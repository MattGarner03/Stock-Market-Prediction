===== 2025 Q1  (2025-05-06 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the First Quarter 2025 Financial Results Conference Call and Webcast for Zoetis. Hosting the call today is Steve Frank, Vice President of Investor Relations for Zoetis. The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, and will not be forwarded automatically. In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call via dial-in or on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for your questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.
Steve Frank: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Zoetis first quarter 2025 earnings call. I am joined today by Kristin Peck, our Chief Executive Officer, and Wetteny Joseph, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website, and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements, and that actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statements in today's press release and our SEC filings, including but not limited to, our annual report on Form 10-K and reports on Form 10-Q. Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or US GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable US GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and the company's 8-K filing dated today, Tuesday, May 6th, 2025. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. With that, I will turn the call over to Kristin.
Kristin Peck: Thank you, Steve, and welcome everyone to our first quarter 2025 earnings call. By staying laser-focused on delivering for our customers, our colleagues drove strong 9% organic operational revenue growth and grew adjusted net income 6% on an organic operational basis. Our International segment led with a 11% organic operational revenue growth, highlighting our global scale and diversification while the US grew 6%, excluding the impact of the MFA divestiture. Growth with balanced across species, our innovative companion animal portfolio grew 9% operationally, fueled by sustained demand for our diverse, market-leading franchises. Livestock grew 7% on an organic operational basis, driven by broad-based double-digit performance internationally. Before we go deeper into the quarter, I want to briefly address what is top of mind for many of you. In today's operating environment, the essential nature of our business remains clear, animals provide companionship and nourishment and in uncertain times people will rely on both. It's precisely because of the enduring secular trends and the fundamentals underpinning our innovation-led operating model. This is what it has consistently proven its resilience even through economic turbulence. That resilience is embedded in how we operate. From our global footprint and diverse durable portfolio across species and geographies, to our omni-channel presence, matrix manufacturing network and talented field force, combined those dynamics ensure for operating from a position of strength as we navigate a fluid environment shaped by macroeconomic, regulatory and geopolitical uncertainty. We are managing these challenges thoughtfully working to minimize their impact, while also seizing opportunities where they exist, so we can continue delivering for our customers, colleagues and shareholders. That means executing our strategy with discipline, supported by a strong balance sheet, operational, excellence thoughtful and strategic capital allocation and experienced leadership team ready to adapt as needed. Most importantly, we continue to prioritize what matters most, living our purpose and ensuring our product reach the people and animals who depend on them. With that context, let's pivot back to the quarter. While our performance reflects the strength of our diverse multi-leverage strategy, I'll touch on a few of the key growth drivers. In companion animal, our combined key franchises grew double-digits operationally, fueled by exceptional performance in our International segment, where our trusted brands, even after several years on the market continued to grow by winning, new patients and improving compliance with significant runway to further define the standard-of-care and deliver meaningful outcomes. In parasiticides, our Simparica franchise continues to expand the overall category and is gaining share, driven by our omni-channel strategy, meeting customers where they are, whether in the clinic through retail, where Simparica Trio is the top selling parasiticide in the US or via home delivery. As you've heard us say, we're seeing increased conversion to broad spectrum triple combinations setting us up for an even longer term growth tailwind. Together, these dynamics positions us well to continue leading through innovation. Most recently, with Simparica Trio’s US label expansion to include flea tapeworm protection. Similarly, key dermatology has consistently been a high growth category built on innovation customer trust and a portfolio that remains the preferred choice for treating allergic itch. Through years of investment and strong partnerships, we have built brand loyalty and established a clear leadership position. We continue to leverage our first mover advantage by capitalizing on the breadth of our portfolio to grow and sustain share in a dynamic environment. We remain focused on what we can control. Execution, innovation and customer experience and we are winning with customers every day. Demand for our portfolio remains strong fueled by the convenience and the unmatched flexibility we provide to vets and pet owners through our three differentiated products. At the same time an estimated 20 million dogs still untreated or untreated for itch. Advances in diagnostics are helping unlock this opportunity, enabling broader access, earlier intervention and better outcomes. That's why we're confident in the enduring strength of this franchise and our ability to continue leading. And similarly, building on our track record of scientific innovation, our osteoarthritis pain, franchise marks a meaningful advancement in care, delivering strong double-digit growth and approximately 25 million doses distributed globally. While adoption has been more gradual, than initially expected, we are encouraged by the foundation we are laying and the long-term potential ahead. We are building and scaling a new category of care, one that require significant education and engagement. While veterinarians and pet owners need time and support to fully understand the safety and empathy profile of newer, more advanced treatments for chronic pain. And in this economic environment, we're seeing pet owners take a more measured approach to managing, chronic conditions, making choices that reflect broader consumer spending trends, which could include adjustments to timing or frequency of care. That said, we see the impact of these therapies every day, they are safe, effective and improving the quality of life for pets and the people who care for them. To accelerate adoption, improve access and grow the OA pain market, we are taking focused, strategic actions. We are expanding medical education for veterinarians and partnering with key opinion leaders to shape best practices. We're investing in and plan to leverage, post launch studies to generate additional real-world insights for vets. We are engaging directly with pet owners to increase education on the burden of OA pain, and the long-term value of treatment and we are launching 360 campaigns, including targeted direct-to-consumer efforts to build awareness and demand. So uptake maybe slower in the near term, our long-term confidence remain strong as we build a durable differentiated market with significant room to grow, especially given the sizeable and underpenetrated opportunity ahead. In Livestock, we delivered strong performance with 7% organic operational growth. Through the sale of our MFA portfolio, we consistently reaffirmed our commitment to livestock and our customers because it makes it what is unique and reliable is the diversity and durability of our business model. Regardless of portfolio mix, one thing is true. People need to eat and global demand for animal proteins will continue to rise. That's why we continue to invest in solutions to protect the health of food-producing animals and safeguard supply chains. Since reporting our results in February, we received conditional licensure from the USDA for avian influenza vaccine for chickens, ensuring we are ready to support customers and regulators wherever the path leads in addressing this evolving threat and it’s during periods of uncertainty that execution matters most. Our experience enables us to rise to the occasion, to stay focused, stay ready and continue delivering solutions where and when they are needed most. As we look to the rest of the year, we’re encouraged by our first quarter performance and the steady demand for our products, along with the resilience we’ve consistently seen across the animal health industry. We are maintaining our full year organic operational revenue guidance range of 6% to 8%, reflecting confidence in the differentiation of our portfolio and our ability to execute in the current environment. While the operating backdrop remains unpredictable, we believe this range appropriately reflects what we know today and we will remain agile in navigating new uncertainties and embracing new opportunities. At the same time, based on our current estimates of enacted tariff-related cost impacts, we are updating our full year organic operational adjusted net income to a range of 5% to 7%. And just to clarify, our outlook does not include any potential impacts from future tariffs as it’s still too early to know how the situation will unfold. And with that, I will close with this. The performance we shared today reflects the dedication of our colleagues around the world, living our purpose, being a trusted solutions provider to our customers and delivering results through their relentless focus. Uncertainty is top of mind for everyone, but it’s not unique to Zoetis. What sets us apart is how we respond. Zoetis has consistently leveraged its innovation-led, customer-first operating model to outperform the market and deliver value for both customers and shareholders. We remain vigilant and agile. We’ll draw on experience navigating complexity, stay clear eyed in our decision-making and continue moving forward with discipline. We are confident in the strength of our portfolio, in the promise of our pipeline, in our ability to adapt, most of all, we’re confident in the commitment of our teams around the world to lead through change and continue delivering for our customers and shareholders, because ultimately, what we do matters for the well-being of animals, people, and communities. That’s why animal health is both essential and resilient, an industry fueled by long-term demand and rising expectations for high-quality care. And as a global leader, we recognize our responsibility to lead today and well into the future. With that, I’ll turn it over to Wetteny to walk us through the more detailed financials. Wetteny?
Wetteny Joseph : Thank you, Kristin. In the first quarter, driven by balanced portfolio growth, we posted $2.2 billion in revenue, growing 1% on a reported basis and 9% on an organic operational basis, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange and the MFA divestiture. Our organic operational growth was driven by 4% price and 5% volume. Adjusted net income of $662 million grew 4% on a reported basis and 6% on an organic operational basis. Our companion animal portfolio led the way with $1.5 billion in revenue, growing 9% operationally. Globally and on an operational basis, our Simparica franchise contributed $367 million, growing 19%, key dermatology posted $387 million, growing 10%, and our OA pain mAbs reported $147 million, growing 15% in the quarter. Our Lifestyle portfolio also contributed organic operational growth of 7% on $645 million in revenue. Now moving on to our Q1 segment results. US revenue grew 2% on a reported basis and 6% on an organic operational basis in the quarter with companion animal growing 8% and livestock declining 2% on an organic operational basis. In companion animal, US growth was driven by our three key franchises, while vaccines faced headwinds from supply timing, coupled with competitor re-entry. Across the portfolio, alternative channel sales continued to outpace the vet channel, offering greater convenience for pet owners, improving compliance and stickiness. Driven by strong growth in auto ship programs that boost compliance and increase the lifetime value of each dog on treatment, our Simparica franchise posted 17% U S growth this quarter on $260 million in revenue. Additional competitive entrants are accelerating the market shift to triple combinations, where we continue to gain share, thanks to the strength of our field force, our first mover advantage and ongoing innovation, including expanded label claims. In key dermatology, sales were $249 million, up 7% with growth across both Apoquel and Cytopoint, while also reflecting the comparison to last year’s initial distribution stocking of Apoquel chewable. Apoquel growth continues to be driven by the retail channel and continued conversion to the chewable, which is easier to administer and promotes daily compliance. Our OA pain mAbs, Librela and Solensia posted a combined $65 million in US sales, growing 14%. Librela grew 17% on $47 million in revenue and Solensia posted $18 million in revenue, growing 7%. To reiterate Kristin’s point, building a new category of care takes time, but we remain confident in the sizable market potential. Our foundation is solid and record penetration confirms that veterinarians want better OA solutions. Organic operational declines of 2% in livestock are primarily driven by declines in jacwin due to aggressive price competition and the timing of price adjustments in the prior year, as well as the timing of supply of Ceftiofur. Moving on to our International segment, revenue was flat on a reported basis and grew 11% on an organic operational basis. Companion animal grew 10% operationally and livestock grew 12% on an organic operational basis. Similar to the US, international companion animal sales were driven by strong performance in our Simparica, key dermatology and OA pain franchises. Our international Simparica franchise, including Simparica and Simparica Trio, grew 23% operationally on $106 million in sales, with both brands driving strong market share gains. Simparica grew 22% operationally on $61 million in sales, driven by expansion of the combination parasiticide market, especially in Latin America and Eastern Europe. Emparica Trio contributed $46 million, growing 26% operationally with strong performance across all regions. Our key dermatology franchise delivered $138 million in revenue, up 15% operationally with double-digit growth in both Apoquel and Cytopoint. Our performance was driven by field force engagement with vets, leading to new patient starts and improved compliance, especially among chronic cases. As Kristin highlighted, we’re executing globally on our key derm strategic priorities. We continue to show strong progress, driven by continued conversion of Apoquel chewable, which now accounts for 57% of doses in Europe. Internationally, our OA pain mAbs were 16% operationally, posting $82 million in combined revenue. International sales of Librela were $65 million growing 14% operationally. Our international efforts have had a significant head start over the US, as we enter our fifth year in some markets. We continue to drive double-digit sales growth and expand both the market and our share. Solensia sales were $18 million, growing 27% operationally in the quarter. Solensia now holds over half of the feline OA market share in international markets, underscoring the strong demand for an OA solution for cats. International livestock grew 12% on an organic operational basis in the quarter. Growth was driven by higher price, including some impacts from high inflationary markets. Volume growth, excluding the impact of MFAs was driven by poultry vaccine growth from key account penetration across Asia, the Middle East and Latin America. Cattle contributed to growth with a return to a more normal environment in Australia, as well as strong demand across much of South America, Canada and Mexico. Our fish business saw good vaccine growth across geographies. Now moving on to the P&L for the quarter. Adjusted gross margin of 72.1% grew 140 basis points on a reported basis. Foreign exchange had a favorable impact of 220 basis points. Excluding FX, we saw lower margins due to higher manufacturing costs, in line with our expectations and included in our initial guidance in February, which should improve as we work through inventory value that prior year standards and unfavorable product mix. This was partially offset by the favorable impact of our MFA divestiture. Adjusted operating expenses increased 3% operationally. Growth was driven primarily by SG&A increases of 4% operationally, mainly due to higher compensation-related expenses and increased direct-to-consumer advertising. R&D declined 2% operationally this quarter due to lower project spend primarily due to timing. Adjusted net income grew 2% operationally and 6% on an organic operational basis. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 4% operationally in the quarter and 8% on an organic operational basis, 2% higher than adjusted net income and reflective of a lower share count as a result of our ongoing share buybacks. Before we get into guidance, I’ll expand on the business impacts of the tariff landscape. While the current situation remains fluid, we are well positioned to navigate this dynamic environment. We’ll be thoughtful and deliberate in our actions with a clear focus on both near and long-term goals. We will leverage the diversity of our revenue across geographies and species to seize opportunities for growth, ensure we work to control expenses, price strategically and manage inventory. People and animals depend on our products and we will continue to deliver for customers. Now moving to guidance for the full year 2025, which reflects continued confidence in our operating model, while acknowledging that there will be some profitability impact in the near term due to enacted tariffs. Please note that guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late April. For the year, we are guiding revenue between $9.425 billion and $9.575 billion with increases due to favorable foreign exchange when compared to the late January rates used in our initial February guidance and maintaining organic operational growth of 6% to 8%. We recognize that there are external factors that are beyond our control. As such, our current guidance does not include any assumed impact of future tariffs, policy changes or further worsening of the macro environment. We continue to expect broad based operational growth across our Simparica, key dermatology and OA pain franchises and reiterate our expectation that these combined innovative franchises will grow double-digits in 2025. We now expect adjusted net income to be in the range of $2.775 billion to $2.825 billion, reflecting operational growth of 5% to 7% on an organic operational basis. Our revised adjusted net income guidance is reflective of the estimated impact of current enacted tariffs, while not accounting for any future changes in the tariff landscape. Lastly, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $6.20 to $6.30 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.85 to $5.95 This EPS increase is primarily due to favorable foreign exchange, compared to the late January rates, as well as the reduction in our share count due to share repurchases in the quarter, slightly offset by enacted tariffs. As we indicated in February, our EPS projections are based on current share counts and do not consider the future favorable impact of our ongoing share repurchase program. As we look forward to the remainder of the year, we recognize there is a degree of uncertainty, but we remain confident in our outlook. In the past, our proven diversified model has delivered steady, predictable and meaningful growth through dynamic environments. We lead into attractive end-markets with strong fundamentals, have a portfolio of market-leading franchises, a sustainable stream of innovation and a proven track record of execution. Now, I’ll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We’ll hear first from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Erin Wright: Great. Thanks. So, first on - I’ll do Librela first and then tariffs. I guess, you speak to what you’re seeing across the US market in terms of the Librela label change, how that’s responding relative to your expectations there? And how do you think the longer-acting OA pain product could potentially replace or enhance sort of the OA pain offering as we head into potentially next year? And then on tariffs, can you describe what exactly is embedded in terms of the growth tariff impact and what mitigation efforts you have? And then and then what does it mean when you say enacted tariffs? I guess, what tariff or jurisdictions are you incorporating or product categories, do you where do you have, I guess, the most exposure, and what sort of is the tariff impact now embedded in guidance? Thanks.
Kristin Peck: Sure. Thanks, Erin. I will take the Librela question. I’ll let Wetteny take the tariff question when I’m done. As we - as Wetteny sort of mentioned in his prepared remarks, we had about 15% organic operating growth in Librela across the globe with – and the US having about 17%. We are continuing to grow the market and vet satisfaction remains strong. Our focus right now is on building and scaling the new category of care and really focusing on continued education and engagement. Now that the label is settled, we’re really focusing on expanding our medical education. We’re investing in a number of post-launch studies as we’ve talked about to generate more real-world data. We’re also bringing in some key opinion leaders from Europe who’ve had the product for over five years to share their experiences in the US as well as investing in targeted DTC. So we continue to have long term confidence. It remains strong. And, you know, we really think Librela is meeting a significant unmet medical need and remain excited. Wetteny, do you want to, cover the tariff question?
Wetteny Joseph : Sure. Look, Erin, our guidance today reflects the net impact of the tariffs that are actually already in place and so that’s net of any mitigations that we’ve already put together, here although the situation remains fluid. To give you a little bit more color in terms of where the exposure is and what we have reflected today, just primarily from imports related to APIs, for a few of our livestock products coming from China. And then, some impact from few of our diagnostics products, as well as certain veterinary accessories. Zooming out, the situation remains fluid, obviously and we continue to monitor as well as are actively planning various scenarios depending on where tariffs land. Keep in mind, we have a broad diversity of geographic footprint and 60% of our manufacturing footprint is actually in the US. So I mean, we export more out of the US than we import into the US and particularly, when you think about companion animal, vast majority of our sales are actually produced in the US for those and a good portion of the companion animal sales outside the US are actually produced in the US. And so I think when you think about that, our exposure is really likely more from retaliatory tariffs from other jurisdictions. So most of our exports go to Europe as well as our imports are actually coming from Europe. So you think about that in the context. And, course, we continue to monitor those. Given our supply chain as broad as it is, that gives us lots of mitigation opportunities. So we until we know exactly where tariffs land, we won’t know exactly how much we’ll mitigate, but we do feel confident that our footprint allows us quite a bit of flexibility to do that. Those will range in terms of time frame where they can be executed, from immediate where it may be moving our inventories all the way to longer term in terms of what does that mean in terms of our footprint. So, lots of opportunities for us as we look at that, but given our diversity from a geography product, et cetera, standpoint, we feel we are as well positioned to navigate this as anyone else.
Operator: We’ll hear next from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Michael Ryskin: Great. Thanks for taking the question guys. I’ll start on the competitive side of things. I think, Wetteny and Kristin, you guys both called out competitive entrants a little bit more in your prepared remarks. Obviously, you’ve had NexGard Plus in the market for a while now and also Credelio, Quattro and Zenrelia. Just if you could dive into a little bit more of like where are you seeing the most competitive pressure? How is it taking shape? Is it more in terms of price? Anything you are seeing in terms of pre-stocking, pre-selling? There’s a derm competitor expected later this year, as well. So just sort of what have you seen so far? What are you factoring into your guide from the competitive side of things in those categories? And then a follow-up on Librela, on Erin’s question there. I just want to - now that you’ve had the label change and some of the learnings from the last couple of months, is your assumption for fiscal year ’25 Librela any different than it was before? Do you think you’ll be able to offset some of these as you go through the year? Just wondering if your thoughts on the ramp for this year are any different than they might have been three months ago? Thanks.
Kristin Peck: Okay, great. I’ll start on the competitive side and then let Wetteny build off of it. I mean, I think what’s really important to note in both dermatology and parasiticides is we were the first mover and I think that’s really important because especially if you look at parasiticides, being the first mover made a big difference. Really, we’ve just been growing our share over time as we talked about. We obviously had one of the biggest competitors enter over a year ago and we’re printing 19% growth overall for the quarter in in Trio. So I think that’s incredibly strong. I think what we’re really seeing is that, there’s still 40% growth in a combined flea chick heartworm space and the more people that enter, the more people get switched into combo therapies from single therapies or topicals or collars. So, we continue to see that regardless of who is entering. We have an excellent product. It’s continued to compete really well in the market. We’re really proud of the execution on this in the US and around the globe. So, we’ve seen competition. We’re obviously going to continue to see more competition. I think what’s also something to focus on is that right now, we have a 40% share in puppies. And obviously, once one dog goes on a product, it’s, rare that it’ll switch. So I think that’s a really good indication of where that’s going in the future. As we talked about, we are expecting potentially a new competitor in dermatology. What you can get into the specifics, that’s baked in. But again, I’d say, you know, if you look at dermatology, we have three excellent products that have been in the market for a long time that are accepted that that have an over 90% satisfaction rate with those products and we are the first mover. So I’ll let Wetteny talk about what that means in guidance, et cetera, and then if you want to follow-up anything else on the Librela if you want, Wetteny.
Wetteny Joseph : Sure. If you look across our three key franchises and I think this will cross over both your first question on competitive entrants as well as, your question on Librela and I’ll double click on that a little bit, Mike. So first of all, our large three key franchises, we expect to grow double-digits, in 2025. They delivered 14% in the first quarter and remain double-digits in our guidance. I think if you look at these areas, including those that already have competition or where we expected we expect more entrants to come in. The bigger picture is the opportunity that remains I think in every area, you have large markets even at the current sizes. In derm, we still have $20 million that are undertreated or untreated. And clearly, with double-digit growth, in that category, a decade plus later, we’re accessing, those expansion opportunities and we have more to go, particularly when you think about international. If you look at Librela, again, our key franchises are double-digit expectations for the year. We haven’t given specific guidance consistently with the first guidance in February on a particular product. But I think I would share this. We had a very strong launch to this product in terms of penetration in clinics in the US, et cetera. If you look at that, that’s a strong foundation for us and really you look at the feedback from vet, they remain very strong in terms of satisfaction. And so, with twenty 27 million medicalized dogs in the US alone with OA and only 9 million being treated, 8 million lives on NSAIDs and 1 million on Librela, I don’t think I need to spell out just how vast the opportunity is and we’re still early. And clearly, as the adoption curve is lower than we expected, as we said in the prepared commentary, we are doubling down on efforts to drive education and awareness, et cetera. The industry has seen this before with other products. We’ve seen this before and we’re confident in terms of the long-term opportunity here and our position in it as a first mover and the impact it’s making on dogs across the world. So we’ll continue to drive those.
Kristin Peck: And the other thing I’d say is, we’re really seeing this as a huge market opportunity of the future. We’ve talked for a while that we think the overall market opportunity for us in a way is between $2 billion and $3 billion and we’re investing, as you know in a long-acting, o a monoclonal antibody that as we mentioned earlier in the year, we are expecting approval for this year. This would be a long-acting three month injection. It was a new and different antibody than Librela with the unique binding site and we’re expecting the dosing range to be about 10 times lower than Librela. So, obviously, we have a lot of confidence in continuing to grow this market and the potential for this market given all the things that Wetteny said and we’ll continue to invest in life cycle innovation behind Librela, as well.
Operator: We’ll hear next from Jon Block with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Jon Block: Great. Thanks, guys. Good morning. Hope you can hear me okay. Maybe just building on a couple of the prior questions, Wetteny just pretty straightforward, but can you just maybe help us and bridge us to the $0.20 increase to the 2025 EPS guidance, because just, obviously back of the envelope. But even with the advantageous move in FX, the lower interest expense, and the lower shares, I’m actually having a hard time getting to $0.20 and that’s arguably before any tariff headwind. I don’t know if you can give us like, a gross, or, net tariff impact on that side of the equation. And then, Kristin, I guess, just a little bit more on Librela. Pretty direct question, do we assume or should we assume flat US Librela revenue for the next two to three quarters until the long-acting is out there? I think the targets here in ‘25, give or take. Is there anything called in the near-term to reaccelerate the US Librela revenues before the long-acting? And then I know you just gave some helpful information on the long-acting. Is that going to carry, call it, a different brand versus Librela? Thanks guys.
Wetteny Joseph : Yeah. Sure. Look, John, I’ll take the bridge to the EPS raise, in dollars for you. If you go back to our initial guidance in February, which used rates, from late January versus where rates are as of late April. We are seeing initially what we, guided to was about a $200 million headwind related to FX on a reported basis and that was really reflective of the dollar that strengthened, particularly in the second half of 2024. If you look at where rates are at the April, largely driven two-thirds of this change is driven by the euro, the pound sterling and the yen, you are looking at most of that, not all of it, nearly all of it actually, being reversed with the weakening dollar. So that is largely, if not entirely, what’s driving the EPS change that you see from us driven by FX and I would tie this also with trade policy and tariffs and so on. So we talk a lot about the impact that has on the organic operational, but it does have somewhat of the opposite effect in terms of what is going to the dollar and demand for that. So I do want to make sure that that is at least looked at and recognized. And so, the impact you see is here. Now in terms of tariffs, net of mitigations, we’re calling about $20 million of headwind that we’re putting here and keep in mind, in February, we said we did not reflect tariffs and we would do so as we know more. And based on what’s enacted, we have that reflected here today, but for that, our organic operational growth in adjusted net income would be the same as it was in February. Again, I’ll give you a little bit more color in terms of what that impact is and I gave you some more in terms of where how we’re positioned as we continue to monitor the situation and where we have mitigation opportunities, as we look ahead. Hopefully, that helped in terms of the FX. I do think what you’re going to see is it’s flat - near flat for the year now with headwinds in the first half and tailwinds in the second half based on where rates are. Again, we don’t forecast the rates. We’re simply using the spot rates as of late April and assume they stay where they are, which we know they won’t. This would be the impact. And so that is consistently how we have reflected on FX.
Kristin Peck: So I’ll follow-up with your question with regards to Librela. I mean, as you know, we obviously don’t give quarterly guidance. But as I mentioned earlier, we are obviously investing to continue to grow and scale this product throughout the year. We’re doing all the things we mentioned obviously, the medical education, the DTC, we’re obviously investing in many post-launch studies to generate real-world data. You saw a few of those come out right now. We provided our pharmacovigilance data to Frontier’s journal, which indicated that all individual events are both rare and very rare. We also did a Librela meloxicam, which had 17 AEs for meloxicam and four for Librela. We’re continuing to invest in additional real-world studies to support the brand. So we are investing, obviously, to grow this brand. We are not waiting for growth until we get a long-acting monoclonal antibody. And I think you also said it will obviously have a different brand. It is a unique antibody and so obviously, therefore cannot share the brand of Librela given its unique molecule. So that would not have the same branding. But look, we can - I just want to reiterate, this is a $2 billion to $3 billion market. We are only $1 million right now on the product. There’s $9 million treated in the United States. But I’d argue, by the way, there’s 27,000,000 dogs with OA. So beyond even what’s treated today, there’s an untreated, market as well, so as you look at this. So we see this as a significant opportunity that we’re going to continue to invest behind.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from David Westenberg with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
David Westenberg : Hi. Thanks. I’m going to actually get away from the Librela questions. So, Amazon is, now selling some of the online drugs probably, I think it’s just singles right now, but maybe get a broad spectrum. Can you talk about any changes in your sales or sales and marketing efforts, both in terms of educating vets or direct-to-consumer strategies? And with Amazon, do you see an acceleration of trends through the alternative channel? Or do you think this is just maybe more market share taking and it would just see the same exact acceleration or the same exact trends we’ve seen? And then, just a really quick one on the FDA and particularly the CMB. Can you tell whether or not there is any potential backlogs or delays in the FDA? I know that the actual reviewers, there hasn’t been any cuts in order to that. But I mean, I think there would be some maybe in some of the support staff that might have like maybe a downstream effect. Thank you.
Kristin Peck: Sure. I’ll start with your second question first. Yes, we are obviously monitoring any changes to both FDA and USDA closely. There are obviously work cuts, already at FDA, but we have not seen any slowdowns on any of our pipeline products as we talked about. We have a very robust pipeline. We work very closely with the FDA. And look, we’re working very closely with the administration, with Congress and with the regulators to help shape that evolving environment. We’re looking for opportunities to support their efforts on efficiencies, while supporting innovation. We think there is lots of opportunities to speed innovation and I’ve spent a lot of time in DC working with them. We really think that innovation is critical as you think about the food supply chain, as well as public health, as well as really bringing unmet products to market. So, it’s a real focus of ours here. We have not seen any slowdown in any of our pipeline products currently at the FDA or the USDA, but we are spending a lot of time there making sure we continue to shape this environment. The second question was on retail growth. I’ll start there and see what Wetteny has got to build on it. First, I’d underscore that retail in the quarter grew 40%. That was, you know, obviously, there’s a little bit there on some one-time stocking, so Wetteny can get into that. But right now, retail is 21% of our US business and this has been growing every year. So I mean, I think Amazon just one more. But Wetteny, do you want to get into some of the specifics there?
Wetteny Joseph : Yeah, I’d be happy to. I think to your point, if you look at retail and when we talk about alternative channels, we have both retail and home delivery, which we’re seeing traction there, as well. If you look at our retail in the quarter about 40% growth. Some of that as we talked about, in February, we saw a little bit of inventory decrease at the end of December through the holiday season. Some of that picked back up in January. So a little bit crossing over there but overall, the trend line continues in terms of the strength that we’ve seen there. When I zoom out and I think we talk a lot about diversification in this company, right? We talk about product categories, geographies, species, et cetera. I do think alternative channels also presents another level of diversification. We’re certainly positioned well to meet the consumer wherever their channel of choice is and that includes in the clinic and when products move from the clinic to these alternative channels, we’re positioned to capitalize on those, as well. So I think any move by any party, whether that’s Amazon or anyone else, is going to continue to give more choices to the consumer and our products are available to them to really drive that. And I think from an economics perspective we talked about on this call before, they are neutral to positive versus the overall. So, this is another area that we’re well positioned to continue to capitalize on in terms of where our products are.
Kristin Peck: And I think that we’ll also continue to grow the compliance for most of our key products. And we’ve got significant percentage of our sales currently for both Apoquel and Simparica Trio over 40% of both in the retail channel. So, I think, Amazon is just one more entrant there.
Operator: We’ll hear next from Brandon Vazquez with William Blair. Please go ahead.
Brandon Vazquez: Hey everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Kristin, you made a comment about, on the Librela side that maybe consumer sentiment or consumer spending was weighing a little bit maybe on compliance. Can you just talk a little bit about what you guys are seeing through April given kind of consumer sentiments rolling over a little bit, not just in Librela, but just the broader portfolio, are you seeing meaningful changes in compliance across the board or not and just kind of the feeling as we’re going through the second quarter. And then one quick model follow-up question. Wetteny, can you just talk about what price and mix - price and volume expectations are for the rest of the year, as well? Thanks.
Kristin Peck: Sure. Yeah, I think what we talked about in, our prepared remarks is obviously adoption has been more gradual as you look at sort of the OA pain market. And honestly, some of the more expensive chronic medications right now than we probably initially expected. But look, we’re really encouraged by the foundation that we’re building. We are starting to see in small pockets a more measured approach to managing chronic conditions. I think consumers are making choices that reflect sort of broader consumer trends. But I think what’s great about our portfolio is how broad it is across so many different categories. So, if maybe the most expensive, we also you can look at it in Apoquel, if you’re looking at the derm space. And we’re continuing to see incredibly strong growth right now in wellness. So, as we always say, we see the animal health industry as incredibly durable and recession resistant obviously, we’re not recession proof. And I think what really sets Zoetis apart in this is that, we’re more resilient than the industry given the innovation that we bring to market. We have really disruptive products that meet unmet medical needs and if you look at a growing global population, whether that’s on the food side or in the companion animal side, I think, Zoetis has always weathered these better than others and we believe we’ll continue to do so. Wetteny, do you want to take the second question?
Wetteny Joseph : Sure. Look, up price and volume mix is consistent with how we saw them coming into the year and I’ll remind you of a few points here. In 2024, we saw strong volume growth, particularly across our key franchises even as we saw price elevated the last couple of years to the tune of 5% to 6%. We came into this year saying we expect price to be above our historical 2% to 3%, but below those levels from the last couple of years and you saw that play out in the first quarter. Our volume growth out of the 9% organic operational growth was 5% volume and 4% price. I would say the direction of travel for the rest of the year would be consistent in terms of that mix. And one last note is last year we saw higher contributions from our hyperinflationary markets, particularly when you think about livestock in international, where we’re seeing much less of that though we’re seeing some in the first half in the first quarter here much less of that this year versus what we saw last year.
Operator: We’ll turn now to Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Chris Schott: Great. Thanks so much for the questions. Maybe just starting off on derm. Can you just remind us of your latest expectations for Merck’s entrance into the market? What’s kind of reflected in guidance on that? And maybe bigger picture on Apoquel, what percent of the market is chewable at this point and how important is that, I guess, in terms of kind of protecting the franchise competitively? My second question, obviously, a very solid start to the year. I know you don’t give quarterly guidance, but just anything notable we should be watching in terms of quarterly gating as we think about the rest of the year from here? Thanks so much.
Wetteny Joseph : Sure. I’ll take I’ll take this and see if, Kristin wants to add to it. So when you look at our guidance today, consistent with February, we put a number of scenarios around the timing of competitive entrants, as well as any short-term, promotional activities that they might have. This does not take away from our long-term view in terms of the opportunity to continue to expand these markets and our confidence that we will continue to drive growth in those, particularly given our first mover advantage. So I want to make sure that is really well understood that our consideration is more short-term implications around promotions and not long-term confidence that we continue to have in those. On Apoquel, particularly, in terms of chewable conversion, if you look at the US, we exited the first quarter around 31% in the aggregate, a little bit higher in the vet clinics and so forth. If you look at International, we’re seeing about 50% conversion across international, but in Europe, it’s actually about 57%. So we’ll continue to see that climb, in terms of our position and last thing I’ll say is coming into a year ago with the launch of chew, we would have anticipated, as we said before, a higher conversion of chew, but I think it’s the stickiness ofApoquel, particularly when you think about the satisfaction levels among vets and pet owners, ownership, et cetera, that is actually driving the conversion rate to be lower than we would have said and I think that’s a good signal for us as we prepare for competition and then of course, longer term in terms of expanding the market.
Operator: We’ll go now to Navann Ty with BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.
Navann Ty: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. One on Librela. Do you expect to pivot back to accessing the moderate population in the US at some point? And a follow-up on the FDA, could you expect the FDA headcount reduction to impact your competitors’ time line in derms? And finally, can you discuss the new FINTEP-one indication for Simparica Trio versus Elanco’s Credelio and Quattro? Thank you.
Kristin Peck: Sure. I’ll start with your last one. Yes, we did get approval for the, prevention of flea tapeworm. As we said before, this is we didn’t see that as critically important, obviously, we’ve mentioned this previously. This is just a nice incremental. It certainly, makes it very little differentiation between us and others. But we as we said before, we don’t see this as a major driver. We didn’t think it was a major issue before. With regards to your question on Librela and the shift to moderate patients, that’s obviously a key part of our focus right now and is consistent with all the different levers that we’re really focused on right now on making sure we expand medical education, bringing in the international KOLs, et cetera is moving into that. And your last question was on the FDA and the impacts on either competitors or long-acting. As I said, we have not experienced any delays at the FDA. We would think others would share the same view at this point. I obviously can’t speak for them. So we’re not expecting any issues with the FDA at the moment based on what we know today to be slowing down ours or anyone else’s pipeline.
Operator: We’ll go next to Steve Scala with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, good morning. This is Chris on for Steve. Thanks for taking our question. We have two just on tariffs. First, it seems like the Trump Administration is pursuing pharmaceutical tariffs under a Section 232 National Security Claim. Based on your interactions with Washington on animal health products viewed as critical to US national security, and what’s the likelihood that US pet products could be excluded, from broader sector tariffs? Thank you.
Kristin Peck: Sure. Our team here and me personally spent a lot of time in DC on the issue of the 232 sec toral tariffs on pharmaceuticals. What we’ve advocated for and have had a great audience for is, what they’re trying to solve is not the problem that we see in animal health and certainly not Zoetis’ problem. I actually said, if you want to be the poster child, I think Zoetis is it’s. 60% of our total manufacturing is in The United States. 75% of what we sell in the United States, we make in the United States and we are a net exporter. So in the sense of the desire for security and pharmaceuticals in the United States, I don’t really think that animal health or Zoetis is a challenge. We’ve shared this point of view with a number of people. I think it’s too early to tell, which is why we were quite clear, in the guidance that this obviously only included currently enacted tariffs. I would definitely not want to presume where they will ultimately cut out on it, but I think we have a very strong argument and we’ve been spending a lot of time making sure they understand the differences between animal health and human health and where our manufacturing is. Importantly, we’ve made the case of where our intellectual property is, which is also in the United States and where the vast majority of our R&D dollars are, which are also in the United States. So, I think we’ve had a good audience, but I wouldn’t presume to, predict what the administration will do here.
Operator: We’ll turn now to Daniel Clark with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.
Daniel Clark : Great. Thank you. Just another question on Librela. When you think about how the launches progress versus your initial expectations, is it really on the patient start side or on the months on therapy side that you’ve seen like, a bigger divergence from where you thought performance was going to be? That’s my question. Thank you.
Wetteny Joseph : So, look, I think if you look at the performance of Librela, first of all, just to see just how much interest there is in terms of vet looking for solutions for pain, you saw 86% penetration across clinics. And we continue to see very strong satisfaction levels for vets who are using the product. So I think that really is a great foundation for us. We’ve seen a transition into more moderate cases and patient starts and expansion of the market with those that were previously not treated by NSAIDs in Europe and that continues to be our focus in the US through education of veterinarians and pet owners in terms of the long-term impacts of OA pain over time, which I think are important to note and will continue to drive those. So, as we said, the uptick hasn’t been as fast on the ramp as we like, but I think the foundation is strong and certainly, undoubtedly, the size of the opportunity remains very vast.
Operator: As there are no further questions at this time, I’d like to turn the floor back over to management for any additional or closing comments.
Kristin Peck : Thank you. As always, I want to thank everyone for joining today for your questions and importantly for your continued interest in Zoetis. Just to summarize, we have the industry’s most diverse and durable portfolio. And animal health is essential and both the industry and Zoetis have proven to be resilient across many different economic cycles and all different types of market conditions and that’s why we continue to see steady sustainable demand for our products across species and geographies. And as we look ahead, we remain focused on executing our strategy with discipline, while staying agile and responsive to the dynamic world around us. We strongly believe that with our innovation, our global reach and our dedicated teams, we are confident in our ability to continue to lead this industry forward. So thanks. Thanks everyone for joining us and have a great day.
Operator: Thank you. Once again ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today’s Zoetis event. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time and have a wonderful rest of your day.

===== 2024 Q4  (2025-02-13 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Financial Results Conference Call and Webcast for Zoetis. Hosting the call today is Steve Frank, Vice President of Investor Relations for Zoetis. The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, and will not be forwarded automatically. In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call via dial-in or on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for your questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.
Steve Frank: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Zoetis fourth quarter and full year 2024 earnings call. I am joined today by Kristin Peck, our Chief Executive Officer, and Wetteny Joseph, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website, and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements, and that actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statements in today's press release and our SEC filings, including but not limited to, our annual report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q. Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures which were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or US GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable US GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and the company's 8-K filing dated today, Thursday, February 13th, 2024. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. With that, I will turn the call over to Kristin.
Kristin Peck: Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. And welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2024 earnings call. Today, thanks to the dedication of our purpose-driven colleagues, we reported an excellent full year result in line with the high end of our November guidance. We delivered double-digit operational revenue growth of 11%, highlighting the strength of our strategy and the enduring demand of our brand. And our relentless focus on execution drove broad-based growth across the business. In the US, revenue grew 11%, while internationally, we grew 10% operationally, marking significant revenue milestones even in a competitive landscape. Our ability to grow, defend, and launch products across markets, drove 14% operational revenue growth in our companion animal portfolio alongside solid 5% operational revenue growth for our livestock portfolio. Reflecting our commitment to shareholders, adjusted net income through 15% operationally. As we look ahead to 2025, we are confident that the drivers of our 2024 success are sustainable, positioning us for continued above-market growth in the mid to high single-digit range for this year and beyond. Our confidence is rooted in the diversity of our business model where multiple growth drivers powered by scientific innovation and commercial excellence work together to create and expand markets. This combination ensures that our market leading franchises deliver long, and in some cases decades long growth tailwinds with significant room for further expansion. While Wetteny will discuss the quarter, I want to highlight some of the drivers that will carry us into 2025. Our global Simparica franchise grew 28% operationally on the year, even amidst competition. This success is fueled by the ongoing shift for triple combination treatments, a market that has grown over 40% in the past 12 months. Currently valued at $2 billion, the global triple combination market pioneered and led by Simparica Trio in the US is projected to more than double to $4.5 billion by 2028. Over 50% of puppies in the US are now on triple combination, a clear signal of the market's trajectory. And veterinarians and pet owners tend to stay with trusted, proven solutions, underscoring the importance of our three-year first-mover advantage in triples. This dynamic, combined with the strength of our diverse portfolio and robust channel strategy, driving higher compliance and increasing total value for patients, positions us to continue leading in this critical segment. Our osteoarthritis or OA pain franchises, including Librela and Solensia, grew revenue 80% operationally in 2024. Librela's US launch is the most successful in our history, cementing its blockbuster status in less than four quarters, and has quickly become the fourth largest product in our US pet care portfolio. As Wetteny mentioned at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in January, true disruptive scientific innovation often follows a nonlinear growth trajectory due to the investment, education, and market development required to establish entirely new categories of care. Even so, innovations like Librela are revolutionizing the treatment paradigm, offering new hope for pets and their owners. With nearly 25 million doses distributed globally, we have already helped millions of dogs regain mobility and improve their quality of life. Just as Librela is transforming care for dogs, Solensia is doing the same for cats. Now, a blockbuster product, Solensia has redefined OA pain management, driving a meaningful increase in feline veterinary visits. By encouraging proactive care, Solensia is bridging longstanding gaps in medicalization and strengthening the relationship between cat owners and their veterinarians. This momentum underscores a significant opportunity to drive sustainable growth in the underpenetrated feline segment and demand for future therapies and long-acting formulations. In our key dermatology franchise, we grew revenue 17% operationally for the year. As we shared at JPMorgan, even with over 25 million dogs treated by our differentiated portfolio to curb itch, the total addressable market is projected to grow to $2.5 billion by 2028, an 11% CAGR. That's because there are still 20 million dogs worldwide who remain untreated or undertreated. With a long runway for growth ahead, a diverse, safe, and effective portfolio, supported by strong customer satisfaction, brand loyalty, and future long-acting formulation, positions us to lead and expand the market. And at the heart of our success is our commitment to living our purpose each day, to nurture the world and humankind by advancing care for animals. That means as customer preferences evolve, ensuring our treatments are available where and when they are needed, while always championing the essential role of veterinarians. This commitment has shaped our omni-channel strategy, meeting customers where they are, whether at the clinic or through alternative channels. As a result, Simparica Trio and Apoquel are the top selling products in US retail, contributing meaningfully higher compliance. When combining retail and home delivery, approximately 20% of our US pet care portfolio flows through alternative channels, driving growth and expanding the total market. We expect this trend to continue into 2025. At the same time, we continue to educate veterinarians and pet owners on the benefits and availability of our treatments, helping to drive informed decisions and better health outcomes. For the year, our livestock portfolio delivered strong 5% operational revenue growth, exceeding our initial expectations of being at the high end of the historical 2% to 4% annual industry growth range. We achieved this result despite the Q4 divestiture of the medicated feed additive product portfolio and certain water-soluble products and related assets. The divestiture was a strategic move to streamline our portfolio, enhance operational focus, and prioritize high growth, high value areas that align with our long-term strategy. And we remain deeply committed to livestock and to continue to lead with innovative vaccines and lifecycle solutions, including antibiotic alternatives and advanced therapies that enhance disease prevention and support sustainability aligned with our core capabilities. As a result of the MFA divestiture, our press release and slides highlight organic operational revenue growth for the full year and fourth quarter, excluding all divested products and adjusted for foreign exchange. Based on this and building on the momentum from 2024, we are guiding to a range of 6% to 8% organic operational revenue growth in 2025 and will continue to provide updates on this metric throughout the year. We also expect organic operational growth in adjusted net income in the range of 6% to 8% in 2025. Excluding the impact of interest and taxes, we expect bottom-line growth of 8% to 10%, reflecting the strength of our business fundamentals and the robust secular trends driving our industry. Our strong underlying performance and financial discipline ensure we remain well positioned to deliver on our value proposition. This guidance underscores the strength of our portfolio and commercial engine as we continue to grow our key franchises. The industry remains essential and resilient, driven by strong underlying demand and the indispensable nature of our work. As we look ahead, we will continue balancing strategic investments in innovation and commercial excellence to sustain our track record of profitable growth and generate long-term value for our shareholders. In 2025, our success will be anchored in the same key drivers that have propelled us over the past decade. We operate in highly attractive end markets driven by scientific innovation and market-leading franchises. With our global scale, we can launch therapy across geographies and channels, ensuring veterinarians and pet owners have access to the best treatments available. And while the operating environment evolves every year with new entrants, shifting geopolitical dynamics, and an evolving regulatory and trade landscape, our agility positions us to navigate these challenges and capitalize on emerging opportunities. Our success is driven by the strength of our strategy, differentiated execution, innovative pipeline, our colleagues, and culture. This is evident in our R&D engine where we expect at least one major approval annually over the next several years with multiple potential blockbusters in our pipeline. These innovations will drive durable, diversified growth across both companion animals and livestock, reinforcing our commitment to addressing unmet needs. Above all, we remain committed to our track record of value creation and delivering performances that outpace the market, positioning Zoetis as a trusted leader in animal health now and in the future. And finally, a sincere thank you to our colleagues whose dedication makes these results possible. And with that, let me turn it over to Wetteny.
Wetteny Joseph: Thank you, Kristin. To echo your enthusiasm, 2024 was an excellent year. Our full year performance reflects broad-based revenue growth across segments, species, price, and volume. The foundation of our ability to continually outperform the animal health industry comes from the diversity of our portfolio and the channels and markets in which we lead. For the year, we posted revenue of $9.3 billion, growing 8% on a reported basis and 11% operationally, with 6% driven by price and 5% from volume. We raised our revenue guidance throughout the year and ultimately finished above the high end of our initial range. Adjusted net income grew 10% on a reported basis and 15% operationally to $2.7 billion. Global revenue growth was driven by our companion animal portfolio, which grew 14% operationally. Leading the way, our Simparica franchise posted $1.4 billion in revenue on the year, growing 28% operationally. Simparica Trio exceeded $1 billion in revenue globally. Simparica Trio remains the number one selling canine parasiticide in the US and a trusted choice for vets and pet owners. As Kristin mentioned, triple combination treatments are the fastest growing segment in animal health and are less than 40% of prescription treatments, signaling significant room for continued growth. In OA pain, we continue to see increased adoption. Librela and Solensia reported combined revenue of $581 million globally for the year, growing 80% operationally. Over a decade since our first launch, our key dermatology franchise posted operational growth of 17%, generating $1.6 billion in revenue. We remain steadfast in our confidence to grow the franchise in the face of competition, and we delivered strong double-digit growth balanced across both Apoquel and Cytopoint. We expect continued market expansion, driven by higher compliance and new patient growth, as we have highlighted that a significant portion of this market remains untreated or undertreated. Lastly, our livestock portfolio also had a strong year with $2.9 billion in revenue or 5% operational revenue growth driven primarily by price while volume growth faced headwinds from the MFA divestiture. On an organic operational basis, livestock grew 7%. Moving on to segment performance for the year, both the US and international segments saw impressive double-digit revenue growth. The US posted $5.1 billion in revenue, growing 11% on the year, while our international segment reported revenue of $4.1 billion, growing 10% operationally for the full year. US growth was led by our companion animal portfolio, which grew 15%, driven by the performance of our Simparica franchise, our OA pain mAbs and market expansion across our key dermatology franchise. The Simparica franchise reached nearly $1 billion in revenue, growing 26%. Simparica Trio was a primary growth driver with $918 million in sales, growing 30%. With high vet and pet owner satisfaction, Trio is the leading parasiticide product in the US. Our ability to grow our volume double digits, while simultaneously taking price by being more targeted in our promotions highlights our first-mover advantage. Our OA pain mAbs reported $271 million in sales in the US, growing 197%. In its first full year in the market, Librela generated $201 million in sales and reached blockbuster status in the US market faster than any product in our history, where it is already the first-line choice for severe OA cases. With nearly 40% of dogs suffering from OA at some point in their lifetime, we are confident that Librela will be a contributor to growth for years to come. Solensia posted $70 million in US revenue for the year, growing 58%. For the year, Solensia accounted for over 70% of clinic revenue in the feline OA category and has continued to substantially grow the market since launch. Key dermatology had an exceptional year, posting growth of 16% on $1.1 billion in sales. As we highlighted, there is a substantial population of untreated or undertreated dogs with derm conditions. Our double-digit volume growth in key dermatology demonstrates our ability to convert those patients to our differentiated portfolio of treatment options and highlights the continued expansion opportunity in the derm space. US livestock business declined 1% on the year due to the MFA divestiture, which closed on October 31. Excluding the impact of MFAs, our organic operational US livestock growth was 6%, which was driven by improved supply of ceftiofur. Moving on to our international segment. Revenue grew 5% on a reported basis and 10% operationally for the year. International performance was favorably impacted by price increases, especially in high inflationary markets, including Argentina, which contributed more than 1.5% to our total company growth for the year. Our international companion animal growth was driven by our Simparica, key dermatology and OA pain mAbs franchises. Our Simparica franchise grew 32% operationally to $357 million in international sales. Performance was driven by Simparica, growing 29% operationally to $212 million in sales, driven by performance in Latin America and Eastern Europe. Simparica Trio grew 39% operationally on $145 million in sales, driven by key account growth in Europe, DTC and the positive impact of our Q1 China launch. Key dermatology posted revenues of $551 million for the year, growing 18% operationally. Performance was driven by Apoquel through new patient growth, especially in Europe. Cytopoint also contributed with new patient growth and compliance in existing patients. Internationally, our OA pain mAbs grew 34% operationally, posting $310 million in combined revenue. Sales of Librela were $246 million internationally, growing 33% operationally. Solensia sales were $64 million, growing 39% on an operational basis. Our international livestock portfolio grew 8% operationally to $1.9 billion in sales for the year, with growth driven by price as well as strong performance in fish, partially offset by headwinds from swine volumes in China. Moving on to our Q4 results. In the fourth quarter, we posted $2.3 billion in revenue, growing 5% on a reported basis and 6% operationally, with 5% driven by price and 1% from volume. Excluding the impact of our MFA divestiture, our Q4 organic operational growth was 9%, with 4% coming from volume. Adjusted net income of $632 million grew 11% on a reported basis and 9% operationally. Revenue in the quarter was driven by our innovative companion animal portfolio. Globally, our Simparica franchise contributed $324 million, growing 21% operationally. Our key dermatology franchise posted $417 million or 11% operational growth and our OA pain mAbs contributed revenue of $150 million, growing 20% operationally in the quarter. Our livestock portfolio also contributed operational growth of 1%, with $726 million in revenue. Livestock organic operational growth in the quarter was 8%. Our global companion animal diagnostics business grew 10% operationally in the quarter on revenues of $96 million. Now, let's move on to our segment results for the quarter. US revenue grew 4% in the quarter, with companion animal growing 7% and livestock declining 8% due to our MFA divestiture. On an organic operational basis, excluding the MFA impact, US revenue grew 8% in the quarter with 12% livestock growth. In companion animal, US performance was driven by growth in our Simparica, key dermatology and OA pain franchises. Pet owners continue to seek the higher standard of care offered by our innovative products, and vet clinic revenue remains healthy, growing 7% on an average spend per visit basis despite declining visits overall. Our mAbs are driving higher therapeutic visits. Our Simparica franchise posted US growth of 17% with $240 million in revenue for the fourth quarter, led by Simparica Trio. As Kristin highlighted, we expect the triple combination parasiticide market to more than double by 2028, and higher triple combo share amongst puppies is a key indicator of where the market is going. Our key dermatology franchise grew 7% in the quarter, generating $270 million in revenue despite clinic stocking headwind from the Apoquel Chewable launch last year. Derm visits were 4% in the quarter, highlighting the willingness of pet owners to treat itch. Cytopoint was the largest driver of growth, driven by preference for injectable treatments. Apoquel growth continues to be driven by expansion of Apoquel Chewable, benefiting from increased conversion and compliance driven by alternative channels. Our OA pain mAbs, Librela and Solensia posted a combined $71 million in US sales in Q4, growing 22%. Our growth in the quarter is reflective of headwinds from initial clinic stocking in Q4 of 2023. Librela, now entering its second year in the market, generated $53 million, growing 21% on the quarter and reaching more than 1.2 million patients. We remain confident that the market opportunity is significant. Pain-related vet visits increased 15% in the fourth quarter, highlighting the demand that has propelled Librela to the fourth largest product in our US business and the most successful launch in animal health history. Organic operational growth in US livestock of 12% was primarily driven by the timing of supply of ceftiofur and volume growth in Draxxin. Moving on to our international segment for the quarter. Revenue grew 6% on a reported basis and 10% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Companion animal grew 13% operationally and livestock grew 6% operationally. The MFA divestiture did not have a material impact on our international organic operational growth. Our international companion animal portfolio growth was driven by our key dermatology products, our Simparica franchise and our OA pain mAbs. Our key dermatology products grew 19% operationally with sales of $147 million in the quarter. Growth in key dermatology was driven by new patients and increased share for both Apoquel and Cytopoint, driven by field force execution and brand marketing campaigns. Preference for chewables continues to increase with conversion to Apoquel Chewable in Europe now at 50%. We saw 32% operational growth in our Simparica franchise internationally with revenue of $84 million on the quarter. Simparica was the main growth driver, growing 33% operationally on $53 million in revenues. Simparica Trio grew 30% operationally with $31 million in revenues. Internationally, our OA pain mAbs grew 18% operationally, posting $79 million in combined revenue. Librela posted sales of $62 million in the quarter, growing 15% operationally. We see continuous growth in prescribing rates and penetration and reorder rates remain high. Solensia growth of 28% operationally on $17 million of sales is driven by increases in both returning and new OA patients. International livestock reported sales of $477 million in the fourth quarter, growing 6% operationally. Growth came primarily from price in hyperinflationary markets and in cattle. Moving down the P&L. Full year adjusted gross margins of 70.7%, grew 50 basis points on a reported basis. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact of 40 basis points. Excluding FX, we saw higher margins due to price and favorable mix, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs. Adjusted operating expenses increased 10% operationally for the year. Growth was driven primarily by SG&A increases of 9% operationally, largely due to higher compensation-related expenses due in part to company performance. Full year G&A growth is inclusive of our Q4 growth of 11% operationally, reflective of the acceleration of certain demand-generating activities into Q4 of 2024. R&D spend grew 12% operationally for the year on higher compensation-related expenses due to company performance and increases in project spend related to internal portfolio advancement. Adjusted net income grew faster than revenue at 15% operationally. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 17% operationally for the year. We remain committed to reinvesting in the business while returning capital to shareholders. In 2024, we repurchased $1.9 billion of Zoetis shares, the most in our history. We also reaffirmed our commitment to buying back shares in August when our Board approved a new multiyear $6 billion share repurchase program. Additionally, we increased our dividend rate 15% during the year, while distributing $786 million back to shareholders. In total, we returned over $2.6 billion to shareholders in 2024, an increase of over $800 million versus the prior year. Now, moving on to our guidance for the full year 2025. The strengthening US dollar throughout 2024 has been a headwind to our reported revenue and adjusted net income projections. As a reminder, we do not forecast foreign exchange and our guidance reflects rates as of late January. Our 2025 guidance reflects foreign exchange headwinds of approximately $250 million to revenue and $50 million to adjusted net income versus 2024. For 2025, we are projecting revenue between $9.225 billion and $9.375 billion, representing an organic operational growth range of 6% to 8%, with growth across both price and value. We expect our performance to be driven by our companion animal business with broad-based growth across our Simparica, key dermatology and OA pain franchises. We are projecting these combined innovative franchises to grow double digits in 2025. Our growth estimates include a range of assumptions for new market entrants and conditions across our business. As a reminder, our guidance does not include products that have not yet been approved. Additionally, guidance does not account for the impact of recent and potential policy changes, including tariffs, tax reform or other regulatory changes. For livestock, 2024 growth was favorably impacted by tailwinds from price, particularly in high inflationary markets, including Argentina. Those impacts normalized as the year progressed, and we do not expect similar tailwinds for 2025. Additionally, our reported growth for livestock will be negatively impacted by our MFA divestiture. We will continue to provide organic operational comparisons throughout the year to normalize for this impact. We expect our organic operational livestock growth to be in line with the livestock industry growth for the year. Now, moving on to the rest of the P&L. Adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue is expected to be approximately 28%. Our expected margin improvement is driven by favorable product mix, aided by our MFA divestiture. This improvement is partially offset by foreign exchange impacts within our supply chain. Adjusted SG&A expenses for the year are expected to be between $2.3 billion and $2.35 billion. This change is reflective of the normalization of compensation increases tied to 2024 performance as well as the acceleration of certain demand-generating activities into Q4 of the prior year. Adjusted R&D expenses for 2025 is expected to be between $680 million and $690 million. We are coming off a multiyear cycle of R&D investment at a pace greater than revenue growth, with the output of those investments reflected in the portfolio progress we disclosed at the JPMorgan conference last month. Adjusted interest expense and other income deductions is expected to be approximately $200 million. Our adjusted effective tax rate for 2025 is expected to be approximately 21%. Adjusted net income is expected to be in the range of $2.7 billion to $2.75 billion, representing growth of 2% to 4% on an operational basis and 6% to 8% on an organic operational basis. Our growth at adjusted net income is impacted by net interest headwinds due to lowering rates on invested cash versus prior years. Additionally, while our adjusted effective tax rate guidance for 2025 is within our historical range, it is at the higher end of the range due to higher taxes on foreign earnings. Our organic operational adjusted net income growth is expected to be 6% to 8%. If we further exclude the impact of interest and taxes, our bottom-line growth is expected to be between 8% and 10%. Lastly, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $6 to $6.10 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.70 to $5.80. Our EPS projections are based on current share count and do not consider the future impact of our ongoing share repurchase program. In closing, 2024 success was built upon the strength of our broad portfolio and our purpose-driven colleagues. Our success across key brands, geographies and channels is the foundation which gives us confidence in our ability to sustain above-market growth this year and into the future. Now, I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Michael Ryskin: Great. Thanks for taking the question, guys. I've got two related ones. I'll sneak them in together. So first, Wetteny in your prepared remarks, you sort of said you have a range of assumptions for new market entrants and market conditions in the guide. I want to dive into that. There's a lot of competition in the market this year that you already have one on the market for derm. There's a second major Apoquel competitor expected this summer. So explicitly, could you sort of walk us through what you're factoring into the guide? Whether it's in terms of color for growth for those products? You kind of gave some broad comments on growth expectations, but also just sort of incremental headwinds from competition and how that could play out? And then tied to that, I guess, are you taking on any incremental investments to support your major brands, derm, combo parasiticides, in terms of go-to-market strategy, commercial efforts, maybe in terms of bundling products together, alternative channels? Just sort of how are you adjusting that in the face of some of that growing competition? Thank you.
Wetteny Joseph: Thank you, Mike. Happy to take the question on competition. Look, first of all, we have delivered an outstanding 2024 with 11% growth operationally at revenue of 15% adjusted income. If you look across our key major franchises, we delivered double-digit growth across all three of those major franchises in derm. And we're -- in the context of derm, more than a decade in, we're delivering 17% operational growth. Actually, as we usually do with our guidance as we start the year, we take into consideration a number of factors. We have multiple sources of growth. And while we're not providing individual product guidance, what we're saying is these three major franchise areas, we expect to drive double-digit growth for us in 2025, and we see the underlying trends that drove our performance in 2024, carry us into 2025 with momentum. Now, in terms of competition, we are factoring in various scenarios in terms of what competition might look like. In the case of derm, we expect those -- that to be in the second half of the year, again, not providing individual guidance on derm specifically, but certainly, long term, we expect to continue to drive substantial growth in these categories. If you look at derm, for example, we're estimating 20 million dogs globally that are not treated or undertreated. We're treating about 12 million today with Apoquel and Cytopoint, there's still 7 million that are on other therapies like steroids, for example, another 13 that are not getting a prescription choice. So clearly, the opportunity that remains here is actually pretty vast and that gives us a lot of confidence in terms of our long-term growth. In terms of investments, look, I think you've seen us do this quite well. At the same time, we are leveraging other investments we made in our field force, et cetera, to drive operational leverage through the P&L. In the case of putting support behind our key brands, whether it's DTC, whether it's education of veterinarians, et cetera, that's something we have demonstrated an ability to do, and they have great returns for us when we do that. We have significant measurements that shows that. And those are areas that we are factoring into our guidance from a spend standpoint.
Operator: Thank you. We'll turn our next question from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Erin Wright: Great. Thanks. I want to dig a little bit more into Librela. Just can you speak to how vets are responding following the vet letter and label change? Like, has that helped them in terms of understanding kind of how to prescribe? And you mentioned it's not linear, but how do we think about US Librela contributions in terms of what's embedded in the guide for 2025? And just to confirm, the long-acting and other pipeline products are not embedded in your guidance for this year? And then just the last one, just on the margin improvement year-to-year in 2025, can you talk a little bit about what's driving that in terms of the mix shift with the MFA divestiture or anything else to call out? Thanks.
Kristin Peck: Thanks, Erin. I'll take Librela questions and let Wetteny take the margin question. A quick answer, no. No new products are included. The long actings are not included in the guidance, as I think Wetteny managed -- mentioned. Look, we're really pleased with the launch of Librela, with $581 million in sales across Librela and Solensia and 80% growth on the year. We're really pleased. It is the most successful launch in history, as we've mentioned. It's also now the fourth largest product for Zoetis with 25 million doses. 40% of dogs suffer from OA. And what we really see as we look forward is continued growth in this category. We did get the Dear Vet letter, which helped best understand what the update in adverse events were using real-world data. And we obviously showed you the label that we implemented based on that. And I think that really underscores our commitment for transparency, which we've been doing all along with regards to the adverse events. I would highlight that there were no contraindications, no warnings and no precautions in that label, but we're really pleased to be able to share that with veterinarians, consistent with our purpose and consistent with our commitment. And I think veterinarians have found that quite helpful. That label, as we had mentioned to you many times, is -- we expected it to be consistent with our label in international, where we continue to be driving growth, as you saw throughout 2024. So the US label looks largely like a label in Europe or Canada, and we really look forward to continuing to grow this franchise. Wetteny, do you want to take the second question on margin?
Wetteny Joseph: Sure. Before I get to the margin, maybe just one more point I'll make on Librela. You asked about how we factored that into our guidance. Clearly, we combined the three major franchise areas, and we're calling double-digit growth across those. As you've seen in Librela, even after three years in the market outside the US and Europe, we delivered 33% growth in Librela in the third year. So we are expecting annual growth to be strong to robust across these franchises, across the OA pain as we go forward, even if we're not giving specific guidance on individual products. On margins, you're right, MFA divestiture is accretive to our gross margins and our bottom-line margins as well. In addition to that, we have mix as we see more of our growth driven by companion animal products that drives favorable mix for us from a margin standpoint as well. And from a price, as we've said consistently, we are expecting to see price be above the 2% to 3% that we've typically done historically, but below the 6% we did this year or nearly 5% we did the prior year. Part of that is lower contribution from some of these hyperinflationary markets that we saw in the prior year is why you see that, but still, we're taking price and therefore, that's contributing to our margins. One of the offsets as we've seen with the US dollar strength over the last number of years is FX. And we do see that being an offset in addition to increased manufacturing costs that we have. But net-net -- and on the FX side, it's about 50 basis points headwind at the gross margin level.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Jon Block with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Jon Block: Thanks, guys. Good morning. Just, Wetteny, any thoughts on the revenue cadence for 2025? Arguably competition will pick up in some key areas. You called it out, but that's more back part of the year. You got arguably an easy comp in the fourth quarter. So curious on the cadence. And then, just for R&D, flat year-over-year, you walked through some of that. Is this sort of a new beginning for you guys where this can be considered a more leverageable, call it, line item going forward? Thanks.
Wetteny Joseph: Yeah. So, look, Jon, first, on the revenue cadence, as I mentioned, the most important aspect here is we look at the trends that are driving our business and demand across our products and the momentum we had in 2024, we see that entering into 2025. So that gives us a lot of confidence, and that's baked into our guidance here. As I said on the earlier question, we are factoring a number of scenarios around new entrants that may come in, and those are more so in the back half of the year. So that would imply a stronger first versus second half. I wouldn't necessarily call out an easy comp in Q4 from an organic operational perspective, maybe from a reported perspective given the divestiture of MFA. As I said in the prepared commentary, when you factor out the MFA, it's a 9% operational growth -- organic operational growth quarter for us. And then we had the comps from the prior year where we launched both Librela and Apoquel Chew in the fourth quarter of the prior year. When you add that into consideration, the growth rate in the fourth quarter is above 10%. And so I think that's a solid quarter, and I wouldn't call that an easy come necessarily as we look at 2025. In terms of R&D, look, we're very pleased with the progress that we're seeing across the pipeline, and we showcased those with the updates we provided last month at the JPMorgan conference. We tend to let the pipeline drive where the investment is and not necessarily deliberately drive that as a leverageable component. Now we did say two years ago almost at Investor Day, we expected the R&D line to grow above revenue for some time. And then it would sort of move back towards sort of top line revenue growth rate, and we're seeing that. But I think that's more of a factor of where the pipeline is, certainly, as major items go through certain cycles in development, they tend to drive more spend. And then as they get on the other side of that, it's not as much. So that will ebb and flow from time to time, but we don't look at that necessarily as a leverageable line item that we're deliberately moving because the long-term delivery of our innovation drives where we drive investments there.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Brandon Vazquez with William Blair. Please go ahead.
Russell Yuen: Hi, this is Russell Yuen on for Brandon Vazquez. Thanks for taking the question. So, looking at a high level, are you guys able to give us any sense as we go into 2025 on how the entire pet population is kind of trending? Now that we're past COVID years, are we back to normal growth rates and growing year-over-year? Or if not, is there anything we kind of need to keep in mind for the backdrop to get a normalized growth rate? I know we sometimes hear about a lagging effect from weak macro, where pets are not replaced as they die. So, kind of just curious on what you're seeing? Thanks.
Kristin Peck: Sure. What we continue to see is the strength of the human-animal bond and that relationship. If you look back to historical numbers, normally, there's not significant changes in the number of pets. The only one exception, obviously, in the last 12 years was COVID. But we're expecting the pet population to remain relatively stable. That's what it's done historically. I think what's really changed and what's driving the fundamental growth of the industry is the fact that the human animal bond makes animal health essential and very resilient. 86% of pet owners would spend whatever it takes. And those incremental pets that were adopted during COVID are aging. And as they age, they're going to get more diseases of -- chronic diseases, et cetera. So we see very strong fundamental drivers with more millennials and Gen Z adopting pets, their relationship with those pets. They're delaying having kids, if they're having kids, and those pets are important parts of their family's life. And they're making sure that those pets are taken care of. So we see very strong growth drivers based on the human animal bond based who's adopting those pets as well as an aging pet population. So we think those are fundamental drivers that Zoetis’ innovation and commercial excellence will only emphasize more.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Balaji Prasad with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Balaji Prasad: Hi, good morning. A couple of questions for me. Firstly, Wetteny, you clarified that none of the expected approvals within the next 12 months have been factored into the guidance. Curious to understand, maybe excluding FX, what are the upside risk to guidance that you can see from here? And on the same line of the three buckets of approvals on drivers, as you can describe that for -- is there any way to quantify the approval though in the second bucket in the 12 to 36 months, what the TAM for these approvals are and what are the investments into this? Thanks.
Wetteny Joseph: Sure. Look, in terms of confirming that we have not factored in new approvals, and that's consistent with how we have approached guidance historically. So those are not in here. We did highlight how much FX headwind we see at the top line, roughly $250 million, given where spot rates are. And as a reminder, we do not forecast FX. So the quantification we're providing is strictly off of the current spot rates versus what the average rates were through 2024. In terms of upside, look, I think we have a very diverse portfolio and our diversity stems across geography, across our products, et cetera. You saw us deliver across our three major franchises in companion animal, all three had double-digit growth, and double-digit growth in terms of volumes as well. So I think the underlying trends here are strong as we enter into 2025, we could not be more pleased. Of course, the factors that we put in, in terms of where competitive entrants might come in could be a factor that might move us in any direction in terms of the timing of those and what some of the short-term sort of dynamics might be around those. And those are the things that might move us one way or the other, which is why we provide a range in our guidance. But we're very, very excited about how we're entering the year and the demand profile that we're seeing across our products and the opportunities we have before us.
Kristin Peck: I can pick up the second question on the TAM for the new product categories. I mean I wanted to start with, we have more drivers of growth to improve the standard of care than any other company. And we -- as we talked about in our pipeline, we have multiple blockbusters. And at JPMorgan, we discussed what the totable addressable market for some of these new therapies would be. To your point, in the 12 to 36 months window, we have chronic kidney disease products. And as we mentioned, that's a $3 billion to $4 billion market. We also mentioned oncology, and that's a $1.2 billion to $1.7 billion market. And then in the longer term, we were also talking about cardiology. I also just want to double click for a second on the long-acting portfolio because I really think these are going to be significant growth drivers. There's a lot of people who can make it in every month. So, it will both increase compliance, which will grow the market as well as meet a lot of pet owners who just, the monthly too much for them, and they would be much more convenient to come in four times a year versus 12 times a year. So, we really think as we look at potential approvals, approval every year for the next several years and really more drivers of growth for the short, medium and long term for the company, we remain really excited about the potential unmet needs that we can address.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Chris Schott: Great. Thanks so much for the questions. Just two for me. First on Librela. Is there any updates in terms of how you're seeing veterinarians approach patient selection as you think about severe patients versus moderate? Is it still skewed more towards severe? Are you starting to make progress on the moderate side? And the second question was on Simparica Trio, obviously, very healthy growth in 2024. Just any pushes and pulls we should think about for that product specifically in '25? Thank you.
Kristin Peck: Sure. With regards to Librela, we continue to see, in Europe, more of our patients be mild to moderate. And that trend has continued in the US, the beginning part of the launch, we were seeing more severe. They are moving more into moderate again, you get to know the product better. So that will be a key focus of the growth in the US as we move more into the moderate patients. We continue to do blind studies with veterinarians, and they continue to be very satisfied with the product, and they continue to intend to prescribe. And I think the more we do and get those into moderate patients, we will see continued growth there. With regards to assumptions in Trio, we had a phenomenal across the Simparica franchise year. Trio is now exceeding $1 billion. It is the number one seller in the US. And it's been on the market for years. Even with significant competition, we saw about a 28% growth. I think what's important to really remind people is there's still significant growth in this category today. We've got 50% of puppies, which means 50% of puppies are still not on a triple combination. We think that will continue to grow the market. We think also, as you have more and more people on auto ship, once you start a parasiticide, you're very unlikely to switch. So, this is a very sticky category. So even as we see new competition, we continue to believe just as we did when we [Technical Difficulty] and we could continue to grow this market and grow our share. And I think we continue to demonstrate our ability to do that.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Glen Santangelo with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Glen Santangelo: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Hey, Wetteny, I just wanted to follow up on some of the comments you made with respect to the organic growth. If you look at the sort of pricing expectation you're building into your assumption this year, I think you said it would be better than your 2% to 3% normalized expectation. So, with sort of half of the operational growth coming from pricing, it seems like you're assuming some modest slowdown on the volume side, and just sort of given that you expect significant double-digit growth in your three major franchises, I guess maybe talk about if either you or Kristin can talk about maybe some of the other areas of the portfolio where you may be seeing some levels of deceleration in volume and maybe that's just some level of conservatism you're building into your guidance? Thanks.
Wetteny Joseph: Sure. Happy to do that. As I said, our pricing expectations for 2025 are a bit north of our historical 2% to 3%, but below the 6% we planted in 2024 and roughly 4.5% to 5% the prior two years. So that is certainly a consideration. One other thing I will remind you is we saw livestock growth in 2024 at roughly 5%. And if you take the MFA divestiture out, it's actually 6% on 2024, we are calling 2% to 4%, which is what the industry growth rate is from a livestock standpoint. Again, I will repeat this point, which is really, really important. The underlying trends that we see driving demand for our products are entering into 2025. And so that gives us a lot of confidence in what we're going to see, which is a double-digit volume growth across these major franchises in 2024. We are factoring a certain competition in there. And so depending on how you look at the range, the 6% to 8%, if taking what I'm saying on price, at the lower end of the range, yes, you would have slightly more price than volume. At the higher end of the range, you would actually have a balance between price and volume, which is what you saw from us excluding hyperinflationary markets in 2024. So that feels about the same is what we're seeing in 2025, depending on where you fall in the range that we're providing on guidance.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Navann Ty with BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.
Navann Ty: Hi, good morning. I have two questions, please. The first one on Librela, if you -- can you discuss any expected impact of the US label changes, if any, on the transition to the moderate population in the US? And then my second question is on innovation. If you can comment on the blockbuster potential of the expected approvals that you have listed? Thank you.
Kristin Peck: Sure. We were very pleased to implement the new label. We think it helps vets understand the latest data on real-world adverse events. We've continued to be incredibly transparent throughout with regards to what we were seeing in other markets, and we shared that data. So we really see this as just helping vets better understand. It's consistent with what we have been sharing with them all along. So we don't really think it changes the trajectory much. We think what we're seeing in the US is more moderate patients and continuing to grow that market. And as I mentioned before, the surveys we're doing with vets, they are satisfied with the product, and they continue to have an intent to prescribe. What we're really seeing is just the impact it's making on improving the quality of life for so many pets. So, we really see continued growth overall in that. And with your second question on the multiple blockbusters, we're really seeing, as we talked about the total addressable market for some of these new unmet needs being very significant. The one I'd really focus on the largest is obviously chronic kidney disease. That's both for dogs and for cats, and there really are no treatment today. And we expanded the size of the total addressable market from our Investor Day. And that was really about better understanding the molecules that we have today and really how they're going to meet that unmet medical need. But also importantly, increases and improvements in diagnostics to be able to better diagnose animals to make sure that we're getting the right patient population aligned with the potential of the product. So, we're very excited as we look at chronic kidney disease, oncology as well as cardiology to really meet new unmet medical needs that the market has really been looking at. And as I mentioned before, we have more drivers of growth for the short, medium and long term to improve the standard of care.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Steve Scala with TD Securities. Please go ahead.
Chris LoBianco: Thank you. This is Chris LoBianco on for Steve Scala. We just had a question on the pipeline -- risk-adjusted, the pipeline opportunities with renal and oncology, have these assets generated pivotal data yet? And does Zoetis have multiple shots on goal, i.e., multiple late-stage assets for each of these opportunities? And could these products be placed at a premium compared to Zoetis' current [indiscernible] pain products? Thank you.
Kristin Peck: Sure. We don't give specific information with regard to our modules in animal health. So the guidance that we provided with regards to product launching is the guidance that we've got.
Operator: Thank you. We'll go next to Andrea Alfonso with UBS. Please go ahead.
Andrea Alfonso: Yes. Hi, good morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. I specifically wanted to ask about the dermatology franchise and how you're thinking about your positioning in 2025 from a pricing versus mix standpoint in light of competitive entries? And have you had to amplify some of your education and awareness efforts around efficacy relatively? And then I guess finally, what's sort of your view on kind of the mix shift between Cytopoint and Apoquel? Thank you so much.
Kristin Peck: Sure. We are very excited for the performance of dermatology in 2024 with 17% growth with a $1.64 billion portfolio. Importantly, even with competition in Q4, we had 11% revenue growth. And we really are seeing growth in this market overall. I think Wetteny mentioned in his remarks before, we're seeing this market grow 11%. We think by 2028, it will grow to $2.5 billion. And there are 20 million dogs that still remain untreated or undertreated that we can still focus on. So we see growth here in a few areas. First, higher compliance, getting more animals on autoship. Obviously, looking at long-acting portfolio coming as well, we see that as potentially improving compliance and really going after the undertreated dogs today as well as the untreated dog. So we see significant continued growth here for the overall market, even with competition. What we continue to see in other franchises and in other categories is with new competition, you have new awareness and we continue to grow the category overall.
Wetteny Joseph: Yeah. I will just add, from a pricing standpoint, we don't provide product-specific pricing considerations, but I would remind you, in 2024 we saw 17% operational growth and double-digit volume growth despite robust price here. So we do believe there's opportunity given the remaining untreated pets in this space and opportunity to continue to grow. In terms of the balance, look, we see strong demand for both products. If you look at Cytopoint and Apoquel, Cytopoint in the clinic is preferred, both from a compliance standpoint and having the volume through the clinic. Apoquel, in alternative channels, when you combine both retail and home delivery, that total is about 40% of our Apoquel volume, and you're seeing that convenience factor, the compliance that that drives drive significant growth as well. So in '24, we actually saw a balanced growth between the two, which is very, very encouraging as we go into 2025.
Operator: Thank you. We'll go next to Daniel Clark with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.
Daniel Clark: Great. Thank you. Just wanted to drill down a little bit on the figure that 50% of puppies are on a triple combo parasiticide. What are the different pushes and pulls that you think could maybe drive that number higher? And how are you thinking about that for 2025?
Kristin Peck: Sure. Again, we think awareness and growth. If you look at it right now, the triple combination therapy still is less than 40% overall, and it's growing at 40%. So we think that you'll continue to see the more you add new puppies, the more they're on. And once they go on, they're very unlikely to go off. So, we really are excited to see this growth. And what we continue to see is new entrants enter, it only brings more attention to triple combinations, which is the fastest growing segment of parasiticides overall. And the triple market today is $2 billion. And we're expecting, as we mentioned before, to grow to $4.5 billion by 2028. So, we just see the natural growth here. And as someone who was [first to here] (ph), we've had four years and the additional three years on the market ahead of anybody else, we see really that lead making a big difference in continuing to grow our share and to grow the market overall.
Operator: And there are no further questions at this time. I'll turn it to Kristin for closing remarks.
Kristin Peck: Okay. Great. As always, thank you, everyone, for your questions, and importantly, for your continued interest in Zoetis. As you heard today, we are extremely pleased with our excellent performance in 2024 and eager to really build on this momentum as we move into 2025. We remain confident in the steady demand for our diverse and our innovative portfolio, which continues to deliver value to our customers and to advance animal health globally. And we're driven by our purpose to advance care for animals, and we remain focused on executing our strategy and filling confidence in our stakeholders and reinforcing our unwavering commitment to our value proposition. We look forward to keeping you updated on our progress as the year progresses. Thanks, everybody.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-11-04 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results Conference Call and Webcast for Zoetis. Hosting the call today is Steve Frank, Vice President of Investor Relations for Zoetis. The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, and will not be forwarded automatically.

[Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.
Steve Frank: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Zoetis third quarter 2024 earnings call. I am joined today by Kristin Peck, our Chief Executive Officer; and Wetteny Joseph, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statements in today's press release and our SEC filings, including, but not limited to, our annual report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q. Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and the company's 8-K filing dated today, Monday, November 4, 2024. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. And with that, I will turn the call over to Kristin.
Kristin Peck: Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our 2024 third quarter earnings call. Let me start by thanking our dedicated purpose-driven colleagues who helped us deliver another excellent quarter. Building on the strong momentum from the first half of the year, revenue grew 14% operationally and adjusted net income is up 15% operationally. We saw balanced double-digit growth across the business. Driven by steady demand for our key franchises, U.S. grew 15% and international revenue grew 13% operationally. Our innovative companion animal portfolio grew 15% operationally, while livestock grew 11% on an operational basis. Our consistent growth is fueled by a diverse, durable, and science-driven portfolio, carefully crafted through a deep understanding of our customers' evolving needs. By maintaining a strong focus on innovation, we set the standard for improving patient outcomes, higher customer satisfaction, and strong partnerships with veterinarians and pet owners. Our osteoarthritis pain franchise, Librela and Solensia, continues to make a transformative impact by addressing a critical unmet need, delivering 97% operational revenue growth globally. From our conversations with customers around the world, it's clear that our safe effective solutions are making a meaningful difference in patients' lives. We recognize the profound impact of our work, which only strengthens our commitment to developing this market. We have navigated this path before and understand that building a new category of care requires a steady strategic approach. As we lap the U.S. Librela launch, we continue to grow share, even in a market where canine pain visits typically slow down from Q2 to Q3. In fact, Librela is actively disrupting this trend by driving more clinic visits and increasing engagement. With $55 million in U.S. quarterly sales, we see significant opportunity to further expand share and utilization. In just 11 months, we have treated 1 million dogs, compared to an estimated 8 million receiving other treatments, and Librela have already become the fourth largest product in U.S. pet care. This highlights the demand and long-term growth potential, reinforcing our confidence in the franchise's $1 billion trajectory. With record market penetration in the U.S., we're only scratching the surface of broader utilization potential. We estimate that an additional 17 million dogs are suffering from untreated OA. That's because before Librela, NSAIDs were the only option for vets, which many untreated dogs could not tolerate due to pre-existing conditions. Globally, Librela opportunity is equally significant, with OA pain estimated to affect nearly 40% of dogs. And importantly, in the U.S., we see a similar non-linear growth curve to Europe, where revenue grew 18% operationally year-over-year, in year four of launch. Given our results there, we are poised to create and expand this market domestically. Drawing on that experience is key to positioning Librela as the preferred pain treatment by highlighting its safe, effective, and convenient choice for vets. We will leverage our strong partnerships and continue collaborating with veterinarians to expand treatment adoption, shifting away from two decades of reliance on NSAIDs. Results and trends like these reaffirm what we've long understood. The human-animal bond is undeniable. Today's generation of pet owners see their pets as integral members of their family and expects human-quality care. Monoclonal antibodies, increasingly important in human health, are a prime example of how we are bringing that same kind of innovation to animal health with treatments like Librela and Solensia. Our Simparica franchise continues to deliver impressive results as well, growing 27% operationally. While our science-backed innovations have created entirely new categories in animal health, we have also set the standard for competing in established markets. Through close collaboration with customers, we understood that overcoming first-mover advantage requires two differentiations, and long-term loyalty is earned with products that stand out in both safety and efficacy. The success of our Simparica franchise expanded the total parasiticides market and demonstrated that improving patient outcomes is not zero-sum, especially with significant unmet needs. In 2020, we pioneered the U.S. triple-combination parasite market with Simparica Trio, offering comprehensive protection against fleas, ticks, and heartworms in one monthly chewable. Trio is now the number one vet-prescribed parasiticide, with over 13 million dogs treated in just four years, and 86% of pet owners report high satisfaction. Despite increased competition, Trio prescription rates continue to climb as triple-combination products are gaining share, supported by our field force's scale and excellence in driving customer engagement. And our commitment to making our products accessible through the most convenient channels for pet owners has solidified Trio's retail leadership. Looking ahead to 2025, we anticipate a dynamic landscape, but perceive two key outcomes. First, consistent with historic trends, the overall addressable market will grow. Second, having more options will accelerate education of vets and pet owners. Increasing awareness of the benefits of broad-spectrum protection will drive conversion to triple-combination treatments. With our significant head start, proven efficacy, and convenience, along with our trusted relationships, we believe Simparica Trio will remain the preferred choice, even as new products enter the market. Similarly, 16% operational revenue growth across our key dermatology franchise demonstrates how disruptive innovation and strategic lifecycle enhancement drive sustained growth. Over a decade ago, we identified a crucial unmet need in veterinary medicine, a solution for canine dermatological itch that balanced safety and efficacy. Itch impacts the well-being of both pets and their owners. It's heartbreaking to see dogs struggling to find relief from persistent discomfort. We were first to address this challenge. Thanks to our relentless focus on innovation and execution, in just a decade, the market grew from $70 million to over $1.5 billion and growing. But we didn't just enter the market, we built it, cultivated it, and continuously evolved it, creating the industry's first $1 billion franchise. As a result, today, Apoquel is the number one prescribed medication in animal health, and the market and our customers have grown alongside us. And when vets wanted other options, we delivered truly differentiated first-line treatments like Cytopoint, the first monoclonal antibody to treat itch, and Apoquel Chew, a convenient chewable that enhances compliance. These therapies are trusted by veterinarians worldwide, bringing relief to over 23 million dogs globally, and we believe they are the best treatment options. And it's not only our product portfolio that sets us apart, it's our customer-focused approach to development. Vets trust our products for their rigorous safety standards and confidence in dosing regimens that allow for chronic uninterrupted use. Our research-driven approach to JAK inhibition selectively ensured that our treatments can be used safely alongside other medications, including vaccines. With over 20 million dogs globally with untreated or undertreated itch, the derm market growth potential is vast. Our proven performance reflects our commitment to expanding access and providing trusted first-line solutions. Similar to our experience in paras, we expect optionality will grow the overall market, a market where Zoetis has two first-line treatments that are known for being safe, effective and trusted. Even with alternatives, satisfied customers are far less likely to switch, and we continue to deliver the solutions they trust and rely on. Innovation, execution and a relentless focus on customer needs are the cornerstones of our key market-leading franchises. Turning to livestock, we recently closed the sale of our Medicated Feed Additive and certain water-soluble product portfolios to Phibro Animal Health. This transaction is a prime example of Zoetis' disciplined capital allocation strategy, allowing us to focus our investments on areas with the highest-growth potential aligned with our core capabilities. We remain deeply committed to livestock, sharpening our focus on key areas of innovation, including preventatives, antibiotic alternatives and genetics. For example, in September, we announced a strategic partnership with Danone to leverage Zoetis' genetic testing capabilities in promoting sustainable dairy production. This collaboration aims to help dairy producers and Danone's global supply-chain improve animal health and productivity with a focus on animal well-being. This strengthens long-term industry resilience, while also reducing environmental impact. Looking ahead, we anticipate the livestock industry to grow 2% to 4% annually, and we aim to be at the higher end of that range. Innovation will be a key driver of that growth. And to that end, we have updated our guidance to reflect strong performance across our key franchises, along with impact primarily from the MFA divestiture. Wetteny will guide into the details there. With 12% operational revenue growth through the first three quarters, we have outpaced our initial expectations, a testament to our agility in navigating a complex environment. As we look to Q4, we anticipate a return to our previous levels of above-market growth and remain on-track to meet our revised full-year guidance with strong momentum going into 2025. This quarter's results highlight the strength of our diverse, durable portfolio and unwavering commitment to delivering for our customers. Before I close, I want to extend my sincere gratitude to our colleagues. They embody our purpose, support our customers and drive our exceptional performance. Their dedication is what truly makes the difference. With their passion and commitment, we feel positive about our ability to deliver on the four key tenets of our value proposition, to grow revenue faster than the market, to invest in innovation and growth capabilities, to grow adjusted net income faster than revenue, and to return excess capital to shareholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Wetteny.
Wetteny Joseph: Thank you, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. To reiterate, innovation and execution underpinned an excellent third quarter, driven by the strength of our diverse and differentiated portfolio. Another quarter of double-digit operational growth across species and geographies. The remarkable performance of our companion animal portfolio highlights the willingness of pet owners to spend on the health and well-being of their pets and the value of our products to pet owners and veterinary practices. Our livestock growth underscores the essential and growing need for animal protein around the world, and the important role our products play in helping producers keep their herds healthy. Put simply, we provide critical solutions central to animal health. Our success is directly tied to our customers, and our first-to-market innovations continue to fuel the growth and success of their practices. In the third quarter, we posted $2.4 billion in revenue, growing 11% on a reported basis and 14% operationally, with 8% driven by volume and 6% from price. Adjusted net income of $716 million grew 14% on a reported basis and 15% operationally. Revenue growth in the quarter was driven by our innovative companion animal portfolio. Globally, OP pain mAbs contributed $151 million. Our Simparica franchise posted $333 million, and our key dermatology franchise contributed revenue of $449 million. Our lifestyle portfolio also contributed strong growth with $758 million in revenue. Regarding our OP pain mAbs, Librela and Solensia, in Europe, after just 3.5 years on the market, Librela and Solensia are the leading treatments for OA pain and are driving market expansion by broadening treatment options across cases. As Kristin mentioned, many of these patients were previously untreated because they could not tolerate NSAIDs. In Europe and the U.S., Librela expansion into this patient group represents a significant market growth opportunity. In the U.S., the growing importance of mAbs cannot be understated. While overall U.S. clinic visits are down, particularly for prescription-only visits that are moving to alternative channels, therapeutic visits such as those for OA are on the rise. In the U.S., Librela has brought almost 0.5 million new patients to the OA pain category since launch by expanding the market with a new standard-of-care. Our performance within the Simparica franchise highlights our ability to meet the evolving needs of pet owners by delivering safe, effective products to convenient channels such as retail, where Trio is the top-selling pharmaceutical. Parasiticides is the largest, most competitive therapeutic category in animal health, and we have substantially increased our market share by being the first-to-market in the U.S. with a trusted differentiated product. Since the launch of Trio, we have gone from number five in this category to number two with clear triple combination market leadership. And in the first year of competition in U.S. triple combinations, we grew revenue by more than 25% and increased our market share. In the U.S., we estimate almost 60% of medicalized dogs are not on triple combination products. The increased share of voice for new entrants should accelerate the shift to triple combinations, where we have a first-to-market advantage. We continue to win with puppies, where Trio is the preferred choice for these new patients, signaling strong growth potential. Earlier, Kristin highlighted the deliberate balance between safety and efficacy with our key dermatology products. Apoquel delivered on that and quickly became one of the most important products in clinics. We understood our customers wanted more convenient options for derm treatment, and we delivered. We have multiple derm products with unique value propositions for both the vet and the pet owner. All of our products can be used on acute, seasonal and chronic cases and have years of real-world vet and pet owner satisfaction. As we face new competition, we remain confident in our growth trajectory. We have proven experience defending established brands and we are confident that our portfolio of first-line treatments remain among the most important products in vet clinics. Now let's move to segment results. U.S. revenue grew 15% in the quarter with companion animal growing 18% and livestock growing 5%. U.S. companion animal performance was driven by our OA pain mAbs, including the launch of Librela, as well as continued adoption and compliance of Simparica Trio and our key dermatology franchise. We continue to grow above-market, driven by increased therapeutic treatment for OA and dermatology, veterinarian's preference for injectables and evolving pet owner preference for retail convenience and home delivery, which also boosts compliance with oral medications. Our OA pain mAbs, Librela and Solensia, posted a combined $73 million in U.S. sales in Q3. Librela generated $55 million, primarily on increased clinic utilization. Penetration has reached 85%, faster than any product in our history. A crucial first step-in our successful launch was ensuring clinic availability. And again, we are just scratching the surface with OA. Just as we've seen with our key dermatology franchise, addressing unmet needs with revolutionary treatment can deliver long-term growth, and we believe Librela will be a growth tailwind for years ahead. Solensia posted $18 million in revenue, or 50% growth. While the incidence rate for OA in cats is similar to dogs at around 40%, there were very few treatment options for cats prior to Solensia. Since Solensia's launch in the U.S. two years ago, we have seen feline OA patients increase over 70%. With current feline medicalization rates significantly lower than dogs, boosting feline treatment presents a significant untapped opportunity. Simparica Trio posted U.S. growth of 29%, with $237 million in revenue. We previously highlighted Trio's momentum through the first year with competition, and our expectations remain high. As we have seen with previous generations of parasiticides, secondary entrants serve to accelerate conversion from older therapies. But in the absence of meaningful differentiation, they do not erode market share. In addition to robust volume growth for Trio, we continue to see the benefit of price driven by our lower promotional environment, and more thoughtful discounting across our customer base. In U.S. key dermatology, we saw 17% growth, or $303 million, for the quarter. Apoquel was the largest driver with outsized contributions from the retail channel. Apoquel Chewable growth outpaced tablet cannibalization declines, benefiting from increased conversion and compliance. Cytopoint growth continues to be driven by preference for injectables. U.S. livestock grew 5% in the quarter, primarily driven by volume growth in cattle, where we continue to see improved supply of [indiscernible]. This growth was partially offset by Draxxin price declines. Moving on to our International segment. Revenue grew 7% on a reported basis and 13% operationally in the quarter. International livestock grew 15% operationally and companion animal grew 11% operationally. International livestock grew 15% operationally in the quarter with equal contributions from volume and price. Cattle was the largest growth contributor, driven by the impact of price in high inflationary markets, as well as volume growth from higher demand and improved supply. Poultry growth was driven by price and key account penetration. Lastly, fish saw strong volume growth in Norway, driven by high demand for our vaccines, as well as the impact of a soft comparable period last year. International companion animal growth was driven by our Simparica key dermatology and OA pain mAbs franchises. Our international Simparica franchise grew 28% operationally, with $75 million in sales. Performance was driven by Simparica Trio, growing 39% operationally to $31 million in sales, benefiting from key account growth in Europe, DTC and the positive impact of our Q1 China launch. Simparica grew 22% operationally on $44 million in sales, driven primarily by Eastern Europe and Brazil. Our international key dermatology franchise contributed $146 million of revenue and 13% operational growth, with double-digit operational growth in Apoquel and Cytopoint. Growth was driven by Apoquel with strong DTC success, especially in European markets. Europe is also benefiting from strong adoption of Apoquel Chewable, where we now see more than half of doses dispensed coming from the chewable formulation. Our key dermatology franchise continues to expand internationally. Many countries are still in the early stages of derm market development and increases in medicalization as well as the benefits that chewable and injectables can offer, provide a significant run rate for growth. Internationally, our OA pain mAbs grew 27% operationally, posting $78 million in combined revenue. International sales of Librela were $62 million, growing 26% operationally. The growth of Librela was driven by higher use in Europe, as well as market expansion and share gains in second-wave launch markets. We see opportunity for continued market expansion from converting existing NSAID patients and increasing months on therapy. Solensia sales were $16 million, growing 32% on an operational basis. Now moving on to the P&L for the quarter. Adjusted gross margin of 70.7% grew 20 basis points with increases from price and mix, offset by higher manufacturing costs. Adjusted operating expenses increased 9% operationally. Growth was driven primarily by SG&A expenses of 9% operationally, largely due to higher compensation-related expenses due to company performance. R&D grew 10% operationally in the quarter on higher compensation-related expenses due to company performance and increases in project spend related to internal portfolio advancements. Adjusted net income grew faster than revenue at 15% operationally. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 17% operationally for the quarter. Now moving on to guidance for the full year 2024. Our raised revenue guidance reflects continued strong performance of our key franchises, partially offset by a reduction to sales for the divestiture of our Medicated Feed Additive product portfolio and certain water soluble products completed October 31. As Kristin highlighted, we remain committed to livestock and see opportunities in several therapeutic areas, enhanced by our strategic partnerships and focus. Please note that guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of mid-October. For the year, we expect revenue between $9.2 billion and $9.3 billion, a range of 10% to 11% operational growth. This is both an increase and a narrowing of our revenue range versus our prior full year guidance. We now expect adjusted net income to be in the range of $2.67 billion to $2.695 billion, representing operational growth of 13.5% to 14.5%. Finally, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.86 to $5.92 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.33 to $5.39. We have seen outstanding performance in 2024 thus far with broad-based growth from our key innovative products across species and geographies, and we remain very positive on the remainder of the year and beyond. Our guidance, combined with our year-to-date results, does signal some expected deceleration in our revenue growth rate for Q4 specifically. As a reminder, revenue growth in Q4 will be impacted by the MFA divestiture, reflecting a reduction of two months of U.S. sales and one month from our international business out of our results in Q4. Additionally, we also saw the impact of stocking from the launch of both Librela and Apoquel Chewable in Q4 of last year. Normalizing for these items, Q4 will be more in line with our historical growth rate. We remain confident in underlying demand and market dynamics as we move into the fourth quarter and then 2025. Our outlook for next year remains positive. We continue to see favorable trends in our key franchises, including OA, dermatology and Simparica, as well as momentum from alternative channels. While we anticipate the recent tailwinds from higher inflation to normalize, our recent performance has significantly outpaced price-driven gains alone. Additionally, we expect headwinds in China to normalize in Q4 and moving into next year. We estimate these headwinds have had approximately 1 percentage unfavorable impact to our growth this year that should normalize in 2025. We are confident in our continued ability to grow above the animal health market, driven by the strength of our portfolio, pipeline and our dedicated colleagues. Now, I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Thank you. We'll take our first question from Erin Wright of Morgan Stanley.
Erin Wright: Great, thanks for taking my question. A two parter here. So first on Librela, how should we be thinking about the quarterly progression from here in terms of U.S. Librela, and how has the experience been in terms of reorder rates, and the months on therapy relative to your internal expectations? And then, just how we should think about that quarterly progression given the stocking dynamics in the fourth quarter and into 2025. And then as we think about bigger picture here, just several moving pieces into 2025 from a profit perspective, I guess you continue to invest in innovation Librela scales, you have favorable mix also from MFA sale. Like how do you think about the level of investment that you need to make next year, and sort of how much you're going to let sort of the enhanced product mix, more skewed towards that companion animal actually flow through in terms of margin expansion next year as well. So how do you think about those headwinds, and tailwinds I guess into 2025? Thanks.
Kristin Peck: Thanks Erin. I'll start with overall Librela and move to Wetteny on sort of quarterly cadence, and the 2025 question you had. Look, we are really pleased with the performance globally with Librela with 123% growth, really remain committed to being a $1 billion franchise. And as you look at just the quarterly progression to-date, it's been the most successful launch in our company's history. In the U.S., we have an 85% penetration rate. Globally we're averaging over 90%. In the first 12 months, we've already got 1 million patients on the product, and we believe we've got a significant runway for growth. With only 1 million patients on that and 8 million still on NSAIDs. We think there's a really large addressable market. We can focus on higher compliance. So, we're very optimistic on that. I'll let Wetteny get into the quarterly cadence going forward as well as your 2025 question as well.
Wetteny Joseph: Yes, Erin, as Kristin said, Librela has been our most successful launch in the history of the company by every metric that we look at in penetration and also the first 12 months revenue and approximately $192 million. Now as we don't tend to give guidance down to an individual product for an individual quarter. But what I would say in terms of the cadence of Librela, is that we'll continue to see and exiting this year into next year. We expect to see strong growth given our penetration. As Kristin said, about $1 million being treated, compared to NSAIDs that are at about 8 million. And so we know launching these major franchises, standards of care, take time. And one other item that is certainly clear, when you look at the historical visits around OA Pain, as Kristin said in the prepared commentary. We do tend to see a peak in Q2 coming down in Q3, and then typically comes back up a bit in Q4, but not to the level of Q2. So that's another element that I would give you to sort of consider as you think about, what to expect through the end of the year, and going into 2025. Now with respect to your second part of your question around considerations and profitability, et cetera. We continue to demonstrate an ability to grow above the animal health market. We certainly see that in our performance this year, on a year-to-date basis we're at 12%. We just raised guidance again for the third time this year, clearly well above the market, and are growing our just an income faster than our top line, including in this quarter, which as you recall last call. We highlighted the fact that we are increasing some of our investments, as we exit this year. And we still delivered faster adjusted income. And so as we look ahead, this is a core tenet of our value proposition that we'll continue to be mindful of, and we have the opportunity here as we look ahead to leverage investments we've made in the past, including field force investments in the U.S. And we see opportunity to continue to leverage those even as we continue to drive growth and launch products, across the market. We will continue to see some investments in DTC behind our key brands. Again, we're building a market, something we have demonstrated an ability to build the markets, expand them and defend them. If you look at what we're doing across our portfolio, right now. And an important part of that will be DTC and advertising promotion behind these products as we go into next year. We would anticipate again, as I've said before, the business has an inherent ability to grow the bottom line faster than the top. As you see the mix as well as price that we're able to take. How much we deliver in any given year may vary depending on the levels of investments we're making, but we may committed to growing the bottom line faster.
Operator: Our next question is from Michael Ryskin of Bank of America.
Michael Ryskin: Great, thanks for taking the question guys. I want to follow-up on a couple of points you touched on there. First, just in the quarter, thinking about Librela progression year-to-date, I know you had some stocking destocking dynamics earlier in the year. Just making sure for Librela, for Trio, for Derm. Was there anything like that in the third quarter in terms of inventory management with customers, people stocking for year-end or maybe destocking any promotions, anything like that? I just want to make sure we're looking at "clean numbers here" especially with some competing launches going on for some of these things. And then two, I want to touch a little bit on the MFA component. You updated the guide for that divestment for the fourth quarter, as you touched on two months in the U.S. on OUS, how should we think about full year 2025 impact in terms of updating our numbers? I think it's roughly $350 million annual revenues. But any you can say in terms of how much SG&A spent, how much R&D spend falls into that, just so we can start to true up our models for next year? Thanks.
Kristin Peck: Sure. For starters, it was a clean quarter across our entire business in the U.S. and abroad. So there's no stocking dynamics or inventory buildups there. But I'll let Wetteny take the more detailed question on MFAs.
Wetteny Joseph: Yes, sure. Look to Kristin's point, if you look at inventory levels, particularly across distributors in the U.S., which we have visibility into, not as much visibility obviously across clinics individually. But our inventory levels remain closer to the low end of our historical averages, similar to where we were over a year ago in Q1, after the destocking. So I would say that. And then within Librela, keep in mind, this is a whole chain product that, is being shipped direct to clinics and not going through distribution. So it's really a product. And given our penetration levels that we highlighted two quarters ago, there's not incremental penetration to really influence inventory levels here. So I thought I would add that, to the answer you already received. With MFAs, just a reminder of what we have disclosed previously. This is a business last year 2023, full year did about $400 million at about 30% margin. So I think that gives you and by the way, seasonality here is roughly linear across the year. So if you look at the divestiture this year, it's about half of a quarter, with two months of the U.S. and one month of international. You can run the numbers here in terms of what the impact, is exiting this year. And then, what that would be for next year, because we'd have three and a half quarters in the number in 2024 that, we'll be comping against. And I think that should give you. Even though I'm not getting into specifics on SG&A versus R&D, et cetera, I think that gives you an impact on through the P&L.
Operator: Our next question is from Brandon Vazquez of William Blair.
Brandon Vazquez: Hi everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to focus on parasiticides and Simparica Trio. It's been a really strong segment for you guys, especially Trio. Can you talk a little bit about despite more competition in the market, why you guys seem to be taking care. Perhaps it's something on the commercial side, and maybe some of the execution you guys have there. So just any color there, and how much that can continue into 25'. And then the quick follow-up, is just if there's any Wetteny for you, if there's any price mix commentary you could give us on the quarter, especially in the companion animal side? Thank you.
Kristin Peck: Sure. Thanks, Brandon. Look, we're really proud of the performance of Trio. It is the number one prescribed parasiticide. It's already been used in over 13 million dogs. I think that the real focus here for us is Simparica growing 27% globally, is really having a phenomenal product. I think it starts with that. I think we were first to market with Trio, which I think has made a big difference. We've also been able to grow that product tremendously, leveraging alternative channels, which today is about 20% of that. But I think what's really underscoring all this, is that the oral flea tick and hardware market is growing 45% year-over-year. And that growth is moving more people into the oral category. And if you look at puppy share, which I think is a really good indicator of where we're going in the future. Trio has a 35% share in puppies. So I think between being a first mover advantage, having a phenomenal product that's got comprehensive coverage, it's convenient. It's a chewable. I think it's a great product. And look, we've partnered very closely with all of our customers, and certainly with our corporates. And I think you're seeing, the customers are really pleased with the product. So, we see strong momentum going into next year. And I'll underscore some of the comments that Wetteny said in his prepared remarks, which is what we've seen continuously as new entrants enter the market, is the expansion of the oral flea tick and hardware market and that is what we're expecting next year into 2025. So Wetteny, do you want to take the second half of the question?
Wetteny Joseph: Sure. In terms of price mix and volume here? As you heard in prepared commentary, the 14% operational growth in the quarter was 8% volume and 6% price. Now your question, if it's related specifically to our parasiticides in the Trio performance, I would say it's about balance, with slightly more volume than price. Here and keep in mind as we've stated previously, we have more targeted promotions as well as discounts to our customers. Which is actually driving better price realization, and not just price increases if you will here on this product, which again has been a phenomenal execution I would say, and contribution to the growth that you're seeing on Trio specifically.
Operator: Our next question is from Jon Block of Stifel.
Jon Block: Thanks guys. Good morning. First one, are there any different marching orders for the sales force as U.S. Librela now largely moves from call it new practice adoption, to more driving utilization and getting into mild-to-moderate. Maybe the tack on to that would be any specific thoughts about 4Q revenue from U.S. Librela? Did you commit to q-over-q growth, because just wanted to follow-up there. That seems to be the only noise in the quarter quite honestly. And then, the second one would just be, any high level building blocks for 2025 revenue. Wetteny, you mentioned China headwinds of a point this year, I'm guessing for the most part that unwinds you've got Librela, their trajectory obviously some of the other key franchises. So again even at a high level any building blocks, for us to take into consideration? Thanks guys.
Kristin Peck: Sure. I would say there's not any new sales marching orders. I think it's a lot more of continuing to focus on getting clinics, have more experience across not just severe, but moving into moderate, which we started probably a little while ago. That was a key focus even for us at launch. So, we'll continue to focus on growing the brand there, but I think it's really sticking with the key messages of the safety of the product. The efficacy of the product and really, demonstrating continuously the opportunity to look at the 8 million patients currently on NSAIDs and switching those NSAIDs patients over to Librela, assuming that that's the right product for that pet overall. So, we remain very, very pleased with this launch, and given how pleased we are at the launch, I think we're going to continue down the same tactics that we have. Certainly now that we've got the penetration, it's really focusing on expanding the use out of just not just severe, but obviously in moderate as well as really talking about the opportunity, given the different pets medical needs to switch from NSAIDs. So I'll turn the second part of the question over to Wetteny on building blocks for '25.
Wetteny Joseph: Sure Jon. Look, we look forward to sharing our 2025 guidance on our next call in February, and just maybe a few reminders here that might be helpful in terms of directionally where we're headed, right. We have several sources of growth and we continue to see strong underlying demand, across our portfolio in most markets where we operate. Our outlook for derm and for Trio remain very positive, exiting this year and going into next year. We expect to see continued strong growth, across our OA pain franchise on a year-over-year basis. And even if you have more normalized pricing, we would expect those to be above, slightly above our historical pricing contribution of 2% to 3%. And as I covered in the prepared commentary, China will be more normalized as we exit this year starting in Q4, and into the next year. And so, you have less of a headwind going into next year, which was almost a full point in the current year. The last piece I would give is just reminder on the MFA and water soluble product portfolio. Removing those and I shared those numbers already in terms of what - those products did last year. So hopefully that's helpful, in terms of getting you into some sort of ballpark here.
Operator: Our next question is from David Westenberg of Piper Sandler.
David Westenberg: Hi, thank you for taking the question, and congrats on a great quarter. So a little bit touch on macro real quick just in terms of how you price relative to veterinary CPI, is that ever a consideration? And as we go into next year, do you also consider some of the clinic growth assumptions that we've seen? Yes, you are isolated in a lot of ways, because you can buy off channel. However, those initial scripts do need to come on visits, and we've seen visits for the last year being quite down. Now and then just a second on a clarification, Wetteny, I think you said in your prepared remarks reasonable promotion environment, or something along the lines of that. Can you clarify what you mean? If you meant Zoetis and industry wide. And specifically, I'm thinking about some of the promotion environments, beginning of next year, as we enter parasiticide season, you'll have a full season of Quattro. You might be lapping some of the promotions from NexGard Plus, I don't know anything like that. So if I could just get a clarity there? Thank you.
Kristin Peck: Sure. Thanks, David. I'll start with your first one. And Wetteny, if I miss anything, please build on it. As we think about pricing, obviously we start with the pricing environment, and the overall inflation environment in any given market where we compete. But the primary thing that we really focus on, is a product-by-product, SKU-by-SKU view of our differentiation and the marketplace overall. I know you referenced that visits were down. We continue to say visits are not a good proxy for how animal health and more particularly how Zoetis does. Really what you're seeing is some of those wellness visits, and a lot of those are products, pickup products, visits. And a lot of that is going over to the alternative channel, which continues to grow very strongly. But if you look at the visits for our particular products around derm or around pain, they're up. And so, I think we really focus on what is the innovation and what is the value that our product provides, to both the vet and the pet owner. And I think that is what really primarily drives our pricing strategy overall. I'll turn the second question on the pricing - the promotional environment to you, Wetteny.
Wetteny Joseph: Sure. Look, the only thing I would add to the visits, is even as overall visits are down in the U.S. If you look at the key therapeutic areas for us, OA Pain business up double-digits. Derm visits are up even as more and more of our Apoquel products, are being sold through the retail channel. So I think that really spells it and consistent with what we've been sharing for some time now. And then if you look at alternative channels, it has been a significant growth driver for us across the U.S. pet care, which, of course, reduces some of the dependency on clearing visits, as well as the auto-ship and higher compliance that, that drives. Alternative channels were up actually 34% year-on-year on the quarter, again, demonstrating that point. As far as promotional activities, my comment here is you see far more disciplined promotional environment this year, particularly when you compare it to last year, when we were up against a new competitor in the civil combination parasiticide space. So that comment really is to say, there's not as much promotional activity here, and that we are more targeted in terms of our discounting to our customers.
Operator: Our next question is from Balaji Prasad of Barclays.
Balaji Prasad: Hi, good morning and thanks for taking the questions. Two from me, one speaking a bit more about 2025. Could you comment about - comment on the incremental growth drivers and headwinds, especially that you see in 2025. And Wetteny, especially as we think about OpEx, again, I don't want to get into guidance, but if you can just comment on the pushes and pulls towards your OpEx spend in the year. Secondly, with regard to Simparica Trio again, can you comment on what kind of move - in terms of the $57 million - 57 million dogs that you have provided that could move to isoxazolines. What's the pace of conversion that could be achieved on a real estate basis? Thanks.
Kristin Peck: Sure. Wetteny, do you want to take this?
Wetteny Joseph: Sure. The first point in terms of next year, and again, I look forward to providing more specific guidance in February here. Balaji, look, I think as we've said at Investor Day, we see opportunity to leverage our SG&A from an OpEx perspective. We have been running R&D driven by our portfolio, and our pipeline progression faster than revenue. I think you see that coming in closer to revenue this year. We'll get into more detail in that in terms of what we would expect into next year, but that's certainly one consideration. I think when I think about other pushes and pulls, there's been a lot of conversations around Argentina this year. I think one thing to keep in mind is, as we have highlighted, the pricing that we have taken in Argentina this year you get in other hyperinflationary markets for that matter. Again, if you expect a more normalized pricing environment, and we would anticipate slightly above where our historical rate is, that incremental price you see from Argentina this year, which is actually on a declining basis. So Q1 was the peak we've come down in Q2 and in Q3, and we expect Q4 to be closer to 1%. I think that would be an item to consider as we go through next year. But one important point though is if you work down the P&L that, has actually had significant headwinds through inflation, through the middle of the P&L. And then from an FX perspective, if you look at the reported results, the net impact of Argentina year-over-year, is actually negative across the P&L. So I think that's really important points to keep in mind, as you're thinking about SG&A? And then the other point on - as we look at the parasiticide market, and what we expect to happen here, we've seen this before. This is the same that we saw, say, almost a decade ago with the launch of all isoxazolines, you saw really continual transition into those that continue to grow the market substantially. And clearly, when we look at the percentage of puppies that are getting put on a triple combination, which is much higher than the overall percentage of dogs that are on paras. So about a third of the prescription parasiticides are in triple combinations, but over 50% of puppies are. And so that gives you a strong indication, of what's going to continue to happen in that market. The split between how much is going from other orals versus collars and topic is not something we have a specificity on, but needless to say, that is where the market is going is towards those triple combinations.
Kristin Peck: Yes. And Balaji, I would just encourage you to look at our slides from today, because we show you some of the graphs of what that actually looks like. And I think with a double-digit growth the fourth year on the market, I think it speaks for itself as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from Glen Santangelo of Jefferies.
Glen Santangelo: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Kristin, it sounds like the company is confident in its ability to take another year of above-average price increases. And I'm kind of curious like what's sort of given you that confidence, and given the evolving competitive landscape and current macro climate? And then just a sort of part of that, could you give us an update on what percentage of the companion business, is flowing through alternate site versus the vet office, and if that's having any impact on any sort of pricing, or customer trends that we should be aware of? Thanks.
Kristin Peck: Sure. I'll start with your second question. Retail grew 34%. I think it's a little bit over. I mean, Wetteny, you can correct me, around 10% of the U.S. business at this point? What is it a little higher?
Wetteny Joseph: It's closer to 15%. If you look at all alternative channels, that's retail online as well as brick and mortar and home, home delivery as well combined.
Kristin Peck: Yes. No, I think it's growing very strongly in the U.S. I mean, look, as we look at overall pricing, again, I'd go back to where I started before, which is look product-by-product and the innovation we're bringing. And I think what we've really talked about continuously is the diverse, durable and innovative portfolio that Zoetis has across species and globally. And so that's how we price our products. And we've continued, as we've seen competition, for example in parasiticides, been continuously taking price there as well where we see the convenience and the benefits that Simparica Trio offer. So, I don't have anything new to add here. I'm not sure Wetteny, if you do.
Wetteny Joseph: Look, I think if you look at this year, right, we are taking price. If you take Argentina out, it's somewhere in the 4.5% to 5% range across the rest of our portfolio, right? And despite that, you see significant volume growth. This quarter, I think, is a testament to that 8% volume growth and 6% price. And so, if you look at our key product areas, actually derm you see price as well as substantial volume growth. So we think there's room for us to continue that, given the value that we bring with these innovations.
Operator: Our next question is from Chris Schott of JPMorgan.
Chris Schott: Great, thanks. Just two questions from me. Maybe first on Apoquel, can you just elaborate a little bit about how you're thinking about the impact from the Zenrelia launch - and maybe specifically, should we anticipate any slowdown to your growth due to some of their promotion activities, are you expecting relatively limited impact there? And then my second question would be on Librela uptake. Just any comments on how U.S. compliance is trending relative to your expectations? I know it's early, but just anything notable in some of those initial trends? Thank you.
Kristin Peck: Sure. I'll start with Apoquel and then Wetteny, if you want to build on Librela uptake question. Yes, I mean another strong quarter, obviously, from Apoquel had 16% growth across the quarter. I think it's the number one product out there. It's got 11 years of safety, huge satisfaction rates across both consumers and veterinarians, with a 90% satisfaction rate. And I think our focus with the product, is continuing to grow the category. We think there's an opportunity for higher compliance, to address under or untreated dogs, to convert to 3 million dogs or on other treatments and 8 million dogs currently not on therapy. We're very confident in our ability to compete with this product given the satisfaction, given the safety and given the efficacy overall. We're very proud of the performance of this, and we look forward to strong performance obviously going forward in 2025 and beyond. You want to take - the update?
Wetteny Joseph: Yes, sure. Look, I think as we've said before, this is our most successful launch cover in the company's history. And I think while it's a little bit early, to get into a ton of detail around compliance in the U.S. specifically. I always like to look at our international markets, which will continue to see strong double-digit growth across those markets for years out. And when we look at the transition into more moderate cases, which now represent more than 60% of our - of cases in - across Europe, for example, that's driving up much on therapy, to be above seven months. And compliance rates that are exceptionally high in that market. So I think this gives you an indication of where the market is, and given the efficacy and the revolutionary profile of this product, what it can do and what is actually doing across markets outside the U.S., and we're very pleased with where we are in the launch trajectory here in the U.S. as well.
Operator: Our next question is from Steve Scala of TD Cowen.
Chris LoBianco: Hi. This is Chris on for Steve Scala. Congrats on the strong quarter and thanks for taking our questions. We had two first, Zoetis has its best confidence in above-industry average sales growth, what is your level of confidence in being able to maintain this growth long-term based only on current on-market products, without contributions from pipeline of business development? And then second, how many competitive matches are you expecting in 2025? And how is this uncertainty impacting your thoughts on how conservative initial 2025 guidance will be? Thank you.
Wetteny Joseph: Sure. I'll give that a shot. Look, I think if you look at our history over a decade, we have outperformed the market by three points on average. I would argue, if you look at the market growth rates this year, it's even above that. Now your question is how - what's our confidence level and be able to sustain that. We're very confident in our ability to sustain that given our existing portfolio. And bifurcating between existing portfolio and new launches is not something I'm going to venture into, because that is ingrained into how we go to market, and how we continue to invest in solving for our customers' greatest challenges. It's hard for me to give you what the growth rate would be without that. But what I would say is it's really important to note that it's not only when we launch, a brand new innovation in a new area. Is a continued life cycle innovation that we drive, which is almost historically 50% of our R&D spend. So we continue to grow the market and expand the market, adding additional claims as we go along the way, which is how we, over time, build markets. And I know there's a lot of questions around sequential growth, et cetera, it's not really about the sequential growth. It's never really super linear it's over time, building the market that once you build it, it's also very sticky, because you've established the standard and someone else has to come with something that is significantly differentiated in order to overtake you. And that's what drives our business. So, we're very confident in continuing to be able to outperform the industry.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll move next to Navann Ty of BNP Paribas.
Navann Ty: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. One on competition and one on innovation. So on competition, can you expand on, which levers is what is using to defend Apoquel versus Zenrelia? Would that be or is it DTC about the safety, as well as near term pricing or anything else. And for Credelio Quattro, did you plan any promotions around that launch maybe to a lesser extent that when you were facing NexGard Plus. And then on innovation, are you able to discuss progress around the long-acting injectables, monoclonal antibodies and parasiticide and longer term innovation in CKD, oncology and cardiology? Thank you.
Kristin Peck: Sure. With regards to competition, and your first question, I think, was on the derm space, we remain very confident in our ability to continue to grow our overall dermatology franchise, whether that's Apoquel, Apoquel, chewable or Cytopoint even with the new competition. We think again, our 11 years of safety and efficacy competing against a product with a box warning. I think is quite strong. I think our satisfaction, we'll continue to do the same tactics we always did. We don't see any need to change any of those. That's really around building deep relationships with our customers, sharing the performance of the product, investing in direct-to-consumer. We don't really see a need given the competition either with them really or also Credelio Quattro. What we continue to see is Wetteny remarked in his opening statement, is that really when new entrants come, it grows the market overall. They invest more in direct-to-consumer advertising, and you'll see more of a conversion over to the oral isoxazoline class. So we remain very confident. We're not planning on changing any of our promotional tactics, when you think about both the entrant and derm, as well as the additional entrant into the paras. Look, we expect everyone will enter paras, and that will only grow the category overall. As you think about innovation, as we talked about at our Investor Day, we really see long-acting across all of our key franchises, an important driver of growth haven't yet given specific guidance on when those launches will be, but those will be more of the near-term launches, as we mentioned in previous sessions.
Operator: And there are no further questions at this time. I'd be happy to return the call to Kristin Peck for closing comments.
Kristin Peck: Thanks, and thank you all for joining us. As always, we really appreciate your questions and importantly, your interest in Zoetis. The animal health industries is repeatedly proven, it's resilient, and our work remains essential, not only for animals, but for the people and the communities and the economy is impacted globally. So looking ahead, we are excited to strengthen our market leadership by leveraging this resilience, and driving long-term growth and value creation. And with that, I want to thank you for your continued trust, as you move forward with confidence and purpose, committed to shaping the future of animal health. Thanks for joining us.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's call. You may now disconnect, and everyone, have a great day.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-08-06 08:30:00) =====
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Welcome to the Second Quarter 2024 Financial Results Conference Call and Webcast for Zoetis.

[Operator Instructions] It’s now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.
Steve Frank: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone and welcome to the Zoetis Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. I am joined today by Kristin Peck, our Chief Executive Officer; and Wetteny Joseph, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statements in today's press release, and our SEC filings, including but not limited to, our Annual Report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q.

We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Kristin.
Kristin Peck: Thank you, Steve and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our second quarter earnings call for 2024, we had another outstanding quarter, growing revenue 11% operationally and 18% operational growth in adjusted net income. Success was fueled by strong demand for innovative products, our ability to capture and expand markets and the dedication of our purpose driven colleagues. Segment growth was well-balanced with 12% growth in the US and 10% operational revenue growth internationally even against a strong comparative quarter. Our innovative companion animal portfolio grew 12% operationally, while our livestock portfolio saw 9% operational growth across species and geographies. It's been an excellent first half of 2024, growing revenue 12% operationally, highlighting that our leadership stems from both industry-leading innovation and differentiated execution. We remain focused on our core strategy, delivering consistent results for our customers, the animals and their care and our shareholders and our unwavering commitment to excellence, has resulted in the most diverse and comprehensive animal health portfolio. We lead the industry in R&D investment, bringing over 300 science-driven innovations to market, including three of the top five best-selling products in Animal Health, Apoquel, Simparica Trio and Cytopoint. With our global footprint and world-class manufacturing facilities, we ensure consistent quality and on-time delivery. Our early investments in digital transformation, power and exceptional customer experience, while positioning us for future growth. We continuously refine our commercial strategies and for effective launches and market penetration. And our powerful brand recognition, targeted direct-to-consumer campaigns experienced sales reps and medical experts help us capture new market share and win loyalty. Our customers are at the center of everything we do from understanding their challenges to exceeding their expectations. Scientific innovation enables us to meet their demands while creating new markets, our commercial execution allows us to defend and grow that market leadership. The animal health industry has proven essential and resilient in all types of climates, but it is also dynamic and growing, and we are well-positioned to seize the opportunity. Look no further than our revolutionary osteoarthritis pain franchise, Librela for dogs and Solensia for cats. We are developing a market with breakthrough products that are safer and more effective, while offering convenience for veterinarians and pet owners. The results speak for themselves. Globally, Librela grew 142% operationally this quarter, fueled by the successful and ongoing US launch. But again, its innovation coupled with execution. Take Solensia, for example. Despite launching in Europe three years ago, we reported 60% operational growth this quarter. Our break-throughs are driving increased feline clinic visits, which in turn expands the total market. We along with veterinarians and pet owners are excited about how these safe and efficacious products are revolutionizing first-line treatment for chronic pain in dogs and cats of all ages. Given our proven track-record of building and scaling billion-dollar franchises, we remain confident about the OA pain trajectory, but we don't just launch products, we cultivate them for long-term success. Our key dermatology franchise exemplifies this commitment, delivering strong 18% operational growth driven by Apoquel and Apoquel chewable along with Cytopoint. We have transformed the management of atopic dermatitis in dogs, providing safe, effective and convenient solutions with over 23 million dogs treated globally and a decade of proven results Apoquel is the world's Number #1 prescribed oral medication for allergic itch and it is overwhelmingly endorsed by veterinarians worldwide with approximately 90% satisfaction, reflecting the trust and confidence they place in our market-leading brands. And we are still unlocking the opportunity. Today, there are approximately 20 million dogs globally with undertreated or untreated pruritic itch presenting a vast untapped market. Take the US, for example, we estimate that 10 million dogs are currently receiving veterinary treatment for itch. While the majority or roughly 70% received Apoquel or Cytopoint, there are 3 million dogs prescribed alternative options like steroids. Moreover, an estimated 8 million dogs are treated with over-the-counter products or not treated at all. This highlights the potential addressable market of 11 million dogs in the US, alone that could benefit from our safe and effective therapies. Internationally, the trend is similar with room for even more growth as dogs become increasingly medicalized, underscoring a significant global market opportunity that will fuel our ongoing growth. To solidify our leadership and win new patients, we are focused on DTC marketing to raise awareness, enhance medical education to improve compliance and expanding retail partnerships. Our ability to execute extends to the Simparica franchise, which grew 22% operationally for the quarter. We have not only navigated the changing competitive landscape, but embrace new opportunities with confidence and agility. Several pre trends are fueling our growth. First, pet owner demographics are shifting. They are younger, more affluent and connected by the powerful human animal bond. They are highly engaged and willing to invest in their pet health and well-being. Second, and Wetteny will say more on this. There is a significant channel shift aimed at meeting the evolving needs of these younger pet owners. We are making our products more accessible, ensuring they are available where and when they need them. This combination is a crucial part of our growth strategy, and the results are reflected in our performance. In this dynamic environment, our execution across all phases from launch to expansion to defense, set us apart, showcasing we can introduce, sustain and grow products in a competitive market. Our focus on innovation and execution cuts across every part of the business to create shareholder value. In our livestock portfolio, the sale of our medicated feed additive and certain water-soluble product portfolios remains on track to close in the second half of the year. Meanwhile, we are focusing on innovative solutions for producers, including preventative, antibiotic alternatives and genetics. As the demand for healthy and sustainable animal protein continues to rise, we remain committed to supporting our livestock customers. Our dedication to meeting their needs and adapted to the evolving market conditions ensures that we are well positioned to contribute to their success. Building on our outstanding performance this quarter, we remain confident in our ability to grow faster than the market and through competition as reflected in our raised guidance. While macroeconomic headwinds persist, Animal Health remains resilient and Zoetis' strong operational execution and innovative, diverse and durable portfolio enable us to navigate all kinds of market conditions effectively. We further demonstrated our commitment to shareholders and confidence in our growth trajectory with the recent announcement of a Board-approved $6 billion share repurchase program, which Wetteny will elaborate on. The animal health landscape is evolving, and our innovations are at the forefront. And while breakthrough innovation is a cornerstone of our strategy, our success is rooted in multiple drivers of growth. We are not just launching new products, we are transforming existing ones to unlock their full potential and better serve customer needs through life cycle innovations. That means taking proven therapies and developing new formulations, uses and delivery methods maximizing their impact and reach. This translates to value created for customers and shareholders alike by allowing us to bring critical new solutions to market faster minimizing development risk and costs by leveraging existing safety profiles of proven products and expanding the reach of established products. Our commitment to life cycle innovation is just one reason we are the leader in animal health. When combined with our market leadership, deep customer insights, strategic investments and our purpose driven colleagues, we are uniquely positioned to deliver against the four tenets of our value proposition. To grow revenues faster than the market, to invest in innovation and growth capabilities to grow adjusted net income faster than revenue and to return excess capital to shareholders. Our differentiated execution and innovative, diverse and durable portfolio ensures we are not just keeping pace, we are setting the pace and redefining what's possible in animal health. With that, let me hand it off to Wetteny. Wetteny?
Wetteny Joseph: Thank you, Kristin, and good morning everyone. As you heard Kristin mention, our ability to execute on our commercial and strategic plans drove another outstanding quarter. We simultaneously executed across product launches, market expansion and market defense to propel us to a strong first-half. In the second quarter, we posted $2.4 billion in revenue, growing 8% on a reported basis and 11% operationally. Adjusted net income of $711 million grew 9% on a reported basis and 18% operationally. Quarterly growth was driven by our innovative companion animal portfolio. Globally, OA pain mAbs posted $149 million. Our Simparica franchise posted revenue of $384 million, which includes $299 million from Simparica Trio and our key dermatology franchise contributed $414 million. Our lifestyle portfolio also saw strong growth with $694 million in revenue. Looking closely at our success and execution. I'd like to focus first on OA pain. As we continue to execute our US launch strategy, we remain confident in our OA pain trajectory. Based on our experience launching other billion-dollar franchises, we know that first-in-class therapies require significantly more market development than lagging look-alikes. In the US, we have reached over 9,000 vets and veterinary technicians through interactive information sessions with our Chief Medical Officer and industry KOLs. This is on top of the thousands of interactions our sales reps and medical teams have had on individual vet visits. These interactions ensure our customers have the tools and resources to reinforce the safety and efficacy of Librela and Solensia with pet owners. Additionally, we are deploying capital to expand our DTC strategy. Pet owners know their pets better than anyone, and we want to help them detect the signs of OA and the available treatment options. We know these therapies are improving lives based on the positive testimonials from pet owners. The positive impact and reception of Librela are reflected in the market adoption. In the US, we see record penetration with over 80% of clinics now purchasing the product. No product in our history has penetrated this quickly. Reorder rates are approaching 90%, which is a leading indicator of customer satisfaction. In Europe, shipment is expanding to moderate and mild OA cases that were largely untreated, now making up more than 65% of total cases. This is just a glimpse into what we expect in the US over time, as Librela continues to expand the addressable market and gain market share. Despite our early success, we still have significant room for continued expansion. Our focus on execution doesn't stop after we launch a product. After more than a decade of exceptional safety and efficacy, our key dermatology franchise is still a critical performance driver, growing 18% operationally in the quarter. In the US, derm clinic visits are increasing, driving volume growth across both Apoquel and Cytopoint. The franchise including Apoquel, Apoquel chewable and Cytopoint is designed to cover multiple needs across different dermatological indications and their different methods of administration suit any vet or pet owner preference. Our derm products also address a full spectrum of pruritic cases, providing relief from acute and seasonal conditions, as well as treatment for dogs, with lifelong chronic conditions, which make up the majority of total derm revenue. And vets and pet owners are extremely happy with the results. In global studies, veterinarians report approximately 90% of that satisfaction with Apoquel safety and efficacy. Our comprehensive portfolio meets vets’ needs and the needs of their patients, and we are confident in our ability to grow revenue even in the face of competition. That confidence is fueled by the significant opportunities for market expansion that Kristin mentioned earlier. First, we are targeting the 8 million dogs in the US with atopic dermatitis that are either untreated or not treated by a vet through direct-to-consumer advertising, helping to educate pet owners on the signs of an itchy dog and our prescription treatment options. Additionally, in the US, there are 3 million dogs who are prescribed alternative products like steroids. We are confident in our ability to win these new customers through our proven safety and efficacy. We are also drawing more doses from the same patient base due to trends within pet health care, including [preference for] (ph) injectable therapies, chewable formulations and alternative channel growth, increasing compliance. Lastly, there are many markets where our key dermatology franchise is in the early stages of maturity. These markets should provide long-term growth trajectory and our outstanding international growth highlights this momentum. Our excellence in execution on our OA pain launches and key dermatology expansion has contributed to a great first half of the year. Now let us move on to our segment results. US revenue grew 12% in the quarter, with companion animal growing 13% and livestock posting 11% growth. For the first time, sales across our US companion animal portfolio surpassed $1 billion in the quarter. Performance was driven by our OA pain mAbs, Simparica Trio and our key dermatology franchise. Portfolio growth was largely driven by trends in retail and home delivery, reflecting the evolution of pet-owner preference for convenience and increased compliance on dispensing oral medications. In the clinic, usage of injectable therapeutic treatment is going to offset the alternative channel shift. Our pain mAbs, Librela and Solensia posted a combined $71 million in US sales in Q2. Librela generated $53 million, primarily on increased clinic utilization. As I mentioned to-date, market adoption is higher than any product in our history. Thus, we are confident in our trajectory. Solensia posted $18 million in revenue. We continue to be pleased with what we are seeing in the feline OA space. As Kristin mentioned, we see positive trends in feline OA visits which have nearly doubled since our launch almost two years ago. Simparica Trio posted US growth of 19% in the quarter on $254 million in revenue. We are entering our second year with competition in the triple combination parasiticide market, and we continue to execute on not just defending our leadership position with Trio, but growing it. Again we do not take a launch and done mentality. We posted 26% moving average total growth over the past 12 months. The majority of which was in a competitive market, highlighting not only our first mover advantage, but also the stickiness of our customer base. Lastly, in the vet channel, Simparica Trio is winning with Puppies, a leading indicator of future performance. In the absence of meaningful differentiation, vets and pet owners are reluctant to switch from a safe, efficacious product. The dermatology product sales in the US were $283 million for the quarter growing 17%. Apoquel was the largest growth driver with Apoquel chewable benefiting from increased conversion. Cytopoint growth continues to be driven by vet and pet owner preference for injectable solutions, especially for chronic cases. Earlier, Kristin alluded to shifting pet owner demographics in the evolving landscape. Much of our success with Simparica Trio and Apoquel has been bolstered by our ability to win in the growing retail and home delivery space. The convenience of these channels for self-administered products are increasingly popular with pet owners, and we are committed to making our products available where our customers need them. Currently, Simparica Trio is the best-selling prescription products in the retail channel and Apoquel is second. We estimate that over 20% of Trio sales and one-third of Apoquel sales now come via the retail channel. Additionally, the alternative channel growth rate for both Trio and Apoquel exceeded overall growth rate for these products this quarter. Growing pet owner preference for alternative channel convenience, has led to a decline in product-only clinic visits. This is why visits are not the best indicator of our performance, given we have consistently grown volume in an evolving landscape. Our US companion animal diagnostics portfolio grew 5% in the quarter, [returning to growth] (ph) after Q1 distributor inventory work downs following our channel strategies change. US Livestock had a strong quarter, growing 11% driven primarily from the timing of supply on ceftiofur, which had a soft comparable period last year. Moving on to our International segment. Revenue grew 4% on a reported basis and 10% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Companion animal grew 12% operationally and Livestock grew 8% operationally. Our international companion animal portfolio growth was driven by our Simparica, key dermatology and OA pain franchises, partially offset by impact in China. Our international Simparica franchise grew 35% operationally. Growth was driven by Simparica, growing 38% operationally to $59 million in sales in the quarter. We continue to see increased use in Latin America and Eastern Europe, as well as price benefits in high inflationary markets. Simparica Trio grew 31% operationally on $45 million in sales benefiting from key account growth in Europe, continued focus on DTC and the positive impact of our recent launch in China. Our key dermatology franchise grew 19% operationally in the quarter posting $131 million in sales. We saw double digit growth across most of our major markets, driven by higher compliance and new patients. Growth was partially offset by headwinds in Japan due to pre-price buy-ins in Q1. As we highlighted earlier, we continue to see significant opportunity for growth. Many international markets are in the early stages of market development with significant runway for growth. Internationally, our OA pain mAbs grew 35% operationally, posting $79 million in combined revenue. International Librela sales were $63 million growing 32% operationally. As we highlighted last quarter, we have lapped the launches in our last significant international markets, which occurred in Q2 of 2023. Solensia sales were $16 million, growing 49% operationally. Our international companion animal diagnostics portfolio grew 15% operationally with strong performance across much of Asia and Europe. International companion animal growth was partially offset by expected declines in China, driven by Revolution franchise. International livestock grew 8% operationally in the quarter driven by price increases, primarily in cattle and poultry in high inflationary markets. We saw strong growth in our fish portfolio this quarter with contributions from price and volume driven by strong demand for vaccines in Norway. Growth in price and fish was partially offset by volume declines in most of our other livestock species, due to a challenging comparable quarter as well as the impact of unfavorable rotations. As expected the economic challenges in China persist, putting pressure on certain companion animal products, as well as livestock, especially in swine. Consistent with what we have said for several quarters, the impact on our growth is expected to moderate late in the year, but continued headwinds are expected throughout the year across companion animal and livestock. [Physical] (ph) discipline across the P&L is one of the things that unlocks successful execution. As we move on to some of the highlights, we wanted to reaffirm our continued commitment to reinvesting in our business and our confidence in the returns we see from those investments. Adjusted gross margins of 71.7% declined 70 basis points on a reported basis. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact of 130 basis points. Excluding FX, we saw higher margins due to price increases favorable mix and lower freight costs, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs, especially in high inflationary markets. Adjusted operating expenses increased 9% operationally contributing to this growth was SG&A increases of 7% operationally and 17% operational growth in R&D. Improvements in operational gross margin and prudent expense growth contributed to adjusted net income which grew 18% operationally. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 20% operationally for the quarter. Lastly, I want to highlight our share repurchase program. In the quarter, we repurchased a record high $533 million in shares. Additionally, on August 1, we announced that we received board approval for a new $6 billion share repurchase program, our largest program to-date. The shares are expected to be repurchased over a multiyear period of up to four years, and the program can be canceled at any time. The company's previous $3.5 billion share repurchase program, which was approved in December 2021 is expected to be completed this year. This commitment reflects continued confidence in our ability to return value to shareholders. Before moving to guidance, an update on the planned divestiture of our Medicated Feed Additives portfolio. As Kristin mentioned, we are expecting this divestiture to close some time in the second half. Our current guidance is not reflective of the sale and may be adjusted subsequent to the close of the deal. As we stated in our April announcement, this portfolio generated approximately $400 million in revenue in 2023 with roughly linear seasonality. Now moving on to guidance for full year 2024. Our outstanding first half performance particularly in our Simparica and key dermatology franchises, demonstrated our ability to drive growth through execution across our business and gives us confidence going forward. Thus, we are raising our 2024 guidance provided during May's earnings call. Please note that guidance reflects foreign exchange rates of late July. For the year, we expect revenue between $9.1 billion and $9.25 billion, a range of 9% to 11% operational growth. As we stated earlier, our OA pain trajectory remains on track. Our expectations for Librela for the year remain unchanged. We now expect adjusted net income to be in the range of $2.64 billion to $2.69 billion, representing operational growth of 13.5% to 15.5%. We are maintaining our commitment to grow adjusted net income faster than revenue over the long-term, while increasing our investment in demand generating activities such as direct-to-consumer advertising. While we saw exceptional leverage this quarter, subsequent quarters may have -- may not have the same level of operating leverage, due to the optimal timing of investments. Finally, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.78 to $5.88 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.35 to $5.45. In closing before we go to Q&A, the strength and diversity of our portfolio and our relationships, as well as our ability to execute on our strategic vision, continually allows us to outperform our peers. We have the utmost confidence in our best-in-class portfolio and colleagues to continue to set the benchmark moving forward. Now I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Jon Block with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Jon Block: Great. Thanks guys. And good morning. Wetteny, maybe the first one for you. Was there a split between price and volume for the quarter? Sorry if I missed that. And then how do we think about pricing contribution from here will call it a 2025 life cycle innovation possibly make price somewhat more durable than maybe some people are anticipating. And then the second question, I'll just ask both upfront. Kristian, you got a lot of innovation to spend on for the DTC. And so where do the best returns reside? I can make the argument Librela is the least penetrated but Apoquel and Trio arguably the annuity is longer. So maybe you can talk to how you're balancing the spend and the associated returns. Thank you.
Wetteny Joseph: Sure, Jon. I'll take the first part of the question, and then Kristin will address the second one. Look, if you look at the stock we've had for the year, it is really been an outstanding start -- we're seeing demand across our innovative products and clearly a balanced growth picture when you look at the quarter with the US growing 12%, international growing 10%. We saw a companion animal growth at 12% and Livestock 9%. To get to your point around price and volume, I will cover the quarter but then I'll remind you of what the first half of the year looks like and what we are anticipating for the balance of the year. The quarter had about 8% price and 3% volume -- now if you look at the price contributions, you have about 2 points coming in from Argentina similar to the first quarter and as we anticipated in the second quarter. And that leaves you with roughly 6 points of price and 3 points of volume. Now I’ll tell you on a year-to-date basis, given where the comps were versus the prior year, you actually have a very balanced picture between price and volume. On a year-to-date basis, we've grown 12% operationally at the top-line. Separating out Argentina, you have 5% price and 5% volume. And that's roughly the balance we expect for the full year. It is just a little bit of nuance on a year-over-year basis based on the comps that is driving much higher volume in Q1 and much higher pricing in Q2. The last point I'll make is Trio had another outstanding quarter, and we are getting better price realization from more targeted promotions. In fact we did not run promotions in the second quarter compared to the last year where we did run a promotion. So that has a little bit of dynamic also playing out on the price picture if you follow that. Again, I'm very pleased with the performance overall stronger price contribution coming from that we expect roughly balanced price volume picture for the year.
Kristin Peck: Thanks. And Jon, I'll take your second question. Look, as you saw in a quarter where we grew derm 18%, the Simparica franchise at 22% and Pain at 142%, clearly, the DTC is having a very positive effect in ROI on each of these. We actually think about it in a much more detailed way than what you were mentioning. We don't just look at it by brand, we look at it by channel. So what is connected TV, TV digital. And there's different ROIs for different. I mean some of these are building markets. As you said, some of these are just more consumer oriented. If you look at parasiticides, consumers really do drive a lot of that spend themselves versus derm and pain, where you have the both the consumer and the veterinary involved. So we look at it both by product. We look at it seasonality. And I'd say, we're investing significantly across all three, where we really believe both there's an opportunity to drive compliance and as well as an opportunity to grow these markets. So we’re aggressively investing across each, but we look at it in a very detailed level to make sure the ROI, any given channel we're investing at any given time of the year makes the most sense.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Erin Wright: Thanks for taking my questions. On Librela first. So should we continue to see that sequential ramp in US Librela sales throughout the remainder of the year? And how are reorder rates sellout trends kind of throughout the quarter? How did that progress relative to your expectations and thoughts on potential label changes there as well for Librela? And then my second question is on just the competitive positioning now. I guess -- can you speak to how you're thinking about that now particularly in the dermatology category, but also in parasiticides and how much of the guidance update today was attributable to your view of your competitive positioning for the balance of the year? Thanks.
Kristin Peck: Thanks. I'll take the first question. I'll let Wetteny take the second question on competition across all three. Obviously, very, very pleased with Librela's growth in the quarter to 142%. What we're really seeing and it is fundamentally improving the quality of life for dogs with OA pain. We've seen a really positive reception. They find it safe and efficacious, and it's really making a real difference. To-date, we have about 18 million doses. We are very pleased with the penetration to-date in the US, which is 80% with the reorder rate of 86%. So to your point on quarter-over-quarter growth continuing to see and expect the rest of the year to see a significant quarter-over-quarter growth in this product. As we mentioned on last call, we are always in ongoing discussions with the FDA, certainly in the first year after launch as they are doing their post-marketing reviews, we have been in those. We have had dialogue with them about possible changes to the Librela label as we've had in many of the other markets we've operated in. In those markets, as you look at it, we continue to see positive trends quarter-over-quarter in Europe after label changes we had in both the EU and the UK in both 2022 and 2023. So these are label changes, as you know, are not uncommon as we talked about last quarter. So we are really excited to see the growth we continue to see in Librela and really the excitement and positive stories from pet owners. So, Wetteny you want to take the second question?
Wetteny Joseph: Sure. Look, when we look at the performance so far, it is been phenomenal across derm, and Trio for the first half of the year, as well as strong contributions obviously coming from our OA pain franchise. You heard the numbers coming in from Librela and Solensia, both in the US with the launch as well as internationally. When we think about the competitive landscape, look clearly, given what we are seeing and what we anticipate continuing because of momentum in the business, we are raising guidance based on the core business. I would say, Derm, in particular when we look at the competitive landscape, we've raised our expectations on derm to double digits. We are seeing high single digits previously. When we look at Trio, the update isn't really meaningful. We were anticipating to be late in the year, comparative launch. Anyway, it's a third to come to market, et cetera. So not any meaningful impact here in terms of how we think about the guidance.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Michael Ryskin: Great. Thanks. Both of my questions are going to be on derm market. So first, just a quick one on Apoquel chewable. You launched that recently, and there was a lot of excitement around that. I was just wondering if you could provide any color on how meaningful a contribution that's having to the better results you are seeing? Or if you think it is more traditional Apoquel that's still driving derm. And are there any inventory dynamics there we should be mindful? Was there any stocking with distributors in the quarter or year-to-date? Just an update on Apoquel chewable and then the follow-up on sort of the long-term opportunity. I think you gave a lot of color in the slides on the opportunity in derm in terms of the underpenetrated market, the untreated opportunity and steps you are taking to further penetrate that. My question is that's been the case for a number of years, and you have had derm on product in the market for over a decade now. So it seems like there is a sizable part of the market that's just resistant to treatment or possibly isn't go into the clinic, isn't amenable to this product? I'm just wondering how real do you think that opportunity is and what the barrier there is? Is that an education? Is that a cost price point? Is that a treatment modality issue. Just why is there still such a sizable unaddressed market in derm and what steps you can do to further penetrate that. Thanks.
Kristin Peck: Thanks, Mike. I will take the second question on the long-term opportunity, and then I'll let Wetteny cover anything that I missed as well as cover all the dynamics you're asking for specifically around chewable. To your point, our Derm portfolio has been on the market for 11 years, and we posted 18% growth in the quarter. So I would say that there is a significant opportunity to continue to expand the market. I appreciate your comment on the slide. We did try to add slides this quarter to try to bring to light some of the stories that we're talking about, again, get some of those numbers out there for you. And specifically, what we were trying to address in that is the significant opportunity where we see two drivers really of the future growth. One is around compliance, and we are seeing really strong growth here around compliance. We can increase compliance through retail and auto shift. I even think chewable, which Wetteny will talk about, will help drive compliance. So we think there is a significant opportunity for more weeks and more months on therapy. And I also think there is a big opportunity to continue to expand the market. And building on what Wetteny said in his prepared remarks, there's 3 million dog owners right now that are prescribed to other products such as steroids that could be moved to our product. And then there's 8 million dogs with OA who might be using shampoos or things like that or over-the-counter treatment or might not be using anything at all. We see those as significant opportunities to continue to grow the market. That's 11 million dogs in the US alone. And as I mentioned in my remarks, internationally, we see the same key drivers and same opportunities, but with an additional one, which is that there is still many dogs yet to be medicalized in international. And as those dogs become more medicalized across many countries in China, Brazil, et cetera, we see a significant opportunity there. But I know you asked a number of questions on chewable, which I'll let Wetteny build on it as well as anything else you saw in Derm, you want to mention.
Wetteny Joseph: Look, when I look at the derm picture, Mike I'm very excited about how we are thoughtfully targeting these sub-parts of the business beyond continuing to educate pet owners and so on, which is already benefiting us in terms of the growth we continue to see in this product 11 years later. So clearly, we are penetrating those areas, and we think there are some real ways we can smartly and thoughtfully target. Here above the about 7 million that we are already treating with our products. 11 million that we can go after here in the US alone, and Kristin just touched on that. And so we'll go into more detail on that, but we're very excited about how we are doing that there. In terms of true look, this is largely conversion for Apoquel. So I wouldn't say, that it is necessarily contributing to overall growth, but an important part of our strategy as we look ahead. We've seen the conversion rates outside the US, for example, in those markets in Europe, we have been in for, I think, about 2.5 or so years now -- those are now about 50% penetration in the US, as we ended the quarter, we were approaching about 1/4 conversion. I think we've crossed that since. So we are in that ballpark. So clearly, meaningfully converting from Apoquel, which again is an important part of our business, and we think could long-term contribute to overall growth given the ease of use and preference to pet owners, et cetera.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Brandon Vasquez with William Blair. Please go ahead.
Brandon Vazquez: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe my first question, can you just walk a little bit through the increased guidance, maybe on the top-line and the bottom-line, specifically what is being passed through there. I think not to pick on, it was a great quarter. I think you'd be a little bit more, especially on the organic growth relative to our estimates, and I think less than that beat was passed-through. So just curious if there's puts and takes through the rest of the year that we should be keeping in mind for both sales and EPS on the bottom-line.
Wetteny Joseph: Sure. Look, first of all let me just cover one last piece that I didn't cover on the last call, which was the contribution in terms of stocking around chew and then I will get Brandon, to your question around the guidance and what went into it in terms of puts and takes in top versus bottom. First of all, there is very little contribution in terms of net inventory into distribution on chew, it's about $4 million, so call it 1 percentage point out of the 18, we talked about on key derm globally, so not meaningful at all. Now to your point around the guidance look, we raised the midpoint of our guidance, about 50 basis points the same on the bottom. We are still very much committed and confident in driving operational sort of growth and expansion through the P&L. You've seen about 450 basis points separation between top-line and bottom-line. So clearly, continuing to demonstrate our core value proposition to grow the bottom-line faster than the top-line. I think what you're seeing here in terms of the guide, while it's the same raise at top and bottom in terms of basis points is because we see an opportunity to invest in the business in areas that will drive growth as we exit the year and enter into next year. And as we said continuously, we will make those investments as we see those opportunities, but still, again, sticking to our commitment to driving top and bottom. Now I think as you look at the back half of the year, I will note a couple of things. If you remember last year in the fourth quarter, we have basically an easier comp particularly on just the bottom-line in the fourth quarter, but these investments will impact the operational leverage you see in the third quarter. So we expect that to be not at the levels that you are seeing in Q2 here as you map from the guidance and the implications in the back half. So clearly, that half looks like about a 9% top line growth there at the top, leverage on the back half, but more heavily weighted towards Q4 versus Q3 in terms of that leverage.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Steve Scala with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Christopher LoBianco: Hi. This is Chris on for Steve Scala. Thanks for taking our questions. We had just one on dermatology. Can you provide any color on the breakdown of key derm sales between Apoquel, Apoquel chewable and Cytopoint? How do you see this split evolving over time? And does Apoquel chewable provide extended patent protection for the brand? Thank you.
Wetteny Joseph: Sure. I'll cover both here. Look, really when you look at the conversion strategy we have with Apoquel chewable versus Apoquel, we talk about the key derm franchise here versus breaking them out here. So we have 18% growth in key derm. If you look at both Apoquel the Apoquel franchise, as well as Cytopoint with double-digit growth in the quarter. Again, we continue to emphasize the combination of Apoquel and Apoquel chewable versus breaking them out, which is the reason that you heard the commentary from us as you did. In terms of patent protection, look there are various patents that cover the product, both across the active ingredient, as well as the formulation and dosing regimens. So they do very overall, if you look at the franchise, we are looking at patents that extend out to 2031. More details are available in the 10-K, if you want to pull that up from last year. And of course, this year 10-K we’ll cover that.
Operator: Again we'll take our next question from Balaji Prasad with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Balaji Prasad: Hi, good morning and congratulations on the quarter. Just a couple for me. Firstly, on -- I wanted to dig a bit into the nuances of pricing. Is there a difference in how pet owners pursue price hikes for pharmaceutical products versus diagnostics? The reason I'm asking is our veterinary survey consistently showing that pet owners are increasingly concerned about spending trends in diagnostics. It seems that this is not applicable on the pharmaceutical side would allow you to take on it, one. Two, could you also just size the fish vaccine business a bit, the growth? And in that context, what would an approval like Alpha Ject Micro translate to in terms of accelerating this revenue growth? Thank you.
Wetteny Joseph: So look, maybe I'll take a stab at the first one, Balaji. Look, I think you've seen that spend in animal health, particularly pet owners is a doable spend, and they see their pet health as essential. We've seen that time and time again. And every survey we've done given the human animal bond, et cetera, shows that. I think when you look at pet health spend, 86% of pet owners are saying that they would spend whatever it takes if their pet needed extensive veterinary care. We've done market studies as well that demonstrated pet owners had a 20% reduction in their budget, they would still spend the same on their pet health. So clearly, underscoring this importance in terms of the importance of the pet health as a member of the family of pet owners, and we see that show up in terms of our numbers. I don't know if I have a view in terms of how that differentiates between therapeutics versus diagnostics. Clearly, as we look at the picture today, you continue to see strong volume growth in our business, even as you see very robust price as well. So clearly, we see that opportunity to continue to drive the business. That way, we are seeing some price realization. So it is not priced to – and pet owner is priced into channels in terms of vet clinics, et cetera. But you see our ability to continue to take price and still drive volume in the business given the innovative solutions we're bringing that are addressing chronic conditions for pet owners that they really, really care about. So we think that there's continued room to continue to do that. In terms of the fixed vaccine, I can't speak to the specific vaccine you talked about. Clearly, we saw 20% growth in our fish portfolio this quarter, this is largely driven by demand for vaccines in Norway, a very important market for us, so we are seeing both price and volume. Therefore, perhaps we'll take offline that specific one that you referenced.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from David Westenberg with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
David Westenberg: Hi, thank you for taking my question and congrats on great quarter here. So you definitely have products that drive visits in an themselves like Cytopoint and Librela but you also do have wellness dependent products such as vaccines and maybe I'd argue Proheart in that category. Can you talk about how those wellness products have been performing? Your expectation for how they do the rest of the year? And can you help frame the size of that -- those kind of products in your portfolio? And then if I could just squeeze in one smaller one. Were there any portfolio [minute] (ph) sales with your MFA portfolio that you're getting rid of? And why is that portfolio if there isn't more or less portfolio sales dependent? Thank you.
Kristin Peck: Sure. I'll take your MFA question, and then I'll let Wetteny take the volumes and things like that across wellness and vaccine. As you think about our medicated feed additive business, as you saw, it was integrated into some of our portfolio contracts, but the majority of those contracts and the majority of the value is Wetteny outlined globally, our MSA sales last year in 2023 were only $400 million. So it's not inconsequential, but it is not a material way of the way we negotiate. Most of our negotiations across portfolio are in more innovative products that are essential to our customers. So no, we are not concerned in livestock, as we sell that business and our ability to continue to leverage our portfolio to provide the best value for our customers. So we're committed to continuing to do that. And I'll let Wetteny take the second question sort of on the wellness.
Wetteny Joseph: Look, David, I think your question on wellness in terms of what's happening across the core portfolio brands versus the rest. I think at the heart of that question is really what's happening around visits, which we have continuously talk about that overall visits on a good indicator for our business, and you see volume growth across our pet care business each quarter even when overall visits are down. Now to get to your point, if you look at Apoquel, Cytopoint, the key derm franchise, if you look at Trio and Simparica franchise and OA pain. Those are all seeing increased volume across the business. I think if you then say what happened to the rest of the portfolio, it contributed about 2 percentage points to our growth. And that's largely price in this quarter, but that's just a dynamic versus the prior year in terms of both timing of when we had some vaccine availability in the prior year that added to supply last year. And therefore, it's a comp item, if you will, and then China has its impact in terms of whether you could the rest of the portfolio. So it's a little bit more price versus volume in the quarter. But overall, typically, we see about 1 to 2 point contribution to growth from the rest of the portfolio. And that's what we're seeing this year. Again, I’d underscore that we are seeing increased volumes across pet care regardless of the overall visit picture. And I think that is really what's important for us to [win with] (ph) our business.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Glen Santangelo with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Glen Santangelo: Yeah, hi. Thanks for taking my question. I maybe want to touch on some of the topics that we just talked about, but -- we get a lot of questions from investors talking about the sluggish sort of pet ownership and vet visit trends and taking all that into the context of a weakening consumer here. And Wetteny, I heard your comments regarding how you view the consumer and your comments regarding how strong the retail channel has been for you all. But could you maybe help us reconcile some of those trends and data points as you think about taking the step to raise guidance in the back half of the year, I mean how conservative are you with respect to the consumer and how you think about those trends in general. Thanks.
Kristin Peck: Thanks. I'll start and see if Wetteny wants to build anything here. I think what you are seeing is the -- you might see an impact in lower spending in pet discretionary -- but we are continuing to see consumer receive pet and medical care as very essential, and they are willing to spend. So if you look in the quarter, we saw about a 4% growth of revenue in the clinics, about 6.2% revenue per visit growth mean obviously, you are referencing the decline in overall clinic visits. But if you look at our US pet care numbers, we outpaced significantly overall in the US with 13% growth in our companion animal business. So we're seeing very strong demand for our products. These pet owners are young, they're affluent. They see the pet as a central member of their family and they are continuing to spend to keep their pets healthy and happy. So we are very optimistic as we look to the rest of this year and confident in the guidance that Wetteny provided and confident honestly, as we look into 2025, the consumer when it comes to essential veterinary care, still is willing to spend. We've done multiple studies as we've referenced before. 86% of pet owners would spend whatever it takes to take care of their pet. And even when faced with a 20% reduction in their income, they would not change what they spend to take care of their pets.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Chris Schott: Hi, great. Thanks so much. Just two questions for me. On derm, is there an updated view on growth for that business in 2024 relative to the comments you made in 1Q just in light of the very strong first half results you've had. And maybe just a second part to the derm question. With your competitor announcing that their product may have a black box warning -- does that change your approach in terms of thinking about how you're thinking about either growing or defending the derm franchise, promotions, marketing, et cetera, as you go through not just the second half of this year about to 2025? Or -- are the plans largely unchanged in light of that update? Thank you.
Wetteny Joseph: Sure, Chris. Thanks for the question. Look, if we look at the growth, I mentioned earlier on the call, given the competitive dynamics and quite frankly, just the strength of our growth as we continue to expand the market 18% growth in the second quarter. We are raising our expectations for key derm franchise. We said last quarter, it would be high single digits. We're now seeing it’s double-digit growth for 2025. Look, on your question, I'll start on the black box warning and turn it over to Kristin to add any additional points. Clearly, a black box warning is the most serious warning that the FDA will have on a product and when faced against a product that does not have one, also has been in the market for 11 years, over 23 million dogs have been treated with our Apoquel product. The satisfaction levels being above 90% or around 90% both on safety and efficacy that becomes a [total] (ph) order. So clearly, we talked about our excitement, quite frankly around still unmet need out there in terms of undertreated and untreated that we are targeting. We got this competition because we believe on offense here in terms of growing -- expanding use of our products is the best move. We got less of the competition. But clearly, it will position us well versus a product that has a black box label.
Kristin Peck: And the only thing I'd add there is I think what's really exciting about Apoquel is that you don't have to trade off safety and efficacy there. It can be used across all durations of therapy, both acute seasonal and chronic I think the chewable really provides differentiation, especially at the consumer level. You don't have to worry about vaccine status, and it works very, very quickly. So I think that's what also gives us optimism and our potential to continue to grow this franchise.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Navann Ty with BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.
Navann Ty: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just had one on Librela. If you had any updated thoughts on the transition to the moderate population, as well as the antitrust investigation in Europe. And then second, on vet visits, and I know that you are not as sensitive as other players, but if you have any outlook for that visit for the full year and next year? Thank you.
Kristin Peck: Sure. First on your question on the EU Commission investigation. It actually has to do with an experimental compound that was part of the Nexvet acquisition, which was about seven years ago. We continue to believe our decision to stop the experimental compound was sound, rigorous and lawful, and we're confident the concerns will be unfounded when they finish their investigation with regards to that. You were asking me how we're doing in international with regards to Librela. Right now, about 65% of the cases are now mild to moderate, which we think is significant progress, this has been a big focus of ours, as we've mentioned on the previous calls. And with regards to your last point, I think on vet visits, we don't really have really good detailed information internationally on vet visits -- so there's not great information. It ranges by market to market, and there's not great sources. So I don't have any specifics I can share there.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Thomas DeBourcy with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.
Tom DeBourcy: Hello. Thanks for taking the question. Just I guess, Livestock, I know maybe not top against a lot. But even excluding fish, your cattle poultry swine growth was pretty strong in the quarter. And I was just wondering, the last couple of years have been difficult for livestock market with inflation and other pressures. Just whether you see maybe a more sustainable mid or high single-digit growth in that market. I know kind of there is MFAs going get it out there, but just otherwise, whether the market may be improving.
Wetteny Joseph: Yes. So look, great. We saw 9% growth in our livestock portfolio. As you've said continuously, livestock tends to grow the market, somewhere between 2% and 4%. Typically, -- this year, we are seeing increased price, particularly in those hyperinflationary markets like Argentina, for example. And so we would expect livestock as a market to grow towards the higher end of that range. And we believe we will follow that range as well. If you look at what we would expect in our results. I think when you see high single-digit growth rates like this, sometimes it's a comp for example, in the US, ceftiofur had an easier comp versus prior year. So you'll see an uptick in that. But overall, we expect livestock to be in that 2% to 4% range, perhaps a touch above that in this current environment given the pricing environment on those hyperinflation in our markets.
Operator: And there are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back to the speakers for any closing remarks.
Kristin Peck: Thank you. Thanks, everybody, for joining the call today and for your questions. Our ability to seamlessly integrate innovation and execution resulted in what I believe is an outstanding second quarter and first half of 2024, it led us to raise our guidance. And we are very excited about the continued momentum for the rest of the year. I think what we've clearly demonstrated is our ability to generate groundbreaking ideas and translate those into tangible results. We are laser-focused on our strategy to ensure we remain at the forefront of the industry. I believe our diverse and durable portfolio of trusted and best-in-class products positions us well to capitalize on the emerging opportunities and to really redefine how animals are cared for, for the long term. And finally, I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to all of our dedicated colleagues across the globe. We recently celebrated Purpose Months across our teams and geographies, highlighting how we bring our purpose to life every day with our customers, our communities and each other and their passion for nurturing the world in human time by advancing care for animals, is truly inspiring. Your hard work and commitment are the driving force behind our success. And I want to thank you for everything that you do. And I want to thank all of you for joining us today. Have a great day.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-05-02 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the First Quarter 2024 Financial Results Conference Call and Webcast for Zoetis. Hosting the call today is Steve Frank, Vice President of Investor Relations for Zoetis. 
 The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, and will not be forwarded automatically. 
 In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately 2 hours after the conclusion of the call via dial-in or on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. 
 [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin. 
Steven Frank: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Zoetis First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. I am joined today by Kristin Peck, our Chief Executive Officer; and Wetteny Joseph, our Chief Financial Officer. 
 Before we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website, and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projections. 
 For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statements in today's press release and our SEC filings, including, but not limited to, our annual report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q. 
 Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and the company's 8-K filing dated today, Thursday, May 2, 2024. 
 We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. 
 And with that, I will turn the call over to Kristin. 
Kristin Peck: Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call for 2024. 
 Today, we reported outstanding first quarter results, underscored by steady demand for our products, a focused strategy and our purpose-driven colleagues. We delivered 12% operational revenue growth and grew adjusted net income 15% operationally in line with the tenet of our value proposition. 
 Driven by the launch of our osteoarthritis pain franchise, the U.S. led the way with 16% growth and 8% operational growth internationally. More specifically, globally, Librela grew 189% operationally, including $40 million in sales in the U.S., in line with our expectations. 
 The powerful human animal bond fueled demand for our companion animal portfolio with 20% growth operationally, while livestock declined 1% operationally. 
 This quarter's results even amidst global uncertainty are a testament, once again, to the power of our diverse and durable portfolio across markets, species and therapeutic areas. It also highlights the continued rise and resilience of the animal health industry. 
 Our purpose and performance are rooted in science, which has always been the great disruptor. And as animal health is increasingly essential for nutrition and companionship, caregivers demand even more high-quality innovation. That means we identify the most prevalent area of unmet veterinary needs and invest in, develop, manufacture and deliver life-changing products that customers have been waiting for. 
 Take, for example, Librela and Solensia, our injectable monoclonal antibodies to treat OA pain in dogs and cats, which are helping millions of pets return to play. With more than 18 million doses distributed worldwide, we are providing long-lasting relief to animals, many of whom were previously undiagnosed or untreated due to limitations of NSAIDs. With nearly 40% of all dogs suffering from OA pain globally, we believe just 1/3 of those are being treated. So we're just scratching the surface of care. 
 And cats are visiting the clinic more often. In fact, we're helping curb clinic fears with Bonqat, the first FDA-approved product to alleviate anxiety in cat, which means we're expanding care in a historically under-medicalized area of the market. 
 We understand that social media is a form for convening, a place for pet owners to connect and to share, but we also have responsibility to empower our customers to make informed decisions grounded in science and data. 
 We are unwavering in our commitment to rigorous safety and quality standards, which has earned us the trust and confidence of veterinarians worldwide. Backed by that commitment, Librela and Solensia are safe and effective. They are anchored in 10 years of science and have been used in Europe for more than 3 years. 
 In the U.S., 78% of veterinarians who are at the center of care are very satisfied with Librela. This is driven by real-world experience and consistent with the feedback we hear in other markets. And our research indicates that 46% of vet globally will treat OA earlier and 65% will treat more dogs now that Librela is available. 
 To accurately reaffirm the safety and efficacy of these therapies, we are doubling down, working directly with veterinarians who need these products, hosting live sessions with our Chief Medical Officer and expanding online education and training while deploying capital to expand our DTC strategy. 
 And veterinarians continue to be confident in Librela as evidenced by a recent blind survey of U.S. vets confirming that perception, and intent to prescribe remain unchanged. 
 We remain confident that OA pain could be our next $1 billion franchise because we are meeting the needs of an underserved market. We are growing by nearly every metric, including adoption, penetration, reorder rates, patient share and expanded utilization. And looking at our 4-week rolling average in the U.S., we're excited to report that sales steadily increased through April. Our performance speaks to the power of the human animal bond. Discerning pet owners want options, and they will work with their vets to find relief for their best friends. 
 Beyond OA pain, Zoetis has been able to lead the market in other key categories because we deeply understand our customers' needs. This allows us to not only compete in existing markets, but again, to create entirely new ones. And science has created something completely unique to our industry, two $1 billion franchises. 
 Our parasiticide portfolio expanded the total market based on deep customer insights. Before Simparica and Simparica Trio, we were #5 in this category. These innovations changed how we compete. Today, we are #2 and continue gaining share and growing the market even in the face of competition. 
 Similarly, we were first to recognize that new therapies were needed to treat canine itch safely and effectively. That market foresight changed the treatment paradigm and revolutionized pet care. A decade of dermatology has led to 3 products; 20 major life cycle enhancements, including Cytopoint, the first ever animal health monoclonal antibody and the first chewable with Apoquel chew. 
 From what was once believed to be just a $100 million market has grown to $1.4 billion because we know what our customers need. Today, more than 18 million dogs are treated for allergic itch and atopic dermatitis and another 13 million remain untreated globally. We built a $1 billion franchise and demonstrated the durability of our portfolio. And we will continue growing this franchise underpinned by strong brand equity, first-mover advantage, life cycle innovations and strong customer relationships. 
 We've led in parasiticides, dermatology and now OA pain. And each time our innovations have created new categories in animal health, you've seen the total industry opportunity expand. 
 Now moving to livestock. I'm sure you all saw the news this week on the announcement of our agreement with Phibro Animal Health to sell our global medicated feed additives and certain water-soluble product portfolios and related assets for $350 million. This deal is another great example of Zoetis' disciplined capital allocation strategy to focus investments in areas with the greatest growth potential and innovation that are aligned with our key capabilities. 
 I'm confident that under Phibro's management, the global reach of these products will continue to expand to meet customer needs worldwide. We remain very committed to livestock and just sharpening our focus and our core innovative livestock growth areas, including preventative antibiotic alternatives and genetics. 
 In summary, for more than 70 years, Zoetis has been leading the industry with our commitment to innovation. We've invested over $5 billion in R&D since our IPO, which has brought more than 300 product lines to the market. Science is and always has been the great disruptor and at the core of our success in delivering the innovations that veterinarians, livestock producers and pet owners expect from us. 
 Our pursuit of science has led to breakthroughs in dermatology, like Cytopoint and Apoquel chew; in parasiticide with Simparica Trio; and now the latest in OA pain with Librela and Solensia that are revolutionizing animal health. 
 Blazing new trails isn't easy. But time and again, our purpose-driven colleagues have proven their ability to expand our industry leadership and forge entirely new markets. 
 And we remain committed to delivering strong growth through our innovative franchises and diverse portfolio while continuing to invest for the future. 
 Looking ahead to the remainder of 2024, our increased operational guidance reflects the resilience of the animal health market and the execution of our strategic growth priorities. We will continue to be disciplined, yet adaptable in our approach to the opportunities, potential challenges and economic shifts that occurred throughout the year. 
 And with that, I will turn it over to Wetteny. 
Wetteny Joseph: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. As Kristin mentioned, we had an outstanding start to the year driven by the underlying strength of our companion animal portfolio, particularly our innovative products, as well as price growth across all species. 
 In the first quarter, we generated revenue of $2.2 billion, growing 10% on a reported basis and 12% on an operational basis. 
 Adjusted net income of $634 million grew 4% on a reported basis and 15% on an operational basis. 
 Our 12% operational revenue growth was due to the underlying strength of our companion animal portfolio, aided by the impact of a weak comparative quarter in our U.S. companion animal business. However, the majority of this [ probability ] to growth was offset by headwinds related to economic conditions in China, the impact of a tough comparative quarter in livestock due to the timing of supply for certain products last year and inventory destocking related to our U.S. diagnostics sales model change. 
 Of the 12% operational revenue growth, 7% is from price with 5% growth in volume. While we saw price growth across our portfolio, price was favorably impacted by hyperinflationary markets, especially Argentina, which contributed 2% to our overall price growth. 
 The volume growth was driven primarily by new products, including our monoclonal antibodies for OA pain, Librela and Solensia, as well as our key dermatology products and Simparica Trio. 
 On a segment basis, the U.S. posted $1.2 billion in revenue, growing 16% on the quarter, while our International segment reported revenue of $1 billion with operational growth of 8% in the quarter. 
 Our companion animal portfolio was the main driver of revenue growth in Q1, growing 20% operationally. This growth was partially offset by livestock, which declined 1% on an operational basis. 
 We saw double-digit operational companion animal growth in both our U.S. and our International segments again this quarter, driven by the strong performance of our innovative products with contributions from both volume and price. 
 Simparica Trio was the primary driver of growth in the quarter, generating $243 million globally, representing operational growth of 61%. We saw strong demand for Trio as well as continued growth in patient share even with competition. 
 Our OA pain meds were also a significant contributor to growth, posting $131 million in the quarter. Global growth came from the impact of new launch markets, both in the U.S. and internationally. In our early launch EU markets, recent vet surveys showed an increase in muscle on therapy and expansion into more moderate OA cases. 
 Our key dermatology products grew 25% operationally in the quarter with $360 million in global revenue. Growth within dermatology was driven primarily by our Apoquel franchise, where we are seeing solid conversion to Apoquel Chewable, including a modest impact from initial distributor stocking in the U.S. 
 Cytopoint growth continues to be driven by vet and pet owner preference for injectable methods of treatment. 
 Our global companion animal diagnostics portfolio declined 12% operationally with declines in the U.S. driven by our distribution model change. These declines were anticipated as our distribution partners sold off their remaining inventory due to our transition to a direct-only model for our U.S. diagnostics portfolio. U.S. declines were partially offset by growth internationally. 
 Our livestock portfolio declined 1% operationally, as expected, driven by a tough comparative quarter in the prior year especially in the U.S. as well as impacts from the ongoing economic conditions in China. This decline was partially offset by price growth in our other International markets. 
 Now moving on to revenue growth by segment for the quarter. U.S. revenue was $1.2 billion in the quarter, growing 16% with companion animal growth of 25% and livestock posting a 7% decline. The companion animal performance in the quarter was driven by Simparica Trio, our key dermatology portfolio, and the impact of the launch of Librela in the U.S. as well as the impact of a weak comparative quarter. 
 Our outstanding U.S. companion animal growth came in the quarter where we saw vet clinic visits decrease 1.5%. We continued to see growth in the therapeutic visits while wellness visits drove the decline. 
 Sales outgrowth in the retail and home delivery continued to outpace vet clinic fulfillment, which is based on growing pet owner preference for these alternative channels. This dynamic is expected to put continued pressure on total vet clinic visits without impacting our expectations for revenue. 
 Despite the visit decline, revenue and spend per visit in the clinic grew 4.5% and 6%, respectively, which reflects continued pet owner willingness to pay. 
 Turning to product performance. Simparica Trio posted sales of $205 million in the quarter, growing 61%. We continue to be the market leader in the triple-combination parasiticide space. Our leading footprint across channels has allowed us to continue to drive dosage growth through increased compliance even with declines in wellness visits at the clinic. 
 In addition to a weak comparable period in the prior year, we are seeing favorable price realization due to more targeted discount programs to vets as well as channel dynamics. 
 The dermatology product sales in the U.S. were $233 million for the quarter, growing 27%. We saw growth in both price and volume and across both Apoquel and Cytopoint. Both also benefited from a weak comparable period in the prior year. 
 Market demand for our dermatology products remained high. In the quarter, we saw growth in both our patient share as well as higher periodic visits in the clinic. Additionally, growth of retail autoship programs continued to bolster compliance. At the beginning of April, we made Apoquel Chewable available through our distribution partners. 
 Our pain meds, Librela and Solensia, posted a combined $57 million in U.S. sales in Q1. Librela generated $40 million in the quarter with underlying vet demand continuing to build on the momentum from our full launch in Q4 of last year. Excluding the impact of the initial clinic stocking, which we have provided last quarter, we are seeing robust sequential quarter growth in Librela, in line with expectations. 
 We continued to see good growth in penetration as well as strong reorder rates, which are approaching 80%, all of which points to positive real-world satisfaction in the clinic and among pet owners. 
 We remain confident not just in the safety and efficacy of Librela, but also in our expected performance. As Kristin alluded to, we have seen steady increasing trends in our trailing 4-week sales average in the U.S., even into April, after the increased media attention. 
 We continued to see steady progress in Solensia, which had U.S. sales of $17 million in the quarter, more than doubling our prior year Q1 sales. We have indicated the feline market needs significant development, but we are pleased with our progress thus far. 
 Solensia is now the market-leading product for feline OA pain in the U.S., and we have seen a significant increase in the medicalized patient pool since launch. 
 Our U.S. companion animal diagnostics portfolio declined 21% in the quarter, driven primarily by distributor inventory work-downs following our channel strategy change. This destocking is in line with our expectations and has negligible impact on our underlying clinic demand. 
 U.S. livestock declined 7% in the quarter while our underlying business performance in the quarter was as expected. Our results are reflective of a strong comparative period in Q1 of 2023, in which we grew 15% due to the return of supply on several products, primarily in cattle. 
 Sales of swine products declined due to decreased sales of vaccines as well as JAKs. 
 In poultry, we saw declines as a result of increased generic competition in our medicated feed additive products. 
 Moving on to our International segment where revenue grew 3% on a reported basis and 8% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Companion animal grew 14% operationally and livestock grew 2% operationally. Increased sales of our international companion animal products were driven by oral pain meds, key dermatology products, vaccines and small animal parasiticides. This growth was partially offset by impacts in China. 
 Our International OA pain meds grew 67% operationally to $74 million in combined revenue in the quarter. International Librela sales were $l59 million, growing 71% operationally. Growth is balanced across new launch markets and our first wave EU markets. 
 We continue to see evolution in the European markets, where we have seen expansion in Librela's use in moderate OA cases, which according to the latest vet surveys now represents the majority of the Librela patients in Europe. We remain pleased with the success of our DTC advertising campaigns in increasing pet owner awareness of OA. 
 Solensia sales were $15 million internationally in the quarter, growing 54% on an operational basis. Our International key dermatology portfolio grew 23% operationally in the quarter, posting $127 million in sales. We saw double-digit operational growth across most of our major markets, driven by higher compliance and new patients. Growth was also favorably impacted by prepriced increased buy-ups in Japan and certain European markets. 
 Our International small animal parasiticides portfolio grew 6% operationally driven by our Simparica franchise with Simparica Trio growing 58% operationally to $38 million in sales. Trio growth benefited from continued uptake in Europe driven by key account penetration and sales force effectiveness as well as contributions from Trio's launch in China. 
 Simparica posted $56 million in revenue, growing 22% on an operational basis in the quarter. This growth was partially offset by a 29% operational decline in our Revolution franchise, which generates a high proportion of sales in China. 
 International livestock grew 2% operationally in the quarter driven by price increases as in high inflationary markets. Price growth was partially offset by volume declines across all of our species, partially driven by a tough comparative period in the prior year due to the return of supply of certain livestock products. 
 The volume declines in livestock were driven by cattle due to a tough comparable period related to supply and worsening market conditions in Australia. Our International swine portfolio saw volume declines driven by China, where we saw lower hog prices as well as a reduction in herd sizes. 
 In sheep, we saw declines from herd reductions due to expected weather conditions in Australia and New Zealand as well as supply constraints on a key product. 
 As we mentioned last quarter, we continue to see economic challenges in China, where low consumer spending and higher urban unemployment have reduced spending. We are also seeing a slowdown in livestock with lower pork prices and smaller herd sizes. The impact on our growth is expected to moderate late in the year, but we expect to continue to see headwinds throughout the year across both companion animal and livestock. 
 Now moving on to the rest of the P&L for the quarter. Adjusted gross margins of 70.7% declined 10 basis points on a reported basis compared to the prior year. 
 Foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact of 180 basis points on our reported adjusted gross margins. Excluding FX, we saw higher margins due to price increases, favorable mix and lower freight costs partially offset by higher manufacturing costs, especially in hyperinflationary markets. 
 Adjusted operating expenses increased 11% operationally, driven primarily by SG&A growth of 10% operationally, mainly due to higher compensation-related expenses as well as increased advertising and promotion spend on our OA pain meds. 
 R&D grew 13% on an operational basis, driven by higher project spend related to both recent acquisitions as well as advancements of our pipeline candidates. 
 The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 19.7%, a decrease of 80 basis points, primarily due to a higher benefit in the U.S. related to foreign-derived intangible income and a more favorable jurisdictional mix of earnings. 
 And finally, adjusted net income grew 15% operationally despite a $31 million headwind to growth from the nonrecurring benefit of our prior year royalty settlement. 
 Adjusted diluted EPS grew 17% operationally for the quarter. 
 Capital expenditures in the first quarter were $140 million. 
 In the quarter, we repurchased $339 million of Zoetis shares. 
 Before moving to guidance, I wanted to comment on our recent announcement to divest our medicated food additive portfolio and certain water-soluble products to Phibro Animal Health. This is a transaction that demonstrates Zoetis' disciplined capital allocation strategy to focus our investments on innovative solutions that advance animal health, productivity and sustainability. This divestiture will allow us to remain focused on other livestock solutions, including vaccine, biologic and genetic programs that are more aligned with our strategic priorities. 
 Now moving on to guidance for full year 2024. As we have mentioned, we had an outstanding first quarter that highlighted our ability to deliver through multiple sources of growth. Our performance in companion animal, especially in parasiticides and our key dermatology franchises, exceeded our expectations. Additionally, we continue to be pleased with the progress of the U.S. launch of Librela and are confident in our ability to meet expectations. 
 We are, therefore, raising our 2024 operational guidance provided during February's earnings call. Note that guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late April. The updated foreign exchange rates negatively impacted our reported revenue guidance by approximately 2% and our reported adjusted net income guidance by approximately 4% when compared to our initial guidance issued in February. 
 For the year, we expect revenue between $9.05 billion and $9.20 billion, representing a range of 8.5% to 10.5% operational growth. Our increase in operational growth is reflective of Argentina's pricing impact as well as due to performance in our companion animal parasiticides and key dermatology products. 
 We now expect our full year operational growth for Simparica Trio to be double digit while we expect growth in our key dermatology products to be in the high single-digit range. 
 As we stated earlier, we remain pleased with our U.S. launch of Librela. Our expectations for Librela for the year remain unchanged. 
 Moving down the P&L. we now expect adjusted net income to be in the range of $2.62 billion to $2.67 billion, representing operational growth of 13% to 15%. 
 And finally, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.71 to $5.81 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.34 to $5.44. 
 Just to summarize before we go to Q&A, we are very pleased with our start to the year. While our reported results are reflective of various foreign exchange-related headwinds, operationally, we continued to deliver growth across our key therapeutic areas and across most of our major markets. This growth highlights the diversity and dependability that allows us to continually outpace the animal health market. Additionally, we continue to lead the way, creating new markets and launching new innovation that increases the standard of medical care for animals. 
 Now I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator? 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] With that, we will take our first question. It's coming from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. 
Michael Ryskin: Great. First, I want to ask just about the guide change. It seems like there's just so many moving pieces right now: the FX moves, you've got all the price you're taking in Argentina, some of the stocking comments for Apoquel Chewable, and obviously, Librela. Just this early in the year to decide to raise the guide, just sort of like what went into that? And what do you see as the upside risks or downside risks to that as you go through the year? 
 And then just a quick follow-up question, and I'll squeeze both in. My question is on margin. With all the price, with all the strength in companion, gross margin was still a little bit weaker in the quarter and you're not raising EPS operationally for the year. So just what's going on with the gross margin and why isn't the flow-through for the companion animal portfolio better? 
Wetteny Joseph: I'll be happy to take this, Mike. Look, we're very pleased with an outstanding quarter to start the year, clearly delivering 12% operational growth at revenue; 15% at adjusted net income from an operational perspective. Couldn't be more pleased with this. 
 In terms of the guidance, of course, there are puts and takes, as you laid out. The performance in the quarter, when we think about the prior year comps, we think these are largely offsetting puts and takes that go into the performance. And I think that feeds into the later part of your question, which is how do we decide to go into increasing our guidance from an operational perspective. 
 But when you look at the puts and takes, clearly the performance from our Trio and key derm, seeing growth as we continue to ramp the launch of Librela not only in the U.S., but across International markets gave us a lot of confidence in terms of underpinning the growth that you saw in the quarter from an operational perspective. 
 Yes, there are some easier comps when you look at the companion animal business, particularly in the U.S. We talked about those at length last year with the destocking and the timing of promotional activity, et cetera. But we also had some headwinds where we had strong comps across livestock, in particular, because of the timing of supply last year as well as the China market that we've been talking about we expected, as well in Argentina given the pricing impacts, et cetera, and then Australia and New Zealand. 
 So when we take a look at those, we think there's probably 1 to 2 points of tailwind on a net basis is what we would estimate coming into the quarter. But then when you look at the bottom line, 15% operational growth in adjusted net income despite the royalty settlement that we had last year, again, is an offsetting element so we still end up with a sort of an operational growth that's in the same range that we've delivered. 
 And so though it's still early in the year, we have confidence in the underlying market and demand that we see across our products. We're seeing increased periodic visits into the clinic for dermatology. Trio, despite head-to-head competition, had a phenomenal quarter, up 61% with $243 million of revenue with the U.S. leading that at 61% as well. 
 So when we take all those into consideration -- and we're seeing price realization across the globe, including increased price from a hyperinflationary market like Argentina, so these gave us enough confidence to be able to raise the guidance and still be very confident in delivering the revised guidance that we did today. 
 Now in terms of margins, let me just make sure I give you -- cover that. If you look at the headline, right, the gross margins are down about 10 basis points. FX had about nearly 200 basis point headwind in this. I think it's important to remind everyone there was a significant devaluation in Argentina that occurred 2 times last year, right? In December as well as prior to that in August. 
 The December devaluation is actually in our first quarter. Keep in mind, our International operations close their books a month earlier. So December is actually Q1. So you're seeing the impact of that Argentina devaluation play out, particularly as you look at inventories and the effects on COGS, cost of goods sold, as well as lower in the P&L. 
 And so when you factor those out, we actually had about a 200 basis point expansion operationally in our gross margins, which again aided our way into the expansion of adjusted net income and growing that at 15%. 
Operator: And our next question comes from Jon Block with Stifel. 
Jonathan Block: I guess I'll ask both upfront as well. Wetteny, I'm getting a lot of questions on Argentina, so hope this is clear. The strength of the top line was big. You raised the guide revenue by 150 bps for the year. You mentioned 200 bps of year-over-year growth in the quarter from Argentina, if I have that right. 
 But what is the incremental growth contribution from Argentina for the year? I do think everyone is like trying to figure out what the raise is, call it, like ex Argentina due to that market's hyperinflationary environment. I hope that's clear. Let me know if it's not. 
 And then maybe just to shift gears, Kristin, on Librela, very helpful comments on the April run rate. And [ I'll recheck ], we hear about a safe drug that might have some issues in dogs with neurological issues and so just would love your thoughts on that. And does the company plan to do any, call it, follow-up studies maybe addressing select AEs, that would be great. 
Wetteny Joseph: I'll take the Argentina question first and then Kristin will cover Librela. Look, the way I look at it, as we said in the prepared commentary and you quoted here, there's a 200 basis point contribution to the top line from Argentina in the quarter. And so if I were to say, look, we're still early in the year and we'll continue to look to take price in that market. And we'll have to watch how that plays out between price and volume as we go. It's a hyperinflationary market. We're pegging what we're looking at based on the actuals and what we anticipate. But again, it's still early in the year. 
 So if you were to take this 200 basis points and you spread them for the year, in effect, you could say there's 50 basis points contribution to the year, if I don't account for any more price from here on, right? And so that's kind of how you look at it. And you'd say, well, the other 100 basis points in the raise is from the rest of the underlying business. The answer is somewhere between there, right? But certainly, contribution from the growth we're seeing, which we said is above our expectations for our derm franchise delivering $360 million, growing 25% on the quarter, as well as Trio, which continues to perform really well for us. 
 And so those, I would say, are significant contributors to the top line guide that we gave. So we're increasing the top line by 150 basis points in terms of the range of operational growth. And Argentina is a piece of that, but I would say there is a significant contribution from the underlying business as well. 
Kristin Peck: Sure, Jon. And I'll take the second part of your question on Librela. I mean, first, I really want to underscore that we have the utmost confidence in the safety and efficacy of Librela. It has been used for over 3 years across the globe in over 14 million dogs and it's approved in over 50 countries. And if you overall look at the rate of reported adverse events, it's about 18% per 10,000 or 0.18% globally. And I think it's important to keep in mind that no single adverse event is classified under the EMEA guidelines as more than rare, which is more than 1 to 10 out of 10,000. 
 So we remain very confident in the safety and efficacy of this product. We watch these reported adverse events very carefully. It's an important part of what every pharmaceutical company does to make sure that we understand any trends that we're seeing. We remain very confident in the data. 
 I really want to underscore, they've been on the market for 3 years. So we continue to watch the AEs that are coming in. And to be clear, the top adverse events today are, number one, lack of efficacy, so it's not working maybe as well as they wanted; polydipsia, which is frequent drinking; and the third being polyuria, which is frequent urination. So the other ones you're talking about remain a rare side effect. In other words, not more than 1 in 10,000. So hopefully, that answers your question. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. 
Erin Wilson Wright: Great. Just another one on Librela, just given the stellar trends that you were mentioning, how do we think about the quarterly progression from here in the second quarter. And then also just like new patient starts, like how has that looked since kind of the media attention. 
 And then on livestock and just a broader rationalization kind of the business with the selling of the feed additives business, which made sense. Do you see other opportunities to further prune the portfolio and presumably this lifts your long-term top line growth targets and margin profile just on the improved mix alone and the focus you can have on these higher-growth, higher-margin businesses. What does Zoetis look like in 3 to 5 years down the road because it could be potentially more skewed to that? And how do you think about that? 
Kristin Peck: Sure. I'll let -- Wetteny, why don't you start with Librela performance and the questions you got there and then I can take the livestock question after that. Wetteny? 
Wetteny Joseph: Yes, I'd be happy to. Look, we delivered $100 million of revenue in Q1 on Librela. That's 189% growth over the prior year. Clearly, the U.S. contributing $40 million is a big part of that. But we're very pleased with the performance across our International markets as well for Librela. And we saw a really strong sequential quarter growth across our International markets, and we continue to see the uptake. 
 We're very pleased as well, when surveyed, European vet clinics actually indicating that now they're seeing more than 50% of the cases being moderate cases, which is very encouraging, as we continue to progress the product having been out there for 3 years. 
 In terms of the progression for the year, clearly, we continue to ramp in the U.S. And as Kristin said and we said in the prepared commentary, as we look at -- on a rolling 4-week basis through the quarter and beyond the quarter into April, we continue to see steadily increasing orders of Librela as well, which again caused us to be able to be confident in our expectations for Librela as we look at the guidance that we gave as well. We're not going to get into very specific quarter-by-quarter. But I would say, if you look at the $40 million in Q1, there's very little to no stocking in that number. 
 Now we did speak at length in February about the stocking in the initial launch in the fourth quarter. We had about 2.5 months at the end of the year for the product launch and you have to factor holidays as well into that. And we saw a very fast penetration into the 60-plus percent in clinics very quickly, which means that there's a lot more stocking in that. 
 Now we give you a range of somewhere between 1/4 and 1/3 of that being stocking, I would say it's likely in the high end of that range. So when you factor that into the $40 million this year, this is a really substantial sequential growth in Librela, and as we said, we continue to see momentum in the product. 
 The one thing I would remind everyone is in International, we did have a number of markets that we launched in the second quarter last year. So we'll be lapping those across the international markets. Those included Canada, Brazil, Australia, Japan and so we'll be lapping those. But we still continue to expect to see strong meaningful growth for the product as well as sequential growth as we go through the rest of the year is what I would remind you in terms of how we expect progression for Librela. 
Kristin Peck: Sure. And Erin, I'll take your second question on livestock. As you and I have talked about many times, livestock generally historically in our industry has grown at around 2% to 4%. I know we grew less for a period of time when we were facing the LOE on DRAXXIN and with some [ large ] disease outbreak across the globe. 
 But I think you're seeing is Zoetis over the last year and going into this year is we're turning more to those historic levels. I think as you look at this year, we expect to be above that level. Again, as Wetteny mentioned, Q1 is not a good indication if you look at sort of the comparable that we had there. So we remain very confident again in livestock. We believe we'll end at the higher end of that range. 
 As you look at the divestiture of our medicated feed additive and water-soluble portfolio and assets, we've continued to be disciplined around our capital allocation. We divested our Pumpkin Pet care last year. This is something that, as a leadership team, we continue to do. We look at every asset we have. We want to make sure that we're investing in the highest areas of growth. So I think that actually is something that's just a rigorous part of how we manage the company. 
 And I think as you look at livestock, obviously, the divestiture of the medicated feed additives portfolio will increase the overall growth of the company and the overall growth of livestock and also help overall on margins. But our real focus of the divestiture really had to do with doubling down and investing in what we see are great potential in the livestock industry and really playing to what are our core strength in preventatives, into antibiotic alternatives, into genetics as we think about vaccines and biologics and new genetic solutions. 
 So again, we'll continue to look at our portfolio, as we always have and as we've done every year, but remain confident in livestock and -- especially this year in our ability to grow faster than the market. 
Operator: Our next question is coming from David Westenberg with Piper Sandler. 
David Westenberg: Congrats on the quarter. So you gave a lot of commentary on April and Librela sales, and it sounds like there's week-on-week build. Just to confirm that is in [ fact ] clinic administration or end market that you're looking at versus like stocking or sales out from you. 
 Veterinarians are really behind the product. It seems like there is some consumer social media kind of stuff. I just want to confirm that the DT sales advertising is on track or if there's any kind of changes there? 
 And then just finally, if I could squeeze in just one more. In terms of your assumptions on that high single-digit in derm, what is the assumption in terms of competitive launch there? 
Wetteny Joseph: Yes, David. Look, I'll take a stab at this and then Kristin may add some. First of all, when you look at Librela sales in the U.S., keep in mind, Librela is sold direct to clinics and the turnaround is very fast. And so there's no sort of channel dynamics to play out in terms of what we're seeing. What we're seeing from week to week is actually coming directly from what the clinics are ordering. 
 And then look, DTC continues to be on track. As we said in our prepared commentary, part of the increase you see in our SG&A spend is really advertising and promotion behind our pain franchise, and clearly, Librela in the U.S. is a big part of that. 
 And then when you think about derm, of course, very pleased with our performance here, $360 million, up 25%. Now there is some soft comp in that. But when we neutralize for that, we still see really, really strong underlying growth and strong demand. And we continue to be able to take price across derm. 
 Now of course, it's still early in the year. So as we look at, particularly in the back half, we are factoring different scenarios around what's the timing of competition. And while we remain confident in our ability to continue to grow our franchises post competition, as we're doing in Trio, there can be some near-term or short-term promotional activity that we are mindful, right? So we do factor those into our thinking in terms of how we land at the high single-digit range, which is up from what we said last time, which was mid- to high single digit. So clearly, our confidence continues to increase there. 
Operator: And our next question is coming from Balaji Prasad with Barclays. 
 Okay. We will take our next question from Brandon Vazquez with William Blair. 
Brandon Vazquez: First, on Librela, I'll ask two upfront here. On Librela, can you guys talk about are you starting to see any pockets of that going from maybe the more severe OA dogs and being used in the moderate OA population? Anything you guys can do to kind of help push that market development because that seems to be the bigger opportunity as you -- as this grows over the coming years. 
 Follow-up, second question is you're spending over $600 million in R&D now. I think we're about a year out from the nice Investor Day you guys held for us last year. Any meaningful updates in the pipeline that you guys can share with us, either new products or life cycle innovation, that might be coming in the near to medium term? 
Kristin Peck: Sure. Wetteny, do you want to take the first one on Librela and I can take the R&D question? 
Wetteny Joseph: Yes. I'd be happy to. Look, we continue to be very pleased with the performance of Librela, as we said, both the U.S. and International. We did complete a recent survey of vet clinics across European markets. And after 3 years in the market, we are certainly seeing the transition to having a lot more moderate cases. In fact, vets, based on surveys, are saying more than 50% of the cases they're seeing now are moderate and even some mild cases coming into the mix. So that's very encouraging. 
 And again, and that also contributed to an increase in months on therapy going somewhere between 7 and 8 months now is what we're estimating based on those surveys with vets. So that progression is what we count on and anticipate, and we're seeing that across International markets. 
 We're still very early in the U.S. But that's the sort of progression we would expect. And we'll continue to educate vets on the product, as we've talked about, to continue to drive that as we move forward. Kristin? 
Kristin Peck: Sure. And Brandon, to your second question on our R&D. Yes, you probably saw the strong growth in R&D in the quarter that is really because we remain very confident in our pipeline in many of the key areas that we mentioned at Investor Day, which was, I guess, a little less than a year ago, really investing behind some of the key therapeutic areas, both our long-lasting monoclonal antibodies, which will be some of the more near-term launches. We are not making any announcements on today's call, obviously, with regards to that. But that's going to be some of the more near-term launches. 
 And then as we talked about, very excited as you look at renal, as you look at oncology and cardiovascular and diagnostics to continue to invest in those areas where we see huge potential. As you look at renal, cardiology, in oncology, we always said, as we said last year, those are more in the 4 years-plus range. So there's no near-term updates there. 
 But we continue to launch products. As you look at -- as I spoke in my script about on Bonqat, which is around anxiety for cats, that's really important. It may not seem a huge product overall, but it's an unlock for the rest of our portfolio. If we can get cats to the clinic, we can sell more -- a lot of our other products, and more importantly, meet the needs of the cat population, which to date has very under-medicalized. 
 So I know we don't give you all the visibility that you're dying for in R&D. But I think as you can see, we've continued to deliver on our pipeline and both in really innovative products, like what you're seeing Librela and Solensia, but also life cycle innovations that will really extend the life of important franchises such as some of our long-acting monoclonal antibodies, which should be more in the near term. 
Operator: Our next question is coming from Steve Scala with TD Cowen. 
Christopher LoBianco: This is Chris on for Steve Scala. We had two questions. First, on livestock, are you seeing any impacts on ongoing outbreak of H5N1 avian influenza? 
 And then second on the U.S. companion animal market, what underlying trends are you seeing in U.S. pet adoption and abandonment rate? And are you seeing any change in share of wallet, share of consumer pet spend on medicines versus other product categories? 
Kristin Peck: Thanks, Steve (sic) [ Chris ]. I'll try to take those, and Wetteny, certainly, if there's anything I missed, you can jump in. Look, we, like all of you, are continuing to watch the outbreak of H5N1. If you look at the portfolio that we have and our capabilities, we stand ready to support both governments and customers across the globe as they look at potential solutions to address H5N1, both on the vaccine side and on the diagnostics side. 
 To date, we have not been requested to do that. But I think like many of our peer companies, we stand ready to support government authorities when that's needed. I do want to reassure people, I mean, data has come out that the milk is safe. Data came out from [ FISS ] this morning reassuring people that the meat base is safe. So we have not seen any impact to our business whatsoever with regards to this. 
 This is a major issue for our customers. And our real focus is supporting them through this and making sure that we focus on what we can do certainly around biosecurity surveillance and detection, which we're more and more engaged with the U.S. FDA and others, given our diagnostics portfolio as well. So no, we have not seen any impacts to our business to date on that. 
 Regards to the U.S. and looking at -- we have not seen a significant U.S. national increase in people bringing their pets back to shelters. I know there's been some isolated here and there, but as the overall U.S., that is not a trend. And those pets that they all adopted during COVID are all aging and continue to be drivers of our growth, not just in the U.S. globally. 
 And I know there has been some talk around consumer sentiment and is that really changing. Obviously, we've seen some changes in sort of collars or treats and things like that. But what's really been clear and what we've talked about for a long time is when you think about animal health care, it's essential. They are not skipping on their animal health care. And if you look at the trends in the quarter as you look at increase in [indiscernible] visits, as Wetteny talked about, the reality is when their animal needs care, they are getting that care. And as you look at spend per visit in the U.S., we're seeing spend per visit up 6% in the U.S., which means, again, consumers and pet owners want to take care of their animals and they continue to invest in this. 
 You look at the strength of the human-animal bond, this is another reason that we say animal health is a very resilient industry that people will continue to invest in the health of their pets, and that's certainly what we're seeing in the quarter. And as you saw, our expanded operational guidance for the year really being driven by our companion animal portfolio is what we expect for the year as well. 
Operator: We'll take our next question from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. 
Nathan Rich: First, just a clarification on Argentina and the price increase. I guess, the price increase you referenced coincide with the December devaluation? It sounds like that price increase wasn't contemplated in the initial operational revenue range for the year. 
 So I guess, like as we think about the impact going forward, I'd imagine that contribution should be similar over the balance of the year, I guess, assuming no major change in the currency dynamics in that market. So is that the correct way to think about it? 
 And then on derm, the company decided to start selling Apoquel Chewable through distribution. Could you maybe just talk about the factors that led to that decision? And any impact on top line and margins for Apoquel as well as the broader portfolio as you think about the potential benefits of selling that portfolio through distribution. 
Wetteny Joseph: I'll take the first one, Nathan, just on Argentina. Look, clearly, the devaluation occurred prior to us issuing guidance and we have plans and continue to see our ability to take price fairly significantly in that market perhaps beyond what we factored in. 
 And so yes, we won't sit here and forecast what FX is going to do or what's going to happen in Argentina. It is a hyperinflationary market after all, so we'll continue to monitor that. And so we're only through one quarter here and we're all on our way through the second quarter, so we're factoring that into our thinking as well. And we are seeing an ability to continue to do that. But we can't sort of forecast, forecast for the rest of the year what will happen there. So we are a bit measured in how we treat that. 
 I would say a portion, again, to what I said earlier, a portion of our increase is certainly coming from that. I would say somewhere between 1/3 to half of the increase we're giving in terms of operational guidance is coming from that because we are getting the operational lift from price there. And the rest of it coming from the rest of the underlying business, as we've talked about, is how I would think about that. 
 In terms of derm, I'll start and then see if Kristin wants to add. Look, clearly, we have products in derm with Apoquel and Cytopoint, they've been in the market for over 10 years and 7 years, respectively. And the level of satisfaction on these products is very high among vets and pet owners. We've launched Apoquel Chewable as an important element because, one, there's a preference from pet owners and perhaps vets to have a palatable chewable. And so we see that as, one meeting, a need in the market as well as an important part of a defense strategy. 
 And so as we anticipate competition in derm, we believe that competition will more likely be a film-coated tablet. And the conversion to Apoquel Chewable is important to us. We are seeing that conversion occur across international markets. In particular, if you look at Europe, we now have about 40% conversion to chewable after being in the market the last couple of years. So that's very encouraging. 
 We just launched in the U.S. at the same time as we launch Librela. And so we want to look to potentially accelerate that transition in that conversion, hence, what went into the thinking here. 
 And so it's still relatively early. There's only a little bit of contribution in the quarter here, perhaps out of the 25% growth you saw in key derm, there might be 2 points coming from that. And so we'll see some more of that occur in the second quarter, but it is an important part of our defense strategy. 
Operator: We will take our next question from Balaji Prasad with Barclays. 
Balaji Prasad: Apologies for missing my spot earlier and also in case my questions are a repeat. So on Librela, curious to understand how has your messaging changed, if at all, with the vets in how they use, how it reacts for dogs that they want to treat and what does this mean for the total addressable market, one. 
 And two, can you help us understand the quarterly cadence for the rest of the year? I think the understanding before was that 1Q was expected to be the weakest quarter and second half stronger than 1H. On the back of this print, does this alter the quarterly cadence in any way? 
Kristin Peck: Sure. I'll take your first question, Balaji, on Librela. And Wetteny, I expect you can take the second one on quarterly cadence. 
 As we think about how we're approaching vets, vets are at the center of care. And our focus has always been around ensuring vets are educated on the product, that they understand it, that they understand how it should be used, when it should be used, et cetera. Certainly, since a lot of the social media, we've been more committed than ever to make sure that vets have better access to a lot of the education we've always been providing. And we've significantly increased our education with vets and their access. 
 So things that we've done. We've done over 1,000 webinars. We have daily sessions with our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Richard Goldstein, to make sure they can have interactive sessions. We have an always-on customer support team. 
 And I think, really, what you're seeing with regards to the vets and how they feel about the product is the confidence that they have access to the education that they need. And as you look at that, that is why you're seeing such a strongly positive experience, not just from pets, but from vets who really are confident in the product, as Wetteny mentioned, their confidence in prescribing the product more, their confidence in the safety and efficacy of the product. 
 As we've talked about, we invest a lot in Zoetis in veterinary education, and we always have, and our vet operations in every market. So I think this is something that's been our strength. Clearly, with the social media, we have doubled down to ensure there's more access to this veterinary education to make sure that any vet who wants to understand more has access to experts, both internally as well as external KOLs, so they can best understand the product. 
 And that again underscores our confidence in this product that we've talked about and the fact that we continue to believe this product will be -- this category, not just Librela, but Librela and Solensia, we continue to commit this will be a $1 billion franchise for Zoetis and that is really rooted in the safety and efficacy of this product and in investment we're putting into both vet and pet owners to make sure they understand the product. 
Wetteny Joseph: Yes. And Balaji, in terms of quarterly cadence and I'll answer the question specific with respect to Librela. If you mean it for overall, I can certainly recap that conversation. 
 But look, clearly, $40 million contribution in the first quarter. And keep in mind, we continue to see really strong growth across our international markets, which moved 71% on the quarter as well. So those will continue to drive growth for us. 
 We won't get ultra-specific in terms of the exact contribution as the quarters go, but we would expect to continue to ramp up from that $40 million through the year. And then, of course, the fourth quarter in terms of percentage growth, we'll be lapping the $44 million that we delivered in the fourth quarter and the first quarter of launch. 
Operator: We'll take our next question from Glen Santangelo with Jefferies. 
Glen Santangelo: Hey, Kristin, obviously, the outlook for Trio in derm continues to be encouraging here. But just given the recent launch of BI and the Elanco launches that presumably may be coming in the second half, if you could look out to 2025 for a second. I'm kind of curious if you anticipate any sort of noticeable shift in the competitive landscape or anything that you think might impact your ability to take price? 
 And the reason I ask is some are getting concerned about increasing competition and a weakening consumer at the same time maybe would impact the company's ability to take price increases consistent with what you have done historically. So any sort of high-level commentary, I think, would be helpful. 
Kristin Peck: Sure. I'll start and then, Wetteny, you can certainly build on this one. We remain very confident and it's really based on our historical performance, and I think you can look at that, we invest in the local innovation across our franchises. 
 We were #5, let's be clear, guys, in paras when we entered with Simparica and Simparica Trio and we're now #2. We're facing competition from the leader in parasiticide, and we grew our share of 0.7% if you look at Q1 in the U.S. So even with very strong competition, we continue to grow share. So we remain confident we can continue to grow our parasiticides and our dermatology franchises even with competition. 
 I mean, paras has always been a very competitive space with most companies operating there. We think our strength, obviously, with the vets, our strength with pet owners, really seeing tremendous growth in our franchises for both Trio and derm in alternative channels, in home delivery and retail. 
 And we see great strength there as you look at the autoship. We continue to increase autoship out there, which absolutely increases compliance, which we think is really important. As you look at, for example, the alternative channels, they grew 55%. Now that was a little bit of a weaker comp if you look at last year. But even if you adjust for all that, that's 25%-plus growth in the alternative channel. 
 So we really believe that we can continue to grow this franchise based on the strength of our products, the strength of our portfolio, our life cycle innovation if you look at what we're doing with Chewable, as well as leveraging some of these new channels, which have the benefit of increased compliance. 
 So back again, it's our confidence not just for '24, but for '25. I don't know, Wetteny, if you want to add anything on that. 
Wetteny Joseph: Look, the only thing I would say is two things. One, we are not seeing a weakening consumer. You saw us post high double-digit growth across Trio and our key derm franchise. And even if we normalize for some of the tailwinds from last year, we still have high double-digit growth across each of those. And so that certainly demonstrates continued demand products and our innovation. 
 The other one I would say is, look, as we look ahead and we're not going to give guidance specific to 2025 here, but we're confident in our ability to grow in the face of competition. Now there can be some short-term promotional activity that might have some impact. But beyond those, we're confident in our products and we'll see what the labels are that we're going to compete against. 
Operator: We'll take our next question from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. 
Christopher Schott: Just two questions for me. Just continuing on Trio, can you quantify if there's a channel dynamic benefit you saw here? And just give us a little more color on maybe the size of that. 
 And then the second one was Librela U.S. Should we expect a similar dynamic in the U.S. that we saw ex U.S., where initial uptake is more in the severe OA pets, which I think would be maybe a little bit less sensitive to some of the headlines we've seen over the past month and then the moderate piece of the business is happening kind of a year or 2 or further out? Or is the U.S. market you're thinking different where those severe and moderate may be scaling kind of simultaneously with each other? 
Kristin Peck: Sure. Thanks, Chris. I'll let -- you take, Wetteny, the Trio question. I can follow up on Librela. 
Wetteny Joseph: Yes, absolutely. Look, the short answer is no. There's no channel dynamics that we're seeing here. As I mentioned just a moment ago, we did have dynamics last year in the quarter where you saw destocking coming from promotional -- timing of promotions in the prior year and more prepriced buy-ups. And so that did provide some tailwind here. 
 So we posted 61% growth globally, and that's the same percentage growth in the U.S., $205 million growing 61%. And if you were to say -- there's no precision here, but I would say our internal estimates is that if we factor in the tailwinds from last year, that may account for about half of the growth that we're seeing. 
 So still remaining very significant growth on Trio, and there's no channel dynamics in terms of inventories to speak of in the current year. 
Kristin Peck: Sure. And on your second question with regards to Librela in the U.S., I mean, what we have seen historically in Europe and in markets that launched first is it is often put into the severe dogs who are desperate for a new therapy initially and moving to the moderate. 
 But we've learned that lesson after 3 years in Europe. And so we're making sure as we launch in the U.S. that we get into that moderate. As you think about the early Experience Trial, for example, that we did in the U.S., we made sure there was a balance of mild, moderate and more severe cases so that they have experience and they can see the impact of the product in that. 
 As you even look at some of the data that Wetteny spoke about earlier, which is we have more than 50% of -- outside of the U.S. of patients right now in moderate -- mild to moderate cases, which I think is tremendous growth. And what you're seeing when you do that is also an increase in compliance. So compliance is now between 7 and 8 months, up from 6 to 7 months outside the U.S. 
 So our goal as we were launching in the U.S. as we designed the early Experience Trial and as we market with vets is to make sure that this is a product that can be a first-line therapy for mild, moderate and severe cases and making sure that we can get that conversion into mild and moderate, similar to where we are in Europe, faster in the U.S. So that is certainly our focus as we think about growing that brand in the U.S. 
Operator: We'll take our final question from Navann Ty with BNP. 
Navann Ty Dietschi: Thanks for the color on Librela. I have some follow-ups. What is the early effect from the vet from your online education sessions? And how many of vets approximately did you reach out to so far? Also interested in your early dialogue with the FDA, if any? Is that just a common surveillance after a product launch so far? 
Kristin Peck: Sure. Thank you. With regards to your first question on the vets we've reached out to, we've reached out to through our tech bulletins with letters directly from our Chief Medical Officer almost every vet in the U.S. -- any vet who's a customer of ours in the U.S. We think that, that's really critical. 
 Any of those vets can join, for example, our open office hours with our Chief Medical Officer, Richard Goldstein. We've invited vets to these webinars and really working with our veterinary operations group in every area across the U.S. to make sure they have access not just to internal and external. So thousands of vets have attended these webinars to date. 
 Again, this is something we normally do. Obviously, we put it -- it's had more urgency to make sure that we have more ways to engage with them, to make sure that the veterinarian's questions are answered. 
 And as I think as you look at the fact that our 4-week trailing sales continue to accelerate, as Wetteny mentioned, is demonstration that vets still are getting the education they need to confidently prescribe this product appropriately there. 
 And with regards to the questions with regards to our interactions with the FDA. As you know from covering us, those are regular conversations we have with the FDA all the time. That's a normal course of business for any company as you launch a new brand, as you expand that and sharing the information in the U.S. and having a dialogue around that, sharing the global information with them. So that's a usual course of what we would do as we launch a product, and honestly, even when the product's on the market for years. 
 So we continue to be a usual course and collaborate with the FDA to make sure that they have all the information they need there. So there's nothing out of the ordinary there in the normal engagement with the FDA. 
Operator: And there are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call to the speakers for any closing remarks. 
Kristin Peck: Thank you. Look -- sorry, back to me. Thank you. Look, I really want to thank everyone for joining today. I want to reiterate that this was an outstanding performance this quarter. I really want to thank our colleagues for their commitment. And hopefully, you see our focus on creating shareholder value. I think it's a strong start as we look forward to continued momentum in 2024. 
 We are customer obsessed from unrivaled R&D investment to expanded manufacturing capabilities to a world-class, purpose-driven colleagues. Everything that we do at Zoetis is aimed at anticipating and addressing what we believe are the most pressing needs in veterinary care even before they're widely recognized by many others. And our scientific breakthroughs have firmly established us as a trusted and preferred partner to our customers. And we will continue to invest in the talent, the pipeline and the capabilities that will support Zoetis' future growth. 
 So we remain committed to the safety and efficacy of our products and of our industry-leading products because our treatments change lives. Based on our track record of performance, I think our customers agree as well. So thanks so much for joining us. We look forward to engaging throughout the quarter. 
Operator: Thank you. And this does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.

===== 2023 Q4  (2024-02-14 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Fourth Quarter and Full-year 2023 Financial Results Conference Call and Webcast for Zoetis. Hosting the call today is Steve Frank, Vice President of Investor Relations for Zoetis. The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, and will not be forwarded automatically. In addition, a replay of this call will be made available approximately two hours after the conclusion of the call via dial-in or on our Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. [Operator Instructions]. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.
Steve Frank: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Zoetis fourth quarter and full-year 2023 earnings call. I am joined today by Kristin Peck, our Chief Executive Officer; and Wetteny Joseph, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website, and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements, and that actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statements in today's press release and our SEC filings, including, but not limited to, our annual report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q. Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and the company's 8-K filing dated today, Tuesday, February 13, 2024. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. With that, I will turn the call over to Kristin.
Kristin Peck: Thank you, Steve and welcome, everyone, to our fourth quarter and full-year 2023 earnings call. Today, we reported strong full-year results driven by the success of our diverse portfolio across markets and species, game-changing innovation, and the outstanding commitment of our purpose-driven colleagues. We delivered 7% operational revenue growth, growing faster than the industry, propelled by steady demand for innovative products that enable our customers and the animals they care for to thrive. With the ongoing momentum of our monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis or OA pain, we saw segment growth of 6% of the US and 9% operational growth internationally. Our companion animal portfolio remains a key growth driver, up 8% operationally, and we saw a return to growth for our livestock portfolio, up 6% operationally. While we continue to operate in an environment of global uncertainty, our diversity across markets, species, and therapeutic areas, has sustained our performance, further demonstrating that animal health is a durable, essential, and growing industry. Our track record of innovation, from pioneering breakthroughs to product lifecycle enhancements, has solidified our position as the industry leader, consistently growing above the market and enables us to create market-leading franchises. We don't just follow trends, we make markets.  The launch of Librela and Solensia, the first two injectable monoclonal antibodies for the alleviation of osteoarthritis, is fundamentally improving the quality of life for dogs and cats, and strengthening the human-animal bond. That's why today Librela remains the number one selling OA pain product in Europe. At Investor Day last May, and again at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference, I shared that our own pain franchise could have peak sales exceeding $1 billion, and we are excited about Librela's performance since its US launch in October, which reaffirms that view. Due to high clinic penetration, we've activated our direct-to-consumer or DTC efforts faster than any other product in our history, which we expect to provide a tailwind for commercial growth. Similarly, Solensia has also been well received, with strong clinic penetration around the world, with increased opportunity as we generate more awareness of OA pain in cats.  Within our dermatology franchise, we've established ourselves as the trusted partner to veterinarians, and after nearly a decade of impressive growth, we still believe we have room to expand this market. Increasing pet owner's awareness that itch is a medical condition that requires treatment, improved compliance, and the opportunity to address even more unmet needs, underpins our optimism. We remain confident that we can sustain growth thanks to our differentiated products like Cytopoint and Apoquel chewable, the first and only chewable treatment for the control of allergic itch and inflammation in dogs. Our parasiticides portfolio, and particularly Simparica Trio, remains a key growth driver, even in the face of increasing competition. This continued success highlights our strategic execution, label strength, and the efficacy of our products. The performance across our key product franchises not only reinforces our market-leading position, but also better innovation consistently meet the evolving demands in veterinary medicine.  As we begin in 2024, we will stay disciplined and adaptable to the evolving macroeconomic and geopolitical backdrop around the world, and focus on executing our plans and continuing to grow faster than the market. Two durable global trends give us confidence in that future growth, the powerful human-animal bond, and the world's growing need for a sustainable supply of animal protein. Our commitment to operational excellence ensures we are ready to scale to meet those demands and navigate unforeseen challenges, while delivering shareholder value. Looking ahead, we are committed to our track record of value creation and above-market performance. Our dedication to innovation remains the cornerstone of our market-leading position. We've consistently demonstrated agility, outpacing the market to bring groundbreaking solutions that meet and exceed customer expectations. We will continue to leverage that advantage and we're guiding to a range of 7% to 9% operational revenue growth in 2024, and adjusted net income growth in the range of 9% to 11% operationally, which reflects our ongoing investments in R&D, supply chains, and commercial excellence, to cultivate new markets, drive growth, and create value. As you've heard me say time and time again, we are confident in our strategy, portfolio, pipeline, and capabilities to deliver value to shareholders and customers, while performing above the market. Our focus positions us well to navigate potential challenges and capitalize on emerging opportunities.  In closing, we'll continue our relentless pursuit to exceed customer expectations and invest in advancing the capabilities that differentiate Zoetis. As we look to 2024, I could not be more excited about our future. Our key growth drivers will continue to showcase our commitment to nurturing the world and humankind by advancing care for animals, and our ongoing innovations will expand the market, reaffirm our best-in-class product portfolio, and defend our position amid competition. I want to reiterate the four tenets of our value proposition discussed on Investor Day. We will grow revenue faster than the market. We will invest in innovation and growth capabilities. We commit to growing adjusted net income faster than revenue, and we'll return excess capital to shareholders. While there is need and demand to improve the quality of life for animals, Zoetis will continue leading the way and setting the standard for performance and growth. This is core to our vision, to be the most trusted and valued animal health company, shaping the future of animal care through innovation, customer obsession, and purpose-driven colleagues.  Thank you. Now, let me hand it over to Wetteny. Wetteny?
Wetteny Joseph: Thank you, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. As Kristin mentioned, we had a strong year in 2023, with revenue of $8.5 billion and adjusted net income of $2.5 billion. Our full-year revenue was near the top end of our guidance range, while our adjusted net income was slightly below our guidance range, primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange, as well as an impairment charge related to a prior acquisition. Our revenue growth was broad, with strong growth across both our US and international segments, both our companion animal and livestock portfolios, and due to both price and volume. Full-year revenue grew 6% on a reported basis and 7% operationally, with adjusted net income anchoring 7% on both a reported and operational basis. Of the 7% operational revenue growth, 5% is from price and 2% is from volume. Volume growth was driven primarily by new products, including our monoclonal antibodies for OA pain, Librela, and Solensia, as well as our key dermatology products and Simparica Trio.  On a segment basis, our US business posted $4.6 billion in revenue, growing 6% on the year, while our international segment reported revenue of $3.9 billion, with operational growth of 9% on the full year. Additionally, while China represents less than 5% of our global revenues, the ongoing economic weakness there continues to impact our business, and represented a half a percentage point drag on our total company operational revenue growth for the year, entirely in volume. Our full-year growth was driven by continued demand for our innovative companion animal portfolio, which grew 8% operationally. Our livestock portfolio also had a strong year, with operational growth of 6%. Performance in companion animal was led by OA pain mAbs, which posted $321 million in global revenue for the year. Growth came from first wave European markets, as well as from the impact of new launch markets in 2023, including the US. We continue to see penetration of our pain mAbs grow within vet clinics, and a high level of satisfaction amongst both vets and pet owners.  Our key dermatology products generated $1.4 billion in sales globally, posting strong growth of 8% for the year on an operational basis. Simparica Trio contributed global revenue of $813 million in 2023, representing growth of 9% operationally, despite distributor inventory headwinds in Q1 and aggressive competitive promotions for much of the year. Our companion animal diagnostics portfolio recorded $356 million in revenue and grew 7% operational, with growth contributions from both the US and international. Our livestock portfolio had a strong year, with 6% operational revenue growth, driven by both price and volume. Moving on to our Q4 financial results, which was another strong quarter. We closed Q4 with revenue of $2.2 billion, representing an increase of 8% on both a reported and operational basis, posting our third consecutive quarter of at least 8% operational revenue growth despite a tough comparative, particularly in US companion animal. Adjusted net income of $569 million is an increase of 6% on both a reported and an operational basis. Of the 8% operational revenue growth, 6% is from price and 2% is on volume. Volume growth consisted of 4% growth from new products and a 2% decline in our inline products. Volume from our key dermatology products was flat in the quarter. On a segment basis, our US business posted $1.2 billion in revenue, growing 9% on the quarter, while our international segment reported revenue of $982 million, with operational growth of 8% on the quarter. Our companion animal portfolio was the main driver of revenue growth in the quarter, growing 10% operationally. Livestock also contributed, with operational growth of 6%. We saw double-digit companion animal growth in both our US and our international segments, driven by our innovative products. Our OA pain mAbs were the primary driver of growth, posting $124 million in combined revenue in the quarter. Global growth came primarily from the impact of new launch markets, bolstered by the Q4 full launch of Librela in the US. Simparica Trio generated $208 million globally in the quarter, representing growth of 21% operationally. Price was the primary driver of growth in the quarter, followed by volume growth, driven by expanded DTC advertising support globally, as well as from increased field force focus. Our key dermatology products generated $375 million in sales globally, posting growth of 7% on an operational basis. Our companion animal diagnostics portfolio recorded revenue of $87 million and grew 8% operationally, with growth contributions from both the US and international. Our livestock products ended the year on a strong note, with growth of 6% operationally, growing in both our US and international segments. Growth was driven equally by price, which grew despite headwinds from drags in price decreases, as well as by volume, with growth in Synovex from our expanded label claims. Now, moving on to revenue growth by segment for the quarter. US revenue was $1.2 billion in the quarter, growing 9%, with companion animal sales growing 10%, and livestock sales growing 4%. Companion animal again posted double-digit growth in the quarter, bolstered by the full launch of Librela at the start of the quarter, all while facing a tough comparative quarter with promotional activity and heavier than normal pre-price buying at the end of last year. In the US, vet clinic visits were flat on the quarter and flat for the year, while we continue to see solid clinical revenue and revenue per visit, growth of 6% for the quarter and 7.5% for the year. Our US companion animal revenue growth continues to outpace veterinary clinic revenue growth due in part to our innovative therapeutics, as well as our strong presence in the retail channel.  Moving on to product performance, growth in the US was driven by our pain mAbs, Simparica Trio, and our key dermatology portfolio. Our combined pain mAbs posted $58 million in US sales in Q4. We moved to a full launch of Librela in the US early in the fourth quarter, and we have been pleased with the results our field force has been able to drive thus far. Librela posted $44 million in US sales in the quarter, which is at the higher end of our initial expectations. It's important to note that while we are not leveraging distribution for our pain mAbs, there's a significant clinic stocking impact in the first few months after launch. We have seen higher than expected penetration and reorder rates through the end of the year, as well as rapid patient share growth in the canine pain category. Solensia had sales of $14 million in Q4 in the US. We have seen a marked increase in feline vet visits and feline revenue growth in the clinic. In the US, feline OA patients are up 23% for 2023. Simparica Trio posted US sales of $185 million in the quarter, growing 17%. Growth was driven primarily by price as we were in promotions in Q4 of 2022 following our Q3 2022 supply challenges, and in advance of a then expected competitor launch in early 2023. In our second quarter, with competition in the triple combination space, we continue to see patient share growth in Simparica Trio. We remain confident in our ability to compete and grow in this space through the strength of our label, retail channel presence, strong corporate and specialty relationships, and the significant advantage of being first to market. (Indiscernible) dermatology product sales in the US were $252 million in the quarter, growing 6%. Cytopoint sales continue to drive growth through both price and volume, with vet and pet owners referring its injectable method of administration. (Operational) franchise growth is driven by better net price realization on lower volume due to promotional activity at the end of last year. Our US companion animal diagnostics portfolio posted growth of 9% in the quarter. US livestock grew 4% in the quarter, primarily driven by growth in poultry as a result of favorable rotations back to certain medicated feed additives and the extended use of Zoamix, as well as share gain due to competitor supply constraints. Sales of both swine and cattle products increased in the quarter, primarily as a result of increased supply of vaccines that were limited in the same quarter of the prior year.  Moving on to our international segment where revenue in the quarter grew 9% on a reported basis and 8%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. International companion animal grew 10% operationally, and livestock grew 7% operationally. China represented a 3% drag on our international segment operational revenue growth in the quarter. Higher sales in companion animal products was led by our pain mAbs, our key dermatology products, and our small animal parasiticides portfolio. Growth in our OA pain products was equally driven by sales force focus and DTC awareness campaigns in early launching European markets, as well as continued uptake in markets launched earlier this year. Librela sales were $53 million internationally or 93% operational growth in the quarter. Solensia sales were $13 million internationally in the quarter, growing 77% operationally. Our international key dermatology portfolio contributed $123 million in revenue, posting growth of 10% in the quarter on an operational basis. We continue to see benefit to Apoquel from our DTC awareness campaigns across several international markets and conversion to Apoquel chewable has been positive. Growth in Cytopoint continues to benefit from higher rates of conversion from Apoquel and overall market growth. Our international small animal parasiticides portfolio grew 4% operationally, driven by our Simparica franchise, with Simparica posting $48 million in revenue and growing 32% on an operational basis in the quarter, driven primarily by price, a strong parasiticide season, and demand generation in emerging markets. Simparica Trio contributed $23 million internationally, growing 72% operationally, driven by high peak season sales in Australia and continued uptake in Europe, driven by key account penetration and field force effectiveness. This growth was partially offset by a 33% operational decline in our Revolution franchise, which generates a high proportion of sales in China where we had a tough comparative quarter due to the return of supply in Q4 of 2022, as well as the ongoing impact of the current economic conditions. Continuing on to international livestock, which was 7% operationally, driven primarily by price increases in all species, especially in high inflationary markets. Our poultry portfolio also benefited from favorable MFA rotations in certain markets. China had an unfavorable impact on our international livestock sales in the quarter, particularly in our swine portfolio. Now, moving on to the rest of the P&L, for the quarter adjusted gross margins of 67.1% decreased 100 basis points on a reported basis compared to the prior year. On an operational basis, adjusted gross margins decreased by 20 basis points, resulting primarily from higher manufacturing costs, which were partially offset by price increases and lower freight costs. Adjusted operating expenses increased 11% operationally, driven primarily by higher SG&A expenses, which grew 10% operationally, primarily due to higher competition-related expenses, as well as a charitable contribution related to the funding of the Zoetis Foundation. R&D expenses grew 17% on an operational basis, driven by higher compensation-related expenses, as well as portfolio progression of key pipeline projects. Finally, other income and deductions were higher in the quarter due to an impairment charge related to an acquisition. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 18.8%, a decrease of 200 basis points, primarily due to higher net discrete tax benefits in the quarter, a higher benefit in the US related to foreign derived intangible income, and a more favorable jurisdictional mix of earnings. Adjusted net income grew 6% operationally, and adjusted diluted EPS grew 7% operationally for the quarter. Capital expenditures in the fourth quarter were $198 million. For the full year, we had capital expenditures of $732 million. Lastly, we continue to return excess capital to shareholders. For the year, we have returned approximately $1.8 billion to shareholders through a combination of share purchases and dividends. In December, we announced a 15% annual dividend increase, continuing our commitment to grow our dividend at or faster than the growth in adjusted net income.  Now, moving on to our guidance for the full year of 2024. Please note that guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late January. We are expecting foreign exchange to have an unfavorable impact on our growth versus the prior year. At net revenue, we expect foreign exchange to negatively impact our growth by 90 basis points, with the impact being more pronounced early in the year and decreasing later in the year. At adjusted net income, we expect FX to negatively impact our growth by 150 basis points, with significant unfavorable impact in the first half of the year, transitioning to slight favorability in the second half of the year. As a reminder, we do not actively forecast FX, so these estimates assume rates remain where they were as of late January. For 2024, we are projecting revenue between $9.075 billion and $9.225 billion, representing a range of 7% to 9% operational growth, with growth across both price and volume. We expect companion animal to be the primary growth driver in 2024. With the expected impact of the US launch of Librela, we expect to see robust growth from our OA pain mAbs, both in the US and internationally. Our current clinic penetration levels for Librela in the US are exceeding our expectations, and as Kristin mentioned, we have launched our DTC efforts ahead of schedule to drive increased pet owner awareness. Even with the expectation of competitive entrance, we anticipate mid to high single-digit growth in both Simparica Trio and our key dermatology portfolio. For livestock, 2023 exceeded our expectations. Our growth in the year benefited from several tailwinds, including improvements in supply in certain markets, as well as competitive out of stocks. While our outlook for the upcoming year is more optimistic than it was as we entered 2023, we do expect our growth rate to normalize and be in line with livestock industry growth. I'd like to briefly touch upon the key assumptions that underpin our expectations for revenue growth. For companion animal, we are not projecting significant change to the current vet clinic trends. We expect US visits to grow flat to 1%, and expect to see growth in therapeutic visits aided by the impact of our OA pain products. For our companion animal parasiticides, we continue to expect meaningful growth from Simparica Trio. We expect new entrants will help continue to drive the conversion from topicals and collars to triple combination of our parasiticides, a space where we are the market leader. In our key dermatology products, we are prepared for competition and confident in our ability to defend and grow our share through our three differentiated dermatology products, the strength of our customer relationships, and the expertise we have gained from almost 10 years in the space. Lastly, while we are not assuming a change in the current economic situation in China, we do expect a headwind to growth, especially in the first half as the situation worsened over the course of 2023. Now, moving on to the rest of the P&L. Adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue is expected to be approximately 29.5%. We continue to make investments to ensure we can support expected future growth in our portfolio, especially in monoclonal antibodies. These investments are driving short-term margin impacts from lower site utilization. This is offset by price increases and favorable product mix. Adjusted SG&A expenses for the year are expected to be between $2.17 billion and $2.22 billion, with the increase from 2023 focused on supporting primary drivers of revenue growth. Adjusted R&D expenses for 2024 is expected to be between $665 million and $675 million. Spend is driven by the advancement of key pipeline projects, as well as higher compensation-related expenses. Adjusted interest expense and other income and deductions is expected to be approximately $210 million. This is significantly higher than the prior year as our growth here is negatively impacted by the non-recurring royalty settlement income we reflected in Q1 of 2023, as well as the impact of lower interest income. Our adjusted effective tax rate for 2024 is expected to be in the range of 20% to 21%. Adjusted in income is expected to be in the range of $2.65 billion to $2.70 billion, representing operational growth of 9% to 11%. Our guidance once again reflects our value proposition of growing revenue in line with or faster than the market and growing adjusted net income faster than revenue. We expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.74 to $.584, and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.34 to $5.44. And finally, we are anticipating capital expenditures in 2024 to be in the range of $800 million to $850 million. These levels remain elevated compared to historical spend levels as we continue to make investments to support our future growth. To summarize, 2023 was another strong year. Even with distributor inventory headwinds entering the year and a challenging economic environment, especially in China, we again outperformed the market. We continue to grow share even in spaces where we face new competition, and we remain confident in our ability to expand existing markets and create new ones in the future. As we move into 2024, our guidance highlights our ability to again grow faster than the market, driven by our innovative product portfolio and multiple sources of growth, as well as our ability to grow our bottom line faster than our pipeline, while making meaningful investments for the future and returning significant excess capital to our shareholders.  Now, I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Erin Wright: Right. Thanks for taking my questions. So, can you talk a little bit about the reorder rates and feedback and expectations around Librela for 2024 in the US and some of those stocking dynamics that we should think about quarter-to-quarter? And then a bigger picture question just on margins and profitability, and there are some moving factors in 2024, such as FX and the ramp up of Librela that weigh on margins, but can you talk a little bit more about the potential margin leverage that you could see across your business as you expand in some of those faster-growing and higher margin categories in 2025 and beyond? And if you could describe a little bit more about that longer term margin leverage. Thanks.
Kristin Peck: Thank you, Erin. I will take the first question on Librela and let Wetteny take that second question. Yes, we were very pleased with how we did with Librela in the first full quarter of launch in Q4. As you saw, we did about $44 million in the quarter, $47 million for the year, including the early experience trial. And really how we achieved that was our penetration was ahead of schedule, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks. Given that penetration, which is in the high 60s, we actually began DTC ahead of what we were expecting. Reorder rates are coming in exactly where we expected, in line with our expectations. So, that makes us really confident as we go into the year. We're looking at what - your other question was what kind of stocking or inventory build we saw in the clinics. It's hard to give you a firm number. It's somewhere between a quarter and a third, I would say, overall in stocking. But look, this is the number one selling pain product in Europe, and we have no doubt it will be that in the US as well. So, we're quite pleased and certainly ahead of our plan on penetration. And look, with our direct-to-consumer advertising investments, we've already started late last year and into Q1 to drive growth in this product in the US. So, I'll let Wetteny take the second question.
Wetteny Joseph: Yes, sure. Look, when looking at margins, yes, indeed there are some moving factors when you think about 2024 and then beyond. We do have Librela in 2023, as we said at Investor Day. If you look at our monoclonal antibodies at peak, particularly as we ramp up production in our capacity, which was built to make sure that we're confident in being able to take advantage of demand, they started out as being dilutive to the overall company average. For example, in 2023. As we go into 2024, Librela becomes accretive to our overall margins, but still below what you would consider our innovative companion animal products. And as we exit 2024 into 2025 and beyond, it becomes more in line with our innovative companion animal products. So, overall, beyond 2024, I won't give you specific guidance here in terms of what to expect, but I think if you look at it, we continue to expect companion animal to outpace the growth of livestock. So, that mix will continue to be favorable for us. And as we get into the higher levels of production for monoclonal antibodies, they're also accretive to overall margins and we're positioned to be able to leverage our SG&A base as well. So, all of those should translate to margin expansion through the P&L over time. But as we've demonstrated, we're not afraid to make the right investments behind our products, behind our key franchises as we see them, investments in R&D, as you saw in 2023. And as the guide implies, R&D will continue to grow faster than revenue as well. So, those investments will slightly offset some of those, but we'll position to continue to expand.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Michael Ryskin: Great. Thanks for taking the question, guys. First, I want to touch on margins, maybe both for 2023 and 2024. So, it looks like you're guiding - back of the envelope math, you’re guiding to about 100 bps of margin expansion in 2024, but you also did finish 2023 lower than we would've expected. I think 4Q especially came in significantly lower. And you called out some headwinds during the call in terms of FX. You called out some timing, some contribution to the Zoetis Charitable Foundation. Any way you could kind of back that out, give us sort of a cleaner number for what margins should have been in 2023, and then maybe what some of those one-time headwinds would have as an impact to 2024, just to give us a better sense of underlying margins and underlying EPS. And then my second question is just following up on Librela, I don't believe you actually quantified a target. So, I want to - just given what you did in 4Q, a major focus point, is something like $200 million to $250 million for Librela for 2024 reasonable? And especially - that's for US, but then on the O-US side, we've heard some concerns maybe coming out of Europe. And it seems like Librela has sort of been a little bit flat over the last couple of quarters in international markets. So, any color on what's going on internationally. Thanks.
Wetteny Joseph: Yes, sure, Mike. Let take this and then see what Kristin wants to add. So, take a look at margins. Indeed in 2024, we are guiding to about 100 basis points of expansion and margins. Keep in mind, when you look at 2023 and how we ended, Q4 had about 100 basis points of margin impact. And about 80 of that is from FX. So, you're talking about roughly 20 basis points when you consider manufacturing costs and a little bit of mix. Now, looking at mix, we had clearly really strong and quite frankly a strong year in livestock. And we're actually here at the national sales meeting for our livestock with our livestock team in Utah. And look, they've had a great year, and we expect livestock continue to grow as we go into 2024, but clearly ended stronger at the end. So, that created a little bit of a mix, and as well as outperforming our expectations exiting the year is also, as I said, a bit diluted. So, when you look at mix and manufacturing costs, you're still talking about 20 basis points of headwind exiting 2023. Most of the impact here is coming from FX, about 80 basis points. The other items that we referenced in our prepared commentary with respect to impact on the quarter and how we ended, FX as I explained, the impact on our finish here, if you take a look at FX, which is clearly non-operational, and you factor non-recurring items like the impairment charge for the prior acquisition, those two items are about $0.07 of headwind in the quarter, in 2023 in the fourth quarter. So, that's really the vast majority of what you saw impacting us here. Of course, we don't forecast FX. So, what we bake into our guidance for 2024 is essentially what would happen if we assume FX rates stay where they are at the end of January here. And with that, on a constant basis, we would expect to expand margins in 2024. And so, that's really consistent with how we've approached our forecasting in the past. And I won’t sit here and guess at what FX is going to do throughout the year 2024. that will have an impact either favorable or unfavorable, depending on how that goes.  For the other part of your question, I just want to maybe talk a little bit about Librela, how we expect Librela. Clearly, when you think about how we will deliver on 7% to 9% operational growth in revenue, price is a pretty significant factor. We continue to expect to be running price above our historic levels of two to three points, and perhaps slightly below what you saw in 2023 at 5%. And then Librela with the US launch clearly is going to be a significant factor. Certainly, $44 million in the quarter in Q4 was - again, very pleased to see that. We do see about a quarter to a third of that being initial stocking. So, you can model that out. In terms of what that would translate to, we're still in the early stages of our launch, but we're very pleased with what we're seeing so far, as we discussed already. In international, we couldn’t be more pleased with what we're seeing. If you look at international, the fourth quarter, you still have about 47% growth if you look at the base markets where we were launched at the beginning of the year. And then the new markets are driving another bit of growth. You have another $12 million contribution from those new markets, in addition to the US $44 million. So, I think what we have to really take into account here is, as we've been launching in markets in Europe, there's some stocking that happens from quarter to quarter as we do those launches. If you factor those out and you just focus on those markets that were already launched, we're talking about 47% growth in the quarter, which has been consistent over the last few quarters, about 50%, give or take growth. So, we couldn’t be more pleased with what we're seeing in the international markets. Kristin?
Kristin Peck: No, it’s great.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll move next to Jon Block with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Jon Block: Great. Thanks, guys. Good morning. Wetteny, any revenue cadence in the year to call out? You've got sort of that easier 1Q 2023 comp, but you were also noting more acute China headwinds in the first half. So, just how do we think about it? Do we sort of look at it on a two-year stack basis? And then on the guidance for the full year, maybe GM fell a little bit below what we were thinking, but SG&A expense, despite the investments, Kristin, that you called out, the accelerated DTC, the SG&A was a little bit lower than where our heads were at. So, maybe you can just talk through those items, why we're only seeing, seems like low to mid-single digit SG&A growth year-over-year. I don't know if some of that's blunted by FX. And then just finally, I'm sorry, Librela, due to the stocking, do you still expect Librela to be up in the US 4Q 2023 to 1Q 2024 as it absorbs the stocking? Thanks, guys.
Wetteny Joseph: Look, I'll take the cadence point first and then see what Kristin wants to add in terms of Librela expectations. Look, sitting here, I would expect a roughly balanced cadence across the year. Now, let's take a look at Q1, which is a specific point you raised in your question, Jon. If you look at Q1, certainly, if you look at companion animal in the US, there's an easier comp. We had destocking the first quarter last year, clearly something we look to see as an easier comp that we come up against. But at the same time, you had a 12% growth quarter in livestock in Q1. And so, I think if you look balance - those don't completely balance, but it's livestock growth, both in the US as well as international. And then you have China, which clearly started to more deteriorate in terms of the economic conditions there throughout the year. So, that becomes a heavier, I would say, headwind coming into Q1 as well as the conditions, weather conditions in Australia, et cetera, having an impact there. So, I think if you balance those out, and last point I'll make is, Librela, clearly very pleased with how we exit Q4 and enter into Q1, but it's going to continue to contribute more and more as you go through the year. So, Q2 and Q3 would be more than Q1. Therefore, the contribution from Librela accelerates through the year and it doesn't have as much relatively speaking in Q1. So, when you take all those into consideration, I actually see a roughly balanced year. Now, we did make references to FX, so from a reported basis that again, taking a look at where the FX rates were a couple weeks ago, you do have a heavier impact in terms of both revenue and bottom line. On the FX factor, hopefully what we provide in prepared commentary is helpful there. So, that's the other piece you have to think about. But when I think about operational base growth, I mean, we did exit the year with good momentum as we exited Q4 and into Q1, again looking at US companion animal. But that's how I think about it. Now, is Q1 going to be higher than Q4 from a Librela perspective? I think if you factor about a quarter to a third of impact coming from stocking, that's $12 million to $15 million. So, even if you had a flat, that means you grew by $12 million to $15 million going into Q1. I won't call it exactly here right now. What I would say is we're pleased with how the product is performing, but we are still in the early stages of this launch.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from David Westenberg with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
David Westenberg: Hi. Thank you for taking the question. So, last year we saw some discounting in front of the NexGard combo launch. Do you anticipate there might be similar competitive dynamics in front of a Elanco’s Quatro launch? And how are you thinking about that in consideration with the gross margins? And then just the second one on just the DTC efforts in Librela? I don't think there is DC allowed in Europe, but can you talk about maybe some of the learnings that you learned in Europe in terms of marketing and how they might apply specifically around communication of the vet? The vet obviously is the one that understands the superior safety profile with monoclonal antibodies and may maybe how that messaging can come out. Thank you.
Kristin Peck: Sure. I'll start with that one and Wetteny can certainly build on it. I mean, I want to first underscore, we had a very strong Q4 with Trio, with 21% growth in the quarter with competition. For the year overall, Trio grew 9%. So, we're very pleased with that. As we guided and Wetteny mentioned earlier, we're expecting mid to high single digit growth in Trio for the year. So, this obviously underscores, and we think we'll see that both in price and in volume. So, we do anticipate, obviously a competitor entering. I'm not exactly sure what - how Purdue or Proctor will do it. Our expectation is that is not a differentiated product. They do mention tapeworm, but you get tapeworm from fleas, and we absolutely control fleas. So, therefore, that's really not a differentiated product. So, we are used to having good competitors, obviously with NexGard. I'm sure there'll be some heavy promotional, but I think our strength, honestly, with our corporate accounts, the experience, switching is low for people with this product. It's very unlikely someone on Trio is going to switch. We're doing quite well with retail and auto-ship, which I think also protects us. And we expect a new competitor to expand the market. What we're seeing a lot is a movement into the triple combos out of topicals, collars, et cetera. So, as we look at that, we're confident in our Trio number as we look into the year. And with regards to your question on, what do we learn from Librela in Europe? So, we cannot do branded advertising for Librela in Europe, but we can do overall advertising for disease awareness and encouraging people who have pets, both dogs and cats with osteoarthritis pain, to bring them to the vet. And we are seeing real impact of that disease awareness. I think it's been a long time where pet owners have not had a product that they could turn to, and encouraging them that there is a new product and that they should go to the vet and be seen. We are seeing really positive uplifts from direct-to-consumer advertising, even when it's not branded. So, I don’t know, Wetteny, if you wanted to add into that. 
Wetteny Joseph: Yes. Look, I think you covered it, Kristin. Trio’s been performing really well for us in the face of direct competition in the US. Couldn't be more pleased, and to be gaining patient share in the face of competition, I think that speaks a lot to what we've been talking about, which is the power of our relationships, the strength of our label and being first to market. So, look, there'll be some initial, I'm sure heavy promotion that happens when a new competitor comes in. We factor some of that into our thinking here. But until we see the label and see what they do, we won't home in on specific reaction and so on. But we're very confident in our ability to continue to grow the franchise. And we're saying we're going to see mid to high single digit growth across Trio in 2024 as well.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Nathan Rich: Great. good morning and thanks for the questions. I wanted to ask on the derm franchise. I think you had talked about mid to high single digit growth for the franchise overall. I guess specifically, are you assuming a headwind within that guidance from the competitive entry that's likely to occur against Apoquel this year? And can you talk about the strategies you're maybe putting in place to defend market share for that product? And then a quick follow-up on China, could you maybe frame the type of headwind that you expect in China in 2024? And does that impact more on the companion or livestock side of the market? Thank you.
Kristin Peck: Yep, sure. I'll take the derm question, and I think Wetteny can follow up on your China question. Look, we saw strong growth both in the quarter and overall in derm at 8%. And I just want to underscore that that growth is obviously understated given the price, if you're looking at the pre-price buying that we saw in late 2022. As we look at our guidance for mid to high single-digit growth for our derm franchise in 2024, that is the expectation that we will see a competitor launch. We expect this market to continue to expand and grow, as we've talked about. There are 85 million dogs in the US who have pruritus. There is still over 6 million untreated dogs and 3.5 million who are treated, but with steroids and sort of over-the-counter products. So, we strongly believe this is a market we can continue to expand. Look, we've had two products been on the market seven and 10 years, respectively. We've had millions of dogs on these products. Our products have been proven over time to be safe and efficacious, and they're trusted by pet owners. They're trusted by vets, and we're seeing more and more a switch to Cytopoint, both a preference for compliance by both the pet owner and the vet. And our competition, we're expecting to come in a film-coated tablet. And if you look at that, we're really focused on investing in applicable chewables and moving them to chewables, which pet owners really prefer. We've been successful in doing this in Europe. We're quite focused on doing this in the US and we're also continuing to look at innovation in the short term, on the long acting. So, we are going to defend this franchise. We're confident in this franchise. Our guidance of mid to high single digits demonstrates that we believe we can continue to grow this market in the US and around the world, not just defend our brand, but continue to bring lifecycle innovation to the space over time to grow our share. Wetteny, do you want to take China?
Wetteny Joseph: Yes, sure. And one point on derm, of course we have a mid to high single-digit growth expectation that we laid out in our guidance, of course, across a broad range of expectation. There’s various scenarios around competitor entry, timing, pricing, et cetera, will play into that. And the label that they have, of course, will be playing into how that plays out. But we're confident in our ability to grow. Our franchise has been around for a decade in this space. On China, we've been consistent on this one. I think we continue to see sort of the broad economic situation there to remain where it is. We're not expecting it to deteriorate nor improve, at least through the first half of our year. And we also have stronger comps similar to the second half of 2023, a little bit less so into the first half of 2024, but still headwinds into the first half of 2024. You continue to see consumer confidence being low and swine prices remaining fairly depressed in consumption there as well. So, all those factors. Of course, long-term, we continue to expect China to be a strong growth market. It has done exceptionally well for us over the last decade, but in the near term, we're not expecting that to be a contribution to growth. In fact, we'll see some declining comps in the first half on China.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Balaji Prasad with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Balaji Prasad: Hi. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for the questions. A couple. firstly, I just wanted to understand the currency dynamics better, considering that most of the nearly 100 basis points based on revenue and 150 basis points based on EPS seems to be growing from here. Why is FX so severe and any particular currencies hurting you? I mean, my general understanding is with $4 billion plus of export revenues and dollar weakening, I thought the impact would have been the other way around. Second question is around the FDA letter that Zoetis has received on Librela number. I want to understand how frequent or normal are these kinds of letters on the animal health side and the issues that FDA found with Librela’s promotion, with the inclusion of the P value on the secondary end points? And what is the current status now with regard to your communication with the FDA? Thank you.
Kristin Peck: So, I'll take your second question first and then let Wetteny take it. I assume you're referencing the letter back in November. Honestly, the letter is uneventful and was well addressed. We immediately resolved the request for clarification. What you're talking about was a request for clarification on our promotional materials. We just made a minor change to the promotional materials and how we represented some statistical data. The concerns are well addressed and the modifications were accepted by the FDA. I mean, this isn't uncommon. So, I don't - that was easily resolved last year. That was a minor issue, but Wetteny, do you want to take the second question?
Wetteny Joseph: Yes, sure. On currency dynamics - and again, we don't forecast FX, so we tend to report out what we see the impact is. And the dollar continues to strengthen against the number of currencies that we operate in. And there's a little bit of a disproportional effect that we see on some of the higher inflationary markets like Argentina. If you follow Argentina, there've been two really significant drops in terms of FX rates versus the dollar, if you follow back, as we ended last year, both in December and I think back in August, and there's a little bit of a delayed effect on those. Clearly, there's an impact on top line that we've talked about, but there's also a little bit of a delayed effect if you look at the impact it has on inventory and receivables that are on the books at the time. So, by the time you collect those, they have a greater impact, which is why you see the impact down the bottom line. So, combination of Argentina, Brazil, Turkey, those are more pronounced than their relative percentage of our revenues, given how significantly they devalue. That's what you’re seeing play out. But really across the board, if you look at how the dollar ended the year, it ended a bit stronger than you saw throughout the average of the year.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Brandon Vazquez with William Blair. Please go ahead.
Brandon Vazquez: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. First, can you talk a little bit about the pre-price buying the quarter? Are you able to quantify how much of a headwind that was? And then maybe talk about should we expect that to be a headwind going forward at all? Are you guys still working through that? And a follow-up to that maybe higher level, is there anything in the pipeline or kind of in product cycle management that you guys can share with us? You're still spending a lot of money in R&D, and even for next year, it looks like that may not be a specific area to get leverage off of the R&D line. So, anything that you'd be able to share with us there would be helpful. Thank you.
Wetteny Joseph: Yes, sure. I'll take the first one and then Kristin will cover the second one. Look, there's always some level of pre-price buying in our - as we exit the year, given what our price increases are going to be. I would say compared to the prior year where there was higher than average pre-price buying ending 2022 into 2023, which had the effect on 2024, we more actively managed customer orders in terms of pre-price buying exiting 2023, and that gave us really first the underlying market strength and momentum that we carried into, but also I would say our order position walking into January 2024 was certainly in better position than say the prior year. So, we more actively manage those, but there's always some level in the numbers.
Kristin Peck: Sure. And the question with regard to R&D, obviously we are very confident in our pipeline. I think we've been the most innovative company in animal health. And as you look at the how we exceeded market growth every year for the last 11 years, it is due to the innovation in our pipeline. We are investing both for the short, medium, and long-term in animal health different than human health. That really makes a difference. You look at sort of what I call like lifecycle enhancements that we just launched such as Apoquel chewable, which will significantly support our key brands. We're also looking at pretty disruptive innovations as well. As you look at sort of the short one-to-three-year term of innovation, we're excited really for some of our long actings. And we've talked a lot about investing in the medium to long term in really important new franchises as well such as renal chronic kidney disease spaces, looking at cardiology, looking at oncology and diabetes. There's really important spaces of unmet medical need in animal health that we're really excited to tackle. We're continuing to invest behind our diagnostics, as well as behind our livestock business, looking at new vaccines and immunomodulators in our genetics business. So, we have a very diverse pipeline because we have a diverse portfolio. So, we're continuing to invest behind that and remain very confident in that.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Chris Schott with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.
Chris Schott: Great. Thanks so much for the questions. Just two for me. Just latest on vet visit growth. I know it's not the primary driver of growth for your business, but you're targeting 0% to 1% this year. And I'm just trying to get more color on what’s the underlying kind of dynamics here. Is this mostly still vet capacity? Is it macro dynamics? Just any color there would be appreciated. And then my second question was just coming back to Librela ex-US. From your perspective, how penetrated is the market for monoclonals at this point? And where do you see the largest opportunity for growth in these markets? I'm sure you have a sense of like, are we in the second inning or the seventh inning of the ramp ex-US? Thanks.
Kristin Peck: Sure. I mean, starting on the first, we are not very levered, as we've spoken about many times before to vet visits. I mean, obviously, they're not inconsequential. Our view of zero to one is that's where it's historically been. That is historically what you see in vet clinic visits over time. So, I think we're really saying it's back to a normal. What's really happening is there's strong end market demand. There remains some capacity issues in the US, but I think some of that's being addressed by more stuff going to auto-ship and retail and online, which has also been supporting it. But we really sort of view the year, as you look into the year for 2023, although we saw flat vet visits, we saw revenue and revenue per visit up 7.5%. So, we really are seeing really strong growth, obviously overall in revenue, and we're much more correlated over time with that, just given the strength of our portfolio, et cetera. And to your second question with regards to Librela outside the US, I think we're still early innings. And really where I think we see the growth is, right now that product is primarily being used in severe dogs. I think getting it into more moderate dogs, I mean, I think, obviously, at least as someone, in my 50s, I will say my hip hurts right now, but everyone doesn't know that who is around me. And so, the reality is, osteoarthritis exists in animals long before they're limping and can't walk up the stairs. And the more we can control that pain early, I think is critical. So, I think what we're really trying to change the paradigm is getting Librela in first line use for animals with osteoarthritis pain, and getting it into more of those moderate dogs. And we think the more we can do that, the more we can continue to grow the market here and grow our franchise. So, we know, we believe we're in early innings across the globe with regards to osteoarthritis pain with both Librela and certainly with Solensia, where we still have to continue to grow awareness for osteoarthritis pain in cats.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Steven Scala with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Chris LoBianco: Hi, this is Chris on for Steve. We have two questions. First on Librela, to what degree are US vet capacity constraints a headwind to longer term treatment compliance? And then is there a regulatory path for the approval of an at-home owner-administered formulation? Thank you.
Kristin Peck: Sure. Obviously, making sure that pet owners can get in monthly for their injections is critical. So, vet capacity is certainly something that we're quite focused on, but I think after the first visit, this is an injection that can certainly be done by a vet tech, and I think the industry's really focused. And we've been partnering with corporates, with the AVMA, with lots of people to really think about how to change the paradigm of vets to vet techs and clinics and things like that. So, we believe there are solutions to really address some of the vet capacity issues. So far globally, and by the way, this vet capacity issue is not just a US issue. It's global. So far, it hasn't affected the growth of our key products. And your second questions with regard to home delivery, you want to take that one? 
Wetteny Joseph: Yes. Look, I think the regulatory path to that isn't really the direction we're going in terms of where we think we can make an impact here. Livestock innovation not only in our OA pain mAbs, but across our portfolio, are really, really important. And as I look ahead, I think longer acting formulations, both Solensia and Librela, will be the direction that will help with this, even though, as Kristin said, we're not seeing any significant impact in terms of our ability to grow the mAbs. I think initial visits where the vet has to see the pet and do the injection beyond that, the techs are able to do it, et cetera. And that varies a bit, but, but we don't see that as being a significant impact for us.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Navann Ty with BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.
Navann Ty: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two, one on Librela and one on Trio. The first one on Librela, with continued investments in 2024, what are the remaining SG&A needs in addition to the current DTC campaign? And just a clarification, do you currently expect Librela to become potentially gross margin accretive in 2025? And then on Trio, can you help us explaining the switches from the NexGard Plus? Are they mostly from BI’s own NexGard rather than from Simparica Trio, and you see uptake from BI on younger dogs and puppies mostly? Thank you.
Wetteny Joseph: I’ll take the first one on Librela. Look, of course, we are going to be making investments and we already started, because as you heard in the prepared commentary, our penetration levels are running above our expectations, and we've launched DTC on Librela, and we're already doing DTC across Europe and international markets as well. As we look ahead, we did make significant investments in our field force going back about a year and a half or so ago. So, we're able to leverage those investments and we don't see incremental investments beyond those to drive our expectations and take advantage of demand on the product. The gross margin picture, as I mentioned earlier, it is dilutive if you look at 2023, and particularly because you saw us outperform expectations on Librela in 2023, right? As you go into 2024, Librela margins are actually accretive to the overall company margin leverage. So, 70%-ish gross margins for the company, Librela is above that, but it is below the gross margins that you would see in our innovative companion animal brands. As we get beyond 2024, you will start to see it at those innovative levels, which is well above the company average. So, hopefully that helps clarify that point. Trio, as we've said, we've seen really strong performance in Trio, posting double-digit growth. Trio grew 17% in the US in Q4, and we continue to gain patient share, which means again, switching is low when you have a product that's safe, efficacious, and been in the market for almost four years now. So, we're very pleased with what we're seeing. I don't know, Kristin, if you want to add anything.
Kristin Peck: The only add, we're doing quite well with puppies. You asked specifically with regards to puppies. I mean, puppies are on the Trio label, so I just want to emphasize that. I know it wasn't on the original Simparica. So, I mean, really you are looking at new starts, we see a lot of puppies and we see a lot of conversion from single and dual-agent customers to a triple combination, and certainly a movement to more people from topicals to oral. So, there's lots of ways for us to continue to gain market share for that product, but we're doing quite well with puppies, to answer that other part of your question.
Operator: And there appears to be no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back to the speakers for any closing remarks.
Kristin Peck: Great. Thank you all so much for the questions, and honestly, for continued interest in Zoetis. I want to underscore that the enduring strength of the human-animal bond for pet owners’ expectations of human quality healthcare for pets, and the need for safe and secure food supply, all underscore the animal health industry is essential and very durable. We remain confident about our strategy and the ongoing value proposition, because we know that our colleagues will make a difference every day in everything that we're doing. And with their support, I want to reiterate that we expect to grow faster than the market again in 2024, not just in line, and to grow operational revenue by mid to high single digits. We are firmly committed to investing in our innovative pipeline, our portfolio, and the DTC programs we need to support the broadening and building billion-dollar franchises. The animal health industry is resilient even in times of uncertainty, and we are poised to navigate these challenges because our portfolio diversity, our commitment to exceptional customer experience, operational excellence and agility, and we look forward to keeping you updated on our progress on future calls. Thanks much for joining us today, guys. Have a great day.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-11-02 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Third Quarter 2023 Financial Results Conference Call and Webcast for Zoetis. Hosting the call today is Steve Frank, Vice President of Investor Relations for Zoetis. The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, and will not be forwarded automatically. In addition, a replay of this call will be made available approximately 2 hours after the conclusion of the call via dial in or on our Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. [Operator Instructions]. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.
Steve Frank: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Zoetis third quarter 2023 earnings call. I am joined today by Kristin Peck, our Chief Executive Officer; and Wetteny Joseph, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website, and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statements in today's press release and our SEC filings, including, but not limited to, our annual report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q. Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and the company's 8-K filing dated today, Thursday, November 2, 2023. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. With that, I will turn the call over to Kristin.
Kristin Peck: Thank you, Steve. And welcome, everyone, to our third quarter earnings call for 2023. We generated strong performance in the third quarter, driven by our diverse companion animal portfolio of key dermatology products, pet parasiticides, monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain and diagnostics. We delivered 8% operational growth in revenue and 13% operational growth in adjusted net income, despite continued market challenges in China. We showed balanced segment growth this quarter with 8% operational growth internationally, and 8% growth in the U.S. Our companion animal portfolio grew 11% and our livestock portfolio grew 3% operational -- operationally in 3Q, in line with our overall expectations.  Through the first nine months of the year, we have grown our revenue 7% operationally, as customers place a premium on the animal health benefits that our products delivered, even in times of economic and geopolitical uncertainty. As the market leader in animal health, we compete in an essential global industry that has been resilient during various economic cycles. And we continue growing above the market based on a steady pipeline of new products, lifecycle innovations, and commercial execution.  We are on track to achieve our full year operational guidance and have narrowed it around the midpoint of the range, as we continue to balance headwinds and tailwind in the marketplace. We are executing well on the drivers where we have more control, like the successful launch of Librela in the U.S., while also mitigating the downside of macroeconomic declines in China, both of which were not considered in our original guidance this year.  Once again, our diverse portfolio across product categories and geographies generate durable, reliable long term growth. We continue to expect our key companion animal franchises to be our core catalysts for growth. We anticipate strong growth and our market leading dermatology portfolio for the year, building on the ongoing direct to consumer or DTC digital campaigns that support disease and product awareness. As well as the continued introduction of life cycle innovations like Apoquel Chewable.  Our compare to franchise and broader portfolio of parasiticides continue to perform well in this increasingly competitive product category, based on our innovative and highly effective products and promotional support from DTC.  In terms of new products, we're very pleased with the U.S. launch of Librela, our canine monoclonal antibody for osteoarthritis or OA pain. This product has been very well received by veterinarians and pet owners in the U.S., as well as other major markets globally. And we have built ample supply for continued growth in the U.S. and elsewhere.  Solensia, our monoclonal antibody for OA paining cats has also been well received by veterinarians in markets around the world. As we look to help increase medicalization of cats. We're building awareness of this condition among cat owners, and introducing our monoclonal antibody treatment through DTC campaigns, as well as AI tools like cat pain IQ, which helps that and pet owners use videos to identify this condition.  Our diagnostic portfolio has been showing stronger year-over-year performance in 2023, with 14% operational growth in the third quarter, and we continue to refine this business to better serve customer needs across our comprehensive portfolio. For example, we're simplifying our reference lab service and operating model in the U.S. and focusing on expanding our larger regional hubs, which can deliver one-day turnaround and have more modernized operations. We also continue to emphasize the benefits of AI technology and our virtual lab services to enhance the speed and quality of our diagnostic solutions.  With all this in mind, we are narrowing our full year guidance for operational growth to a range of 6.5% to 7.5% in revenue and a range of 7.5% to 8.5% in adjusted net income, keeping the same midpoint as our prior guidance. Wetteny will provide more details on guidance in his remarks.  We continue to see strong underlying customer demand this year and into 2024, even while recovery in China is still a notable uncertainty. The majority of that practices in the U.S. continue to see high customer demand for veterinary services. However, labor constraints and more limited hours continue to hamper their ability to meet this demand. Year-to-date, clinic visits are flat as we expected. We did see a modest decline in clinic visits this quarter in the U.S., while clinic visit revenues and average revenue per visit were up.  Looking ahead, we remain confident in the sustainable underlying demand for animal health, based on the strength of the human animal bond, people's willingness to spend on pet house and the essential need for safe and secure food supply. We expect to achieve double digit operational growth for our companion animal portfolio this year and low single digit operational growth in our livestock portfolio. Before I wrap up, I want to reiterate a theme I discussed earlier this year at Investor Day. It's the confidence we have in sustaining our key market leading franchises across dermatology, pet parasiticides and osteoarthritis pain based on life cycle innovations in these categories as well as the pipeline we are exploring in other areas of unmet need. We are firmly committed to investing in our portfolio as well as the DTC programs and capabilities we need to support our growth, while managing costs and creating value for our shareholders. Despite economic and geopolitical uncertainties in China and elsewhere, we believe we will continue to grow faster than the market for the remainder of 2023 and into 2024. This confidence stems from our diverse portfolio across markets and species. Our industry-leading franchises, the ongoing launch of Librela and the operational excellence and agility that our people deliver every day for our business and for our customers. So thank you, and let me hand this over to Wetteny. Wetteny?
Wetteny Joseph: Thank you, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. As Kristin mentioned, we had a strong third quarter, with broad-based growth across both our U.S. and international segments across both companion animal and lifestyle portfolios and across both price and volume. For the quarter, we were able to deliver results in line with our expectations, even in light of continued headwinds in China. In the third quarter, we generated revenue of $2.2 billion, growing 7% on a reported basis and 8% on an operational basis. Adjusted net income of $629 million grew 11% on a reported basis and 13% on an operational basis. Of the 8% operational revenue growth, 5% is from price and 3% is from volume. Volume growth consisted of 2% from new products, including our monoclonal antibodies for pain, Librela and Solensia and 1% from our key dermatology portfolio. Our companion animal portfolio was the main driver of revenue growth, growing 11% operationally. Livestock also contributed, with operational growth of 3% in the quarter. Companion animal growth was again driven by our innovative products with double-digit operational growth in our key dermatology portfolio, our monoclonal antibodies for OA pain, Librela and Solensia and Simparica Trio. Our key dermatology products generated $393 million in sales globally, posting growth of 14% on an operational basis with double-digit growth in both the U.S. and international. Globally, our monoclonal antibodies for OA pain posted $77 million in combined revenue in the quarter. Growth came primarily from our European markets as well as from the impact of new launch markets internationally. With the October full launch of Librela in the U.S., our pain products are now available in most major markets. Simparica Trio posted global revenue of $206 million in the quarter, representing growth of 20% operationally versus the comparable 2022 period. Growth was driven by expanded DTC advertising support globally as well as from increased field force and promotional focus. Our companion animal diagnostics portfolio reported revenue of $90 million and grew 14% operationally, with growth contributions from both the U.S. and international. Our life sci portfolio grew 3% operationally, with international growth partially offset by a slight decline in the U.S. Growth in livestock was driven primarily by price, especially in high inflationary markets. We also saw volume growth in our poultry portfolio, driven by increased usage of vaccines as well as our antioxodio product, Zoamix in the U.S. Now moving on to revenue growth by segment for the quarter. U.S. revenue was $1.2 billion in the quarter, growing 8%, with companion animal products growing 11% and livestock sales declining 2%. On the companion animal side, while vet clinic visits declined 1.5% in the quarter, we continue to see robust play in revenue growth, up 6% versus a year ago. Average revenue per visit is up over 7%. On a year-to-date basis, clinic visits are flat, while clinic revenue is growing 8%. These trends highlight the continued durability of pet owner willingness to spend as well as the continued impact of vet clinic staffing challenges.  Our companion animal revenue growth continues to outpace veterinary clinic revenue growth, due in part to our continued upsized growth in retail channel. Turning to product performance. Companion animal growth in the U.S. was driven by our key dermatology portfolio, Simparica Trio and Solensia. Key dermatology product sales in the U.S. were $260 million in the quarter, growing 13%. Simparica point sales continued to drive growth in the quarter, with vets showing a preference for injectables due to higher compliance and pet owners appreciating the longer duration of treatment. Apoquel sales were driven by growth in the retail channel as pet owners continue to rely more heavily on retail for ongoing pharmacy needs as well as retail auto ship programs that drive higher compliance. Our latest dermatology life cycle innovation at Apoquel Chewable was launched in the U.S. in October. Apoquel Chewable has been well received in Europe, as pet owners favor the ease of chewable administration over film-coated tablets. Simparica Trio posted U.S. sales of $184 million in the quarter, growing 17%, driven by increased focus in our parasiticide promotional programs. We continue to see patient share growth in Simparica Trio, even with the recent competitive launch in the triple combination space. We remain confident in our ability to compete through our superior label, strong retail channel presence, and the strength of our corporate and specialty relationships. In the U.S., our pain products posted sales of $15 million in the quarter. We continue to see solid player penetration growth for Solensia, as well as an uptick in Feline clinic visits and expect to continue to drive awareness of Feline OA through our DTC advertising campaigns. Librela has been well received by early experience program participants and their patients during the third quarter. We moved to a full launch in mid-October. We have been very pleased with post launch performance thus far, and are confident that we have ample supply to meet our demand expectations. Our U.S. companion animal diagnostics portfolio posted growth of 18% in the quarter, as we continue to see positive results from the new field force we introduced last year. We saw strong placement growth in the quarter, especially on our images device. U.S. livestock sales declined 2% in the quarter, primarily resulting from the timing of supply on certain cattle products in the prior year, where we had an improved supply position and restocking in the channel, which drove a strong comparable quarter. The Q3 decline was partially offset by growth in our cattle productivity implant, Synovex due to extended label claims. The cattle decline was partially offset by growth in poultry due to vaccines and the extended use of Zoamix, an alternative to antibiotic medicated feed additives. Moving on to our International segment, where revenue grew 8% on both a reported and operational basis in the quarter. International companion animal revenue grew 12% operationally and livestock grew 5% operationally. Increased sales of companion animal products resulted from growth in our monoclonal antibodies for OA pain, our key dermatology products and our small animal parasiticides portfolio. Growth in our OA pain products was bolstered by field force focus and DTC awareness campaigns in early launch European markets, specifically the U.K. and Germany, as well as the continued uptake in markets launched earlier this year. Librela sales were $50 million international or 55% operational growth in the quarter, despite a slightly more difficult comparator in Q3 of 2022 due to the removal of supply constraints in our international markets. We remain confident in our ability to supply our forecasted demand for Librela. Solensia sales were $12 million in the quarter. Our international key dermatology portfolio contributed $133 million of revenue and grew 17% operationally. We saw double-digit growth across most of our major markets and strong uptake of Apoquel Chewable. Apoquel growth was driven primarily by the delayed itch season in Europe and Canada. Cytopoint growth was driven by continued patient expansion and higher compliance in existing patients. Our international small animal are parasiticides portfolio growth of 9% operationally was driven by our Simparica franchise, with Simparica posting $40 million in revenue, growing 29% operationally, driven primarily by demand generation in emerging markets. Simparica Trio posted $23 million, growing 47% on an operational basis, driven by growth in corporate account contracts. The Simparica franchise performance was partially offset by a 16% operational decline in Revolution franchise, driven by a difficult comparable period in China, due to the return of supply in the prior year as well as the ongoing impact of the current economic conditions. As Kristin mentioned, we have seen declines in China due to the ongoing economic challenges, particularly on the companion animal side, which were not fully reflected in our initial guidance. We continue to monitor economic conditions. However, we are not expecting an improvement this year or into the first half of next year. Our international livestock segment grew 5% operationally in the quarter, driven primarily by price increases, especially in high inflationary markets. Growth was driven primarily by our cattle portfolio, which grew 8% operationally. Brazil was the largest contributor, where we have seen price growth, supply recovery on certain products as well as continued improvement in cattle industry dynamics. Additionally, the prior was a weak comparative period due to the impact of supply disruptions and a more uncertain industry dynamic led to a lowering of channel inventories in the quarter. Our poultry business also contributed to growth in the quarter, growing 9% operationally due to increased key account penetration in emerging markets. Now moving on to the rest of the P&L for the quarter. Adjusted gross margin of 70.5% improved 70 basis points on a reported basis compared to the prior year, primarily driven by the impact of price increases and lower freight charges. This was partially offset by higher manufacturing costs, inventory charges and product mix. Adjusted operating expenses increased 7% operationally, driven primarily by higher SG&A expenses, which were 5% operationally due to higher competition related expenses. R&D expenses grew 13% on an operational basis in the quarter, driven by higher compensation-related expenses as well as increased project spend for our pipeline projects. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 19.6%, a decrease of 130 basis points due to favorable jurisdictional mix of earnings and a higher benefit in the U.S. related to foreign-derived intangible income, partially offset by lower net discrete tax benefits. And finally, adjusted net income was 13% operationally and adjusted diluted EPS grew 15% operationally for the quarter. Capital expenditures in the third quarter were $145 million. We now expect full year capital expenditures to be in the range of $725 million to $750 million. In the quarter, we repurchased $250 million of Zoetis shares. Now moving to guidance for the full year 2023. Please note that guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late October, which reflect the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Beginning with revenue for the full year. Due to unfavorable foreign exchange rates, we are revising our reported revenue range while narrowing our guidance on operational revenue growth. We expect revenue between $8.475 billion and $8.55 billion, with a range of 6.5% to 7.5% operational growth. Our previous guidance was 6% to 8%. We have been pleased with our operational performance thus far. While foreign exchange headwinds have been larger than expected, our year-to-date operational revenue growth of 7% is in line with our expectations. We expect to benefit from the approval and launch of Librela in the U.S., which is included in our revised guidance last quarter as well as the performance of our Lifestyle business. However, ongoing uncertainty in China has continued to offset upside potential. We are expecting adjusted net income to be in the range of $2.49 billion to $2.51 billion, also slightly lower, driven by unfavorable foreign exchange. Operationally, we are narrowing our growth expectations to a range of 7.5% to 8.5%, previously 7% to 9%. Expected reported diluted EPS narrows to a range of $5.14 to $5.21. And adjusted diluted EPS narrows to $5.38 to $5.43. Finally, to summarize before we go to Q&A. Our broad-based growth across species and geographies despite the challenging economic environment in China, continue to highlight the resilience of our portfolio and of the animal health industry. We remain committed to growing above the industry, driven by our innovative portfolio, commercial execution and multiple sources of in-line growth. Now I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Jon Block with Stifel. Please go ahead. 
Jon Block: Great, thanks guys. Good morning. I promise one long question. So in companion animal, the overall revenue was a bit shy of what we had expected, but you really had great performance what we call sort of the big 5 products. So atopic derm, Trio map, the big 5 were all ahead of our estimate. So maybe if you guys can talk a little bit about the ongoing uptake of some of those key big 5 products even with a more difficult consumer, right? Because people view some of those as discretionary. Again, the results were really strong and even despite the more difficult consumer. And then the flip side would just be like anything to site regarding the legacy products, right? So if you back into legacy that might have been modestly down year-over-year. And a quick part B on the follow-up, Kristin, you mentioned faster growth for Zoetis than market and get in '24. I don't think we're really surprised by that. You've done that year in and year out. But can I push you a little bit on how we should think about for Zoetis in '24 versus Zoetis in '23? In other words, if we take into account the OA pain uptake, if you would, could we see accelerated growth for the company in '24 versus '23 when we think about all the moving parts?
Kristin Peck: Wow. Okay. So John, great question. I think there's like 20 questions on that one. So I don't know how we would do that, but let me start, and then I'll let Wetteny build on it. To your point, we had really strong growth across our franchises. And if you look at dermatology, it's 14% in the quarter, Paris [ph] at 10%, diagnostics at 14% and the overall pain portfolio at 91%. So there really was strong growth across all those. Obviously, leading the growth there will be pain. And as you look into 2024, we see that as well with significant optimism about where that's going to go, we're very pleased with where that launch is. These are both Librela and Solensia, 2 products that are very early in their life cycle with significant growth. And I think if you really double click if you look at international, who already have these products in the market for a while, you're seeing great growth. Importantly, we're continuing to see really strong compliance on those products across Europe. As someone who currently has a dog who has an early experience, who look at their second dose of Librela, the difference that it makes, I really can't see any pet owner taking their dogs off these world-leading medications. So maybe Wetteny, if you want to take on some of the detailed questions you had around derm, paris and Solensia. But to your point, we remain very optimistic looking into 2024 about the strength of our companion animal portfolio and the 11% was in line with what we expected to be honest. But Wetteny, do you want to give more detail on some of that?
Wetteny Joseph: Yes, absolutely. Look, the 11% growth operationally in companion animal is right in line with our expectations coming into the quarter. And the overall growth of 8% operational, I would even say, is slightly above. If you recall on the last call, we said expect Q3 to come in somewhere between the mid and the high end of our growth rate. So that's roughly between 7% and 8%, so at the high end of that.  But in terms of consumer, look, as we've said time and time again, if you look at the therapeutics category in terms of the value in pet health as well as some of the chronic conditions, as Kristin mentioned, consumers have not been treating those as discretionary. Even when you see some relative softness in pet spend, it doesn't carry over into the health care piece in terms of therapeutics, et cetera. And we've seen that play out in many ways even as I'm sure we'll get into a -- clinic visits are slightly down in the quarter. Clinic revenue is up almost 7%, and we're growing faster than that. Again, retail being a part of that, and we'll get into that in a little bit more detail. When I look at the big products, as you described them, John, derm, Triomabs, all up double digits and up across U.S. and international. I mean our growth this quarter was broad-based, across companion animal livestock U.S. international price, 5% volume on 3%. So really broad-based. And I think that really underscores the breadth of our products as well as our innovation and the value that consumer and pet owners place on products. The legacy products, when I look at in line, keep in mind, when we talk price, we tend to see price lift in those legacy products as well. But when it volume, it wasn't down. In-line products were actually flat on the quarter year-on-year with some lift on price. So hopefully, that helps. But I share the optimism Kristin described with respect to 2024. I mean we have multiple sources of growth, not only the Librela launch in the U.S. You've got continued growth across international markets for Librela and Solensia as well. And of course, we'll have price as a lever in addition to in-line products we just talked about. Livestock is now back to growth, and we'll look at what that looks like when we come back with guidance next year. And then we expect growth across our key franchises as well in terms of derm, paris and diagnostics. So I'll cap it there as a long answer to a long question, but we'll take the next one.
Operator: Certainly, we'll take our next question from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley.
Erin Wright: Thanks. On Librela, can you talk a little bit about the initial feedback for U.S. practices? Will there be any initial clinic level stocking? I think you said your expectations are intact there. But any lumpiness quarter-to-quarter that we should be thinking about? Has anything changed in terms of your expectations there? And then as we think about margin expansion next year, given Librela won't be at critical mass so that we may weigh on the gross margin. But is there still some underlying operating leverage that we should think about across the business?
Kristin Peck: Sure. Thanks, Erin. I'll take the first half of the question, and Wetteny can take the second half of the question. We launched in the U.S., the early experience trial in September with 400 clinics. As I mentioned, my dog puppy was actually one of those dogs. We went to a full launch in mid-October once we got a full dose in, and that's really the uptake was really strong. Very pleased with the results. We're obviously still in the early stages, but we're seeing it very similar to what we saw in Europe. Both vets and pet owners are super excited. We make sure that we've got ample supply as both Wetteny and I mentioned, because we do see this as a strong ramp, as you saw what happened in international. International had a supply constraint for a while. And as soon as we open that, we saw where that really went. So we continue to see really strong demand. Penetration is going really well in the clinics in the U.S. and the experience is broadening. There will be some small initial stocking for sure in some of those clinics, but I don't know if I would call that lumpiness going into next year. There definitely was obviously, they stock it. And our hope is we continue to just continue to drive that growth going forward. It is the number 1 selling OA pain product in Europe. We expect it to obviously be the same in the U.S. If you look at the U.S. in particular, Erin, there are 26 million medicalized dogs with OA. So this is a big market that we're going after, and this is a game-changing product. So we really see a very strong potential with this.  We think Librela will expand the market. And as we've mentioned before, we really do think Librela and Solensia alone can be a $1 billion portfolio for us. And that's in a market today that was only $400 million. So I think that sort of underscores where we see growth there. But do you want to talk about the margin expansion issue, Wetteny?
Wetteny Joseph : Sure. I will. Look, you're right, Erin. In terms of -- as we said, when you look at ABS at peak, once they ramp up, they will be additive and accretive to our gross margins. We believe they're also accretive to our contribution margin, even when there are what I'll say is subscale in terms of getting towards their peak. So as we launch into the U.S., which is a large market, obviously, as you said, we'll see a little bit of a headwind from a gross margin perspective. But given many of the investments that we need to drive this field force, et cetera, already in the books, if you will. There will be some incremental A&P and DTC. And once we have the right level of penetration of the product in clinics, but that's still going to leave room for contribution margin lift in the product. So that will be, I would say, a factor from a gross margin standpoint. But we'll give more precision in terms of guidance for '24 at the next call. But as you can read from us and what we're saying today, we're very excited about '24. We're optimistic on '24, given the levers I just described. So in line with what we said at Investor Day, we expect to grow in the mid- to high single digits. I think you'll continue to see us look for margin expansion given the mix up in companion animal versus large [indiscernible], but I won't give you any more and more specific than that.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs.
Nathan Rich : Great. Thank you, so much the question. I wanted to stick with Librela. And Kristin, specifically ask about how vets are diagnosing OA pain and starting dogs on therapy? You obviously talked about the large number of pets that could benefit from this, but relatively few dogs on treatment. I guess, anything you can share in terms of diagnosis rates for practices that were in the early experience program and where those diagnoses are coming from? Are these dogs currently on a pain product and maybe switching to Librela or these new dogs being diagnosed? Anything there would be great. And then a quick follow-up on the international performance of Librela. It looks like it was roughly flat sequentially on a constant currency basis. Any learnings on seasonality or anything like that on the international side, now that that's been on the market for a little bit?
Kristin Peck: Sure. A few things I'd say there. Unlike cat pain, which we can certainly talk about if someone has a question on it. Dog OA pain and osteoarthritis has been diagnosed quite well by that. This is not hard to diagnose dogs, unlike cats, do not hide it. You can sense they're less active. They limp. They don't want to go upstairs. It is not hard to diagnose. And a lot of these dogs are already being treated. They're being treated with our product, Rimadyl and other OA products. There's diets for this is not a space where there's not a developed market, a developed protocol for diagnosis. That is not the case in cats, where we do have to really develop protocols for diagnosis. What we saw initially is the first dogs they put on are the most symptomatic dogs, where they know that like they really are really struggling. I think if you look at what we've seen in international is as vets get more comfortable with it, they then start providing it for dogs earlier in the OA pain, which actually is even better. They have greater quality of life over time. So our experience of diagnosis is really coming out of international, which is normally initially the dogs they first put it on are the one suffering the most where their pet owners are begging for it. And then over time, you move into earlier stages of OA. But again, this is not one that is hard to diagnose for vets. They have protocols to do that today. So we're not really as concerned here in the diagnosis part. I think what we really need to do and we see growth in '24 and beyond in '25 and '26 is having that really provide a product like Librela to dog earlier in their disease, which I think will be a good growth driver. And in international, that is definitely not the case. We're seeing phenomenal growth right now. It is definitely not flat. But Wetteny, do you want to get into some of the specifics of the international growth situation there?
Wetteny Joseph : Yes, absolutely. Look, if you look at Librela, we delivered $53 million in revenues in Q3. That's a 65% growth operationally. Now if you look at the preexisting markets, they were up about 33%. So that's an incremental $10 million or $11 million in the quarter year-on-year growth in the pre-existing markets. And then new markets that have been launched this year is about $10 million that includes a little bit from the U.S. from the early experience program. So year-on-year growth and then sequentially, I think was your question, and we're still up a few million sequentially. Just keep in mind, Q3 last year, as we said, we have a bit of a tougher comp for Q3, because that's when we released sort of the allocations that we're on and the supply constraints. So that is factoring a little bit, but we still had 33% in the in the EU sort of locations in markets where we had previously launched. So that's still a very robust growth despite the comp.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from David Westenberg with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead
David Westenberg: Hi. Thank you for taking the question. Just on 2024 on derm, do you expect the competitive launch outside of the one we already know from Elanco. How comfortable do you feel about your decision to price Apoquel Chewables at parity with your existing products? And are there any analogs for chewables as a competitive differentiator in front of a competitive launch? And just as a quick follow-up on the R&D. It did step down a little bit, and I think you're guiding for it down. Is there anything are we reading in it too much to say maybe there's not a new product -- a significant new product in 2024, 2025 and maybe reading into that too much.
Kristin Peck : Sure. As we look for competition in dermatology to your question, we are expecting competition in the second half of next year. Our knowledge is that really there's only one that we're aware of at this point that we're expecting in 2024. We obviously don't know when in the second half that it would be coming. But we're well positioned for competition. As we've been preparing for competition for a while. We both have Cytopoint, we have monopole antibodies. We've got Apoquel. We've got Chew. We've got a pipeline behind that of continued life cycle innovations with longer-duration monoclonal antibodies, other species. So dermatology is a critical portfolio for us. We're continuing to grow. We did 14% in the quarter. So we're going to invest heavily behind this to make sure that we can continue to grow both our portfolio and the market overall. And if you look at chewable pricing, our strategy was let's move everybody to a product that's even easier that their dog like even more that they see as a treat, before you have competition, which we're expecting to be in a film coated tablet, similar to the original Apoquel. So we do see this as a really strong defense strategy for us. We've been seeing great as you look at the growth in international in the quarter. It was led by the conversion to Apoquel Chewable. And in the U.S., a lot of the growth in derm for us was also led by retail, which has done really, really well. To your point on R&D, I'll let Wetteny take it, but there's absolutely nothing going on there in the sense of any weakness in our portfolio. But Wetteny, do you want to talk about sort of what drove some of that?
Wetteny Joseph : Yes, absolutely. Look, as Kristin just said, we remain on target with our regulatory milestones with respect to R&D spend was up about 13% year-over-year on the quarter. So clearly, well above our revenue growth rate. So what you're seeing in terms of our overall expectations for the year versus where we're landing is just a matter of timing on the span of gross projects, but nothing significant or notable there. Again, we continue to drive innovation, both across new innovation as well as life cycle innovation across our portfolio, and we're very excited about the progress we're making in R&D.
Kristin Peck : Yes. It's mostly just timing of investments. I mean it varies quarter-to-quarter. 
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Michael Ryskin : Right. Thanks for taking question. Mostly, I want to focus on Trio. You had a really solid result in the U.S., but it's sort of in that ramping up phase. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the market between yourself and the key competitors, BI, Merck, Elanco and specifically, BI just flashed NexGard PLUS, we saw a relatively surprising decline in Bravecto revenues from Merck? So I'm just curious, any change to competitive dynamics, anything you're seeing in terms of pricing or stocking or destocking and how that impacts Trio? And then just a follow-up on the very last question. CapEx as well, you slashed the guide this year pretty significantly. I think I heard you say Wetteny, the $725 million to $750 million and previously it was I think, $900 million to $1 billion. So just curious, did that get pushed out into '24 as well? Or is there -- any other change there?
Kristin Peck : Sure. I'll take the first half of the question, see if Wetteny want to build on it and then Wetteny, if you want to handle the CapEx question. We did see strong growth in Trio in the quarter, 20% in Q3 for Trio. It remains the number 1 fleet tick heartworm in the U.S. by revenue. And really importantly, it's continuing to grow share. It's up 3% in the quarter. It's also growing patient share, which was up 2% in the quarter. So we're expecting solid growth this year. Obviously, we -- there's a new competitor. But in the Q4, I would also say to watch, we got a challenging comp as you look at us in Q4. If you remember, we got back into stock and ran a number of promotions in Q4 of last year. But we continue to expect strong growth for the year there. Even with the destocking that we saw in the U.S. in Q1 and the pre-price buying, as we talked about before that you had in Q4 of 2022. So we see this as a franchise that will continue to grow. A lot of our growth is really being driven by our auto ship, by retail, which remains very strong for us, with our corporate accounts. This is also a category where you do see low switching once you get on a product. So we do believe the broadest portfolio, but continue to see strength in Trio. So we're happy with the growth we've seen there. But Wetteny, anything you add that I miss there, and you want to talk about CapEx?
Wetteny Joseph : Yes, sure. Look, on Trio, I think you covered it well, $206 million of revenue in the quarter. That's up 20% operationally. We're very pleased with that, including the patient share gains that Kristin already described. On CapEx, yes, we did reduce our CapEx expectations for the year from about $950 million to $1 billion down to $725 million to $750 million. This is really on timing of project spend. We remain committed to the investments that we're making. And this is still representing about a 25% increase in CapEx year-over-year. So as we said at Investor Day, excise CapEx to remain elevated for the next couple of years, and then we'll start to bring that down sort of in the range of a growth rate that approximates our revenue growth range as you go beyond '24, ‘25-time frame. So again, really just don't matter of timing is what you're seeing from a CapEx standpoint.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Brandon Vazquez with William Blair. Please go ahead.
Brandon Vazquez : Hi. Good morning, thank for taking my question. On the companion animal side of things, it's a nice strong quarter. I think you had said, if I heard you correctly, that in 2023, you expect full year organic growth, double digits. The question being, I think you're at 7% year-to-date. I'm kind of being a little dangerous here and playing with my model live, but I think it implies kind of like a high teens organic growth in companion animal in the fourth quarter. One, am I thinking about that correctly? And then two, what's kind of giving you the confidence that the business can do that, especially, I think Q4 is a little bit more difficult year-over-year comp.
Wetteny Joseph : Yes, I'll be happy to take that. Look, we continue to see, as you saw this quarter, 11% operational growth in companion animal. And though we have some tough comps, as Kristin just referenced with the Trio answer on previous question, we are expecting very, very strong growth across companion animal. And keep in mind, we have some comp challenges with respect to livestock, which will decelerate from what it is on a year-to-date basis, about 6% to a low single-digit growth. So as you look at what's factored into the guidance that we just gave in narrowing the range, but still maintaining our midpoint, if you will, you can factor that into your equation in terms of what the livestock versus companion animal mix is as we exit the year.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Balaji Prasad with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Balaji Prasad : Hi. Good morning. A couple of questions from me. Firstly, to the extent you can without commenting on any '24 guidance. Can you highlight some of the macro factors and how you expect that to change? Speaking -- looking at the diagnostic space of consumer trends, better option volume? And secondly, a bit more specific. Can you speak about your Librela supply plans? You recently opened a facility, a new facility in Lincoln and what impact does that have for supply costs and margins?
Kristin Peck : Sure. I'll start with the beginning and then Wetteny maybe you can build on it. We continue to see very strong macro drivers in animal health. It's really led by the humanization of pets, which is a global trend. It's also led we continue to look at 2024 as to who's adopting those pets, which is more of millennial and Gen-Z and importantly, more income households, who are really raising the standard of care that they want to spend on their pets. We see this as important drivers as we bring real innovation to the market with Librela, with Solensia certainly continuing with Cytopoint which is growing very strongly. So we look at the drivers of pet care globally, which is really who's adopting the pest, how they want to spend on their pets and looking at revenue per clinic, which continues to grow very strongly, which is what we're really correlated against. It's something that continues into 2024. These are strong macro drivers for us. As we've spoken about on the livestock side, we really believe that market historically, and we believe in the future will continue to grow. 2% to 4%, low single digits. And as we said, we were going to return to that growth rate as we start to fully lap the challenges with DRAXXIN. So as you look at livestock, what's driving that is a growing middle class and more consumption of protein, with the whole Ozempic thing aside, which really hasn't really impacted livestock or the consumption of protein globally, really because of who is really driving a lot of that growth, which is middle classes across the globe, and more and more people entering that and seeing and upgrading their protein. So we look at those macro drivers, and we really don't see any changes if we look into not just 2024, but 2025 and 2026. And when we bring innovation to those markets, we believe we can continue to grow ahead of that. So Wetteny, I'm not sure if I missed anything there, and if you want to take the second half of the question?
Wetteny Joseph : No, I think you covered the macro dynamics well, Kristin. On the supply question with respect to Librela, we are very confident in our supply plans to meet the demand expectations for Librela that we have certainly for '24 and beyond. Mentioning the Lincoln facility, certainly in addition to both our internal capacity and third party that we are using, we continue to invest internally. And I think if you look at Lincoln that will be a factor, particularly as you go beyond 2024, with respect to supply planning fully well and other maps as well. So again, very confident in our ability to meet those demand expectations, and we've already factored the ramp that we saw in Europe in our thinking around demand there as well.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll take our next question from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead
Chris Schott: This is Ekaterina on for Chris. Thank you so much for taking a question. So first, very quickly, just on veterinary visits and the pressure we've been seeing there recently, can you just remind us how sensitive Zoetis is to be dynamic and maybe your latest thinking around how visits are going to trend maybe into 4Q and potentially into 2024, if you want to comment on that. And then the second question is just on U.S. cattle. Can you just elaborate a little bit more on the dynamics you saw in the quarter? Because I think one of your competitors mentioned the timing of the cattle kind of was shifted earlier this year. Is this something that you saw as well? And does that potentially create a headwind for you as you think about the fourth quarter?
Kristin Peck : Thanks, Ekaterina. I'll take your first question and Wetteny can build on me and then take the second. That business were flat year-to-date, which is what we've expected and what we talked about previously. In the quarter, they were down around 1.5% and as you discussed, we're really not as reliant on vet visits. The better proxy for us is revenue because again, remember that a lot of our products don't need to be purchased in the clinic. If you look at both auto ship, as you look at retail, you look at chronic medications, all of this continues to have us a higher correlation with overall revenue growth in the clinic. Historically, as we talked about before, vet clinic visits are flat to maybe 1% and if you look at where they stand today, they're still ahead of where they were pre-pandemic. So we don't pay as much attention to that vet clinic visit. If you look at revenue in the clinic, our growth in companion animal was higher than even that number, and that's because we're driving so much innovation there overall. So if you look at vet clinics business, we're not as tied to that number as we continue to say. So I don't know if there's anything I miss there Wetteny, what you want to build on, and then you want to take the second question?
Wetteny Joseph : Yes, sure. The only thing I would add on the vet clinic visits is you see our growth continues to outpace that of the clinic growth. And the vet visits were not as they're important, right? But we're not as sensitive to visit because therapeutics and chronic indications tend to power through that. And you can still see volume growth even as visits are down. And then the retail piece, which is continuing to grow. We've seen an additional 24% points as a percentage of our pet care revenues in the U.S. each year. So we've gone from 11% from about 5% just a few years ago. So we continue to see that in the quarter, it was up about 35%, if you look at our retail sales. So those are the factors I would add. With respect to the cattle dynamics and livestock in general, I would say clearly, we've had a very strong start to the year through the first 9 months. Livestock is up about 6%. Clearly, we're signaling that will come down in the fourth quarter. And that's really more of a factor of variability across quarters, given the timing of supply that we've had in the prior year versus the current year. The timing of when we've taken price adjustments for Jackson, for example, which impacted Q2 versus Q3 as well as Q4 this year as we're anticipating a step in that -- at the end of the year. So that will put some more pressure on Q4. We factored all that into our guidance that we've just issued today, which we are still in line with our expectations that we started the year with, which is right around our midpoint, we just narrowed it. So all those are in. With respect to capital dynamics around, we haven't seen anything that would say there's a pronounced shift with respect to the cattle run here. But again, we factored all these items into our thinking and what we've just iterated today from a guidance standpoint.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Steve Scala TD Colin. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst : Hi. This is Chris on for Steve. Thanks a taking a question. We had 2. First, on the U.S. on the parasiticide market, can you provide an update on the estimated volume share of topical today? And then looking ahead to 2024, what is the risk of significant pricing pressure on Trio from the month of Credelio Quattro. Assuming a non-inferior product label type seems like the main level they could both to grow their market share. And then a clarifying question on U.S. Librela, can you confirm that U.S. sales were 0 in Q3? And then looking ahead to Q4, do you still expect sales to be immaterial for the full year?
Wetteny Joseph : Yes. Look, I'm not sure if I got the second question, but I'm going to give it a shot and then ask you to clarify. On the parasiticides market, we still estimate in terms of volume, nearly half is still in the collars and topicals, but from a value perspective dollars, we're significantly leaning on the calls and prescription. As those are at higher price points. I think you're asking a specific question about share for specific products within the topicals and collars and I don't have that to hand. But if it was a different question, I'll ask you to clarify after I give you an answer on Librela. So Librela, in the third quarter was minimal. As you know, in September, we had an early experience program. That was only about 400 clinics very limited with KOLs to get them using the product and being able to talk about it, et cetera, and helping with refining protocols and so on. And so the number was like $3 million in the quarter, not meaningful at all. And given the timing of the full launch in October and with the holidays coming, it is not going to have a meaningful impact on the full year growth again on that point. But I'll ask you to clarify if I didn't get the question right on Paris.
Operator: It appears disconnected at this time.
Kristin Peck : Next question?
Operator: And there are no further questions at this time. I'll turn it back to Kristin for closing remarks.
Kristin Peck : Great. Thank you, everybody. Great questions today. Once again, we want to reiterate that we remain confident in our ability to achieve our full year guidance based on the diverse and innovative portfolio that continues to drive our success. We are firmly committed to continuing to invest in that portfolio as we look at the opportunities ahead of us, through DTC and building our capabilities to support our growth, but we'll also continue to manage our costs and ensure we're creating value for our shareholders. We continue to grow faster than the market by focusing on our people and our colleagues and on operational excellence and agility. They deliver every day for our business and for our customers. So we look forward to updating you on the full year and our long-term value proposition and hopefully seeing many of you in San Francisco at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference to kick off 2024. Thanks, everybody.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-08-08 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Second Quarter 2023 Financial Results Conference Call and Webcast for Zoetis. Hosting the call today is Steve Frank, Vice President of Investor Relations for Zoetis. The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, and will not be forwarded automatically. In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately 2 hours after the conclusion of this call via dial-in or on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.
Steve Frank: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Zoetis second quarter 2023 earnings call. I am joined today by Kristin Peck, our Chief Executive Officer; and Wetteny Joseph, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I will remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statements in today’s press release and our SEC filings, including, but not limited to, our Annual Report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q. Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and the company’s 8-K filing dated today, Tuesday, August 8, 2023. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. With that, I will turn the call over to Kristin.
Kristin Peck: Thank you, Steve, and welcome everyone to our second quarter earnings call for 2023. I hope you were able to join us or listen to our Investor Day this past May. If you missed it, please checkout our replay on zoetis.com. I think you will find it worth the time in learning more about Zoetis and where we see future growth in animal health. We appreciated the opportunity to step beyond the cadence of our quarterly earnings call and speak to about the long range perspective on our business and on our industry during Investor Day. We also appreciated your questions and the ongoing dialogue about the issues most important to you. As you know, we shared more detail about our growth strategy, innovative pipelines, and the key franchises, capabilities and investments we are making to build on our competitive advantages as the world leader in animal health. The four tenets of our value proposition were affirmed and expanded on throughout the day, and you can expect us to revisit that framework and provide progress updates in future investor interactions. Our goal is always to ensure that you understand how we are positioned to deliver on our value proposition, the revenue growth, strategic investments, margin expansion and capital returns. With that covered, let's turn now to the second quarter financial results. Today, we reported strong second quarter results of 9% operational growth in revenue and 12% operational growth in adjusted net income based on our diverse portfolio across markets and species. As expected, we return to a more balanced segment growth this quarter with 11% operational growth internationally, and 7% growth in the U.S. Our companion animal portfolio grew 11% operationally, driven by our major franchises in dermatology, osteoarthritis pain and pet parasiticides. The second quarter results and drivers were more in line with our performance trends in recent years, with innovations and strength in our companion animal portfolio leading the way. Meanwhile, our livestock portfolio grew 4% operationally in the second quarter, driven by sales of poultry, cattle and fish products, and continue to demonstrate the benefits of our diversified portfolio across species and geographies with a strong first half. Overall, the first half of 2023 has played out much as we expected. We have grown revenue 6% operationally in the first half, driven by strong results from our international markets and livestock performance, which were partially offset by the distributor destocking we explained in the first quarter. As expected, the impact of distributor destocking in our U.S companion animal portfolio has stabilized and was not a significant factor in the second quarter. We continue to see strong customer demand for our companion animal portfolio. For the first half of 2023, companion animal grew 5% operationally. We believe companion animal should be a bigger driver of performance for the remainder of the year with a stronger second half driven by our key franchises. While we are monitoring how inflationary pressures may impact pet care spending in markets around the world, the underlying demand has remained steady and resilient to date, and this is what we have seen historically. In the U.S., veterinary clinic visits continue to stabilize staying relatively flat through the first half of the year, and clinic revenue and spend per visit were both up about 9% in the U.S in the first half. Meanwhile, our livestock portfolio grew 8% operationally in the first half of 2023, reflecting strong growth internationally and continued supply recovery in our U.S cattle products. We expect live -- livestock growth for the full year to be in the low single digits operationally, reflecting tougher comparisons in the second half of the year for our U.S portfolio. With the first half of the year playing out largely as expected, we are maintaining our full year guidance for operational growth of 6% to 8% in revenue, and 7% to 9% in adjusted net income, at our companion animal portfolio we expect Librela and Solensia to continue to ramp up in various markets as we build our franchise for osteoarthritis pain. One way we are supporting growth for both products is increased use of direct-to-consumer campaigns in launch markets. These campaigns are building disease and product awareness, creating conversations among vets and pet owners and accelerating our efforts in markets where DTC is available. We're also pleased to have received U.S regulatory approvals in the second quarter for Librela and for Apoquel Chewable. Both have been performing well in markets outside the U.S to date. Librela is expected to launch in the U.S in November with an early experience trial beginning in September. As we look at the second half, we continue to expect strong growth, even as we factor in uncertainty around the macroeconomic conditions and drought that exists in certain countries around the globe, particularly Asia Pacific, and tougher comparisons for U.S livestock portfolio in the U.S. As we have seen historically in these types of environments, our global footprint and diverse portfolio provide more stability to our business during uncertain times. And we remain ready to pivot resources and investments to the greatest opportunity areas that it can ensure we continue to deliver on our commitments. For example, we continue to expand in large and growing product areas, such as parasiticide, dermatology, monoclonal antibodies for pain, vaccines and diagnostics, and invest in the franchises and capabilities that support our future growth, many of which we discussed at Investor Day. Before I wrap up, three quick points around our colleagues. First, I want to welcome Ester Banque to our Zoetis Executive Team as EVP and President of U.S Operations. Ester joined us in July coming most recently from Bristol Myers Squibb, and having spent a major part of her career at Novartis as well. She brings diverse global experience in health care, and an impressive track record of driving results to Zoetis. And I'm happy to say she is already off and running with the U.S business. I also wanted to call out the recent publication of our 2022 sustainability report. This year's report captures how sustainability is integrated across the business and shares the progress we are making toward are driven to care aspirations. This report honors our outstanding Zoetis colleagues who champion our purpose and work every day to make us the world's most trusted and valued animal health company. And finally, I wanted to mention a recent recognition from Fast Company, which names Zoetis as one of the Best Workplaces for Innovators. Shaping animal care through innovation is something we've always done across the company, and it's been a key element of our success. This is a well deserved honor for our culture, and our people who continuously strive to solve critical unmet medical needs in animal health from chronic illnesses, like osteoarthritis pain and allergic dermatitis for pets to emerging infectious diseases, threatening the food supply. I'm truly proud of our colleagues for receiving this recognition. In conclusion, with a solid first half behind us, I remain very positive about achieving our full year guidance, thanks to the purpose driven colleagues, innovation driven culture and diverse portfolio that continue to drive our success. Thank you. And now let me hand it off to Wetteny. Wetteny?
Wetteny Joseph: Thank you, Kristin, and good morning. As Kristin mentioned, we had a strong second quarter with balanced growth across both our companion animal and livestock portfolios, as well as our U.S and international segments. In the second quarter, we generated revenue of $2.2 billion, growing 6% on a reported basis and 9% on an operational basis. Adjusted net income of $652 million were 15% on a reported basis and 12% on an operational basis. Of the 9% operational revenue growth, 4% is from price and 5% is from volume. Volume growth consisted of 2% from other in-line products, 2% from new products, including our monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain and 1% from our key dermatology portfolio. Companion animal products are the primary driver of growth this quarter, growing 11% operationally with livestock growing 4% on an operational basis in the quarter. For companion animal, our key dermatology portfolio was the largest contributor to growth in the quarter, posting $355 million in revenue, our largest quarter ever and representing 14% growth on an operational basis. We saw double-digit operational growth in both international and the U.S. driven by strong growth in Cytopoint as well as growth driven by Apoquel and the conversion to Apoquel Chewable in certain international markets. Our monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain in dogs and cats, Librela and Solensia posted $69 million in revenue globally in the quarter with strong demand for both products as well as the impact of the launch of Librela in several new international markets. Our companion animal parasiticides also contributed to growth in the quarter, driven by our Revolution franchise, which had $103 million in revenue and grew 22% operationally. Simparica Trio also contributed to the parasiticide growth with $248 million of revenue and growth of 5% operationally. Our global companion animal diagnostics portfolio recorded $92 million in revenue in Q2, growing 12% operationally. We saw double-digit growth in the U.S. driven by high instrument placements in the quarter and disruptions from the implementation of our new field force model that impacted the prior year. Sales of our livestock products grew 4% on an operational basis in the quarter. We saw growth across both our U.S. and international segments driven by poultry, cattle and fish. Now moving on to revenue growth by segment for the quarter. U.S. revenue was $1.2 billion in the quarter, growing 7% with companion animal products growing 7% and livestock sales growing 5%. As Kristen mentioned, our companion animal performance in the quarter reflects the stabilization of the distributor inventory levels that were a headwind to our growth in Q1. U.S. vet visits were flat in the quarter. [Indiscernible] revenue growth and average revenue per visit were both up 8%. These trends are in line with expectations and continue to reflect the stabilization post-COVID. Turning to U.S. product performance. Our key dermatology product sales were $241 million for the quarter, growing 10% and benefited from higher periodic patient visits in the quarter. Cytopoint sales continue to drive growth with vets and pet owners showing a preference for injectables. Our U.S. small animal vaccines revenue grew 20% in the quarter, driven by higher sales of our canine influenza virus vaccine due in part to a competitor back order as well as higher sales into certain corporate and strategic accounts. Apoquel Chewable posted sales of $213 million in the quarter, growing 2%. Growth was driven by inpatient demand across all channels, partially offset by a difficult comparison period given the timing of distributor shipments from last year during our supply challenges as well as aggressive competitive promotion in the current quarter. Our growth cadence for Trio across the year will be impacted by the timing of supply recovery in 2022, and we expect growth rate improvement in the second half. As expected, we received FDA approval for Librela in the U.S. in May. We look forward to starting our early experience program in late Q3 with an expected November launch. Now turning to U.S. livestock. We saw 5% growth in our livestock portfolio in the quarter, primarily from our cattle business where we saw significant growth in Jackson, resulting from a favorable comparative quarter last year when an anticipated midyear price reduction limited sales in the quarter. Additional U.S. cattle growth came from Synovex, which benefited from our reimplementation label claim. Our U.S. poultry portfolio also contributed to growth of 11% based on our vaccine portfolio and an increased focus on egg layer market. We also benefited from favorable MFA rotations at certain large producers. Moving on to our International segment, where revenue was $1 billion, growing 6% on a reported basis and 11% operationally in the quarter. International companion animal revenue grew 17% operationally in the quarter, while livestock revenue grew 4% operationally. Increased sales of companion animal products resulted from growth of our small animal parasiticides, our monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain and our key dermatology products. Our international parasiticide portfolio growth was primarily driven by a revolution franchise with $57 million in revenue, growing 52% operationally driven by the lack of supply last year, which particularly impacted China in the second quarter of 2022. Our Simparica franchise also contributed to growth with continued market share expansion, especially in Latin America, Europe and Asia. We continue to see strong adoption of Librela and Solensia. Librela generated $48 million in revenue with 89% operational growth in the quarter driven by strong growth in Europe, supported by our direct-to-consumer advertising efforts in major markets and recent launches in various international markets, including Canada, Australia, Brazil and Japan. Solensia delivered $11 million of second quarter sales internationally, driven by higher demand and supported by direct-to-consumer marketing efforts. Our international key dermatology portfolio grew 22% operationally. We continue to see double-digit operational growth across most of our major markets, driven by growth from and conversion to Apoquel Chewable as well as from Cytopoint with higher compliance and new patients. Our growth also benefited from a weak comparative quarter in Japan, which was impacted by pre-priced buy ups in Q1 of last year. Moving on to our international livestock portfolio, which grew 4% on an operational basis in the quarter. Our poultry portfolio performed well with growth driven by key account penetration and MFA rotations in core poultry markets, including Europe, the Middle East and Latin America. Our fish portfolio continues to perform well as a result of increased sales of vaccines across salmon markets in Norway and Chile. Lastly, our cattle portfolio saw gains in Turkey, Brazil and Argentina from strong price growth and the recovery of supply issues. Now moving on to the rest of the P&L for the quarter. Adjusted gross margin of 72.4% improved 260 basis points on a reported basis compared to the prior year, resulting from favorable foreign exchange, price increases and favorable product mix. This was partially offset by higher manufacturing costs in the quarter. Adjusted operating expenses increased 8% operationally with both SG&A and R&D growing 8% operationally driven primarily by headcount-related compensation costs due to the timing of new hires in 2022 and the impact of annual salary increases. The lower growth in R&D expenses this quarter is reflective of the timing of spend in project investments and not a reduction in our expected R&D spend for the full year. Year-to-date, adjusted R&D expenses has grown 13% operationally. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.5%, an increase of 80 basis points, driven by higher net discrete tax expenses in the quarter, mainly related to changes to prior year's tax positions and less favorable jurisdictional mix of earnings, partially offset by a higher benefit in the U.S. related to foreign-derived intangible income. And finally, adjusted net income grew 12% operationally and adjusted diluted EPS grew 14% operationally in the quarter. Capital expenditures in the second quarter were $166 million and continue to be on track with our expectations for the year. In the quarter, we repurchased $324 million of Zoetis shares. Now moving on to guidance for the full year 2023. Please note that guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late July, beginning with revenue for the full year due to unfavorable foreign exchange we are slightly lowering our revenue range while maintaining our guidance on operational revenue growth. We expect revenue between $8.50 billion and $8.65 billion, representing a range of 6% to 8% operational growth. With the approval of Librela in the U.S., we are now including our projected sales for November and December in our guidance, which are expected to be immaterial to our overall operational growth rate. Their impact on the full year revenue is largely offset by potential uncertainty in China as well as broader macroeconomic conditions in certain markets. Operationally, the first half has played out largely as we expected with 6% operational revenue growth. We expect stronger growth in the second half of the year overall, especially in our U.S. companion animal business. In livestock, which has grown 8% year-to-date on an operational basis. We anticipate unfavorable comparisons in the second half, driven by the timing of price decreases in Jackson in the U.S. last year, and the resumption of supply of several products after outages in the first half of 2022. We expect adjusted net income to be in the range of $2.50 billion to $2.55 billion, slightly above our previous guidance while maintaining our previous guidance of operational growth of 7% to 9%, driven by foreign exchange favorability in cost of sales and expenses, which were partially offset by unfavorability in revenue. Reported diluted EPS increases to a range of $5.15 to $5.27, which is impacted by foreign exchange and a one-time gain from a business development deal. And finally, due to the impact of foreign exchange, we are increasing adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.37 to $5.47. Just to summarize before we go to Q&A, we saw strong well based growth in the second quarter, growing in both companion animal and livestock as well as in the U.S. and internationally, with contributions from price and volume. We expect stronger growth as we move into the second half. We remain confident in our ability to deliver on our operational full year guidance commitments. We continue to see improving fundamentals in the overall industry and remain committed to delivering on our value proposition to grow revenue faster than the market and to grow adjusted net income faster than revenue. Now I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Michael Ryskin: Great. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the quarter, Kristen and Wetteny. I want to start with Trio real quickly. We've seen -- we finally see NexGard Plus in the U.S. from Boehringer Ingelheim. I just want to ask, how do you see this market playing out? There's a lot of debate on the label differences Trio versus NexGard Plus, the 6 month versus 1 month warm detail as well as how it's going to be priced with the promotions being put out at the start of the launch. So what are your expectations for Trio now that the competition is finally here both for second half and for 2024. And if I could squeeze in a follow-up. I want to ask on Librela. It continues to be really well OUS. I think it's on track for over 200 million this year from OUS alone. Any learnings or changes to your assumptions now that you can take that into the U.S. launch. Fair to say that it could be incremental 75 million, 100 million to revenue next year? Thanks.
Kristin Peck: Sure. Thanks, Mike. I'll start with the first question and let Wetteny follow-up on Librela. Yes, as we saw the -- this was the label for NexGard Plus was largely what we expected. I think Simparica Trio clearly has a superior label, and it was first to market. Right now Simparica Trio is #1 in companion animal [indiscernible] in the U.S. As you look at where we are, we've had 3 years of demonstrated efficacy and experience with this product. And we'll clearly leverage our retail auto ship to continue that. As you look at NexGard Plus, it obviously does not, as you saw, have heartworm from first dose -- it has 4 ticks versus 5. It doesn't yet have a label to prevent line. It has a lower minimum weight. So we really do think we have a strength in our Simparica Trio label will be aggressive, obviously, in competing against them. We are expecting a much stronger Q3 for the product based on comparable. So we expect a strong second half for us. We are expecting significant promos. We watch them do this before. This is something BI does often. So beyond the promos, we think we can be very competitive with our product based on the strength of our label, the strength of the experience with the product. Our relationships clearly with the corporates and really with a very pleased pet owner who's on this product. So obviously, we're ready for some significant competition, but we remain very confident overall and our strength in [indiscernible], and we see a stronger growth obviously in the next quarter and the second half for [indiscernible] overall. But Wetteny, do you want to take this question on Librela?
Wetteny Joseph: Sure. Mike, thanks for the question. Look, we remain really on track with EU performance, and we are very pleased to see $48 million of Librela revenues in the quarter, up 89% versus the prior year. We also launched a product in a number of new markets in our International segment including Japan, Australia, Brazil and Canada. Those contributed about $10 million for the quarter. So we continue to see really strong demand for the product, and we are starting to initiate DTC campaigns, which will continue to drive awareness across both Librela and Solensia in our markets. It is already, as we said last year, the #1 osteoarthritis pain product in the EU. Look, we won't necessarily get into what the expectations are for next year. Obviously, we'll do that as we get into guidance for the year. We are expecting to continue to see strong growth for Librela on the balance of the year. I will note, last year, we did see a bit of an uptick in the third quarter. That was, as we released the allocations that we are on, and we saw clinics order a bit more, that was offset in Q4. So just a little bit of a dynamic in Q3 and Q4. But really with the new markets as well as continued growth in EU, we are expecting very strong growth in the third quarter as well.
Operator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs.
Nathan Rich: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the questions. First, Wetteny, I wanted to start with the outlook for companion. I think you had talked about it improving in the back half of the year. Was that relative to the 5% growth in the first half? Or is that relative to the second quarter growth, which is obviously higher. Any context you can kind of provide as well on just kind of cadence through Q2 versus 4Q would be helpful. And then just a follow-up on the commentary on Trio. Could you maybe just talk about the 2% operational growth and the different factors that impacted that in the quarter and then the kind of type of growth that you would expect in the back half of the year, just given the competitive launch that you mentioned as well as maybe a normalization of supply.
Wetteny Joseph: Yes, I'd be happy to take this and see what Kristin wants to add. With respect to companion animal, as we said, and I think you saw us really reiterate our guidance from an operational perspective 6% to 8%. Now while livestock has seen about 8% growth in the first half, we saw 4% growth in livestock in the second quarter operationally. We are expecting -- as we said in the prepared commentary, livestock to come in, in the low single-digit range. So I think you can clearly see that the growth in the back half of the year is going to be significantly driven by companion animal. And as we said also, given the timing of supply in 2022, we are facing -- relatively speaking, an easier comp in the U.S. companion animal business in the third quarter versus, say, the fourth quarter. So I think those will play out in terms of how you get -- how you map out to our guidance on an operational perspective, being largely driven by companion animal in the back half of the year. I think overall, not just from a companion animal perspective, overall, I would expect the third quarter to be another strong quarter for us. I would expect us to come in somewhere between the mid and high-end of our annual range. We said after last quarter, given the distributor destocking impact to a normalized growth for the rest of the year which would translate to somewhere -- if you just pick the midpoint of our guidance, that will be around 8%. We came in slightly above that, really in line with our expectations on the quarter. And so you can map out what that means for the rest of the year, but I would expect Q3 to be slightly above Q4 given what I just shared from a companion animal perspective versus less like that has a tougher comp in the third quarter, particularly in the U.S. Trio, like Kristin said, we are starting [ph] very strong quarter in third quarter despite the competitive launch, which we believe to be imminent here. Part of that is the cadence last year. I think the rhythm of supply last year clearly had an impact where we saw a bigger Q2 last year than in Q3. So I think you're going to see that play out with respect to the Trio growth. And given the first mover advantages that we have with Trio that's been in the market for over 3 years and our confidence in terms of our label, et cetera, we expect to see continued growth across Trio and a strong year for the year for Trio.
Operator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Jon Block with Stifel.
Jon Block: Great. Thanks, guys. Good morning. I'll [indiscernible] the front. I guess the first one, just any color on the gross margin. Wetteny, I think the 2Q '23 gross margin, I believe, might have been the best in the company's history. So maybe you could talk about the drivers there and more importantly, are some of those drivers sustainable? And then the second question might build a little bit on a prior question, which is, is Trio the modest, call it, downside driver of the implied companion animal '23 growth? Because I think I've got it right. Essentially, livestock went from flattish to up low single digits. Obviously, overall operational stayed unchanged at 6% to 8%. So the implied CA came down a bit. Do we think about Trio being responsible for that? And maybe just a byproduct of some of the promotions that you called out earlier? Thanks for your time.
Wetteny Joseph: Yes. Look, with respect to gross margin, you saw 72.4% gross margin on the quarter in Q2. That's up about 260 basis points versus last year. FX is about 200 basis points of that. And clearly, we've pegged our overall guidance on FX based on where rates were at the end of July. So I'm not going to venture to forecast what that might mean. But in terms of the other components that are driving our gross margin, price and mix, certainly were favorable for us. And as we've just discussed with respect to livestock having a tougher comp in the back half versus companion animal particularly into the third quarter, we expect price mix to continue to contribute favorably here. The other element, of course, is really manufacturing -- higher manufacturing costs. I think typically what you see is this first half is a little bit higher for us than the second half. Part of that is the mix with respect to cattle run in the fall that tends to have a little bit of a mix down on us overall. But I would say the overall mix for the company, given the back half strength in companion animal is going to be -- continue to be favorable. So we see that being something that will consistently sustain. And again, we won't get into next year's element until we get there. With respect to the second half, look, clearly, our expectations with Trio remain that we'll see strong growth contribution for Trio and we are going to see a very strong third quarter. I think some of the -- and by the way, the year has played out, as we said, we gave a range of 6% to 8% operationally, sitting here today after delivering a very strong second quarter, we remain in line with our expectations for the year at 6% to 8%. I think if you look at some of the areas that we're watching from a macro perspective, China is one of them. I think if you look at the data coming out of China, confidence levels for consumers are low, the savings rates are very high. And so we're watching that as well as the impact it has on the Southeast Asia region given the tourism impact that China has on that region. That's one of the areas. Certainly, we are watching here in terms of what goes into our thinking with respect to the balance of the year.
Kristin Peck: Yes, I just want to reiterate, it is not -- I would not call Trio what is driving any change in the second half. I really want to emphasize what Wetteny said and what we said in our remarks. It really is, as we are looking at uncertainties with China, Southeast Asia, Australia with the drought. So I mean, as always, when you run a large global company, I think the advantage of Zoetis is the diversity of our portfolio and the durability. And that's by market, that's by species, and that's by therapeutic area. So we are obviously seeing strength in a lot of areas, but obviously, uncertainties remain in China, Southeast Asia and certainly in some other markets around the world, certain ones such as if you look at, say, at Spain, et cetera, which has got high inflation and weather issues as well. So I would say, I just want to be very clear. I don't think your characterization of Trio specifically repairs is the concern in the second half. It is much more around some of these macroeconomic and geopolitical and whether uncertainties that we're seeing in certain markets.
Operator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Westenberg with Piper Sandler.
David Westenberg: Hi. Thank you for taking the question. So can you talk about the derm market in 2024? I'm not talking necessarily, but you're specifically -- but how you expect growth in monoclonals versus growth in small molecule with an incoming competitor. And if I could just squeeze in one really short one. Just want to confirm, Librela U.S. is not in the 2023 guidance. Thank you.
Kristin Peck: Sure. I can start with your second. Yes, Librela U.S. is in, as we did note, obviously, in Wetteny's remarks. But to get to your question on derm and Wetteny can certainly follow-up with you once on the derm question -- on the Librela question. But we have led the way, as you know, in dermatology with both a small molecule and large molecule. We've been driving awareness through DTC. We still think there's significant market potential here in developed and emerging markets. There's still plenty of dogs that are untreated here. We are really focusing on investing in direct-to-consumer branded in the U.S. and in some markets and unbranded outside. With that, if you're seeing this year, we are looking at double-digit growth. In Q2, we had 14% growth with double-digit growth in both products in the quarter, so real strength. And we are continuing to innovate here. I think you saw also approval for Apoquel-2 in the U.S. We will look for long-acting Cytopoint, look at species, we are expecting obviously competition. We've been expecting it for a while. We'll say again, we're expecting it in 2024, and we'll see what happens. But we really are seeing more of a preference from both the vet and the pet owner moving more to Cytopoint for compliance reasons, obviously, for EE [ph]. So I think we'll continue to see that. So we are seeing very strong growth in dermatology. Again, we are expecting double digits for the year. In the quarter, we had great strength against both, but I would like to be clear that as we are seeing do we think will grow faster. We are seeing greater focus from the vet and the pet owner on Cytopoint being a greater driver of our overall dermatology franchise, but really expect to follow that up with strong innovation continuing in what we think is a really important space, Wetteny do you want to add anything on derma's question or Librela?
Wetteny Joseph: Yes. Look, I think clearly, a really strong quarter for us in derm in the second quarter, and we are expecting another strong quarter and strong back half for derm across and clearly Cytopoint driving that as well. Just with respect to Librela, I just wanted to add a little bit of color in terms of our thinking there. Certainly, very pleased to have received approval in May. But really, consistent with our expectations, we've been sharing for the last, I think, 2 or 3 quarters, we've been expecting an approval to be -- to come in the first half of this year followed by an early experience program and then the launch late in the year is what we've been saying. We remain on track with that. We are planning to begin the early experience program next month with the launch to follow somewhere in the November time frame. Given the holidays and what's typically a little bit slower time frame with respect to clinics, et cetera, we're not expecting the contribution here to be significant to the growth for the year. And look, we continue to see great performance outside the U.S., and we are launching in other markets as well in line with our expectations as I shared a little bit earlier with an 89% growth rate on Librela on the quarter. And so we have factored that into the guidance here, but again, not a significant contribution.
Operator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Brandon Vazquez with William Blair.
Brandon Vazquez: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just first on EPS and guidance. I just wanted to clarify the beat was pretty strong in the quarter, I think about $0.09 relative to the industry [ph]. EPS at the midpoint for guidance came up 3 points and just clarify, is that entirely the delta between those two? Is that entirely FX? Or is there anything else there we should be keeping in mind? And then as we think of the rest of the year kind of following up on that guidance, I think you said 4% pricing in the quarter. Can you just remind us when some of these pricing increases came in? Does the benefit of pricing kind of slow down in the back half? And does that imply any improvements in volume and guidance? Thanks.
Wetteny Joseph: Yes, happy to answer. Look, as we said, we really reflected two things in our guidance today is, as we said, in fact, last quarter, FX was an area that we are watching, given the volatility that we are seeing across certain currencies that we operate in. And so we've updated guidance for FX both at the revenue line, which is negative. About -- it's about 75 basis points of growth essentially on a reported basis, that's impacting FX. So we reflected that here. But it's actually a positive contribution when you come down to EPS to the [indiscernible] $0.03. So what you're seeing there from an adjusted basis is really all FX. From a reported standpoint, we're also reflecting some gains that we saw from a couple of DB [ph] deals that are elevating the reported rate from an EPS perspective. The only other color I would ask -- add here with respect to the second half from the cadence is, again, we are expecting a very strong second half from a companion animal perspective versus livestock with the comps. I think if you look at the third quarter, we probably saw a bit lower OpEx in the prior year versus the fourth quarter. So I would expect OpEx will also be a little bit higher in Q3 versus Q4 as you look at the balance of the year. But other than that, I think price is something we typically do early in the year. There are certain markets where we may do a midyear price increase as well. But overall, price is something that happens fairly early in the year and pretty consistent with what you've seen in our numbers today.
Operator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Chris Schott with J.P. Morgan
Unidentified Analyst: Hi. Thank you so much. This is [indiscernible] on for Chris. So first question, on dermatology, can you just remind us where you are in terms of life cycle management? Any additional color that you kind of see with the dermatology portfolio kind of evolving over the next several years in terms of maybe potential new mechanisms or mode of administration. And then the second question is on Europe. You obviously had a very strong quarter for companion ex U.S. this quarter. Can you just elaborate a bit on the trends that you're seeing there and how you see them holding up in the second half of the year? Thank you so much.
Kristin Peck: Sure. Thanks, [indiscernible]. I'll take your questions and see what Wetteny wants to build on it. Life cycle innovation, obviously, is critical in dermatology. We're quite focused on it in a number of areas. I think you saw approval in May of -- or in the quarter of Apoquel Chewable which we had approved outside the U.S., but now got approved in the U.S. This is really important for a lot of pet owners who have trouble getting their dogs to take pills. So a chewable has real value there. We are also looking at monoclonal antibodies, looking at more long acting in that space. We are also looking at life cycle innovation around other species. Clearly, dermatology is a significant issue amongst many companion animals. So we'll continue to look for opportunities there. It is a big market. We will continue to lead in innovation and in life cycle innovation across a number of different areas. I said, from small molecules to monoclonal antibodies to additional species. So we are really focused there. As you look at Europe, I mean, I think for most companies that we say, the growth in Europe was ahead of what many of us expected for the year, mostly because I think we were expecting energy to be a much bigger issue certainly through the winter, et cetera. But we've seen a great strength, particularly in Northern Europe. But I would say that if you look at Southern Europe, I don't think it's performing as well as Northern Europe. They've got greater inflationary markets there as well as a number of weather issues with severe heat waves and drought across markets like Spain. But we really see the underlying demand in Europe and Northern Europe remaining strong, and we are seeing strong growth there. So I'm not sure, Wetteny, if you want to build on any of those comments.
Wetteny Joseph: Yes. Look, I think just stepping back from a companion animal performance perspective, we've continued to see strength there across our international markets. Even in emerging markets, just in Poland recently you're seeing a real uptick in terms of companion animal continuing to take hold. I think some of the innovation that we have may take some time to take hold in other markets outside the U.S. and it takes longer to get to those peak sales. We are continuing to see really strong derm growth across our international markets and so on. So we believe that is sustainable. The first half, we've seen really strong growth there in terms of companion animal. Across international, we saw 17% operational growth in companion animal in the quarter following a 10% growth in Q1. I would continue to expect double-digit growth, maybe not at the level we saw in Q2 in the back half for international, we continue to see double-digit growth there.
Operator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Louise Chen with Cantor. Louise, your line is unmuted. Please go ahead with your question.
Louise Chen: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So I wanted to ask you some of the pushes and pulls to your commitment to the mid to high single-digit revenue growth that you've talked about over the next 3 to 5 years? Thank you.
Kristin Peck: Sure. Thanks, Louise. We remain committed to the guidance we provided at Investor Day back in May. We really -- I would start with just the resiliency of the animal health industry. The industry itself, historically, as you know, grows at 4% to 6%. We see really strong tailwinds driving the industry over the next medium to long-term, increasing medicalization, especially in emerging markets, increases in population, really, the strength of the human animal bond. We are seeing increasing willingness to pay with 86% of pet owners say they'll pay whatever it takes to take care of their pet. But really where I think it differentiates Zoetis' innovation. Our innovation across chronic diseases. We look at -- what we can do as we talked about some of our new franchises that we think we will build over that time period as well. We look at an increasing global population, which is obviously driving the need for more sustainable ways of producing agriculture and meats and proteins, so we really think Zoetis will continue to outperform a market growing 4% to 6%. Historically, we've outperformed close to 3%. Zoetis is well diversified, and we are the innovation leader. We've got strong franchises today that are continuing to grow. Dermatology to be set, again this year are growing double-digit, parasiticides, OA pain, we've got strong diagnostics, emerging markets. So we really believe the industry is very attractive and very resilient. But most importantly, I think Zoetis as a leader in innovation will continue to drive this important space.
Operator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Balaji Prasad with Barclays. And Balaji, your line is open. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Good morning. This is [indiscernible] for Balaji. Thanks for taking our question. A quick one on the global parasiticide market. On the Investor Day, you expect the global parasiticide market to expand from 6.3 billion in 2022 to around 10 billion to 12 billion by 2032, which implies a CAGR of around 6%. You also mentioned that Zoetis expect to grow faster than the market in this segment. So would you give us above half range of the market share of Zoetis parasiticide business in the next 3 to 5 years? How much our future growth in this segment will be supported by new product launch and how much will be supported by revenue growth of Trio and Revolution Plus? Thank you.
Kristin Peck: Sure. Thanks for the question. I'll start and I'll let obviously Wetteny build there. We are the leader in parasiticides. We are really proud of that. We really see this as an important franchise. We have a broad set of products from Revolution to ProHeart to Simparica to Simparica Trio. We will be continuing to innovate in this important area. It is, by far, as you talked about, the largest therapeutic area in animal health. We really see a few things. Obviously, we are going to lead with innovation. We are going to lead with innovation in products that are easy to use, that really meet the customer demand as well as what our veterinarians are looking for. And we believe there's continued innovation in the space. We are looking at long actables, we are looking at injectables. We are looking at other combinations. Controlling parasites is critical to the overall health of the animal because if you don't, it creates lots of other issues. for animals. So we'll continue to grow in this important space. We think it will continue to be a major contributor to Zoetis' growth over the time period. So I don't know Wetteny, you want to add anything there?
Wetteny Joseph: Yes. Look, what I would say is parasiticide is a -- the biggest sort of market segment within animal health. It's also a very competitive space. Now if you look at [indiscernible] combination, all medications, these are relatively new standard of care, and we are going to continue to see those expand the market with respect to the number of doses as well as from a price perspective. And this is the area that we play in the oral space largely. And so I would expect us to grow faster than the market. But again, it's a competitive space, and we'll continue to innovate as others do as well.
Kristin Peck: Yes. The only thing I'd also add there is one other growth that we haven't talked about much today is increase in compliance. I think if you look at retail and auto ship [ph] and injectables, I think right now, if you believe that the research will show you the average pet is really on a bet 6 to 7 months, when they should be on 12 months for many of these products. So I think if we can do a better job of driving compliance either through auto ship on e-commerce or home delivery through the vet or dual [ph] as injectables where you can guarantee compliance. So we think there's lots of potential growth drivers for Zoetis to continue to drive this market and take share.
Operator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Steve Scala with TD Cowen.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi. Good morning. This is Chris on for Steve. We had two questions. First, on the U.S. pet health market. You mentioned U.S. vet visits were flat in the quarter. Is this capacity driven? Or is it more related to demand and weakening new patient visits and oneness visits? And then second, do you expect any headwind from the restart of student [ph] loan repayments this fall? Thank you.
Kristin Peck: Sure. Thanks. As you look at the vet visits, they -- we really have seen them, on average, be flattish for the first half of the year. But to be clear, they're still ahead of where they were pre-pandemic, we do not see that as a demand issue. As we've talked about on previous calls, it's really more of a supply issue in the sense of the veterinary workforce challenges. We are working hard to partner with vets to help address this. Certainly, we are finding new efficiencies in their clinic helping to support as we can, adding more vet tech, et cetera, financial support, you name it, to support it. But we are not seeing any concerns around demand for veterinary health care. We are really focused on making sure that the supply is there. So no, we are not seeing , we don't look at the flat vet visits and have a cause for concern. Historically, just so you know, vet visits have been, give or take, flat to 1-ish historically. So this is not really concerning. And if you look at the first half of the year, we saw a 9% increase in both average revenue per visit and revenue overall in the clinic. So we are continuing to see really strong demand for veterinary care and for our product, and we don't really see that changing. And now on your second question on headwinds from student loan, we're not expecting that to be a significant driver for us in the back half of this year or in 2024.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we have no further questions in queue. I'll turn the floor over to Kristin Peck for any additional or closing remarks.
Kristin Peck: Great. Thank you all for your questions today, and importantly, for your continued interest in Zoetis. Looking ahead, we really want to underscore that we remain confident in our full year guidance really because of sustainable underlying demand for animal health, as we just talked about, especially in uncertain times. We believe that the enduring strength of the human animal bond, their willingness to spend on pet health and the essential need for a safe and affordable food supply are all fundamental drivers of our growth. And I believe no one in the industry has a stronger set of capabilities and colleagues when it comes to meeting these customer needs, to advancing animal care and to creating shareholder value. So we look forward to keeping you updated on our progress, and thank you for your time today. Have a great day.
Operator: This does conclude the Zoetis second quarter 2023 financial results conference call and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-05-04 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the First Quarter 2023 Financial Results Conference Call and a Webcast for Zoetis. Hosting the call today is Steve Frank, Vice President of Investor Relations for Zoetis. The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, and will not be forwarded automatically. In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call via dial-in or on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. [Operator Instructions]. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.
Steve Frank: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Zoetis first quarter 2023 earnings call. I am joined today by Kristin Peck, our Chief Executive Officer; and Wetteny Joseph, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I will remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statements in today’s press release and our SEC filings, including, but not limited to, our Annual Report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q. Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and the company’s 8-K filing dated today, Thursday, May 4, 2023. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. With that, I will turn the call over to Kristin.
Kristin Peck: Thank you, Steve, and welcome everyone to our first quarter earnings call for 2023. Today, we reported solid first quarter results of 4% operational growth in revenue as expected, based on our diverse portfolio and strength in international markets. As we indicated in February, we expected a softer first quarter and a stronger growth for the remainder of the year, and we are reiterating our full year guidance for operational growth of 6% to 8% in revenue and 7% to 9% in adjusted net income, given the underlying strength of the petcare market. In the first quarter, our international segment led the way growing revenue 10% operationally and was partially offset by a 1% decline in the U.S. Our livestock portfolio drove the results with 12% operational growth in revenue, while companion animal product revenues were flat operationally. The performance in livestock was based on double-digit operational growth for cattle, poultry, sheep and fish. In the case of U.S. cattle, this performance was supported by an improvement in the supply of key products. Meanwhile, our companion animal portfolio in the U.S. declined due to distributors destocking and reducing their inventories in the first quarter. As well as higher purchases in the fourth quarter of 2022, which occurred in anticipation of price increases and based on promotional programs. We see strong end market demand in companion animal channels based on data from veterinary clinics, retailers and pet owners. And we view distributor inventories as a short-term impact on our companion animal sales. For example, while our sales into distributors declined in the quarter, as we expected, our product sales from distributors out to veterinary clinics were up approximately 8% and our product sales out of retail channels to pet owners were up about 35% up affirming a healthy petcare market in the U.S. Pet owner demand for product is expected to grow during the second quarter, pulling through more inventory and allowing purchase patterns by distributors to become more aligned with the underlying demand throughout the year. Other dynamics in the U.S. vet clinics also continue to show momentum and trending in a positive direction. Clinic visits increased 2% in the first quarter, showing an increase for the first time since 2021. Meanwhile, clinic revenue and average spend per visit continue to grow even in the face of inflationary pressures. Revenue and average dollars per visit increased 11% and 9% respectively in the quarter. The combination of evolving pet owner demographics, innovative medicines and an unbreakable human animal bond, all continue to support a positive and growing companion animal market where we lead. Despite the Q1 distributor issues in the U.S. our overall growth was driven by strength in international markets, which delivered 10% operational revenue growth in both livestock and companion animal portfolios. This quarter's results are a testament once again to how our diverse portfolio and geographic presence help deliver steady and predictable growth. Turning now to adjusted net income, we saw a decline of 3% operationally in the first quarter, which was in-line with our expectations. The first quarter reflected significant investments in our U.S. petcare field force and shifts in the go to market model for diagnostics, costs which were not incurred fully in the year ago quarter. We also saw increased investments in R&D, which we have discussed previously. The investments in diagnostics are maturing and gaining traction in the U.S., and we continue to grow and expand outside of the U.S. We expect a return to growth in U.S. diagnostics for the year as we build our Vetscan Imagyst AI platform, refine and grow our reference lab business and bring further innovative offerings to the space. Looking ahead, we see strong demand driving double digit operational growth for our innovative companion animal portfolio and relatively flat operational growth in our livestock portfolio this year. We will continue to invest in the franchises and capabilities that support our future growth, including large and growing product areas like parasiticides, dermatology, monoclonal antibodies, vaccines and diagnostics. For example, we continue to build out key product franchises through lifecycle innovations and claim extensions in products like Simparica Trio, Cytopoint and Draxxin. We are also expanding our global reach with approvals in additional markets for new livestock vaccines like Protivity, for beef and dairy calves, and Lawsotek for swine. And most recently, we purchased a manufacturing site outside Atlanta, Georgia, which will be used as a new monoclonal antibody, vaccine, and petcare product operation to add capacity for expected growth. As you know, our monoclonal antibody and vaccine platforms are rapidly growing and this new site would substantially expand manufacturing capacity for our biologics portfolio and ensure long-term supply across all global markets when it begins operations in 2026. While the overall economic uncertainty remains a headwind globally in 2020, 2023, we have proven to be up to any challenge. We have learned valuable lessons and built new muscles, especially over the last three years, developing more agility, flexibility and resilience in our business and our people. Despite the unusual mix of results in our first quarter, I continue to feel very positive about our full year guidance, and how our diverse portfolio and vision for the future of animal health can drive long-term sustainable growth, and create value for our customers and shareholders. We will continue to be disciplined yet adaptable in our approach to the opportunities, potential challenges and economic shifts that could occur throughout the year. We remain committed to delivering strong growth in 2023 based on our market leadership, innovative franchises and diverse portfolio, while continuing to invest for the future. Thank you. Now let me hand this off to Wetteny. Wetteny?
Wetteny Joseph: Thank you, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. We had a solid start to the year, with growth driven by our livestock business and strong international market performance. Echoing Kristin’s comment, our Q1 results are in-line with our expectations. As we indicated on our Q4 earnings call, we expected the first quarter to be below the low end of our forecasted annual operational growth rate of 6% for 2023. In the first quarter, we generated revenue of $2 billion growing 1% on a reported basis and 4% on an operational basis. Adjusted net income of $607 million declined 3% on both a reported and an operational basis. Of the 4% operational revenue growth, 5%age from price with a 1% decline in volume. The volume decline is driven primarily by U.S. companion animal distributor destocking in the quarter. Our livestock portfolio led the way in terms of species growth growing 12% operationally with companion animal revenues flat on an operational basis in the quarter. Livestock growth was broad based with double-digit operational growth across cattle, poultry, sheep and fish. The growth in cattle was driven by additional supply of key products in the U.S. We saw growth in our poultry portfolio driven by higher sales of vaccines. Our sheep products benefited from favorable market conditions in Australia as well as our acquisition of Jurox in the fourth quarter of 2022. Finally, our fish portfolio continues to perform well with double-digit operational growth driven by strong vaccine performance in Norway. Sales of our companion animal products were flat operationally in the quarter, with growth in our monoclonal antibody products, Cytopoint, Librela and Solensia, offsetting declines in Apoquel, parasiticides and anti-infectives. Our monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain in dogs and cats, Librela and Solensia posted $51 million in revenue globally in the quarter, with strong demand for both products. Additionally, Solensia benefited from our U.S. launch in the third quarter last year. As for Librela in the U.S. we still anticipate approval in the first half of this year with the launch later in the second half. Simparica Trio posted global revenue of $151 million in the quarter, representing an operational decline of 7% versus the comparable 2022 period. This was primarily the result of U.S. distributor destocking during the quarter, as well as pre-price increased buy-in and promotional activity during the fourth quarter. This decline was partially offset by growth in our international markets from increased clinic penetration and launches in new markets. Our key dermatology portfolio declined 3% percent operation only with $290 million in global revenue. This decline is attributed to the impact of pre-price increased buy-ins in the U.S. in Q4, and in Japan in the comparable period in 2022. Cytopoint partially offset this decline with double-digit growth based on continued veterinary preference for injectables, which keep revenues in the clinic. Cytopoint better reflects underlying market demand due to our direct sales model on our dermatology portfolio and the lack of retail channel impacts. While we do believe conversion from Apoquel to Cytopoint may be accelerating, our overall outlook for our key dermatology portfolio remains unchanged. Our companion animal diagnostics portfolio declined 3% operationally, with declines in the U.S. partially offset by growth internationally. Now moving on to revenue growth by segment for the quarter. U.S. revenue was $1 billion in the quarter declining 1% with companion animal products declining 7% and livestock sales growing 15%. Companion animal performance in the quarter is reflective of the expectations we set in the prior quarter and is a result of distributor inventory and promotional impacts. As Kristin mentioned, demand for the veterinary market as demonstrated by distributor sales to clinics is healthy and growing. We continue to see robust sales outgrowth across our companion animal portfolio, including strong growth in parasiticides and our key dermatology products and our outlook for the full year remains unchanged. U.S. vet practice trends are improving, with clinic visits up 2% in the quarter and clinic revenue growth up 11%. Average revenue per visit is up 9%. These trends are slightly better than we expected and largely reflect the normalization of the COVID impact on vet clinic visits. Total visits in the quarter remain above pre-pandemic levels and clinic revenues have grown on average of 10% annually over that period. Spent per visit remains elevated as the standard-of-care continues to increase. Turning to product performance, the companion animal decline in the U.S. was driven largely by a decrease in sales of our parasiticides portfolio as well as key dermatology products. Simparica Trio posted sales of $127 million in the quarter, declining 13% driven by distributor destocking, partially offset by growth in patient share where we continue to outpace the overall flea, tick, and heartworm market. Our outlook for Trio remains unchanged as we continue to see strong customer demand and continued conversion from topicals and collars. Key dermatology products sales were $184 million for the quarter declining 5%. Apoquel sales were negatively impacted by high sales in Q4 ahead of our 2023 price increases and significant retail buy-in in Q1 2022. Cytopoint sales growth partially offset the Apoquel decline due largely to its injectable administration, which is preferred by clinics. The U.S. companion animal decline was partially offset by growth in sales of Solensia, which launched in the third quarter. We continue to see solid clinic penetration growth in Solensia and expect to drive awareness of feline OA through our DTC advertising campaigns. U.S. livestock grew 15% in the quarter, primarily resulting from our cattle business where we have improved several supply outages, which impacted our revenues throughout 2022 and replenished our channel partner inventories. While we will continue to see benefit from improved supply, the replenishment impact is largely isolated to this quarter. We also saw growth in Synovex due to expanded label claims. Our poultry business also contributed to growth driven by expanded sales of vaccines. Moving on to our international segment, where revenue grew 3% on a reported basis and 10% operationally in the quarter with companion animal and livestock revenue both growing 10%. Increased sales of companion animal products resulted from our monoclonal antibodies for alleviation of osteoarthritis pain, small animal parasiticides, as well as the impact of our Jurox acquisition, which was completed in the fourth quarter of last year. We continue to be encouraged by the performance of Librela and Solensia. Librela generated $34 million or 74% operational growth driven by strong underlying demand and the removal of supply allocations that were in-place for the first half of 2022. Solensia delivered $9 million in the first quarter sales internationally, driven by stronger demand. Simparica Trio was the top contributor to growth for our international small animal parasiticides with $24 million in revenue growing 47% operationally due to expanding market share in the flea, tick, and heartworm space. Our international key dermatology portfolio was flat operational in the quarter. We saw double-digit operational growth across most of our major markets, driven by higher compliance and new patients. However, this growth was offset by large pre-priced buy-ups of Apoquel in Japan in Q1 2022. Our international livestock segment also grew 10% operational in the quarter with growth in four of our five core species. Growth was driven by our cattle portfolio, which benefited from price increases in certain emerging markets. Our sheep business had an exceptional quarter with high demand in Australia due to favorable market conditions as well as the impact of our Jurox acquisition. Poultry also contributed to growth in the quarter with higher key account penetration in the Middle East and Eastern Europe as well as the benefit of price. And lastly, our fish portfolio continues to perform well, driven by growth in salmon vaccines in Norway. Swine was flat for the quarter with strong sales in China, partially offset by intermittent supply constraints in some markets. Now moving on to the rest of the P&L for the quarter. Adjusted gross margins of 70.8% declined 80 basis points on a reported basis compared to the prior year, resulting from higher manufacturing costs and unfavorable product mix. This was partially offset by favorable foreign exchange and price increases. Adjusted operating expenses increased 12% operationally with SG&A growth of 11% operationally driven by headcount related compensation costs as a result of our U.S. small animal field force expansion, which largely began in Q2 of 2022, and higher T&E. R&D grew 19% on an operational basis, driven by higher project spend for our pipeline candidates, advancing projects include disruptive, novel innovation and lifecycle management. R&D remains our first priority in capital allocation. Other income and deductions in the quarter are reflective of a favorable benefit associated with a settlement in the current period for prior period underpaid royalties related to sales of certain products. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.5% an increase of 160 basis points driven by lower net discrete tax benefits in the quarter and less favorable jurisdictional mix of earnings, partially offset by higher benefit in the U.S. related to foreign derived intangible income. And finally, adjusted net income declined 3% operationally and adjusted diluted EPS declined 1% operationally for the quarter. Capital expenditures in the first quarter were $223 million. We are still anticipating a significant increase in capital expenditures for the full year of 2023. We continue to make investments to support our future growth, including manufacturing capacity for monoclonal antibodies as well as oral solid dosage. In the quarter, we repurchased $283 million of Zoetis shares and grew a dividend over 15% versus Q1 2022. Now, moving on to guidance for the full year 2023. As we have mentioned, the first quarter has gone largely as we expected. We are therefore reaffirming our 2023 guidance provided during February's earnings call. Note that guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late April. Foreign exchange rates have been volatile over the quarter. We will continue to monitor the impact of this volatility going forward. For the year, we continue to expect revenue between $8.575 billion and $8.725 billion representing a range of 6% to 8% operational growth. We also continue to expect adjusted net income to be in the range of $2.49 billion to $2.54 billion representing operational growth of 7% to 9%. And finally, we expected this adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.34 to $5.44 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.03 to $5.14, both consistent with our February guidance. Just to summarize before we go to Q&A, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our full year guidance commitments and expect more normalized growth in subsequent quarters. We continue to see positive trends and solid fundamentals in the underlying demand and are confident that our innovative portfolio will continue to allow us to go in-line with or faster than the market. Now, I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Jon Block from Stifel. Please go ahead.
Jon Block: Thanks guys. Appreciate it. Good morning. I'll ask both upfront I think importantly, is the channel now normalized in the U.S., Kristin? And then some rough crude math, but if you were down 7% U.S. companion animal and sales out were up 8% -- it's over like a 1500 basis point delta. And I sort of landed over $100 million in sales if you quantify that. So can you guys bridge how you get there? I guess there's $25 million to $30 million of parasiticides last quarter, or [does these] (ph) working down inventory by a week, whatever you can do to bridge that would be helpful. And then a quicker one, an easier one, Librela, I think you said approval still expected 1H. So launch 2H, is that the full launch call it before the end of the year. And then again, Kristin, how do you feel on your ability to serve demand we believe there's a lot of Solensia users that are chomping at the bid to get at it. So do you expect U.S. Librela supply to be an issue at all call it, 1H ‘24? Thanks guys.
Kristin Peck: Sure, Jon. I'll start with your second question. It's pretty straightforward. Yes, we continue to expect approval of Librela in the first half with the launch in the second half. The timing of exactly that a full launch, we would obviously, we've always said do early experience first and then go to full launch, the full launch could be very late in the year. But as we continue to -- and I'll reiterate again, the Librela is not in our numbers for the year. We do not include in our numbers for the year, a product that's expected to launch very late in the year for obvious reasons. So, we would do early experience. As we've always done with a full launch -- if we did a full launch, it will be very late in the year based on what we're saying. And no, we do not anticipate any supply challenges, on a full launch in 2024, whether it's late this year or early 2024, we don't see any challenges there. On your second question on distributor, I think we'll spend a bunch of time on that today. Obviously, there's a lot of complexity in that one. But again, it is in-line with what we expected and we really don't think the trend you see in the quarter is going to continue. Let me let what get into all the details because I know this is probably the biggest question we've been hearing early this morning. So, Wetteny, you want to go through some of the details?
Wetteny Joseph: Sure. Jon, the start of your question was, are we at normalized levels, I’ll start there, first? And yes, we're at normalized levels here sitting here in the second quarter. And let me just step back and give you a little bit more details here. As Kristin said, we came into the year and as you may recall on the last call, we described how we saw increased buy-in in the fourth quarter. Driven by promotions that we ran on parasiticides, given we have recovery of supply late in the year, as we got through some of our supply constraints. And there was more pre-priced buy-in given the level of pricing pieces we're coming into 2023 with, in the fourth quarter above what I would call normal levels pre-price buy-in. So, we expected to see destocking in the quarter, which is why we said that the first quarter would be below the low end of the range of growth that we have for the year at 6% to 8%. So we've seen destocking in the first quarter down to I would say the lower end of our normal range that we've experienced historically. And as we step into -- and by the way, given rising interest rates, that is not unexpected. And then as we got into April, we saw slightly more destocking as we started the quarter, but those have normalized and have been reflected in the guidance that we just reiterated today. And so we're not anticipating a return back to normal levels in terms of inventories or assumption in our guidance is that they'll stay about where they are now. Now to be clear, if you look at the end market demand dynamics, they remain very strong. As we said in our earnings release, sales out of distributors into clinics were up 8% on a volume basis in the quarter. And if you look at retail, sales out pet owners were up 35% on the quarter. We've seen for the first time in about a year vet visit increased by 2%, and if you look at derm patients, for example, visit increased in the quarter versus a year ago. And so again, we've seen normalization since then, and by the way, international markets where we didn't see -- we haven't seen and don't expect to see the level of destocking that we've seen in the U.S. you saw 10% operational growth in our international markets across livestock and companion animal. And so again, without an extremely return to those levels and these are factored into our guidance, and we're contemplated when we gave the initial guidance back in February.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Erin Wright: Great. Thanks. Two questions, one on livestock, one on companion. So, on the livestock side, was there a stocking benefit across livestock in the segment in the quarter? Can you quantify that for us and how much of the strength in U.S. livestock should continue in the coming quarters, given that you expect flat for the year? And you touched on derm a little bit on the companion animal side, but you mentioned Apoquel declined with no competitors in that segment and your direct distribution strategy, what drove the decline, and does that volatility that you're seeing across that retail channel for this product change how you think about leveraging that alternative channel, and are you proactively shifting customers to side of going ahead of competition? Thanks.
Kristin Peck: Sure. Thanks, Erin. Again, livestock did grow 12% as you mentioned, which was in line with what we expected, but the growth really was driven by resupply or increased supply of a lot of key products As we reiterated in our prepared remarks, we continue to expect a flattish growth for livestock for the year. If you look at it we saw, if you look at the U.S. business, we think you'll see it's really more of a onetime sort of getting back into supply and some of this. Is it slightly up or slightly down? I think a lot of that is genuinely going to depend on China. If it's return to travel and dining out in China will drive growth in a number of our markets around the world in our export markets such as Brazil or Australia or even the U.S. So we continue to expect and built into our guidance for the year is to have a flattish livestock number, which obviously gets back to Wetteny’s point, which is we're expecting very strong double digit growth in companion animal. As you look at derm for the quarter, it did decline, but this is largely due to the destocking of the pre-price buy-ins and promotions in the U.S. And as Wetteny mentioned in his remarks, the one-time issue in Japan back to Q1 of 2022, in fact, if you pull that out, international had double digit growth if you take out Japan. So again, this performance was in line with our expectations, but really importantly it is not indicative of our view of our expectations for the year. We continue to expect double-digit growth for the rest of the year and for the overall year for dermatology. Our sales out remain really strong. We're seeing a lot of uptick right now in Cytopoint, more and more on pet owners are really seeing the compliance benefits of it, the efficacy of it, invest, love it because it obviously stays in the clinic. As we continue to see the shift here it would compliance, I think again we'll underscore our growth there. And the other thing I'd mentioned that Wetteny mentioned is derm visits continue to grow in Q1. And we're not really seeing any pushback from customers on the price increases that we did do. So we continue to expect strong growth for derm for the year per our last guidance, double digit growth for derm.
Wetteny Joseph: Yes, I would just add that first quarter is non-indicative of the year here, Aaron, similar to the overall results. And so to your point around retail channels, etcetera, we don't see us changing that. I think the fact that, Cytopoint we expect to continue to lead the growth for key derm franchise, we'll change the mix between those two. But not changing the overall picture and our expectations for derm remain the same for the rest of the year. And we're off to actually a strong start. In the second quarter for derm both in the U.S. and internationally.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Michael Ryskin: Great. Thanks for taking the question guys. First, I want to ask about sort of the top line progression through the rest of the year. I think you'd point to some softness from what you previously and you talked about just now let me on when you saw distributors to start the second quarter. But any additional color you could give us as sort of we go through the rest of the year given that there is a relatively steep ramp implied in numbers right now just to hit your $8.65 billion and 68% operational growth. So just talk about the step up in 2Q, 1Q to 2Q versus 2Q to 3Q, 4Q. And then as a follow on to that, Kristin, you touched on Librela earlier, but I was wondering if you guys could comment on the other product launch expected this year, the competitor to Simparica Trio. We haven't seen that yet. Obviously can come any day, but just curious what you're hearing on that. And if your thoughts on what's going on parasiticides market have changed regarding that in terms of what some of your competitors are doing with stocking, what some of your competitors are doing with promotions of some of their products and sort of how that's impacting your view on tariff through the rest of the year. Thanks.
Wetteny Joseph: Hey, Mike. I'll start with progression for top line for the year and then I'll turn it over to Kristen. And she'll cover Librela launch in sure competition. So with respect to progression for the balance of the year, we expect normalized growth across the year starting with the second quarter, which obviously we're already about halfway into the second quarter. And as I mentioned just a little bit ago, we've got a strong start particularly in derm but across the board to what I'll call more normalized mix and normalized cadence for the balance of the year. One thing I would say is with respect to Q2, and that's normalized operational growth rate I'm referring to. If you take a look at FX, for example, that was about three points of headwind in the first quarter based on where rates are right now, I would expect about two points of headwind on the second quarter. So when you map out operational growth to reported growth, you should take that into consideration. That turns around in the second half again based on where rates are now and it ends up being slightly unfavorable on the year, year-on-year on FX on the top line and slightly favorable at the bottom line. So that's how I would sort of think through the progression. But again, starting with the second quarter, you should expect normalized growth to get to the guidance that we just reiterated at 6% to 8%.
Kristin Peck: Sure. And let me pick up your second question, which was the other product. We are continuing to expect competition in the second half of the year for Simparica Trio. But I want to underscore that as you look at the first quarter, we actually gained share. So as we said, there's very strong underlying demand for Simparica Trio in the U.S and even with competition coming, if you look at our performance, it was in line with our expectations. Again, we said it's not indicative of the year and we continue to expect strong growth for the remainder of the year. Even with competition in the second half. So we have been expecting this competition. The good news is it's later than we did expect. As we think about it, we've talked about this before, we're not expecting them to radically change any pricing if they would really I think given they are the leader right now with HEARTGARD NexGard, they would really cannibalize their own business. And I think it's important to keep in mind even if you look at the quarter. They ran very strong promotions ahead of their launch. And even with those promotions, we gained share in that quarter. So we remain very confident in the strength of Simparica Trio. In the strength of our relationships with that in the pet owner satisfaction of it, we do expect competition. We think they'll bring a product as I said in the second half of the year, but we remain confident of the strong growth for Simparica Trio as we said before for the year.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Nathan Rich: Great. Thanks for the questions. Sorry to keep honing in on the destocking dynamics, but could you maybe just talk about how the first quarter U.S. companion animal sales kind of played out month by month? It seems like January and February price saw the bulk of the impact from the pre buy-in and pull forward into the fourth quarter. It sounded like the destocking might have occurred a little bit later in the quarter. I think this is people are looking to get better visibility on the improvement in the second quarter. Could you maybe just comment on how March or April played out just as we think about kind of where the business is heading into the second quarter?
Wetteny Joseph: Yes. So look, I'll be happy to answer the question as to destocking. We saw destocking from the start of the quarter just as we anticipated and as we discussed in some of prior call given the dynamics coming out of Q4. As we mentioned too in the last call, the timing of our supply recovery in terms of last year would have had an impact on the cadence on the year, which is playing out exactly as we thought. I'll give you a little bit more color perhaps that might be helpful if you think about what the end market demand looks like. When we look at our sales out of distribution to clinics, we said its 8% volume growth on the quarter. If you look at how those played out for March, the end of the quarter, they're actually above that number. So, we haven't seen anything in terms of what the end markets are that would indicate a slowdown. And as I said, we've had a strong start to the second quarter and we're sitting here in the middle of the second quarter, and I'm saying that we would see normalized growth starting in this current quarter for the balance of the year.
Kristin Peck: Yeah. And I think I want to also reiterate what Wetteny said earlier, which is they are at very low levels, the lower end of their ranges, but our guidance expects that they do not go back up. We believe that given the current interest rate environment, our expectation is that they will stay at this level. So again, our confidence in the guidance we're providing is assuming that they're not going back up, they will stay at the levels that they're at now.
Operator: And we will go next to Louise Chen with Cantor. Please go ahead.
Louise Chen: Hi, thanks for taking my questions here. So wanted to ask you, on your upcoming investor event, what will you discuss here? What are some of the key things that you're going to be going over. It's been a while since you've had investor event. And will you be disclosing more additional pipeline products, longer term guidance, anything from that front? And then I also wanted to ask you in your diagnostics business, what's the outlook for the remainder of the year on that business? Thank you.
Kristin Peck: Sure. We are excited for our Investor Day. We spent a time talking to a lot of our investors over the last six months as to what they're looking about. Our focus there will be really on building confidence in our medium to long term growth expectations. We've gotten a lot of questions obviously on our pipeline and R&D. So, you'll see us as we mentioned in our press release, Rob Polzer, our Head of R&D will be coming to give more detail on our R&D portfolio. And we also look forward to introducing you to other members of our leadership team. So you get to meet them as well. We're excited to share what we view as the short medium and long term growth aspirations and give you some confidence in more detail around all of those. So Wetteny, do you want to take her second question on diagnostics?
Wetteny Joseph: Yes, happy to, Kristen. So look on diagnostics, we have seen increased productivity from our diagnostics team, particularly if you look at the U.S. where we made the change about a year ago into the second quarter. In this first quarter, we actually saw very strong placements across our instruments, including images as well. Those will help drive growth from a consumables perspective if you look at the rest of the year consistent with our guidance, we said we would expect to see improvements in terms of that to the productivity given the new field force and the change out that we did last year. And we would expect to see return to growth in the U.S. in the back half of this year. And again, we're lapping those changes that we made, which we believe -- firmly believe are going to drive long term growth for the business in addition to innovation that we continue to work on in terms of diagnostics.
Operator: And we will take our next question from David Westenberg with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
David Westenberg: Hi. Thank you for taking the question. So just to get on the Simparica Trio franchise and so in the distributor dynamics here, I usually think about the parasiticide portfolio is being heavy in March to August season. As we take a step back or take a zoom outlook, do you think any of the dynamics that have happened with some of the distributor destocking is going to be a net negative for the annual sales of the product? Put it another way, do you think maybe at this impact the timing of missing the flea and tick season in any of this kind of dynamic? And then just to reiterate on the inventory question on the livestock portfolio, it doesn't have the same dynamics, right? So I mean like the price increases in livestock were not the same as the price increases in companion. Therefore, you wouldn't see some of that same distributor dynamic. And then if I could squeeze just one more, just I want to -- I didn't see the inventory or the balance sheet yet, so just wanted to see if inventory levels trended up or down. Thank you. Sorry. That was one.
Kristin Peck: Sure. Let me start with Trio and then I'll let Wetteny take the other two. I want to underscore what we said earlier. We have very strong demand in sales out. And so what you saw in Trio in the first quarter was a stocking issue. But as we look at the demand for the product and where it's going, it has no effect on the flea and tick season as needed. We have full supply in. I think what makes it a little complicated and as unusual was the supply issues we had in Q3, Q2 and Q3 of 2022 put us putting a lot more inventory into the channel at the end of Q4. Trying to restock shelves against what we thought as you remember was going to be a launch in Q1 of a competitor. So I think there's obviously some quarter-to-quarter stocking dynamics, but I want to underscore demand for this product remains strong. We gained share in the quarter. We are now at normal inventory levels, so no, we do not see anything if you look at the Q2 to Q3 of the product and which we would agree that is normally Q2 to Q3 is the strongest sales normally in parasiticides. So, we continue to see very strong demand for the product. Obviously, there is some quarter-to-quarter stocking stuff that is relatively unique as you look at the end of 2022 and the beginning of 2023. But we don't think that actually signals through anything and the demand for the product or importantly the strong growth we see for the product for the year. Even as we said assuming competition in the second half.
Wetteny Joseph: Yes, look, I think there were couple other parts to your question, I'll touch on in terms of livestock. We're not seeing the same dynamics in livestock. Look, I mean if you look at where we ended last year, maybe we're in the middle of the range towards the bottom of the range, might have been slightly increase in the quarter given the recovery of some supply for certain products as we mentioned in our prepared commentary, but overall, not any meaningful movement there to speak of. And then with respect to our balance sheet on inventory, as you know, we are ramping up certain products, anticipating launch and approval of certain other products that will continue to drive inventories. First, if you look at operating cash flows on the quarter, they're actually favourable to last year because as inventories continue to increase, we saw really strong performance on receivables and other NAP. So overall, operating cash flows look favorable versus a year ago.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Balaji Prasad with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Balaji Prasad: Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for the questions. Couple from me. Firstly, could you give an update on the supply chain issues which impacted growth in 2022, be it in the vaccine side Trio or [indiscernible] and would you foresee or anticipate any supply chain issue impacting any of your key products this year? Secondly, I wasn't sure I got the derm decline fully. This is not a distributed independent segment. Can you provide some numbers around the derm segment and help us understand what led to the decline? Thanks.
Kristin Peck: Sure. I'll start with your first question on supply chain and maybe Wetteny can build on my derm answer from before. With regards to the supply chain, as we expected, we have completely normalized the supply chain. We always have some small level of challenges as we mentioned before in the biologics. But the challenges we saw in 2022 have been resolved as we indicated they would be. We're back into normal supply on these products as you look at whether that's parasiticides or importantly our monoclonal antibodies. As expected, those are at normalized levels. We'll have some small number in bios as we always have that all of our competitors generally have. But supply chain has been normalized and we don't foresee any specific supply chain challenges in 2023 going forward. But maybe Wetteny you can build up my previous comments on derm segment if you can clarify some of these questions?
Wetteny Joseph: Yes, I'd be happy to. So look, the derm story is similar in terms of destocking from pre-price buy-ins that we saw in the U.S. into retail in Q4. As well as a year ago, if you look at Japan and if you look at our reporting last year in Q1, you would have seen a significant growth rate for Japan in the first quarter, driven by those pre-price buy ups in Apoquel. And then you saw that go the other way in the second quarter. So if you were to I would say pro form the results for the first quarter taking into account what I just said, you will see double digit growth for the derm franchise in both the U.S. and international.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi. This is [Katarina] (ph) on for Chris. Thank you so much for taking our questions. So, first on price increases, any feedback from the price increases in the beginning of the year, are you seeing any pushback from veterinarians or pet owners and any initial thoughts of how you'll be approaching price increases in 2024. And then the second question is on diagnostics, any thoughts on the proposed Mars Heska acquisition and the impact that will have on the diagnostics market? Does it change Zoetis’ plans and diagnostics or the investments you're making in that market? Thank you so much.
Kristin Peck: Sure. Thanks, [Katarina] (ph). I'll take your second question first and then let Wetteny take your first question on the pricing. I really think the margin acquisition of Heska confirms that the veterinary diagnostics market continues to be incredibly attractive investment area. Most importantly it reinforces our strategy, we think the sound around committees executed around in the U.S. specifically building our reference lab network and continuing to invest in innovation importantly in our point of care. We've had a robust start to 2023 as we look at our images, our virtual lab, our reference lab offering, we really believe it's resonating with customers. And really our focus is on leading with cutting edge medicine, really rolling out our virtual lab, which we really think is a differentiator. And we think that's what differentiates what it's overall is innovation in the space, innovation around point of care, innovation in customer experience and innovation in the reference side. So no, we really see that acquisition as reconfirming our strategy. And really we're going to accelerate our growth focus on innovative diagnostics. So, Wetteny, do you want to take our second group of questions around pricing?
Wetteny Joseph: Yes, sure. Look, we have not seen any pressure in terms of end market demand given our price increases. We took 5% price on the quarter that's up versus 3% last year. If you look at the end market dynamics that we described earlier, you're seeing significant growth out from distributors to clinics, but also importantly, you're seeing significant growth from retail into pet owners. And we continue to see increased patient visits, for example, in derm, etcetera. So we have not seen any resistance there in terms of price increase. And by the way, if you look at international, we grew 10% in companion animal in the quarter given price increases as well and despite some pre-price buy in, which is normal in the fourth quarter. So we haven't seen any signs of that. If you look at livestock, that actually offsets some of the -- marginally offset some of the price increases we would have seen in companion animal. We can just see some impact on Draxxin, but not meaningful not at the level that we've seen previously as we previously said and actually we saw some volume offset to that positively offsetting some of the price on the Draxxin side. So all told in good shape in terms of what we're seeing in terms of market reaction to our prices. And in terms of what it means for 2024, too early to tell. We won't go into that yet.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Brandon Vazquez with William Blair. Please go ahead.
Brandon Vazquez: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. The first one is just on guidance. You started off the year pretty strong despite kind of inventory levels creating a little bit of noise here. But if you kind of read through that, you're looking at, I don't know, like high single digits, maybe even double digits operational growth to start the year reiterated guide for 6% to 8% operational growth. So the question being basically what would get you to that low end of that operational growth range given the strength you're already seeing in the year if you kind of read through the noise?
Wetteny Joseph: So look, if you look at the end market dynamics that we see, we see strength there, so I think that supports certainly the mid to high end of our guidance I would say. If you look at what it means for the rest of the year and I'll reiterate this point, which is we're already halfway through the second quarter. And again, we're seeing strong start to the quarter and we'll see that normalized growth rate including mix by the way for the balance of the year. And keep in mind, right, our guidance didn't change including what we expect from livestock for the balance of the year. Right? We went from saying livestock could be minus one to plus one. We're saying it's flattish, basically the same thing. So how Q1 has played out exactly as we thought essentially and therefore the rest of the year is the same. And so no point in our guidance range is any, I would say, more probable than the other, we feel great about where we are on the year. And how it's starting out for us in the second quarter, particularly, despite what you described as the noise in terms of the inventory levels.
Operator: And we'll go next to [Steve Scholar with PD Cohen] (ph). Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you. A couple of questions. First, the new manufacturing facility in Georgia, is the investment based predominantly on increased forecasts for current products or positive late stage R&D progress for which we at least on the outside currently don't have visibility or is this some combination? And in the prepared remarks, you referred to disruptive novel innovation in the pipeline. Should we expect to get a window on that during the May meeting? And can you tell us if this is likely mainly directed at currently untreated diseases, more species, wider claims within existing species, improve dosing or something else? Thank you.
Kristin Peck: Sure. The new manufacturing facility in right outside of Atlanta, Georgia will be both to support current products and the growth in our current products as well as we'll target launching some of our new monoclonal antibodies out of that facility as well. It's a very large facility. It gives us tons of flexibility, which is what we found really exciting about the opportunity to be able to use it for lots of different things and really build a strong centre in the South with a great labor market, really good access to workforce that we think makes a lot of sense. So we actually -- we see it’s the facility's ability to do both and that is currently the intention. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we would expect it to be fully operational by 2026 and doing both at that point. With regards to Investor Day, we will be looking at the whole portfolio. We'll give you more details which we've been asked for around the pain opportunity and what we're expecting there. We'll also talk about some of the new disease areas we've mentioned before. It will give you a sense of what we think those markets could look like. A lot of those markets are new markets, so we'll help you size that market. We'll talk a lot about what our pipeline looks like. And what we're doing now. So we'll give you information both on a species basis importantly on sort of key technologies as we talked about in monoclonal areas -- monoclonal antibodies. And then also lastly, talk about some of these emerging big new markets that we think we can attack with some of our new novel technologies.
Operator: And there are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the program back to Kristin Peck for closing remarks.
Kristin Peck: Thank you. So look, just to summarize, we really see a very positive and sustainable demand for our product based on what we've talked about for long time which is the fundamental drivers of animal health. We are confident that Zoetis has the industry's most diverse and durable global portfolio. And this is really founded on innovative science as we talk about and supported by a high quality supply chain. We'll remain focused this year and going forward on our five key growth catalyst; dermatology, pet parasiticides, pain, diagnostics and emerging markets. And we're going to continue to invest in the talent, the pipeline and the capabilities that support this future growth while ensuring that we can adapt to the dynamic environment that we all operate in. And we really look forward to sharing more about this with you. Our vision, our pipeline, our strategies for growth at our Investor Day on May 25th. And there you'll hear more from me, Wetteny, our Head of R&D, Rob Polzer, about the confidence we have in the animal health industry. And importantly, our ability to go faster than that market and the investments that we're making to create that value for our shareholders. So, we announced the event this week and I hope you can all join us virtually or at the New York Stock Exchange. As always, you can find more details about our Investor Relations information on our website. So thanks so much for joining us today.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.

===== 2022 Q4  (2023-02-14 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Financial Results Conference Call and Webcast for Zoetis. Hosting the call today is Steve Frank, Vice President of Investor Relations for Zoetis. The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, and will not be forwarded automatically. In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately 2 hours after the conclusion of this call via dial-in or the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.
Steve Frank: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone and welcome to the Zoetis fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings call. I am joined today by Kristin Peck, our Chief Executive Officer; and Wetteny Joseph, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I will remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statements in today’s press release and our SEC filings, including, but not limited to, our annual report, Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q. Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and the company’s 8-K filing dated today, Tuesday, February 14, 2023. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. With that, I will turn the call over to Kristin.
Kristin Peck: Thank you, Steve and welcome everyone to our fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings call. Today, we reported strong full year results for 2022, in line with the high-end of our guidance from November and thanks to our diverse portfolio, global scale and talented colleagues. Our 8% operational revenue growth for the year was driven by our innovative companion animal portfolio, which grew 14% operationally while our livestock portfolio declined 2% operationally, primarily due to generic competition and market challenges, especially in the U.S. Thanks to our broad global scale and diversity, we delivered well-balanced operational growth across our U.S. and international segments, which grew 7% and 9% respectively. For the year, we generated operational growth in all of our top 13 markets despite the economic challenges, continued COVID recovery and political uncertainty created by the war in Ukraine. Reflecting our longstanding value proposition, we grew our adjusted net income faster than sales for the year with an operational increase of 11% for the full year and we use this performance and financial strength to continue investing in the R&D, manufacturing capacity and sales and marketing resources to support our future growth and pipeline. As we begin 2023, we will stay adaptable to the evolving macroeconomic factors and geopolitical tensions around the world and focus on executing our plans. We remain very confident in the fundamental and resilient global demand for animal care. And most importantly, we are confident in Zoetis’ ability to continue delivering solid sustainable growth as we resolve our prior supply constraints and build share of our market-leading franchises. Looking ahead, we are committed to our track record of value creation and above-market performance even in the face of today’s economic uncertainty. We are well positioned with our strategic priorities and capabilities to expand in large and growing product areas like parasiticides, dermatology products, monoclonal antibodies, vaccines and diagnostics. We are guiding to a range of 6% to 8% operational growth for revenue in 2023 and adjusted net income growth in the range of 7% to 9% operationally, which reflects our increased investment plans for R&D and manufacturing to support growth. As the world leader in animal health, a market that has grown on average of 5% to 6% through various economic cycles over the last two decades, we feel very positive about how our portfolio, pipeline and strategy can drive long-term sustainable growth and create value for our customers and shareholders. Wetteny will discuss more details about the 4Q results and full year 2023 guidance, but let me provide some additional perspective on our business and set the stage for some of our growth drivers for the year. First, we have remained the world leader in animal health over the last decade, outperforming the market and bringing groundbreaking innovation to veterinarians, producers and pet owners who care for animals. We marked our 10-year anniversary as a public company on February 1, a decade, which saw us bring more than 2,000 new products and lifecycle innovations to market, build a diverse portfolio, featuring market-leading franchises and 15 current blockbusters generate consistent above-market revenue growth and deliver a total shareholder return of more than 500% all while increasing our market cap from $16 billion in 2013 to about $75 billion today. While we celebrate those accomplishments, I am even more excited about where we can go in the next decade and by the talented colleagues, innovative pipeline and best-in-class capabilities we have brought together at Zoetis. Our colleagues’ purpose-driven mindset and steady performance in the face of adversity give me confidence in the continued execution, innovation, growth and durability of our business. As we turn to 2023, we are focused on five key growth catalysts for the year. In dermatology, we see excellent growth opportunities even after nearly a decade of game-changing innovation that began with the introduction of Apoquel in 2014 and has continued with the success of our first monoclonal antibody, Cytopoint, as well as recent lifecycle innovations like Apoquel chewable. We continue to see even more opportunities to grow and expand in this market. In pet parasiticides, the largest single product area in animal health, we continue to gain share and are now the second largest in revenue for this category. We have improved supply in 2023. We expect to continue expanding share in this market and supporting our diverse global portfolio beating Simparica Trio, our triple combination product. In the area of pain, we are off to a great start with our two monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain, Librela for dogs, which became our latest blockbuster in 2022 and Solensia for cats. We are once again revolutionizing care in this category and seeing very positive early reaction to both products in their large markets as we continue to expand geographies and supply. In terms of the U.S. approval for Librela, we remain confident in receiving approval in the first half of ‘23 with a leasing plan for late in the year. In diagnostics, we continue to generate solid above-market growth in international markets above our go-to-market model in the U.S. and drive greater global adoption for VETSCAN IMAGYST, our AI-based diagnostics platform. And finally, as population growth and economic mobility drive more demand for animal protein and pets, we see major opportunities in fast-growing emerging markets outside the U.S., where our portfolio is well suited to meet those evolving needs. Overall, our business continues to be weighted towards higher growth, innovation-driven areas in companion animal and these will remain our growth drivers for the foreseeable future. Meanwhile, our livestock portfolio will remain a valuable cash-generating piece of our business as we continue to recover in the U.S. from generic competition and show solid growth in emerging markets. As always, we will stay disciplined yet adaptable, and our approach to the new market opportunities, potential challenges and economic shifts that could occur. And in conclusion, Zoetis remains well positioned in terms of our market leadership, financial strength, investment strategies and diverse portfolio to deliver sustainable growth in 2023. Thank you. And I will hand this off to Wetteny.
Wetteny Joseph: Thank you, Kristin and good morning everyone. As Kristin mentioned, we had a strong year in 2022 with revenue of $8.1 billion and adjusted net income of $2.3 billion both in line with the high end of our November full year guidance range. Full year revenue grew 4% on a reported basis and 8% operationally with adjusted net income increasing 3% on a reported basis and 11% operationally. Looking deeper into the operational growth for the year, price contributed 3% to full year operational revenue growth with volume contributing 5%. Volume growth consisted of 4% from new products, including Simparica Trio and our monoclonal antibodies, Librela and Solensia, and 2% from key dermatology products, partially offset by a decline of 1% from other in-line products. Revenue growth was broad-based with positive operational growth in each of our top 13 markets, which make up approximately 85% of our total revenues with international growing 9% operationally and the U.S. growing 7%. Our growth was driven by continued demand for our innovative new products in our companion animal portfolio, which grew 14% operationally. Our companion animal portfolio now makes up 64% of our global revenues. This growth was partially offset by our livestock business, which declined 2% operationally, primarily due to the generic competition, supply constraints as well as challenging market conditions in certain geographies. Performance in companion animal was driven by our small animal parasiticide portfolio, which grew 20% on an operational basis. Simparica Trio generated $744 million in sales, growing 58% on an operational basis. Our Simparica franchise reached $1 billion in global revenue for the first time in 2022. Our key dermatology products generated $1.3 billion in sales posting strong growth of 17% operationally with double-digit growth in both international and the U.S. Key derm growth in our international markets was especially strong at 27% operationally. We continue to see solid growth in our monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain. As expected, sales of Librela eclipsed the $100 million mark on the year, marking Zoetis’ 15th blockbuster product. We look forward to Librela’s expected launch in the U.S. in late 2023. Solensia contributed $30 million in sales in 2022, primarily from international markets, with solid penetration in the U.S. after a launch late in the year. Our companion animal diagnostics portfolio declined 2% operationally in the year, with declines in the U.S., partially offset by growth internationally. Our livestock business declined 2% on an operational basis. Our portfolio continues to be challenged by generic and cheaper alternatives to DRAXXIN in cattle as well as Zoamix in poultry. We do expect the generic impact to begin to moderate in 2023. Additional declines were driven by supply challenges on certain livestock products as well as unfavorable market conditions, especially the U.S. cattle and China swine markets. Moving on to our Q4 financial results, which was another strong quarter. We closed Q4 with revenue of $2 billion, representing an increase of 4% on a reported basis and 9% on an operational basis. Adjusted net income of $539 million is an increase of 14% on a reported basis and 27% operationally. Of the 9% operational revenue growth, 3% is from price and 6% from volume. Volume growth consisted of 3% from new products, which includes Simparica Trio as well as Librela and Solensia and 2% from key dermatology products, while other in-line products grew 1%. Companion animal products grew 15% operationally while our livestock portfolio was flat in the quarter. Simparica Trio was the largest contributor to growth in the quarter, posting global revenue of $171 million, representing operational growth of 39% for the quarter. We expect Simparica Trio to continue to grow the addressable market for fleet taking hardware globally and drive the conversion from collar and top parasiticides to oral combination products. These dynamics will provide additional run-rate for future expansion of the broader market and revenue growth for Trio even once competing triple combination products enter the market. Our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint, had solid global growth in the quarter, posting $347 million of revenue, representing 14% operational growth against a robust prior year in which key derm grew 23% operationally in the fourth quarter of 2021. Our monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain in dogs and cats continue to grow posting $39 million of revenue in the quarter, primarily in international markets. Meanwhile, sales of livestock products were flat on an operational basis in the quarter, with growth in fish and poultry offset by the impact of generics and supply constraints on cattle and swine products. Now moving on to revenue growth by segment for the quarter. U.S. revenue was $1.1 billion in the quarter, growing 7% with companion animal sales growing 12% and livestock sales declining by 6%. Focusing first on companion animal, we returned to double-digit growth in the quarter, as we resolved the majority of our supply issues from earlier in the year. In the U.S. veterinary practice revenue is growing approximately 6% and spending per visit remained strong again this quarter, increasing 10% despite a 4% decline in clinic visits in the quarter. The visit decline reflects comparison to the peak visit numbers in 2021, driven by pandemic after-effects and increased adoption of pets as well as the impact of veterinary workforce challenges that have limited some clinic capacities. Absolute clinic visits remain above pre-pandemic levels. We continue to see growth in the retail segment outpacing other channels. In Q4, sales to our retail partners grew by 49%. Simparica Trio continues to drive growth in the quarter with sales of $158 million in the U.S., growing 39%. With the supply constraints from earlier in the year largely resolved, we were able to leverage promotional efforts to drive growth and regain market share in the quarter. Key dermatology product sales in the U.S. were $239 million for the quarter, growing 11% with Apoquel and Cytopoint, each growing double-digits. We expect to continue the expansion of the market for the foreseeable future. U.S. livestock declined 6% in the quarter as expected, with sales of cattle products impacted by supply restocking for certain products in the third quarter of 2022 as well as the impact of generic competition in cattle and poultry. Moving on to our International segment, where revenue was flat on a reported basis and grew 12% operationally in the quarter. International companion animal revenue grew 21% operationally and livestock grew 4% operationally. Increased sales of companion animal products resulted from growth in our parasiticides portfolio, our key dermatology products and our monoclonal antibodies for alleviation of osteoarthritis pain. Our international small animal parasiticide portfolio had a very strong quarter. Growth was driven by revolution franchise, which rebounded well from supply challenges, especially in China. Our key dermatology products contributed $108 million to revenue and grew 22% on an operational basis in the quarter, with growth in Cytopoint across all key markets and continued double-digit growth of Apoquel. We continue to be pleased with the performance of our oral pain portfolio with Librela generating $26 million and Solensia delivering $7 million in fourth quarter sales internationally. Librela sales in the quarter dipped slightly below the prior quarter due to the removal of supply allocation in certain markets, which led to higher inventory levels at the end of Q3. We expect to see significant contribution to growth in 2023 coming from Librela across our International segment. Moving on to our International Livestock segment, which grew 4% operationally in the quarter. Our fish portfolio grew 25% operationally due to increased demand for vaccines in key salmon markets, including Norway and Chile. Sales of poultry products grew due to increased demand for poultry protein. Growth was partially offset by swine sales, which declined due to supply constraints in certain vaccines across international. The slight decline was partially offset by growth in China, driven by a weak comparative quarter in the prior year and improved swine market conditions. Now moving on to the rest of the P&L for the quarter. Adjusted gross margins of 68.1% decreased 150 basis points on a reported basis compared to the prior year, resulting primarily from unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. Operationally, gross margin declined 60 basis points, driven by higher inventory charges as well as higher manufacturing and freight costs, which were partially offset by favorable price and mix. Operationally, adjusted operating expenses decreased 6% with SG&A declining 9% driven by lower compensation-related expenses and lower advertising and promotion, partially offset by higher freight and logistics related expenses. R&D expenses increased 10% operationally due to higher compensation costs and higher project spend. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.8%, an increase of 220 basis points, primarily due to lower net discrete tax benefits in the quarter and a lower benefit in the U.S. related to foreign-derived intangible income. Adjusted net income grew 27% operationally and adjusted diluted EPS grew 30% operationally for the quarter. Capital expenditures in the fourth quarter were $171 million. In the quarter, we repurchased approximately $400 million of Zoetis shares and returned over $0.5 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. For the year, we have repurchased almost $1.6 billion of Zoetis shares and returned over $2.2 billion to shareholders. In December, we announced a 15% annual dividend increase, continuing our commitment to grow our dividend at or faster than the growth in adjusted net income. Now moving on to our guidance for the full year 2023, please note that guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late January. We are expecting foreign exchange to have a minimal impact versus the prior year, with the full year impact neutral at revenue and slightly accretive at adjusted net income. The foreign exchange impact in the first half will be unfavorable versus prior year, particularly in the first quarter. In the second half of the year, foreign exchange is expected to be favorable based on the late January exchange rates. For 2023, we are projecting revenue between $8.575 billion and $8.725 billion, representing a range of 6% to 8% operational growth. Volume will be 1% to 2% at the low end of our guidance range and 3% to 4% at the high end. We again expect companion animal to be the primary growth driver in 2023 with the continued strength of our diverse Simparica Trio portfolio, the adoption of our monoclonal antibodies for OA pain and further expansion of our key dermatology products. Despite the decline in vet planning visits last year, industry fundamentals remain strong. Business remain above pre-COVID levels and clinic revenue is at an all-time high as the standard of care continues to increase. We anticipate modest livestock declines in 2023, driven by the generic impact on DRAXXIN sales, particularly in the first half as well as unfavorable market conditions in U.S. cattle. These declines will be partially offset by growth in poultry, driven by increased demand for poultry protein and new product launches as well as fish. The fundamental trends which make livestock an essential business remain intact. I’d like to touch upon the key assumptions that underpin our expectation for revenue growth. For companion animal, we assume a triple combination product we will launch in the U.S. in the first half of 2023 to compete against Simparica Trio. We expect this entrant will help Trio drive the conversion from topicals and collars to triple combination or parasiticides and still project significant growth for Trio. We do not expect competitive entrants in 2023 for our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint. We expect another year of robust growth of our key derm portfolio coming from continued expansion of the dermatology market and price. We are excited about the continued growth in our OA franchise and plan to launch in several new markets next year. For the remainder of the P&L, adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue is expected to be in the range of 29.5% to 30%, where favorable foreign exchange price increases and product mix are partially offset by higher input costs. Adjusted SG&A expenses for the year are expected to be between $2.06 billion and $2.1 billion, with the increase from 2022 focused on supporting primary drivers of revenue growth. Adjusted R&D expenses for 2023, is expected to be between $635 million and $660 million. R&D spend can fluctuate year-over-year. This increased investment is reflective of both new projects as well as those advancing in our pipeline. Zoetis is the leader in animal health because of the disruptive innovation, novel products and life cycle enhancements we bring to the market. This increase in R&D expenses reflects our commitment to ensuring our capital allocation prioritizes innovation. Adjusted interest and other income reductions are expected to be approximately $170 million. Our adjusted effective tax rate for 2023 is expected to be in the range of 20% to 21%. Adjusted net income is expected to be in the range of $2.49 billion to $2.54 billion, representing operational growth of 7% to 9%. Our guidance once again reflects our value proposition of growing revenue in line with or faster than the market and growing adjusted net income faster than revenue. We expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.34 to $5.44 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.03 to $5.14. We are anticipating capital expenditures in 2023 to increase to $950 million to $1 billion. We continue to make investments to support our future growth, including manufacturing capacity for monoclonal antibodies as well as oral solid dosage. Finally, Zoetis and the animal health industry remain resilient in the face of economic headwinds. Our 2023 guidance range is reflective of uncertain macroeconomic conditions and the impact of veterinary clinic labor challenges. While guidance represents our expectations for the full year, Q1 revenue is expected to be below the low end of the operational growth rate in our full year guidance due to a variety of reasons. First, Q1 2022 was a strong comparable quarter as we saw robust growth with limited impact from vet clinic labor constraints as well as minimal disruption from our diagnostics field force model change, which began in Q2. Additionally, in the quarter, we expect to see lingering impacts of the latest COVID wave in China. Lastly, the return of supply on certain products, including Simparica Trio, and subsequent channel restocking as well as promotions to regain share in Q4 2022 modestly increased inventory levels in the channel in the short-term. In Q1, we expect a modest decline in adjusted net income versus the prior year as a result of the timing of our 2022 sales force extension in the U.S., which did not start until Q2, as well as the R&D investment noted earlier, which is also off a low base in Q1 2022. Now to summarize. 2022 was another strong year despite some challenges, we significantly outperformed the market and continue to take share, all while growing the bottom line faster than the top line. As we begin 2023, we once again expect to grow faster than the market, driven by the strength of our innovative portfolio, our ability to successfully launch new products and expand existing markets and our confidence in the end market dynamics for the spaces we compete in. Now I’ll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Michael Ryskin from Bank of America.
Michael Ryskin: Great. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the quarter, guys. I’m going to throw in a couple of just real quick. First, I would have to get your latest thoughts on NexGard plus BI triple combo now that it’s been unveiled at VMX. Just what are your expectations for Simparica Trio growth this year, if you could give us a ballpark for that? And then second, I want to talk about R&D spend in 2023. It seems to have jumped quite a lot year-over-year, and that’s a big part of why operating margins aren’t expanding as much as we’re used to. Any specific programs you want to highlight? And anything you can say in terms of when that R&D spend will translate into future launches? Is this something that’s sort of in the regulatory phase or weight clinical phase? Just give us a sense of where the extra $100 million year-over-year is going? Thanks.
Kristin Peck: Sure. Thanks, Mike. I’ll take those and let’s see if Wetteny has anything to add. The first, on Trio, obviously, we had a phenomenal year with 58% growth. We’re really proud of that. Obviously, we got back in clinics after some of the supply problems, and we’re fully back there. We’ve got 90% penetration with an 80% reorder rate and are now the number two fleet tick heartworm there. We are expecting competition from NexGard Plus sometime in the first half. We actually assure you don’t know exactly when that will be but we continue to expect the market to expand, and we continue to expect Simparica Trio to be growing on the year. I mean, albeit probably not at 58%, but we expect to have a very strong year. I think what you’re going to see is really moving more customers from collars and topicals into what is a best-in-class fleet to heartworm combined oral products. So we expect to continue to go through this as we’ve continued to say, we don’t have any more information on the exact timing there. But we’re going to be aggressive. As you’ve seen us in Q4 and Q1, really investing behind this brand doing DTC, etcetera. So we expect strong growth there continuing even with a new entrant. And when you think about R&D spend, and I’ll start and I’ll see Wetteny wants to build there. We’ve gotten questions often from you and from a lot of our investors. Why don’t you spend more in R&D or if you had a program would you invest in it? And I think what we’re demonstrating is we see a very strong pipeline here. These incremental investments to your question are certainly the bigger ones are in late-stage development going into development that cost that, but also some great new technologies in the research side as well. So it’s brought across the portfolio. It is a significant investment. And hopefully, it’s assigned to all of you of our confidence in our pipeline and the strength of our R&D engine and our willingness to invest in that for the short and the long-term across their – we see obviously really big platforms there in parasiticides continuing to invest there, in dermatology and across our monoclonal antibody franchise, certainly, looking at long-acting as we’ve talked about, but also new disease areas. So I don’t know if I missed anything, Wetteny, do you want anything?
Wetteny Joseph: No. Look, I’ll just add a couple of points. Going back to Trio, we expect, as Kristin said, for Trio to grow significantly in the year, although as we now are well into our third year with a product, we wouldn’t expect it to continue to grow at 58%, which is what it did in 2022. Now the timing of our supply recovery in 2022 and the fact that as we see competition come in, it may drive some promotional activities that might drive some variability in terms of quarter-to-quarter in terms of where the growth is. But for the total year, we expect significant growth on Trio. And then on the R&D spend, it’s our practice that we don’t actually dictate what the investment in R&D is going to be. We let the pipeline dictated. And so as we see programs either coming into research or coming out of research into development or into late development as those programs require spending, and we do a full ROI spec, etcetera, on them, we go ahead and fund those. And so we’re very pleased to see that the pipeline is demanding this level of investment and we will still be able to deliver faster growth at ANI in revenue based on our guide of 6% to 8% of revenue and 7% to 9% at adjusted net income.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jon Block from Stifel.
Jon Block: Great. Thanks, guys and good morning. Wetteny, the 4Q GM of 68.1% was a little bit below us for the quarter, but the 2023 guidance of 70% to 70.5% was certainly solid. So maybe if you can just talk to the drivers for ‘23 gross margin or those the supply chain easing, maybe a little bit about the cadence? And then maybe just sort of as a tack on to that or the second question. In 2022, it was sort of a tale of two halves for atopic derm. One H was operational around 20%, two H operational, I think it was closer to 10%. I think you guys alluded to solid growth in ‘23, but do you want to just frame that for us? Is it a continued deceleration of atopic derm into ‘23 with no competition because I think you clarified that? Or can we expect some level of stabilization, call it, in that high single, low double-digit range for the atopic derm franchise? Thanks, guys.
Wetteny Joseph: Yes. So I’ll start and see if Kristin would add anything here. Let’s start with gross margins. Look, if you look at the year, we were able to expand margins on the year. And certainly, as we explained in the prepared commentary, we saw FX come in to the tune of about 80 basis point headwind against gross margin in the fourth quarter. And certainly, we’ve seen input costs or some manufacturing costs impact the gross margin picture that you saw in the fourth quarter. But given where OpEx came in, you saw substantial growth at ANI versus revenue where revenue came in at 9% in the quarter ANI coming and 27% growth in the quarter. I think as we go into 2023, given the timing of our price increases, which started at the beginning of the year, as you know, certainly, we’ve seen some inflation in input costs coming out of ‘22, but we go into ‘23 price increases that start to change that as we go into ‘23, which is why we give guidance where we see about 40 basis point margin – gross margin expansion on the year. And obviously, a point, if you look at the midpoint of our guidance on growth higher at ANI versus the top line is what I would say on the margin point. And certainly, as you look at continued growth of companion animal outpacing the growth of livestock in the business, that mix will be favorable to us in addition to what I already covered from a price perspective. I think if you look at the atopic derm, we delivered $1.3 billion of revenue in 2022, that’s a 17% increase. And we’re almost at 10 years since Apoquel was launched and it’s just amazing to see that we continue to expand the market, and we believe there is more room to expand not only in the U.S., where we grew 12% in 2022, but particularly in international markets, it takes longer to get to peak sales levels, and we delivered 27% growth in international. I think we will continue to see really solid growth across the business. We have had double-digit growth in 2023. Though it may not be at the level that you’ve seen in 2021, where we grew to think about 23% and then 17% in 2022, but we continue to see room to continue to expand the derm market here.
Operator: Our next question comes from Erin Wright from Morgan Stanley.
Erin Wright: Great. Thanks. So two questions here. One, how much did the lingering supply chain issues impact on Simparica Trio sales in the quarter, if at all? And how much did the stocking benefit offset that in the fourth quarter? And did you benefit across other product lines in terms of distributor stocking that we should be aware of in terms of that first quarter cadence as well. And just if you could talk a little bit more and maybe you touched on this with the gross margin dynamic. But in terms of overall price, you are taking across the two core species segments here. And then my second question is on Librela. Can you give us an update on the U.S. Librela approval? And what does guidance assume in terms of U.S. contribution from Librela is that material in 2023? Thanks.
Wetteny Joseph: Yes. So let me first touch on your questions around supply, and it’s Trio as well as other products. As we said in the third quarter call, while we had some outages in supply during the year, particularly in the third quarter, competitors actually took advantage of that and run promotions. And we certainly intended to run promotions as we recovered on supply, which we did in the fourth quarter. And so I think the timing of our supply recovery, whether it’s for Trio in the U.S. or for Revolution in China will drive some stocking levels, certainly as we enter into 2023, which we discussed. But I think typically, you’ll see some increase in inventory levels from Q3 to Q4 anyway, because distributors are anticipating our price increases and the intent to drive a little bit of that. So I would say when I look at across other products, it’s probably more in the range of typical increase that you would see. But if you look at Trio, we’re probably, if I had to bracket it in terms of the impact on Trio, if you back out, what would typically be an increase from Q3 to Q4 anyway. So the incremental contribution in the fourth quarter, I’d put somewhere in the $25 million to $30 million range. So it’s not a significant number for us. And certainly, as we discussed already, we factored that into our guidance, and we expect significant growth from Trio on the year. With respect to Librela, look, we continue to expect and I’m very confident that we will see an approval in a well in the first half of the year, our plans have not changed. We continue to plan to have an early experience program run on the program once we’ve gotten approval and we have the label set, etcetera, and that will transition into a launch sometime late in the year.
Kristin Peck: And our practice – just to build on that, our practice on that is that we do not include in our guidance or our budget if we’re expecting a late launch in the year. We’ve always done that as those have cover us for a while. So Librela is not in our current guidance that we provided. We will update the guidance once we have a better sense. And obviously, this is a big product and when it launches, it could have a big impact. So whether or not you have 1 month, 3 months, etcetera, 4 months, it makes a big difference. So we will update guidance once we have a better sense of that approval. So to clarify your second question, Librela is not in the guidance that we provided. We fully do expect to have it, but we will update our guidance once we have a better sense of what the exact timing is.
Wetteny Joseph: Yes. And we will give a better bracket in terms of what we expect the impact depending on the timing of the launch and what we see through the EEP program, etcetera.
Operator: Our next question comes from Louise Chen from Cantor.
Louise Chen: Hi, thanks for taking my questions, here. So I wanted to see if you could give more color on how you’re investing in supply to meet the growing demand for your products and when you actually expect to complete – or what your objectives here? Thank you.
Wetteny Joseph: Yes, I’ll take that. And see Kristin would add on anything. We are investing in a number of areas when it comes to our supply network, upload a couple of categories, I’d say, in the short – near-term, we have investments clearly in inventory to help absorb any shocks that come through the supply chain. We’re making investments in our demand planning processes and tools to give us better visibility etcetera as well as we don’t see that we are building in, in certain aspects of our inputs now coming into our manufacturing process. Longer term, as you may have listened on the prepared commentary, we’re making significant capital investments across our network across the network in the U.S. to support our monoclonal antibodies, both for products that have already been approved and are launching. And what we have in our pipeline is well from a math perspective. It is a platform that we continue to innovate on. And then all solid dose as well, whether it’s parasiticides, derm session in various aspects. We are making investments throughout the network for those we’re making investments to support our vector vaccine manufacturing, for example, as well for livestock and so on. So we are making investments across the organization, investments in tech and digital to leverage data again, to give us better visibility as well for the long-term to support our long-term growth aspirations.
Kristin Peck: The only thing I would build on there, Louise, is I mean if you look at the CapEx number that Wetteny was talking about in his prepared remarks, of $950 million to $1 billion. That is clearly the highest CapEx that we have had. But I also think you should look also at what we said were about R&D. And if you look at significant new investments in R&D, those are going to be products that we are going to have to be able to manufacture in a few years. What you are seeing is the commensurate investment in our manufacturing capabilities to be able to launch those products and really critical platforms across the globe. So, we are very confident in where our pipeline is, and we are going to invest in our manufacturing capacity to deliver on those products over the medium to long-term.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nathan Rich from Goldman Sachs.
Nathan Rich: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. The first one on Trio, I would be curious just to get a sense of what kind of factors you are watching as you think about the impact that competition could have. And magnitudes that would kind of push you to the higher or lower end of your range for competition. And are you anticipating any changes to pricing or your promotional cadence when competition enters? And then my second question on DRAXXIN. Just how much of a drag will that continue to be in 2023? I think you have previously said that you will start to cycle the second year of competitive entry in the first quarter, but I think there has been some more recent price changes. So, just curious what we should expect in terms of the impact on the livestock business this year?
Kristin Peck: Sure, Nate. I will take the first question and then I will let Wetteny take your second question on DRAXXIN. Look, we have been expecting competition for a long time on Trio, I would say. So, I would say we are well prepared for what that is. We have been investing heavily, obviously, behind DTC, really investing with our customers and with pet owners directly to make sure that when competition enters, that we have very pleased customers. And a few things I will point to there, obviously, it’s our direct-to-consumer advertising, I would say, our broad portfolio and our – as you look at our relationship with corporate accounts, we are very strong with corporate accounts. We are their preferred product. So, I think that will provide some resiliency. But I would also say auto ship remains a real strength. This is not a sector where people often switch unless there is a really good reason. So, new dogs they will make a choice. But they are not – I think customers are already on our product are not going to be that inspired to change. And if you look at the dynamics certainly in the U.S. around retail, it grew 43% on the year. It’s now about 11% of our U.S. business. And I highlight that because the more that insulates us from potential new entrants coming. And we obviously expect NexGard Plus, but I am sure there will be others over the next 1 year to 2 years that enter as well. So, we are really investing in insulating ourselves from that impact by investing in pet owner loyalty programs, DTC, a broad portfolio with innovation with our customers wanting to do corporate account side also underscore. And then lastly, auto ship and strong relationships with the retail sector. So, do you want to take the second question on DRAXXIN?
Wetteny Joseph: Yes, absolutely. Look, as we said from the very beginning, we were expecting DRAXXIN to have about 20% decline in the first year of generic competition and then another 20% in the second year. The first year was slightly better than our expectations coming in somewhere around 16% decline. But the second year was a little bit worse. So, I think we are sort of in that ballpark. I think the second year is about 25%. So, we are at a level now that once we lap, I would say, the second year, which would be through the first quarter of ‘23, which is why in the previous commentary, we said, particularly in the first quarter, I think we are at a low enough level, won’t be as meaningful as an impact on us, and I think the drag on our overall are stock business won’t be as significant. So, I would still expect some pressure on livestock given where U.S. cattle, for example, as a market is we are watching swine, particularly in China and anti [ph] has across other regions to determine where we end up lending. But we think livestock will be slightly down year-on-year, maybe marginally better than we – than you saw in 2023, where livestock was down 2%.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Westenberg from Piper Sandler.
David Westenberg: Thank you for taking the question. So, I want to kind of continue with the some on Trio dynamics. Can you talk about maybe if you got any word on in terms of what the label might look like on the competitive launch? And can you give a little bit more color? I think you said in the prepared remarks that you expect it to come from collars and topical. What are you kind of seeing in the marketplace that suggests that as opposed to whether maybe legacy oral parasiticides? And then kind of the second question here is on the increase in R&D spending, are you going to continue to give out some of the – what you have in pipeline about – I think you guys usually give out six months in advance to Wall Street. Is that kind of still the expectation when you talk about pipeline? And thank you very much.
Kristin Peck: Hi Dave. I will start on Trio and then maybe Wetteny can clarify if there is anything I am missing, and then let me take the R&D question as well. Look, we don’t have any clear signs of what the label of competition will be. We are very confident in our current label. We don’t think it has any holes. I have got to tell you, we are at 100% heartworm protection. So, I am not really sure where you are going to hit us on that. We have also been out on the market now since 2020 with this, which means we have a very strong set of safety data as well. So, I am sure, as always, they will – competition will enter and they will try to find any angle they can. But we don’t really think there is any holes in our label right now that we are concerned about. We are in puppies, if you look back to Simparica. And the second part of your question, look, yes, they will move from single agents. I think they will, single agents from just flea, tick or just heartworm products, I think we will move into the combination label for sure. But we are not expecting pricing to be a big factor initially. And really, that has to do with who is entering, because if they don’t enter the market similarly priced or higher than their current two products, they are going to cannibalize themselves. So, I think really, the power of who is entering does not lead us to believe that price is going to be a major factor and who enters. I mean obviously, we will adapt to whatever comes, whatever label they have, but we remain very confident in our label, in our relationships and in our data today. But – do you want to take the second question, or do you want me?
Wetteny Joseph: Yes. Look, it’s only small addition I will do to Trio is we do get to 100% heartworm after the first dose. So – and with the product being in the market almost 3 years and satisfaction levels being very high and penetration across clinics, etcetera, we are very confident on our position as competition enters into the space. On R&D, look, I think unlike human health in animal health is not as much visibility as given with respect to what’s being specifically worked in the pipeline, we see that as a competitive advantage for us given our track record and how we continue to drive innovation in the spaces that we enter. And so we won’t necessarily be changing that significantly here in terms of what we have in here, but we have talked about various aspects of unmet needs that if you were to ask veterinary practitioners, what are the top 5 or 10 unmet needs that they have, I think you would imagine that we are working on all of those areas.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.
Chris Schott: Great. Thanks so much. I just had a question on the overall volume comments you made. I think it was 1% to 2% volume growth at the low end versus 3% to 4% at the high end. Can you just elaborate on the dynamics there? So, how does that look at for companion versus livestock? And maybe as part of that, what’s implied in terms of vet visit growth this year? And is that even a relevant swing factor in any of the overall outlook for the business? Thank you.
Wetteny Joseph: Yes. So, look, I think if you look at our 2022 results, the net price contribution is about 3%. Now if you take vaccine out, that number is about 4% and companion animal would be at the higher number here, with certain products essentially above that. Now, we are very pleased to be able to take price, which typically is about 2% to 3%. And here in 2022, it was about double what we would normally do, and we still saw about 5% volume growth in 2022. So, as we look at 2023, I think you would see price with DRAXXIN impact being less than it was in ‘23 in particular, plus how we are going into price in certain products, I think you are going to expect a higher price contribution on the year, the timing of that in terms of where customers may have bought ahead of the price increases and so on. So, you might see a little bit of a lag in terms of when you see the price picture play out, but you would see at the low end of our range, but it’s a bigger contributor. But at the upper end, it’s all additional volume. In terms of where we see clinic traffic, certainly, we have seen vet visits come down versus the peak that we saw in 2021. In the fourth quarter, visits were down about 4%, but revenue per visit was up 10% and total revenue was up 6% on the quarter. Again, continuing the trends that we see as being sustainable which is pet owners willing to pay for innovation and seeing sustainably higher revenue for pet clinics. Now, we are still very early in 2023. But as we look at data, in January, we are seeing some increases in vet visits. Again, as we expected, we have been running above pre-pandemic levels. So, even in Q4, where visits were down 12%, they were actually still 2% above Q4 2019. And so we have been saying that, that’s the element to continue to watch. I think one month is a little bit early to call it, but we are expecting visits business to be flat to up in 2023, and we are starting to see some signals of that earlier in the year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brandon Vazquez from William Blair.
Brandon Vazquez: Hi everyone. Thanks for taking the question. My first is just on the diagnostics side, you guys have, I believe talked about this before, but maybe can you refresh us on where you are on some of the commercial changes, I think it was in the U.S., where those are and what that might mean for growth and potentially accelerating that business into ‘23-plus? And the other is just on China. You guys had a nice rebound there. I think you mentioned a little bit of supply coming back on the market, but maybe tempered that a little bit with COVID headwinds. So, curious how those two shake out maybe 1.5 months into this first quarter? Thanks.
Kristin Peck: Sure, Brandon. I will start and let Wetteny build on both of them. So, in diagnostics, first of all, just ready and are joining you from our national sales meeting actually out in Denver. And I would say the energy in our diagnostics team is just amazing. So, we will – as Wetteny mentioned in his prepared remarks, Q1, a little, but we didn’t have them on board until Q2 of 2022. So, what we are expecting as we look into 2022 as we get into the sort of middle of the year and the end of the year is really a return to at least market growth in the U.S., if not faster. We have continued to see very strong growth in international, as you saw from last year, and we expect that to continue into the year. So, we are really excited about the new field force, having them on the ground, having them fully up to speed. Wetteny and I spent a lot of time with them yesterday. So, I would say super optimistic overall in diagnostics, returning to growth across the board, certainly, the images platform and investments there. And then I will start on China and let’s see what Wetteny has to build on it. We did see overall strong growth in the year of 11% and we are optimistic so far year-to-date in sort of the return in China. We have seen both on the companion and animal side, a really strong rebound there as we look into – certainly, for us, our year is both December and January. December, obviously, with the number of people home stick there was a little weaker, but we are seeing really strong rebound in January. And we are looking, I think at a strong year for us in China. Also, as you look at livestock with opening up China, more return to eating out to travel, to tourism will not just be good for China, to be honest with you, it could be good for livestock across the globe. So, it’s one to watch, obviously, there is huge uncertainty around China not to mention geopolitical tensions and potential UFO these days. But we stayed really confident in where we think China will be for the year. But it remains a big risk both for China as well as for livestock across the board because I think a lot of if China returns, they will see China buying a lot of poultry, beef, etcetera, from Brazil, Europe, the U.S. there. But I don’t know if you want to build anything either on the diagnostics question or China, Wetteny?
Wetteny Joseph: Look, it’s great to be here in Denver with a large number of our colleagues on Valentine’s Day. But look, I think China, we have been very pleased to see how China ended the year high-double digit growth on the quarter. My comments around supply was just the timing of recovery, particularly on revolution, Revolution Plus in that market that might create some dynamics on quarter-to-quarter. But we are expecting really solid growth out of China this year. I think the first quarter though, given the timing of the COVID waves. Just as a reminder, our international segment closes in – at the end of November, which means the quarter really started in December for them. And so a lot of that occurred in the first quarter, and we are seeing that having an impact, but we do see a rebound and as Kristin said, it has implications for other markets in terms of exports into China, but we are expecting a really solid rebound there.
Operator: Our next question comes from Elliot Wilbur from Raymond James.
Elliot Wilbur: Thanks. Good morning. Wanted to go back to some of your early commentary around growth expectations for the key derm franchise? And just specifically thinking about the key levers in 2023, Kristin, I wonder if you can maybe just talk about, especially given the high level of penetration of Apoquel in the U.S. What the key levers there are going for or whether it would be price, new market entry, geographic expansion or just outperformance by Cytopoint relative to Apoquel? And then for Wetteny, just – I don’t know if you said this in your prepared commentary or not, I didn’t catch it if you did. But within gross margin guidance, could you just talk maybe about the inflationary headwinds that are sort of embedded in your guidance for this year? Thanks.
Kristin Peck: Sure. I would say a few things on derm, both domestically as well as globally. We will be looking to expand and I think as Wetteny said in his prepared remarks, reaching peak sales in some of these markets takes a little bit longer outside of the U.S. So, we are continuing to see very strong growth in dermatology, both in Apoquel and Cytopoint as well as life cycle innovation remains really important for us here. The movement to Apoquel Chewable – it’s been growing much faster than we expected and the conversion there remains very, very strong. So, I think it’s both, you are going to see growth in volume, certainly potentially a little more globally. But beyond Apoquel, I mean I think Cytopoint, that’s really love it and so do customers. It’s 100% compliance. So, I think if you look at the overall franchise, Apoquel, Cytopoint, Apoquel Chewable, we will probably see greater growth outside the U.S. So, we are both looking at volume. We have taken price consistently here. And certainly, 2023 will be no different here. So, I think you will see growth from both price and from volume, you will see chewable really building on it. I think you will see a real uptick in Cytopoint. Again, we are back to absolute full supply. We, as you know, last year, did need to make some trade-off decisions there, because that the same impacts as our other mAbs and in some of our vaccines with regard to some of the COVID vaccine supply challenges we had. But we are back full speed. So, we are also really investing in other big growth drivers here will be direct-to-consumer advertising in international. So, we are going to do unbranded DTC as we have started last year. And we are really – even in the U.S., you still have 6 million itchy dogs that are currently undiagnosed and not treated. So, we really continue to see growth here, as we said, double digit, as Wetteny mentioned earlier, but I will let Wetteny take the second question, obviously, on inflation in 2023 and etcetera.
Wetteny Joseph: Yes. So, look, I think across the macro elements, we have been appropriately prudent in how we have laid out this guidance in the range that we have given today. But specifically on gross margins, if you look at inflation, as we are preparing to come into the year, we are certainly accounting for significant inflationary pressure on some of our input costs, energy, Europe, etcetera. But as we have entered the year, I think they are a little bit better than what we anticipated coming into the year, but still significant inflation that’s baked into what we have here, which obviously are more than offset by our mix and our price, which is why you see some modest gross margin improvement year-on-year as we go through the year. But we have factored in a fairly significant inflationary pressure in the gross margin figures that we gave.
Operator: And our last question comes from Balaji Prasad from Barclays.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi. This is Akhila on for Balaji. Thanks for taking our questions. Just two for me. I guess could you first just provide some additional color on business development priorities for the year? And then building upon an earlier question, what are your volume expectations from new pet additions for the year? Thank you.
Wetteny Joseph: Yes. So, look, when you look at our capital allocation priorities, certainly investing in the business is the first place we go. And clearly, we are poised to significantly invest in the areas of R&D as well as across our supply chain and manufacturing – you saw the significant increase in R&D spend anticipated for 2023 versus 2022. And our CapEx numbers are going to be in the range of $950 million to $1 billion on the year. Certainly, as you look at our strategic priorities, they are aligned with where we look at from a BD perspective in terms of where there might be opportunities to accelerate some of those execution on our strategies. And they span across our current slate of businesses, including some of the R&D areas in terms of external innovation and so on. BD is one of those areas, as you know, is hard to predict in terms of exact timing and so on, but it is an important lever that I would say, second after investing in the business. And then thirdly, as you saw in 2022, we are returning capital to shareholders to the tune of $2.2 billion in total between share buybacks and dividends. Alright. I think you had a question – sorry, I think you had a question in terms of new pets. Look, if you look at the growth in the industry over the last two decades, it’s been about 5% to 6%. The way I look at it, vet visits, in essence, as you see pet population growth and so on, it would be reflected in that. They have accounted for about 1% of that growth historically. So, the bigger element of growth here is really pet owners’ willingness to spend for innovation, and you see that reflected in the spend per visit figures that are far more in terms of the impact on growth historically, and we anticipate that continuing. So, as you sit here today, I wouldn’t say new pet increases is a major factor into what we are looking at. It’s our innovation and pet owners willing to pay. And the demographics of pet ownership with Gen Z and millennials willing to spend more on pet health and prioritizing those as well as higher income households that are bringing pets and more pets into their homes. Those are the factors that we watch that contribute to growth.
Operator: It appears we have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the program back over to CEO, Kristin Peck.
Kristin Peck: Thank you so much, and thanks everybody for your questions and certainly for your continued interest in Zoetis. And just to summarize, we see really positive and sustainable demand for our products based on the fundamental drivers of animal health, we see continued strength across our diverse global portfolio, especially in our products for pet care. And we are continuing to invest in the talent, the pipeline and the manufacturing capabilities that can support our future growth, while adapting our business to the increasingly dynamic environment where we operate. So, we look forward to keeping you updated on future calls, and thanks so much for joining us today.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today’s conference. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-11-03 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Third Quarter 2022 Financial Results Conference Call and Webcast for Zoetis. Hosting the call today is Steve Frank, Vice President of Investor Relations for Zoetis. The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, and will not be forwarded automatically. In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call via dial-in or on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only and the floor will be open for your questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] In the interest of time, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and then queue up again with any follow-ups. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.
Steve Frank: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Zoetis third quarter 2022 earnings call. I am joined today by Kristin Peck, our Chief Executive Officer; and Wetteny Joseph, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements. And that, actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statements in today's press release and our SEC filings, including, but not limited to, our annual report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q. Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or US GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable US GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and the company's 8-K filing dated today, Thursday, November 3, 2022. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. With that, I will turn the call over to Kristin.
Kristin Peck: Thank you, Steve, and welcome, everyone, to our third quarter earnings call for 2022. While the world faces a dynamic external environment and uncertainty in the global economy, our business has been tested and continues to perform well, based on our diverse durable portfolio and global footprint. In the third quarter, we delivered solid results with 5% operational revenue growth, reflecting steady performance across our innovation-driven companion animal portfolio, especially in our international markets. Our international business grew 8% operationally and the US grew 2% in the quarter. As we've been saying for some time, supply challenges throughout the year remain a headwind to meeting global demand, and those impacts were more pronounced in the third quarter. Supply has been improving in certain product categories, such as parasiticides, and we continue prioritizing supply for key products and markets. However, we do expect constraints in some categories to continue. Overall, positive pet care trends in terms of increasing spend and pet owner demographics continue to underpin the strength of our business. With 10% operational growth in companion animal products in the third quarter, we continue to see strong demand globally for Simparica Trio and other parasiticides, our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint, small animal vaccine and monoclonal antibodies, Librela and Solensia. In the US, supply constraints for companion animal products tempered some of our expected growth in the quarter, and we also experienced an impact related to workforce challenges in veterinary clinics. The decline in clinic visits is stabilizing at pre-COVID rates, as clinics struggle with capacity issues. That being said, average revenues per visit continue to rise in the US as pet owners place a premium on the care of their pets, a positive long-term trend. This commitment to pet well-being is also demonstrated in the success of our monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain, Librela and Solensia. They are performing exceptionally well in the EU and Solensia is on track after being launched in the US at the end of the third quarter. We are investing in building a feline market for pain treatment and undertreated condition for cats. Outside of the US, companion animal products showed strong growth of 17% operationally. In some of our largest markets like China and Australia, we're seeing our innovative pet care products contributing more and more to growth in these traditionally live stock-driven markets. Meanwhile, our global livestock business performed largely as expected in the third quarter, with a decline of 3% operationally. We continue to face generic competition for livestock products, especially in cattle and poultry, and we face supply constraints in products such as vaccines. However, we are seeing solid pockets of growth, especially in aquaculture and poultry products and certain markets outside the US. As we stabilize from the generic competition, and review more consistent supply, we will improve our livestock performance. Looking ahead, we remain confident in the innovation-driven strength of our business especially in areas such as parasiticides, key dermatology products, vaccines and monoclonal antibodies. I am optimistic about the fundamental growth drivers and essential nature of the animal health industry to weather challenging times. However, we are revising our full year guidance to affect lower-than-expected sales in the second half of the year due to supply constraints, veterinary workforce challenges and recent changes to foreign exchange rates. We believe it is prudent to take a more cautious view, given the increasing uncertainty around supply, inflation and other macroeconomic conditions that have become less predictable. As we look ahead, to our tenth anniversary as an independent company next year and I reflect on all that we've achieved in the last decade, I feel very positive about where we are and the capabilities we have to overcome any challenges we face. Historically, we've always been able to adapt our business to meet evolving customer needs, drive growth faster than the market and achieve our purpose in nurturing the world and human kind by advancing care for animals. The human animal bond and people's connection to pets and farm animals is powerful. It's a bond we support with a diverse portfolio that remains the strength of our business, and we see strong global demand for innovative products, especially in companion animal parasiticides, dermatology, vaccines, diagnostics and monoclonal antibodies for pain. Positive pet owner demographics and their willingness to spend on the care of their animals remain long-term sustainable drivers of growth, despite some of the workforce challenges in clinics and livestock continues to be an important part of our business, an area where we drive significant value for our customers and shareholders. To sustain our growth, innovation remains our lifeblood, and we continue investing in the industry's leading R&D engine at Zoetis. Our monoclonal antibody portfolio for OA pain is a game changer. It has been performing exceptionally well as a pet treatment and growth driver in an increasing number of markets, and Librela is expected to be a blockbuster for Zoetis in 2022. In terms of the US approval for Librela, we have confirmed dates for the FDA site inspections outside the US, but their timing makes it unlikely to have an approval this year. Given our ongoing conversations with the FDA, we are confident in receiving approval in the first half of 2023 with a launch planned for late in the year. In closing, our business continues to perform well in a dynamic market and we are well positioned to advance our strategic growth opportunities in parasiticides, dermatology, pain, diagnostics and emerging markets. Even as we face challenging supply constraints, generic competition and macroeconomic uncertainty, I remain confident in the resilience of our business and colleagues, as we finish 2022 and we go into 2023. Given the importance of the companionship and nutrition provided by pets and farm minimals and the power of the human animal bond, the animal health industry has consistently grown in the mid-single digits, even in down markets. And as the leader in animal health, we have the pipeline, market leadership positions, global scale and financial strength to continue outpacing the market. Throughout the last 10 years in various market conditions, we have grown the top line an average of about 8%. And even in the last recession, when our business was more livestock than companion animal, we still grew. As we look toward the end of the year and into 2023, I expect us to continue setting the bar on innovation, cultivating a high-performing culture and delivering superior customer experiences. All of this will have us growing significantly above the market and building enduring value for shareholders in this dynamic market. Thank you. Now let me hand things over to Wetteny.
Wetteny Joseph: Thank you, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. As Kristin mentioned, we had a solid quarter with growth across a number of our core franchises, driven by our companion animal performance, especially in international. Today, I will focus my comments on our third quarter financial results, the key drivers contributing to our performance and provide an update on our full year 2022 guidance. In the third quarter, we generated revenue of $2 billion, growing 1% on a reported basis and 5% on an operational basis. Adjusted net income of $566 million declined 5% on a reported basis and grew 2% on an operational basis. Of the 5% operational revenue growth, 4% is from volume and 1% from price. Volume growth consisted of 4% from new products, which includes Simparica Trio and our monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain in dogs and cats, Librela an Solensia and 1% from key dermatology products, while other in-line products declined 1%. The decline was largely the result of supply challenges. Companion animal products continue to be the primary driver of growth, growing 10% operationally, with livestock declining 3% on an operational basis in the quarter. Simparica Trio was the largest contributor to growth in the quarter. Trio posted global revenue of $172 million, representing operational growth of 43% versus the comparable period in 2021. We expect to continue to grow the addressable market for flee, tick and heartworm globally and see significant room for growth with brands like Simparica Trio, Simparica, ProHeart and Revolution Plus. Meanwhile, our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint, had solid global growth, especially internationally, with $343 million of revenue, representing 11% operational growth against a robust prior year in which these products grew 26% operationally. Year-to-date revenue is $966 million, representing 18% operational growth. Sales of our monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain in dogs and cats in International continue to exceed expectations, posting $37 million of sales in the quarter. Switching to Diagnostics. Our global Companion Animal diagnostics portfolio recorded $78 million in revenue in Q3, declining 9% operationally. Despite declining revenues, we saw solid new instrument placements in the quarter. The decline in our US diagnostics portfolio was partially offset by growth internationally in the quarter. In the US, our diagnostics results were also impacted by the vet clinic workforce challenges, and we continue to experience a slowdown in sales as we transition to our new go-to-market model and build out a sizable and new dedicated field force for diagnostics. While disruptive in the short term, this investment is putting the necessary elements in place to position and grow our diagnostics portfolio over the long run. We expect the effectiveness of our new diagnosis field force to improve gradually into 2023. Diagnostics remains core to our business and a key long-term growth driver for Zoetis. Meanwhile, sales of lifestyle products declined by 3% operationally in the quarter. Our portfolio continues to be challenged by generics and cheaper alternatives to Draxxin in cattle as well as Zoamix in poultry and supply challenges for certain products. Our fish portfolio grew 19% operationally in the quarter and along with the strength of our sheep products in Australia, partially offset the broader decline. Now moving on to revenue growth by segment for the quarter. US revenue was $1.1 billion in the quarter, growing 2%, with companion animal sales growing 6% and livestock sales declining by 7%. Focusing first on companion animal. The effects of our ongoing supply challenges were more pronounced in the third quarter, tempering growth in our parasiticides. In US companion animal, we are also seeing vet clinic workforce challenges limiting appointment availability as visits declined 4% in the quarter. Despite lower visits, practice revenue is growing approximately 5% and as spending per visit remained strong again this quarter, increasing more than 9%. The decline in clinic visits is stabilizing at pre-COVID levels, as the impact of higher pet ownership growth rates due to COVID normalize and vet practices deal with workforce challenges. However, underlying demand for veterinary care remains robust throughout the country, even as people return to work. While vet clinic workforce challenges do exist, we believe vet clinic revenue will continue to grow at levels above what we were seeing prior to COVID as the standard of veterinary care continues to increase through innovation, better pet ownership demographics, higher compliance and more pets. Even with the robust comparative year, we continue to see volume growth in our companion animal products, driven by our innovative products, such as Trio and our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint. Growth of Simparica Trio was again strong in the quarter with sales of $157 million in the US, growing 43%. Despite the impact of supply constraints and the vet clinic workforce challenges, we continue to take share within individual clinics. These dynamics will provide additional runway for future expansion of both the broader market and revenue growth for Trio. Key dermatology products sales in the US were $231 million for the quarter, growing 6% with Apoquel and Cytopoint each contributing to growth. Year-to-date, our US derm portfolio has grown 12%. Growth is tempered by prior year cover related spice in derm visits that drive visit growth of 25% in Q3, 2021, and help accelerate market expansion. This growth was also impacted by the ongoing pet clinic workforce challenges. We expect continued expansion of the market for the foreseeable future. US livestock declined 7% in the quarter as expected, with sales of cattle products impacted by generic competition for Jackson. Meanwhile, our US poultry portfolio continues to be negatively impacted by the expanded use of lower cost alternatives and generic competition for Zoamix. US swine product sales declined 3% in the quarter, driven primarily by increased competition for vaccines. Moving on to our International segment, where revenue declined 2% on a reported basis and grew 8% operationally in the quarter. International Companion animal revenue grew 17% operationally and livestock revenue was flat operationally. Increased sales of comparing animal products resulted from growth of monoclonal antibodies for alleviation of osteoarthritis pain, our key dermatology products, and Simparica Trio. We remain excited with the long-term prospects of these innovative brands and expect future direct-to-consumer advertising to help drive additional growth. Sales of companion animal vaccines also contributed to growth in the quarter. We continue to be pleased with the performance of our monoclonal antibodies for OA pain with Librela generating $31 million and Solensia delivering $6 million in third quarter sales. Librela remains on track to exceed $100 million in revenue this year, a new blockbuster for Zoetis. As we have mentioned in prior quarters, Librela is the number one pain product in the EU with the underlying performance metrics being very favorable for future growth. Reordering rates remain high. Compliance continues to exceed our initial expectations and we continue to see significant opportunity to expand the pain market with a meaningful percentage of dogs on Librela being new to the market. We saw volume growth in our international companion animal portfolio in the third quarter and we also saw growth across our injectable products, including monoclonal antibodies and vaccines. Meanwhile, international livestock was flat operationally in the quarter. Our fish portfolio grew 19% operationally and experienced increased demand for vaccines in key salmon markets, including Norway and Chile. Sales of sheep products grew as a result of favorable market conditions and new product launches in Australia. Growth was offset by swine sales, which declined due to supply constraints across international and lower sales across Europe due to reduced exports to China and higher input costs for producers. Sales in Brazil also declined as we are seeing supply challenges on cattle products. Additionally, inflationary impacts on consumer spending are driving consumption away from beef to lower-cost animal proteins such as pork and chicken and reducing reducer profitability. Lastly, the Jurox acquisition, which is based in Australia, was completed on September 30 and is not reflected in our Q3 results. Now moving on to the rest of the P&L for the quarter. Adjusted gross margins of 69.8% decreased 90 basis points on a comparable basis to the prior year, resulting primarily from unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. Operationally, gross margin slightly declined, driven by higher manufacturing, freight and other costs, which were largely offset by favorable mix and price. Adjusted operating expenses increased 3% operationally, with SG&A growth of 3% operationally, driven by T&E costs beginning to return to pre-COVID levels as well as freight and logistics. R&D expenses increased 4% operationally due to higher compensation costs and higher operating costs. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.9%, an increase of 420 basis points due to unfavorable changes to the jurisdictional mix of earnings, including decreased favorability related to foreign-derived intangible income in the prior year period. And finally, adjusted net income grew 2% operationally and adjusted diluted EPS grew 4% operationally for the quarter. Capital expenditures in the third quarter were $154 million. In the quarter, we repurchased approximately $375 million of Zoetis shares and returned over $0.5 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. Year-to-date, we have repurchased almost $1.2 billion of Zoetis shares. Now moving on to our updated guidance for the full year 2022. For operational revenue growth, we are lowering our growth to 7% to 8%, previously 9.5% to 10.5%. We are also lowering our operational growth expectations for adjusted net income to a range of 9% to 11%, previously 11% to 13%. This change in guidance is reflective of our Q3 results, continued impact from supply challenges and the ongoing veterinary workforce challenges. Foreign exchange rates on our updated guidance are as of late October and reflect the continued strengthening of the US dollar. Beginning with revenue for the full year 2022 due to lowering of our guidance and the impact of foreign exchange, we are now projecting revenue of between $8.0 billion and $8.075 billion. We lowered our operating expense guidance for the full year, reflecting lower expenses in both Q3 and Q4, which reflects our ability to manage costs. Additionally, it is worth noting that our expected Q4 expense decline is also impacted by an easier comp due to heavy spending in the fourth quarter last year. Additionally, our guidance for adjusted interest expense and OID was changed to reflect favorable changes to interest income. We now expect adjusted net income to be in the range of $2.27 billion to $2.31 billion. And finally, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.83 to $4.90 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.51 to $4.59. While lower, our full year 2022 guidance once again reflects our value proposition of growing revenue in line with or faster than the market and growing adjusted net income faster than revenue over the long term. Our success will continue to come from our diversified portfolio of enduring brands driven by multiple sources of in-line growth, productive innovation and our infrastructure to develop and expand market globally. We expect to continue to execute across multiple dimensions of our business and capitalize on key growth opportunities for the foreseeable future. Now I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Erin Wright: Great. Thank you for taking my question. So when we think about some of these headwinds and tailwinds related to 2022, what is now proving to be more challenging than anticipated? Is it mostly the supply chain issues, or is it other factors here? And can you quantify the supply chain constraints, what sales would have been excluding these dynamics? And then, how should we think about those broader headwinds and tailwinds from an operational perspective into 2023, as we think about both livestock and companion animal, should low single-digit livestock growth in 2023 be the right way to think about it? And then, if that's the case, how do we think about companion animal operational growth in 2023? And I'll stop there. Thanks.
Kristin Peck: Sure. Thanks, Aaron. I'll start and I'll let Wetteny build on this one. I mean, I think, the first thing to start with is fundamentally and structurally the veterinary business and importantly, demand for our products remains stronger than it was before COVID. I think we've got still a very healthy business. If you look at sort of the headwinds as we looked at the second half of this year, by far, supply was the biggest, and I'll let Wetteny comment on sort of sizing them I would say that was the significant driver for us in Q3. And as we look into Q4, I mean, certainly, we can talk about vet clinic visits as well. But I think for us, we really believe that the supply issues that we were facing were really the primary driver for us. And as we look into 2023, I think the really good news around that is -- as we look at the ones we faced this year, as we talked about supply from the beginning of the year, we had MABS issues. We worked through that. We're now in full supply on our MABS in all the markets that we've launched in. So I think that one is one we've addressed. We did have paras challenges in Q2, Q3, honestly, our supply came in too late in Q3. And I think if you look at Simparica Trio in particular, our competitors took advantage of the top shelves. And so it's taken us a little longer to get back on shelf than we had hoped. But again, I think the paras problem will work itself out as you look into Q4. We have challenges as well in Rev. for Rev and Simparica, Q3 is a really important quarter for us. And so I think you saw that. I think, again, the really good news is demand remains strong for these products, and we've addressed most of those supply issues. There'll be some small ongoing ones, as you know, in our industry, Aaron, you followed us a long time. We always have challenges around vaccines. When you supply as many products as we do across as many species globally, there's always some level of it, and some of those will continue into next year. But we're really confident that the biggest challenges we were anticipating this year around MAB have been addressed. As you look at paras, both Trio and Rev, we'll work through that by the end of this year. We have really clear plans in place. I mean, obviously, there'll be some ongoing one in vaccines, but that's more usual, of course, but Wetteny, do you want to sort of get some for second and third questions?
Wetteny Joseph: Yeah, sure. Erin, as we've been saying throughout this year, supply certainly remains a headwind to meeting global demand. And as Kristin mentioned, the timing of recovery on some of these is very important. So as we went throughout the year and face supply constraints, particularly in Trio, despite the fact that Trio has performed really well for us, growing 65% on a year-to-date basis. The reality is, we had outages throughout the peak parasiticide season for Trio to Q2 and Q3, though we recovered late in Q3, the impact was such that we allowed competitors to be more aggressive about placing products on shelves, which we saw that impact as we exited Q3. But going forward, we do anticipate continuing to see some impact for Revolution, Revolution Plus, where we are selectively looking at key markets to deliver those products against others. So that is something that we're carrying into the fourth quarter, and we have reflected in the guidance that we have issued today. So while our business faces other impacts outside of supply, whether it's workforce or macro in certain markets. By far, the supply constraints are the biggest impact here, looking at how we've seen the year sort of transition versus what we saw earlier. And so, if you look at the guidance change here of about $200 million reduction in guidance, I would say, FX and supply account for more than 75% of that, with supply being by far the largest majority of that.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please, go ahead.
Michael Ryskin: Great. Thanks. And I have a quick follow-up on that last point and then touch on something else. So on the supply issues, I think a lot of what you just commented on, Kristin and Wetteny was that, as you guys have these challenges in the quarter, your competitors took advantage of stock shelves. How should we think about that longer term? Is that a temporary switch over? Meaning, can you gain that back once you resolve especially some of the older products of Revolution, but also Trio, whether that happens this quarter or next quarter, are you going to be able to push those competitors out of those positions easily, or is that something that’s going to be a little bit more of a challenge to regain your footing there? And then, I also want to touch on Librela approval. It seems like that time line has slipped a little bit with the OUS inspection date. I'm just wondering, how does that change your launch expectations and ramp expectations in the United States. I mean, you talked about second half 2023 or later in 2023 launch. So just walk us through the dynamics there. Thanks.
Kristin Peck: Sure. I'll start and I'll let Wetteny build on this one. As you think about competitors, yes, I am very confident that we will get our shelf space back, and there's -- this is -- I very much see this as temporary. We're not worried as Wetteny said, this product is really well received by our customers and by pet owners. It's growing 65% on the year. So I am very confident we will get that back. So I see that absolutely as temporary. So I think the other important thing here as we look at Simparica Trio, in particular, is that, when it comes to competition, the latest update we have is we are no longer expecting competition early in 2023 based on what we're hearing. As always, this is hard as a private company, and no one gives us much information on some of the private companies here and that a lot of them are not public, but our basic intelligence at this point is, we don't see something launching against us as well early in the year, and we'll clearly leverage that opportunity to gain share as well. So I think that is also incremental news as we think about Trio. And when it comes to Librela, I mean, obviously, we were hoping for an approval this year, depending on when we get it next year, we just have to -- everything moves based on what that is. So we're still obviously hoping for a launch as we expected. But without knowing the exact timing of the approval into next year, it just moves proportionately, as you probably know. So I think that's just the only incremental news there. We're confident, well, no matter what, we'll get a launch next year. But the timing of it is just we'll have to update it once we get the final approval on that. I don't know, Wetteny, did I miss anything there?
Wetteny Joseph: I'll just add a couple of points on Trio. Look, if you look at combination, flee, tick, heartworm, it's still a relatively new standard of care. And what you continue to see is in this very important part of the market, which is north of $5 billion globally. This expansion going from topicals and orals -- topicals and collars into orals and then now with triple combinations, we'll continue to expand that into the market and grow the market as well. So even with competition, we expect to continue to grow. So this dynamic that we described that occurred as we exited Q3 -- between Q2 and Q3, we see that as a temporary effect, and we'll continue to drive our share here. And particularly, since we are not anticipating a delay in terms of competition, though it's hard to say exactly when it will come. It could come in 2023, but we don't expect it early in the year. With respect to Librela, what I would say is, we continue to be extremely pleased and the product continues to perform better than our expectations across Europe. And though we've had capacity constraints that didn't allow us to be able to take full advantage of demand this year and we've had to actually make trade-offs in terms of delaying launches in other markets. As we exit the year, we anticipate next year being able to launch the product in additional markets outside the US and outside of Europe. And the product, again, continues to perform really well for us. So we're very pleased with that. And so this sort of delay in terms of when the actual approval will happen in the US, given the dynamics we're seeing in terms of the expansion of 40% of the dogs that have been put on the product and new to the market. The less of time duration of use of the product, et cetera, all bode well for sort of continued growth in this area and expansion of the pain market beyond the timing of the launch, et cetera.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Please, go ahead.
Nathan Rich: Great. Thanks for the questions. I had a follow-up on the supply constraints as well. Wetteny, it seems like based on your commentary on the second half revenue revision, the supply constraints would be something like a 200 to 300 basis point impact on second half volumes. I just wondered to see if that number is in the right ballpark. And as we think about the go forward, will there be a headwind in 4Q? It sounded like those -- a large majority of the constraints that may have been resolved by the end of the third quarter. Just wanted to see what we should expect for the third -- for the fourth quarter, excuse me. And then into 2023, would you anticipate there to be any lingering supply constraints or should everything be resolved at that point? Thank you.
Wetteny Joseph: Yes. So, look, what I would say is, supply issue is not unique to us, given the wide variety of products and species. It's relatively commonplace in this industry, as I've learned coming in about a year-and-a-half ago. I think the level that we're seeing now is certainly elevated over the last couple of years. And in particular, we saw more of an impact here in Q3, given the timing of our recovery on some of these, right? So I do think we expect to see some continued impact into Q4, but we reflected those in the guidance that we just issued today. I mentioned Revolution, for example, being one of them and quite frankly, throughout the years in the MABS where we are confident in our ability to fulfill demand next year, not only in Europe but other markets outside of Europe. We've made trade-offs in MABS even between, for example, Cytopoint and Librela, right? So I do think those impacts have had their effects on this year. But as we go into next year, we're confident in those. I think vaccines is an area that you typically see certain supply constraints in and challenges, and I think we'll continue to see those into 2024 and as we exit the year, we'll continue to make progress on Revolution, but it is certainly having an impact on the fourth quarter as well is what I would say. Of course, we'll have a lot more color to provide on the next call with respect to 2023, but we feel confident on the biggest products that have the greatest impacts. If you look at Trio from a parasiticide perspective, confidence in terms of supply going into next year. And for our MABS, particularly Librela launches, et cetera, and for Cytopoint for next year, we feel very confident about that as well. So those are big movers for us going into 2023.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Louise Chen with Cantor. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Louise Chen: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions here. So I wanted to ask you with the potential competition coming for some of your key products next year. Do you still think you can grow through those if they do come next year? And then second question I had for you is on innovation and livestock. When do you see that next phase of innovation and when will we possibly see growth getting beyond that sort of 3% to 4% that we've seen historically for a while? Thank you.
Kristin Peck: Sure. Louise, in your first question with regards to competition, I think the good news is we're not expecting competition early in the year anymore on Trio. But regardless of when competition arises, I do think we'll continue to grow through this. If you look at this category, even when [indiscernible] were introduced and you saw one then two then three, this category grew, we launched a triple combination, and we grew incredibly well. I think there was plenty of space here. Wetteny mentioned earlier, there's still movement from topicals and collars and this is a really innovative category. So I do believe you'll continue to see growth. As you look at dermatology, I would say the same thing. I think a competitor can help us continue to grow this market. There are still 6 million untreated dogs. The usage of this product in international is still significantly below that of the US when you have the same number of dogs with the conditions. So we continue to believe there is growth across these. Obviously, growth may decelerate in derm with a competitor, but I still think these are going to be growing markets. I think the innovation. And don't forget, we continue to look at life cycle enhancements for all of these products. We are not stopping with what we have. So I think there's a lot of visibility into a competitor might come, but not necessarily some of the innovations in these key product categories that we'll continue to do. With regards to innovation and livestock, Wetteny, do you want to take that one with regards to growth rates?
Wetteny Joseph: Yes, sure. Look, I think if you look at livestock, as we said, this is a segment that has grown in the sort of 3% to 4% range historically. And given the impact that we're seeing from generic competition for Draxxin, Zoamix, et cetera, we've been performing below that. But as we sit here, if we, for example, were to pro forma out the Draxxin impact, you would see growth in our livestock business, even in the quarter that we delivered negative 3 on Q3, which is similar to last quarter. And so, I think, as we look to exit this year, I think livestock will be slightly below the performance you saw in Q3, given the intensification of some of the generic competition. But beyond that, as we look beyond out exiting 2023 into 2024, et cetera, we'll have to take a look at what the macro is. I think if you look at cattle in key markets across Brazil, and elsewhere in the US, we'll have to really continue to look at what the macro is. But in terms of innovation, we continue to make innovation that, quite frankly, you're not seeing the impact of them in the current year because of the impact of generic competition. So if you look at inhibition in terms of poultry with vector vaccines that we're starting to launch in the US. If you look at some of our swine vaccines that we're launching elsewhere, we've had some supply constraints in those as well. So you're not seeing the full effect of those. But beyond this year and beyond the generic competition is that sort of supply pull, you start to see growth coming out of our livestock business. I just want to make one more point going back to derm. We don't -- last earnings, we said we don't see competition for derm in the first half of next year. Now, three months later, there's still no new news, right? And so, I think, as you know, in the space, it's not that we have specific data on what folks have. And so, it's about a six-month time frame that we look ahead. And three months later, we still don't see anything. So it's not to say that we expect competition next year is just we don't have any data that says there will be any in the first half. So I just want to make that clarifying point as you asked the question around competition next year.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Jon Block with Stifel. Please, go ahead. Your line is open.
Jon Block: Thanks, guys. Good morning. I'll ask both upfront. I think the 2022 out margin was, I believe, largely unchanged despite the lower revenue. And Wetteny, you mentioned managing OpEx, but I think you guys also wanted to invest, you've got some notable new opportunities in front of you. So how do we think about that? In other words, is this an OpEx push on the investment into 2023, or should we still expect the bottom line growing decently above the top line next year 2023? And then Kristin, just to shift gears, can you just maybe elaborate a little bit on, call it, the company's line of sight into these supply constraints fully resolving in 2023. At least for me, it seemed like the Trio issue came as a little bit of a surprise. And maybe just a tack on to that, do we think of these sales as lost, fully lost or at least a portion push? Because I would think from a consumer to go from -- to a triple and then back to a duo, is there something where some of these can be recouped in the early part of 2023? Thanks, guys.
Wetteny Joseph: Yes. So I'll take the first part of the question in terms of how we see margins and investments, et cetera. We've made a number of investments across the business, whether you look at what we're doing in R&D, what we've done with respect to our field force, and we'll continue to do across the diagnostics in our pet care field force, for example, in the US, we're making investments across our supply chain and manufacturing, obviously, given the demand we're seeing across our products and anticipated launches of other products out into the future. So we'll continue to make those investments, but we do have the ability to manage discretionary spend and you see that play out in the third quarter, where OpEx was below top line growth. And in fact, other than the tax rate difference to last year, if you look at our earnings before taxes, those grew at 8% on a 5% top line growth. So you see that leverage playing out in the P&L. And we have the ability to continue to do that. And I think we'll continue to use price to drive margins. The mix is favorable to us, given companion animal continues to grow faster than livestock. So companion animal grew 10% in the quarter where livestock declined 3%. So that mix is favorable to us, although, we see some offset with respect to inflation and so on, but you continue to see those drivers, and we can anticipate those going into next year. So we'll continue to make investments in select areas, again, prioritizing R&D prioritizing manufacturing and supply chain, for example, but we'll manage discretionary spend elsewhere to still deliver a leveraged P&L, which is what we've said. Now there may be quarters, where that doesn't play out exactly. But I think if you look at a year, you will see us continue to do that. And that margin between top line growth and bottom line growth may be less than what the business naturally can do, but that's because we're making investments where we see the need, but we will still manage to deliver annually a leveraged P&L is our target.
Kristin Peck: And sure, I'll take your second question around visibility into supply resolution. When we started the year, like many companies across many different sectors, we knew supply challenges would be there waiting on things as you look at ones where -- to your point, were we a little surprised by what happened with specifically Trio and Rev. I mean the honest answer is yes, we thought they would resolve faster. It's not that we weren't aware this was a capacity issue. We needed to build capacity and specifically some of this at a third party. And honestly, getting that third party on took us a little longer than we expected. We set a really an OpEx team over there to try to work on it and the timing of the resolution took us longer than we expected on that one. Why am I have visibility to why I say it's better, because we're having a weekly call, I'm looking at their output on a weekly basis for both Revolution and Trio, and they're doing really well. I think they're delivering consistently. They're up and running. And so I have visibility, and that's why I have strong confidence. And that's why Wetteny has strong confidence that as we look in to resolve through Q4, we're managing through back orders right now. So we just got to get product out to market, and we're prioritizing the markets at the biggest ones and right now, and we'll get it to everyone by the end of this year, early next year. But when you're back, a few months on a product like Rev+, for example, in markets where that's a huge product, it takes a little while to get them fully back in supply. And that's why we have full confidence. We knew what the issue was. It was capacity there. With Librela and Solensia, it was component parts, and we knew we were competing as well. That's why Wetteny was talking about, we were making trade-offs between products there. We have that in full supply. A lot of these were some were COVID-related. Some of these were capacity related and some were component parts related. It's been challenging for many companies to work through this. But we are as a leadership team managing this very carefully as Wetteny and I said in the first and second quarter calls, constantly working with GMS, we have full visibility into what is happening for each of these products, and that's why we have confidence as to when they will resolve and when we'll get into full supply in key markets. So hopefully, anything else want to add there.
Wetteny Joseph: Look, I just think one of the things that I've really learned in the last 18 months be in this space is, it's not if you recover from a supply constraint, it’s when you recover really matters. So we talk about that already in parasiticides from a season perspective. But that's true across livestock. If you look at gaining supply in time for fall cattle run in the US is important. And so, if you missed that window, you have a greater impact than you thought. So if you were planning to and executing towards the timing of that, and you cover a little bit later, that's where you start to see the impact. And I think that's what's played out here as we exit Q3 and why some of this might appear as a little bit of a surprise to you.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Brandon Vazquez with William Blair. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Brandon Vazquez: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to focus on -- we have talked about 75% of the lowered guide was FX and some of the supply constraints. Maybe that smaller portion, the 25% and less, I think, was vet staffing issues. So maybe, can you talk a little bit about what kind of changed what incrementally maybe got worse in the vet staffing issues, how that's trending into the fourth quarter, so we can kind of frame up how that might be a headwind as we go into 2023? And really how -- what kind of confidence you have that, it's not maybe a demand issue as macro conditions worse and it's really just a vet staffing issue? Thanks.
Kristin Peck: Sure. I mean, look, I'll go back to where I started. If you look at demand at the vet clinic, there's no question that it is fundamentally remaining strong. Current staffing and vet visits is ahead of where it was pre-COVID. So this is not like, Oh My God, everything went down, where are we going. It is a realignment. And I think what -- why are we confident in demand? Well, there are more pets, I mean, why we have a capacity problem is not actually that there are fewer visits, is there are more pets than we had before as we saw the sort of pandemic boom. The pet parents are more millennials. They spend more time on their pets, spend more money on their pets. They're more invested in the preventative care of their pets, which increases demand. So we remain very confident that demand is very strong. It has proved resilient through other challenging macroeconomic times. So what we need to work with vets on is how to better leverage vet techs and other ways to make sure that they can see as many pets as they possibly can. So we remain very confident, this is not a demand issue. It is a capacity issue. We have to create more capacity than they had pre-COVID. There's ways of doing this by helping them improve their productivity across the different spaces. But, I mean, just putting that in numbers, why are we confident there we're fine is, if you look overall right now, the spend per visit is up 9% and clinic revenues are up 5% in the quarter. We did see a 4% decline in vet visits, but that was over a quarter at unprecedented levels, if you look back to last Q3. So the veterinary industry is structurally and fundamentally in good shape. We have to help them create additional capacity for all the new pets we have, but I think demand remains strong.
Wetteny Joseph: I would just say, look, as I said earlier, there are other factors that impact our business. I mean you do see some macro in some select markets. So if I look at Brazil, for example, you see a trade down from beef to poultry and swine. If you look at China, we continue to see lockdowns impact consumption, particularly on the livestock side. But if you look at companion animal performance, even in those markets, despite the significant letdowns in China, you see strong double-digit growth in companion animal. We saw double-digit growth in companion animal even in Brazil, despite the macro. So I do think this speaks to the resiliency of particularly on the companion animal side of the space, even in challenging macro areas. And then, the other thing I'll say with respect to a very strong comp is, if you look at derm, our third quarter last year, derm grew 26% globally. It was north of 20% in the US. And so when you have labor capacity constraints at the vet clinic, being able to perform above that level of growth from a prior year perspective becomes a challenge. So, again, supply is by far the biggest challenge we faced all year and certainly in the third quarter. But the macro continues to be largely from a demand perspective, remaining strong.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please, go ahead.
Chris Schott: Great. Thanks so much. Just a couple of quick ones here for me. I just want to come back to Trio. With this competitor delay that you're talking about for early next year. I just want to make sure I'm clear. Is there going to be any supply issues as a rate limiter for growth of Trio in 2023 or was this more of a onetime issue in 2022. So, I guess, can you fully take advantage of that delay in competition as we think about the spring season next year? And my second question was on the ongoing supply issues. I know this is -- in the near term, you can't do much about this. Is there an ability to either hold higher inventories or just think about supply differently kind of going forward to ensure that, I guess, these issues don't happen again in the future. Again, I know you can't deal with that in the 3Q, but just as we think about kind of 2023 and beyond, or do you view this, as discussed, a moment in time where there's not much of an ability to manage this? Thanks, so much.
Kristin Peck: Sure. As you look at Trio for 2023, yes, we will be able to leverage the opportunity. Again, the challenge we had this year was getting new capacity online with a third party that took us longer than we expected. That is online and performing well. So we remain confident going into next year that we can leverage that opportunity and certainly have plans in place to do so. And your second question was around -- what was your second question?
Chris Schott: The ability to manage inventory and so on to -- 
Kristin Peck: Yes. I mean, look, we're holding -- by the way, we have tried to do that already. If you look -- focusing on resilience and managing inventory better. If you look at our inventory, we've invested a lot in making sure that we have component parts. As we see in our industry, being out of stock has a significant cost for the company. So we're certainly looking at how we can invest in that. But prudently, a lot of the buildup you're seeing right now is in raw materials and things like that to make sure we have on hand what we need to make it, and we're focusing that on our most important products. So you can manage a lot of this through inventory, assuming you have capacity. But if you look at the biggest challenges we faced this year, it was getting on board capacity in key products and getting some of the component parts for things like MAB. And we have figured that out, but -- in the sense of the MAB, and we do have the capacity online. So you do -- you can definitely leverage inventory in certain cases, except when your challenge is capacity or a component part. But I don't know if you want to add to.
Wetteny Joseph: The only thing I would say is, look, the actions we've taken this year will continue to execute against give us confidence in our ability to capitalize on the opportunity here with a delay from a competition standpoint. But what we've learned over the last two-plus years is, things happen in this world, whether it's US or Europe and so on. So barring any sort of major events, we do feel confident with our ability to capitalize on this and execute to meet the demand for the product. And we anticipate we'll continue to see demand beyond when a competitor comes into place as well, for the reasons we've already stated.
Operator: Okay. We'll take our next question from David Westenberg with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
David Westenberg: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. Most on supply chain have already been answered. So I'll start with Librela, I think you mentioned it's a blockbuster. It's only outside of the US. I think we typically think of animal health as being or companion animal as being kind of half in the US, half outside the US. Is there something specific about outside the US that's made it resonate so well, or should we still think of this as maybe a $200 million product if it was available in the US? And then a question for Wetteny, you mentioned a lot more, I think, on competition in livestock and I've heard commentary in the past. I mean, I think you said poultry vaccines and Draxxin. Draxxin, of course, has been the ongoing issue. Can you talk about -- is there a way to quantify how much more this quarter or what we're seeing now is competition versus just dynamics across livestock because, of course, dynamics across livestock have been a little bit on the weaker side. And I just want to see how much is transitory and how much of this might be permanent. Thank you for the questions.
Kristin Peck: Sure. So I'll take your first question, and I'll let Wetteny take the second question. As you think about Librela, we are proud that it is a blockbuster in its first full year in launch outside the US. I would note that it hasn't even been launched in every market outside the US. I wouldn't even say it's everywhere there. And if you just take a slight step back here, as you look at the pain category globally in dogs, traditionally, it's been about a $400 million market. We believe with this product, we can double the size of that market. And we've talked about this before, taking a $400 million market to an $800 million market. We believe we can do this, because we think this product's efficacy is really, really strong. And so, if you think about that, we think we can get more dogs to be cared for. It doesn't have some of the safety profile issues of other products. We're seeing that people are staying on it longer. It is already in Europe, the number one pain product, as you think about it. So we are -- we very strongly. If you look at this, 40% customers to Librela are new to the category. This really speaks to the power of this product, that's excitement with us. And we're seeing a 90% reorder rate. So I think you're going to see significant potential for this product, as you look at growing it outside to other markets as Wetteny mentioned earlier, beyond the ones that's already launched in international. And then certainly, when you add to the US. We've seen in some of these really advanced technology products, the US is often bigger than international on most of these products. So we remain very optimistic for the success of this product, just based on so far, it's -- we've talked about this on previous calls, it's done incredibly well and where we've even been upside surprise, is how many months many customers are staying on it. So, we'll continue to see how that evolves over time, but we're very optimistic about this product, not just in international, but as we bring it into the US and as we expand it across international. But Wetteny, do you want to take the second question on livestock?
Wetteny Joseph: Yes, sure. Look, the first thing I would say is, there is no structural change with respect to the competitive nature of livestock. It's always been competitive and it remains so. So our commentary here today and what we've been talking about over the last couple of years isn't necessarily different. What is, is that generic competition has had an impact on us over the last couple of years as we anticipated, as we said. So Jackson, if you look at Jackson prior to LOE, we are roughly in the mid-$300 million, let's call it, $350 million in revenue. That by far, the largest sort of individual product within livestock. And so, certainly, as we anticipated, about a 20% impact in the first year, another 20% in the second year. The first year was a little bit better than that. It was south of 20%, but the second year is above that. And so, still in the neighborhood, maybe a little bit worse than what we thought initially, with respect to Jackson, but there's no other large product like that. I would say, in the portfolio, though Zoamix also has seen some competition, but it was nowhere near the size of a Jackson. So short story is, no change in terms of what we're seeing in terms of the competitiveness of livestock, is just a little bit more intensification in terms of products that have become generic if they are sizable.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Steve Scala with Cowen. Please, go ahead.
Steve Scala: Many thanks. First, just to clarify, in the prepared remarks, it was stated that supply challenges were more pronounced in Q3 and that there is increased uncertainty. Can you clarify why supply challenges peaked in Q3 and why there is now more uncertainty as opposed to what was seen in Q2 or apparently what is anticipated in Q4? And then secondly, China lockdowns were mentioned. Can you quantify the impact? And then lastly, what is the capacity of Lincoln to manufacture the pain monoclonal antibodies? I thought at one point, some small-scale manufacturing was done there. Is that a possibility to be expanded? Thank you.
Wetteny Joseph: So I'll start and see if Kristin wants to add anything. With respect to the supply challenges, I think we've described in a fair amount of detail what we saw happen and why the impact was more noticeable in the third quarter, though we also made significant progress as we exited the quarter. So the impact that we're seeing in the third quarter, if we double-click on parasiticides, for example, particularly with Trio, I mean, from Q1, we have -- we've had outages on Trio across certain strengths, et cetera. And we continue to run with constraints throughout the year. But in particular, in Q2 and Q3, those outages really left more space across vet clinics for competitors to fill those shelves. And so, as we got into Q3, again, continuing to be in the parasiticide season, we saw switchovers with respect to new patients coming off of collars and topicals, for example, going into orals, rather than coming into our product going into some of our competitors, because our competitors filled shelves when we had gaps. So that's why we saw a bigger impact in that in terms of what we saw, particularly for Trio. Revolution’s been an issue, quite frankly, throughout the year and remains so, even as we've gotten into Q4 here, which is why we say we continue to see uncertainty in certain products here. Vaccines, I would say, a relatively commonplace across the industry in terms of having supply issues. And again, we've seen a little bit more of those this year. And again, particularly in Q3, given the cattle run in the US in the fall, et cetera. So we saw some of that -- the impact of those outages more pronounced in the quarter. So hopefully, that gives you plenty, if there's a follow-up, I'm sure you can take it up with Steve offline as well. But that's the detail that we've shared. With respect to capacity for MABS, these are long lead time areas, right? If you take the time to manufacture, it's long lead time, the time to add capacity in monoclonal antibodies is also relatively long. So we've been working on those for some time, which is why, as we've gone through this year, we -- and we express confidence into next year being able to not only capitalize on demand that we see across Europe, but we'll be able to launch in other products outside of Europe across our international segment with confidence, because we have been able to expand in various areas. I won't go into a specific site in terms of what their capacity is. But suffice it to say, our monoclonal antibodies manufacturing is more than just one location in terms of where we do that. And you've seen us take an uptick as well in terms of CapEx going from last year to this year, we've talked about that all year. And you continue to see an uptick in CapEx as we go into the next year or two as well, because we continue to make investments in capacity and monoclonal antibodies are an important platform for us, not only with respect to derm with Cytopoint with the pain franchise, but other products that we're working on in our pipeline, we require those. So we'll continue to make investments with respect to MAB on capacity.
Kristin Peck: A few follow-ups there. I mean, for starters, the comment on uncertainty had to do with the macroeconomic environment. The question is, we're still seeing very strong consumer demand, but there's still a belief that we'll have potentially a recession in Q1, Q2, Q3. It was not about increased uncertainty, to be clear, in supply. It was uncertainty as to the macroeconomic environment and what we'll be looking at into 2023 or even in Q4. So let me be clear, the uncertainty comment that was not related to supply. The only -- the comment I'll make is with regards to the China question. I mean, look, in Q3, China grew 35% even with these lockdowns, again, underlying what we've been saying, the demand for our products remains very strong. What's important there is, if you look like four or five years ago, it was a majority livestock business. It became about 50-50 last year between livestock and companion animal. And if you look at it right now, the lockdowns are clearly impacting livestock, but companion animal, and given its close to 50-50, grew almost double what you see as China's growth that. So even with the lockdowns, we really see China remaining a strong market for us and growing quite well. So I think we can weather those lockdowns. I mean, look, if we -- the lockdown staff, which does not appear based on the news in the last 24 hours, to be something that's going to be happening in the near term, you might see livestock recover a little faster than what it is. But again, even in this environment, even with lockdowns, you saw 35% growth in Q3 in China. So I would just underscore that.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Elliot Wilbur with Raymond James. Please, go ahead.
Michael Parolari: Hi, guys. This is actually Michael Parolari on for Elliot. Thanks for taking my questions. So first one from me, you guys might have touched on this earlier, so apologies if I missed that commentary, but any early commentary on how we should be thinking about currency impacts on top line and margin trends into 2023? And then second question is, growth contribution from price this quarter, I believe, you said, was 1% compared to 3% over the past two quarters. Most of the industry seems to be moving in the other direction, given the current macro environment. So just wondering, if you guys could touch on perhaps what negatively impacted that growth contribution in the period and how to be thinking about that moving forward? Thank you.
Wetteny Joseph: Yes, I'll start. And -- and see, what Kristin will add. First of all, with respect to currency, if you look at this year, top line impact from FX, given the strength of the US dollar is about 4%. So on the year, 4% which is roughly $39 million headwind versus prior year rates. If you look at the impact all the way down to the bottom line, it's about 8%. And so, from an EPS standpoint, that's about $0.36 of headwind. It's about $0.07 worse than our prior guidance, given the continued strength of the US dollar. So that's where we are. We're not going to forecast what FX might do. But our guidance is based on where rates were at the end of October here. And we'll continue to update, but we'll focus on commentary around operational growth given, given FX impact, but that's the impact that we're seeing this year. But if I didn't go into price here, on a year-to-date basis, if you look at our companion animal product sales and revenues, we've taken about 5% price on a year-to-date basis. And so, what is offsetting that largely is what we've been talking about here today, which is, the generic competition, particularly on Jackson, that's offsetting that growth where you see a net of 1% in the quarter. But on a year-to-date basis, our price is about 2%. If you include the impact of generic competition and higher than that without -- but companion animal is where we have innovative products, we continue to see strong demand, and we're taking price to the tune of about 5%. And if you look at our margins, roughly 90 basis points down year-over-year, FX is by far the biggest contributor to that. So if you take FX out, you've got about 20 basis points. So essentially, our price is offsetting increases in manufacturing costs, et cetera, being price and mix and so on is what we're seeing. So that's where the offset is. We're right about where you might see across elsewhere in the industry, our vet practices, given the strong demand we continue to see are actually taking price at or above what we're taking in that 5% on companion animal as well.
Operator: And we'll go next to Balaji Prasad with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: This is actually Makayla on for Balaji. Thanks for taking my question. Just on Trio, just wondering what the penetration has been for corporate accounts and just how much room is left for further expansion? Thank you.
Wetteny Joseph: Yes. So we've been very pleased with the penetration across large corporate accounts. We're about 90%, but we still see more room, even within those large corporate accounts to increase utilization of Trio. And we continue to work on those, and that's part of where our expanded field force in the US is focused in addition to, obviously, with the launches of other products, et cetera, and across derm to continue to penetrate and so on. So we've been very pleased with the overall penetration across large corporates. We continue to work on smaller and mid-sized accounts as well. And we see more room within those penetrated clinics to get better utilization on Trio. I don't know if you would add anything to that, Kristin.
Kristin Peck: No.
Operator: And there are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to Kristin Peck for any closing remarks.
Kristin Peck: Great. Look, thanks, everybody, for your questions today and for your continued interest in Zoetis. Just to summarize, we continue to see strength across our diverse global portfolio, especially in our products for pet care and the fundamental drivers of animal health, as I've said throughout this call, remained fundamentally and structurally very strong. We continue to invest in talent and innovation, certainly in manufacturing expansions, as we've talked to you today that can support this future growth, while adapting and optimizing our business for the increasingly dynamic macroeconomic environment that we all operate in. We look forward to keeping you updated on future calls. Thanks so much for joining us today.
Operator: Thank you. And this does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.

[Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.
Steve Frank: Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Zoetis second quarter 2022 earnings call. I am joined today by Kristin Peck, our Chief Executive Officer; and Wetteny Joseph, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements. And that actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statements in today's press release and our SEC filings, including, but not limited to, our annual report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q. Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and the company's 8-K filing dated today, Thursday, August 4, 2022. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. With that, I will turn the call over to Kristin.
Kristin Peck: Thank you, Steve, and welcome, everyone, to our second quarter earnings call for 2022. I'm pleased to say Zoetis delivered another strong quarter with 8% operational growth in revenue and 9% operational growth in adjusted net income, driven once again by the strength of our companion animal portfolio. We saw a balanced performance across our segments with similar operational revenue growth for both the U.S. and international, 9% and 8%, respectively. Our diversity and strength across parasiticides, dermatology products, vaccines and monoclonal antibodies for pain continue to demonstrate people's desire for innovative and effective care for their pets. We continue to see positive spending trends across the globe for pet care. And we grew 14% operationally in our companion animal portfolio. As anticipated, our livestock portfolio continued to face challenges, declining 1% operationally in the second quarter, largely due to generic competition primarily in U.S. cattle and declines in swine products in China due to lower pork prices and COVID-related supply constraints. Overall, our business remains strong, thanks to the durability of our global portfolio and a steady pipeline of new products. Even as we face uncertain macroeconomic conditions, continued supply constraints, generic competition and the war in Ukraine, we remain confident in the resilience of our business and colleagues. As we look to the rest of the year, we are updating and narrowing our guidance to reflect our positive outlook for the remainder of 2022 and the negative impact of recent changes to foreign exchange rates. Wetteny will walk you through the details in his remarks. As we look at the second half of the year, we remain confident in our long-term growth drivers and our ability to maintain a steady supply for customers despite inflationary pressures on the global economy and ongoing constraints for certain products. We all know pet owners love their dogs and cats and pet care remains a very positive and robust market, showing little impact from broader consumer concerns with inflation for the global economy. As we expected during the pandemic, that clinic visits are normalizing over time and spending continues to show strong growth based on the latest U.S. numbers. The positive dynamic between pets and pet owners, which I've spoken about before, is proving sustainable and recession-resistant due to people's affinity for their pets, a willingness to prioritize medical care for their pets and key demographic drivers such as the increased pet ownership by Gen Z and millennials and the greater percentage of high income households owning pets. Our innovative companion animal portfolio is well suited to address these customer needs. Our key dermatology products continue to demonstrate strong growth, 22% operationally for the first half, and we see opportunity to expand in underpenetrated markets especially internationally and introduce life cycle innovations like Apoquel chewable tablets. We have more to come in the pipeline for dermatology, and we do not foresee any competitors for Apoquel or Cytopoint this year or in the first half of 2023. In terms of parasiticides, the Simparica franchise, including Simparica Trio, is performing extremely well. having grown 47% operationally through the first half of the year and is gaining share in the industry's largest category. We currently anticipate a competing triple-combination parasiticide to be approved in the U.S. in the next 6 months with a possible launch next year. However, we believe Trio will continue to grow based on a strong label, proven efficacy and the support of DTC marketing in the U.S. and international markets. Our monoclonal antibodies for pain, Librela and Solensia, are performing very well in approved markets across Europe, and we remain very confident in the blockbuster potential of these breakthrough treatments. In terms of the U.S., we have begun early experience trials for Solensia and expect a broader market launch in the fourth quarter. And we still anticipate approval for Librela later this year, assuming FDA inspections are completed at facilities outside the United States. Meanwhile, our operational growth in international has remained steady throughout the first half of the year at 8% despite COVID lockdowns in China and revenue reductions in Russia and Ukraine due to the war. Excluding the impact of Russia and Ukraine in the first half, our international sales would have grown 9% operationally. This is the latest example of how our diverse portfolio and global footprint drive steady and sustainable growth for the business. While some markets may be experiencing setbacks in the quarter, other markets like the U.S., Australia, Southern Europe and other emerging markets are driving our performance. In the second half, we see China returning to stronger growth if COVID stays in check, and we continue to expect the diversity across geographies and species to remain strong. In terms of livestock, we expect continued pressure from generic competition, primarily in U.S. cattle and poultry products. However, we are generating growth across various livestock species in markets outside the U.S. and fish continues to perform exceptionally well. Finally, like many companies, we are managing through supply constraints this year with certain products. We continue working hard to optimize our supply chain this year so we can meet the increasing demand for certain key products. Looking ahead, we will continue to invest in the resources DTC marketing and manufacturing capacity we need to support of future growth and achieve results for our customer and shareholders. We’re advancing our driven-to-care sustainability goals that were established last year. And we published our 2021 progress update and ESG metrics in the second quarter, highlighting achievements toward our DE&I aspirations, expanded clinic goals and support for the veterinary profession. We are committed to staying on our journey to be the most sustainable animal health company in the world. We also continue to invest in R&D, business development and new capabilities across the business to enhance our portfolio and ensure our long-term growth. In the second quarter, we continued to receive approvals for new products like Poulvac, Procerta-HVT-IBD ND, expand key franchises like Apoquel into new markets and acquire new businesses to complement our portfolio such as Basepaws, a pet care genetics company. In closing, our business continues to perform extraordinarily well in one of the most dynamic markets I've ever seen. Diversity, innovation and customer focus are our cornerstones for excellence. I want to thank our colleagues for their tenacity, commitment and resilience as we continue to deliver for our customers and shareholders. Thank you. Now let me hand things off to Wetteny.
Wetteny Joseph: Thank you, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. As Kristin mentioned, we had a very strong quarter with growth across a number of our core franchises and the continued resilience of our end markets. Today, I will focus my comments on our second quarter financial performance, the key drivers contributing to our performance and provide an update on our full year 2022 guidance. In the second quarter, we generated revenue of $2.1 billion, growing 5% on a reported basis and 8% on an operational basis. Adjusted net income of $567 million was flat on a reported basis and grew 9% on an operational basis. Of the 8% operational revenue growth, 3% is from price and 5% from volume. Volume growth consisted of 6% from new products, which includes the Simparica Trio and Librela, 2% from key dermatology products, while other in-line products declined 3%. The decline in other inline products was expected and largely the result of the impact of intermittent supply challenges and generic competition for Jackson. Companion animal products continue to be the primary driver of growth, growing 14% operationally with livestock declining 1% on an operational basis in the quarter. Simparica Trio was the largest contributor to growth in the quarter. Trio posted global revenue of $237 million, representing operational growth of 72% versus the comparable 2021 period. We also continue to experience better-than-expected results from our Trio franchise outside the U.S. where we had sales of almost $30 million. We expect to continue to grow the addressable market for flea, tick and heartworm globally and see significant headroom for growth with brands like Simparica and Trio. Meanwhile, our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint, had significant global growth again with $315 million of revenue, representing 16% operational growth against a robust prior year in which these products were 22% operationally in the second quarter of 2021. In Europe, our monoclonal antibodies, fostered pain in dogs and cats also meaningfully contributed to growth posting $31 million in sales. Our global companion animal diagnostics portfolio recorded $83 million in revenue in Q2, declining 9% operationally. Growth in our international diagnostics portfolio was more than offset by a decline in our U.S. business in the quarter. In the U.S., we experienced a decrease in sales resulting from our new grocery market model and the build-out of a sizable and new dedicated field force for diagnostics. While disruptive in the short term, this investment is putting the necessary fundamental elements in place to position and grow our diagnostics portfolio over the long run. We expect the effectiveness of our new diagnostic sales force to improve gradually for the remainder of the year. Diagnostics remains core to our business and a key long-term growth driver for Zoetis. Sales of livestock products declined 1% operationally in the quarter, negatively impacting growth across the portfolio were global generic competition for Jackson and the War in Ukraine. China swine products again declined due to lower pork prices and COVID-related lock downs. Our U.S. poultry portfolio also continues to be challenged by generics and cheaper alternatives to Zoetis. Meanwhile, our fish portfolio again grew double digits in the quarter. And along with the strength of our sheep products in Australia, partially offset the broader decline. Overall, livestock performance in the quarter continues to be in line with our expectations.  Now moving on to revenue growth by segment for the quarter. U.S. revenue was $1.1 billion in the quarter, growing 9% with companion animal products growing 13% and livestock sales declining 7%. Focusing first on companion animal. U.S. set practice revenue trends continue to be positive with practice revenue growing approximately 5%. Spending per visit remained strong again this quarter, increasing over 7%. Visit declined more than 2%, primarily due to challenging prior year comparisons. In terms of best visit traffic, it is worth noting that business in the second quarter were above the number of visits pre-COVID in the second quarter of 2019 and the trend line for growth in visits over the last several years continues to slow favorably. I would also like to point out that our companion animal portfolio in the U.S. had volume growth of 8% in the quarter. Our injectable portfolio of products that must be administered in the vet clinic also saw volume growth in the quarter. These products include Cytopoint, vaccines and Poulvac. Underlying demand for veterinary care remains robust throughout the country even as people return to work. While labor challenges do exist as they do across most industries, we believe vet clinic revenue will continue to grow at levels above what we were seeing prior to COVID as the standard of veterinary care continues to increase through innovation, better demographics, higher compliance and more pets. Companion animal growth of 13% in the U.S. was driven largely by sales from Simparica Trio as well as key dermatology products.  Growth of Simparica Trio was again strong in the quarter with sales of $208 million in the U.S., growing 74%. We are pleased to see that a significant number of Trio customers are new to the flea, tick and heartworm category altogether. In addition, we continue to meet our clinic penetration targets and take share within individual clinics. These dynamics will provide additional runway for future expansion of both the broader market and revenue growth for Trio. Key dermatology product sales were $219 million for the quarter, growing 11% with Apoquel and Cytopoint is significantly contributing to growth. Year-to-date, our derm portfolio grew 16%. Our investments to support our derm portfolio have been instrumental in driving more patients into the clinics and we will continue to invest meaningfully in this space as a large portion of dogs with dermatitis remain undertreated, representing an opportunity to further expand the market. U.S. livestock declined 7% in the quarter, driven primarily by sales of cattle products as a result of generic competition for Jackson. Meanwhile, our poultry portfolio continues to be negatively impacted by the expanded use of lower cost alternatives and generic competition for Zoamix. Swine products sales grew in the quarter as a result of increased disease prevalence and favorable market conditions for producers. Moving on to our International segment, where revenue grew 2% on a reported basis and 8% operationally in the quarter. Companion animal revenue grew 16% operationally and loss lag revenue grew 2% operationally. Increased sales of companion animal products resulted from growth of monoclonal antibodies for alleviation of osteoarthritis pain, our key dermatology products and the Simparica franchise. These core brands continue to benefit from our international direct-to-consumer promotional campaigns and we remain excited with the long-term prospects of these programs. We continue to be pleased with the performance of our monoclonal antibodies for OA pain with Librela generating $26 million in Solensia delivering $5 million in second quarter sales. Librela remains on track to exceed $100 million in revenue this year. As we have mentioned in prior quarters, Librela is the number one pain product in the EU with the underlying performance metrics being very favorable for future growth. Reordering rates remain high. Compliance continues to exceed our initial expectations, and we continue to see significant opportunity to expand the pain market with a meaningful percentage of dogs on Librela being new to the market. It is also worth noting that we are observing similar pet owner and vet clinic trends in many of our key international markets that we are seeing in the U.S. The higher standard of care and better demographics as well as a more rapid adoption of innovation continues to expand markets for our products and we expect these trends to continue. Volume growth in our international and companion animal portfolio was 10% in the second quarter, and we also saw growth across our injectable products, including monoclonal antibodies, vaccines and Cytopoint. Meanwhile, international livestock grew 2% operationally in the quarter with solid growth across fish, cattle and sheep. Our fish portfolio experienced increased demand for vaccines in key standard markets, including Chile and Norway. Cattle grew through favorable market conditions and price in key emerging markets, including Australia, Turkey, China and the U.K. Sales of sheep products grew as a result of favorable market conditions and new product launches in Australia. Growth was partially offset by continued weakness with the price of pork and COVID-related supply challenges in China as well as unfavorable producer rotational programs with MFAs in Europe and reduced stock sizes in Latin America impacting poultry. Now moving on to the rest of the P&L for the quarter. Adjusted gross margins of 69.8% decreased 120 basis points on a comparable basis to the prior year, resulting primarily from unfavorable foreign exchange impacts as well as higher manufacturing, freight and other costs partially offset by favorable price and mix. Adjusted operating expense increased 10% operationally with SG&A growth of 8% operationally, driven by promotional and marketing expenses related to key brands and new product launches as well as T&E cost beginning to return to pre-COVID levels. R&D expenses increased 16% operationally due to higher compensation costs, increased spending on projects and higher operating costs. The adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 20.7%, an increase of 70 basis points, driven by changes in jurisdictional mix of earnings and lower discrete tax benefits related to share-based payments. And finally, adjusted net income grew 9% operationally and adjusted diluted EPS grew 10% operationally for the quarter. Capital expenditures in the second quarter were $146 million. We are still anticipating a significant increase in capital expenditures for the back half of 2022, primarily related to investments in Ireland, the U.S. and China to support manufacturing capacity needed to meet our long-term growth demands. In the quarter, we returned over $600 million to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. We repurchased only $450 million of Zoetis shares, representing our largest share repurchase ever. Now moving on to our updated guidance for the full year 2022. For operational revenue growth, we are maintaining the midpoint and narrowing the range of growth to 9.5% to 10.5%, previously 9% to 11%. We are increasing our operational growth expectations for adjusted net income to a range of 11% to 13%, previously 10% to 13%. This change in guidance signals increased confidence in the back half of the year due to the continuing outperformance of companion animal, easing of certain supply constraints and an improvement in our business in China. Please note that our guidance for adjusted interest expense and/or ID was changed to reflect favorable changes to interest income. Foreign exchange rates on our updated guidance as of late July and reflect the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Beginning with revenue for the full year 2022 due to the narrowing of our range and the impact of foreign exchange, we are now projecting revenue of between $8.225 billion and $8.325 billion. We now expect adjusted net income to be in the range of $2.35 billion to $2.39 billion. And finally, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.97 to $5.05 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.65 to $4.75. While guidance possess our outlook for the full year due to the unique factors impacting our business in 2022, I would like to note that our guidance for growth, especially for revenue and adjusted net income will be rated towards the end of the year. While we expect operating expenses to be incurred at a similar rate across that half of the year, we are noting an easier OpEx pop in Q4 than Q3 due to heavy spending in the fourth quarter of last year. Also, in Q3 of last year, we experienced an unusually low adjusted effective tax rate of 16.7% due to favorability related to foreign-derived intangible income and certain discrete items. We do not expect similar favorability this year. Our full year 2022 guidance once again reflects our value proposition of growing revenue in line with or faster in the market. and growing adjusted net income faster than revenue over the long term. Our success will continue to come from our diversified portfolio of enduring brands driven by multiple sources of in-line growth, productive innovation, and an infrastructure to develop and expand markets globally. We expect to continue to execute across multiple dimensions of our business and capitalize on favorable end market dynamics for the foreseeable future. Now I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Michael Riskin Of Bank of America.
Michael Ryskin: I'm going to try to squeeze in two real quick. First, on the -- your comments on the Trio competition, Kristin, certainly something that's been talked about and anticipated for a while. But I'm curious if you have any updated thoughts on how you'll respond? Is there going to be a change to how you price Simparica Trio or any additional promotional or do you see plants you can try to implement in the next 6 months. And I'm wondering if it's too early to give us maybe a ballpark dollar target for next year. Is it great to think that you could hit $1 billion in Trio sales in 2023. And then a quick follow-up, if I can. On margins for the year, when I'm hoping you could -- can you walk us impact to margins, both on gross margin and OpEx. Just wondering how that factors into the updated outlook.
Kristin Peck: Sure. I'll take the first one, Mike. Thanks for the question. For starters, we were really pleased with performance of Simparica Trio and Simparica franchise in the quarter with 72% growth. And we do expect even with competition to grow the franchise here -- what we're really seeing in the market is a strong shift from topicals and collars to worlds. There's a new standard of care. So we see the category certainly growing. We still believe we've got some number of advantages from being first to market. We've gotten a lot of customers enrolled in auto shift, which is really helping continue to drive growth there. We've got strong relationships with the large corporate. But importantly, on that issue, we still believe we've got significant room to expand in our penetrated clinics as we look at where our penetration within those clinics is. The other thing is, we really don't believe you're going to see tons of switching without significant differentiation, which honestly we're not really expecting. This remains a significant market. And right now, the Simparica franchise is number two in the U.S. and flea tick heartworm. So we are expecting approval of a potential competitor sometime in the back half of this year and then obviously launching likely sometime next year. But we continue to believe that we can grow the franchise. We're going to invest highly in that through direct-to-consumer through our field force. And we believe, given all the issues and opportunities we have, we can continue to grow this franchise.
Wetteny Joseph: And Mike, your question on margins and OpEx. If you look at our gross margins on a year-to-date basis, if you take out the impact of FX, we're running about 20 basis points above last year. So in the quarter, you saw gross margins down about 120 basis points, but it's all FX driven. We've effectively maintained OpEx growth range in our guidance, and we're able to raise the bottom line guidance to 11% to 13% versus 10% to 13% that we started the year with. So again, FX is having an impact here but we are executing into our plan, and we'll see an improvement even on the bottom line growth rate.
Operator: Our next question comes from Erin Wright of Morgan Stanley.
Erin Wright: Could we get an update on Librela, both the U.S. approval and the supply chain constraints for that product in international markets. At this point, do you think you have visibility if supply chain constraints will have any sort of impact on the U.S. launch in terms of timing? And after you do get approval in the U.S., will you be ready to broadly launch that product immediately. And then just in terms of the guidance, how should we be thinking about what's embedded in the guidance for companion animal and livestock growth for the balance of the year? Are there any sort of dynamics from a quarter-to-quarter basis that we should be thinking about?
Kristin Peck: I'll take the first one, Wetteny can take that second question. We are really pleased so far in the Librela success outside of the U.S., and we'll talk a little bit what I think the implication therefore are within the U.S. Right now, Librela is the number one awaiting product in dogs in the EU already, which we think is outstanding if you look at its success, it's really been embraced and we see very strong reorder rates right now. Really impressively, 40% of dogs are new to the category, and we're seeing a 90% reorder rate. So we're really pleased. This is a product, as you've noted, that does share some components with human COVID vaccines. And we've been managing that very carefully, making sure as we launch that we have adequate supply since this is a chronic medication. Really have been thoughtful about that. We do believe we've got additional capacity coming on in some of our suppliers as we look into the second half of this year and into next year. So as we look at the rest of this year, we -- as we said, we believe this product will be a blockbuster this year, over $100 million. And we're very optimistic, assuming we get the approvals we're expecting an infection this year to be able to move exactly as we did it Solensia next year with an early experience in the first half followed by a full launch. So remain very excited investing heavily behind this and believe we're working really hard in the supply chain unless something changes dramatically, we are confident we will have the supply we need for a successful launch in the U.S. next year.
Wetteny Joseph: Yes, Erin, with respect to our guidance and how you should be thinking about companion animal versus livestock. And so far year-to-date, we've delivered 9% operational growth at the top line, losses driven by companion animal. I think you can expect that to continue in the back half of the year when you consider, as Kristin just mentioned, Solensia will be fully launched in the second half in the U.S. here, we'll continue to see growth in Trio and with Librela, which we expect to be a blockbuster in the EU this year, we delivered $21 million in the first quarter, $26 million in the second quarter. So that will continue to ramp. So I think those will contribute towards comparing that will continue to drive. When I think about livestock, we do see easier comps in the back half than we would have had in the first half to recall swine in China, for example, prices start to really decline in the second half of last year. So that becomes a comp when you think about Q3 and Q4. And then for cattle, we did have some price adjustments in the fourth quarter last year on Jackson leading into the start of the year. So those make for a slightly easier comp from a cattle perspective in the fourth quarter. So those are sort of the considerations, but I would expect the second half to look more like the first half in terms of the contribution from companion animal compared to livestock.
Operator: Our next question is from Jon Block of Stifel.
Jon Block: I'll try to ask two logos upfront. Key derm, I think it was up 22% operationally in 1H, but I think it slowed from 27% in 1Q to 16% in 2Q, and I got a sort of a similar year ago comp. So can you talk to, Kristin, your thoughts on the topic derm growth call it, just the trajectory going forward? Does the chewable version offer a price premium for you guys? And I think, Kristin, you also talked about just no competition for maybe in the next 10 months, just how you have that line of sight. And then shifting to your second question to livestock. That market just always seems to be evolving. Would love to get your thoughts on normalized growth returning to the industry in 2023, Kris, I think you called it out last quarter. Does that stay intact? And would your growth be representative of market since I think you're going to get soon on the back end of some of the generic headwinds that you've been facing.
Kristin Peck: I'll take the first question, let me take the second one on livestock. We are very pleased with continued growth of derm. To your point, in the first 6 months of the year, it grew 22% and in the quarter, it was 16%. There always has been some cyclicality, but we really believe we can continue to grow this franchise. We can expand it -- we have been through both branded and unbranded DTC. As you know, we just began this year really an investment in unbranded DTC in Europe, where we're now seeing significant pickup there. We continue to see people home with Passmore and importantly, they are still in the U.S. alone, 6 million dogs who are still issuing who do not get -- have not received the product. So we think we can continue to grow this. To your question on competition and life cycle innovation, we are investing heavily behind life cycle innovation. This is our category, as you saw last year, the franchise is already worth $1 billion. So we will work heavily to defend this, both with chewable and with other products in the pipeline. Chewable is a real advantage for a lot of people who have trouble giving tools to their dogs and getting them to take it. I would say there may be a slight price depending it's very market specific as you look at the pricing there. But to us, it's really building the loyalty to our franchise overall. We don't have on the competition. As you know, it's not a perfect science in our industry. But as you saw, we did on the Simparica Trio sense that we do see competition. Mostly that is through working with chatter in the marketplace as well as with distributors and our large corporates, who start negotiating differently with us when they believe there's going to be competition in a space. So we are not seeing that in the same way that we are just starting to see that now on competition for our Simparica Trio franchise. So we continue to believe we can grow this franchise with new innovation, with the strength of our commercial infrastructure with our investment in DTC. So I'll let Wetteny take the second question on livestock.
Wetteny Joseph: Yes. When you look at livestock, historically, we've seen livestock grow around the 4% range. Certainly, you're very familiar with what's happened in the last few years in terms of ASF and for us, with generic competition with Jackson and Zoamix, the year is essentially executing as we expected on livestock. We continue to believe that we can see livestock returning to normalized growth in the 2023-2024 time frame. And long term, when you look at livestock, we continue to see growth in this business long term, given population growth. We see urbanization as well as growing middle class, particularly as you look across emerging markets. And even this year, if you look at this quarter, for example, livestock grew 2% internationally, despite the headwinds in swine as I said, those comps get easier in the back half. And if you Russia-Ukraine, for example, another point there. So we're seeing growth in emerging markets on livestock. We expect those to continue in long term with innovation as well as we continue our swine vaccines that we are launching vector vaccines on the poultry side, immunotherapies [Indiscernible], et cetera, we would expect to continue to drive growth in livestock long term.
Operator: Our next question comes from Christine Rains of William Blair.
Christine Rains: Just piggybacking off of that last point, can you further review those pipeline highlights in the work for our livestock portfolio. And just related on the comparatively well international growth in livestock this quarter. Can you discuss the factors there that drive the different performance between international and domestic here?
Wetteny Joseph: Yes. Sure, I'd be happy to do that. Look, I think as we entered the year, we expected given the second year of generic competition for Jackson, our largest product in cattle and to some extent, in swine as well. We expected that to drag our livestock performance in the U.S. And again, that's essentially executing as we thought. What that is masking somewhat is the innovation that we are launching in swine for example, with vaccines in swine or vector vaccines that we have been launching will continue to drive in livestock as well. But we are seeing growth in emerging markets. You saw 2% growth in the quarter. But again, that was offset partially with Russia-Ukraine impact here given the conflict there, as well as swine, as you know, from the second half of last year, we've seen a decrease in price that has impacted the performance there, although we have seen a lift in price on swine over the last number of weeks or months in China, we expect to continue as we execute through the second half of the year.
Kristin Peck: Yes, I'll take a little bit more on your question on the pipeline and livestock. To build on what Wetteny saying, we do continue to believe that we're -- that there's significant growth opportunities in vaccines and livestock, that's what our customers are looking for. As Wetteny referenced, we've been launching some vaccines in swine. Certainly, vector vaccines, we just announced approval of the second vector vaccine. In poultry, we'll be launching more vector vaccines, not poultry franchise as well. Really excited, as I mentioned earlier, about fish with 23% growth in the quarter. Apoquel really focusing on [Indiscernible] and other potential vaccines there. And then if you look at that more broadly as we look out a little farther investment immunotherapies as well as in precision livestock farming, continuing to add to our block yard product there to our genetics business there. So we do see a number of key platforms in livestock to drive innovation in the space. As Wetteny said, I think you can get back to the historical growth rates of around 4% as we hopefully lap some of these generic issues around Jackson and Zoamix and poultry and the ASF issue in China. But I think to get above that, which we certainly aspire to do, it's going to take bringing innovation, and we are certainly investing to be the leader in innovation in livestock.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nathan Rich of Goldman Sachs.
Nathan Rich: Kristin, you talked about the capacity and labor constraints that clinics are facing. But I think you noted vaccines and injectable products continue to grow. I guess could you maybe talk to your ability to continue to grow those products the current market backdrop. And I guess, ultimately, the bigger picture question is, if we see these market dynamics, both from a macro standpoint as well as some of the pressures that vet clinics are facing continue into next year. I guess -- how should we think about growth? I guess, should we expect a similar level of companion animal growth as to what you're guiding to in the back half?
Kristin Peck: Sure. I think what's important to keep in mind is that vet clinics are doing quite well. If you look at growth in vet clinic revenue since 2019, it's up 20%. There's definitely with a 5% increase in the number of pets in the U.S. There are capacity constraints to meeting all the needs. But I think what's important to remember also is we are not leveraged as high as some other businesses to in-clinic visits. A lot of our key products are chronic. So if you look at our derm portfolio, our tariff portfolio, et cetera, we're still seeing tremendous growth. We had a 10% volume increase in the quarter in U.S. products. So I think it's important to think there's more movement to online and other spaces. So we don't see some of these capacity issues as a major issue for us in continuing to grow our business. You're seeing some of the same capacity strength in Europe, and yet you're already seeing us have Librela looking to be a blockbuster product this year. And I think what really differentiates us is innovation. When there's important science and new products that they're excited about, we're still seeing great attention at the vet clinic for that and really driving that through. Although a lot of people are very focused on vet visits given we're not as leveraged to that. We really think the spend per visit is really important. And I think we're leading in that category given innovation.
Operator: Our next question comes from Louise Chen of Cantor Fitzgerald.
Louise Chen: I'd like to ask you, are there any metrics that you can point due to support price and demand elasticity in the pet health space? And then, do you think about this the same way in livestock?
Wetteny Joseph: Well, I think certainly, when we look at price and demand, we've continued to see opportunistic price at or above inflation, and we've demonstrated that over the years, particularly in certain markets. We've also looked at data in terms of pet ownership and demographically, we see the structural improvement, I would say, even compared to a very strong basis to begin with. So if you look at pet ownership with respect to Gen Z and millennials, and they're prioritizing pet health that certainly bodes well. But also, we're seeing more adoption at higher income households if you look at what adoption numbers look like over the last number of years, which again is structurally very positive for the industry. So as we've taken price over the years and we took about 5% price on -- in companion animal this year. Overall for the company, we've been running about 3% net given some of the last slight dynamics of the Jackson generic competition. But we haven't been able to take price. And yet we still continue to see strong volume growth across the business. And to Kristin's point, that's largely driven as well by innovation in the space. So we continue to see elasticity in terms of ability to take price see from an inflationary perspective.
Operator: Our next question comes from Elliot Wilbur of Raymond James.
Elliot Wilbur: Just a follow-up question for Kristin around parasiticide trends in the quarter. Can you maybe just talk about category growth overall? It seemed like some of the metrics out there suggested that overall category growth had actually been down. And obviously, Trio continues to perform extraordinarily well, particularly in the U.S. But I'm just thinking about the second half of the year and then early next year with a potential entrant, what you're seeing in terms of category growth? And if you could just give us the number in terms of where Simparica is with respect to overall share in the category. And if I could just get a quick follow-up in here on Librela. Obviously, the initial EU experience has been quite positive here. I think you mentioned that 40% of pets were new to therapy. Just wanted to get maybe an update in terms of what you're seeing with respect to persistence some of the pets that started therapy initially and sort of where we what kind of persistence rates you're seeing sort of 6 to 7 months after beginning therapy? And is that 40%, is that sort of a normal number in terms of new pets coming into the market or should the takeaway there be that Librela sort of test really kind of elevated the overall category growth?
Kristin Peck: I'll start with your Librela and see if maybe Wetteny can add anything on the tariff point. Really good questions there on Librela. If you look at the 40% new to the category, we do think that's extraordinary. This is an established category. This isn't like derm when we started where it wasn't really a category. There have been many products across the globe for dogs, for pain management. But I think it really underscores the challenges with the existing therapies. There's -- the trade-offs and safety and efficacy have been significant. Most of those therapies, you can't stay on for very long. And I think -- so for a lot of people that really didn't want to deal with some of those side effects that they had stayed out of the category. I think was something with the label that we have with a monoclonal antibody, we are clearly bringing new people to the sector, and we're growing that sector significantly. I think we talked about before, the global market for pain for dogs was around $400 million. We believe with the addition of Librela that we can double the size of that market over time and move that to 800, and we think we can do that from a few ways and one of them you referenced. One is people staying on therapy longer. Certainly, with a safe and efficacious product, we believe we can increase days on therapy. I think we can also be demonstrated with 40% increase the number of pets getting it. And third, we think we can grow the market certainly based on price. This is a premium product with significant innovation. So we are really pleased with the 40% growth. It is certainly higher than even we were expecting with the new patients to the category. We are seeing significant -- probably higher than we were expected initially, compliant to the sense of months on therapy. So we remain extremely optimistic about EU and the persistence of this growth. And I'll let Wetteny take your follow-up question on Simparica.
Wetteny Joseph: Yes. When we look at the category, we speaking, clearly, Trio grew 72% in the quarter. If you look at our overall Simparica franchise, grew 47%, right? So if you get Simparica, not Trio, but Simparica internationally, it grew 23% in the quarter. So we have the broadest offering into the parasiticides in the industry. And clearly, the only triple combination in the U.S. What we are seeing is, categorically, we're seeing a shift from topicals and collars to all medications. And if you look at triple combination in the U.S. One of the interesting statistics that we've seen is that on Trio, about 30% of the dogs that are coming on Trio are new to the category and not having been prescribed a prescription of parasiticide in the prior 18 months or so. So we do see significant room to continue to expand in this space. And as competitors come into the space, there'll be more DTC that will drive even more patients for the clinic, which is beneficial for us as well given our relationships across corporate accounts and so on will benefit from having more voices out driving more patients into the clinic. So we're not seeing a slowdown in the category. There is a bit of a shift from the topicals and collars into rolls and that benefits us given our premium products.
Operator: Our next question comes from Balaji Prasad of Barclays.
Balaji Prasad: Firstly, as we start to lap the impact of generics on Draxxin and Zoamix, would you still count a threat of generalization as a top two or top three challenge over the next two years? And if you could also add some broader comments around the percentage of your portfolio exposed to general completion of this period. Also on diagnostics, operational decline of 9%, it seems to be the first quarter of decline after Q2 2020 and in contrast to your per visits results. So wondering what kind of increased spend per visit did you notice that you've been calling out over the past few months? And any metrics that you can direct to between point of sale or reference labs that helps us understand this performance?
Kristin Peck: Sure. I'll start with your diagnostics and then I will let Wetteny do the Draxxin livestock question. As you look at -- we're about flat in the first half of the year in diagnostics. And as Wetteny mentioned in his remarks, as you saw the decline, really, there was growth in international. We made a huge investment in creating a stand-alone diagnostics field force and technical team and service team in the U.S. is highly disruptive. As you know, if you watch other companies do this over time. So -- but we do believe in the absolute strength of this business long term, investing in it long term, as you've seen, we've invested in innovation and our images platform, et cetera. to grow this business. So obviously, as that people get into new territories, et cetera, there's obviously some disruption that happens there. This honestly was anticipated. We remain extremely optimistic in the growth of this business and the strength of it. We certainly look at the strength of our international business and how well that's been doing and growing that with customers. We invested in diagnostics for the long term. and really believe we can drive strong growth here. And diagnostics as a sector is -- grows faster than the overall animal health space. And we believe we can bring disruptive innovation to the space to help us drive that. But I'll let Wetteny take the follow-up question on livestock and Draxxin.
Wetteny Joseph: Yes, sure. If you look at Draxxin, right, the largest product that we have across our livestock portfolio. Beyond that, there isn't any other product that's even nearly that size and magnitude if you look across our portfolio as well in companion animals, there or products that are anywhere near any sort of LOE. So we would not anticipate after the first two years, that the generic competition element will be the key driver here in the business. As we said, we expect lifestyle to be returning back to sort of normalized growth in the '23-'24 time frame is what we would expect in that regard to a generic standpoint.
Operator: Our next question is from Chris Schott of JPMorgan.
Ekaterina Knyazkova: This is Ekaterina on from Chris from JPMorgan. And my question is on the macroeconomic environment here, are you seeing any notable differences when it comes to panel demand across geographies -- so Europe appears to be getting hit harder by some of the challenges related to fuel costs to food prices and stuff like that. And I was wondering if you're starting to see any changes in behavior in that market.
Kristin Peck: Sure. Thanks, Ekaterina. Good to have you on the call today. As you look at the sort of macroeconomics, we continue to see, on a global basis, very strong demand. And I think what's driving that for us is the innovation that we bring to the market, as well as who's adopting some of these dogs, millennial Gen Z who are more willing to spend more on their pets as well as more of the pets being adopted by high-income families. That being said, Ekaterina, as you double-click into individual markets, you are seeing as economies get affected, obviously, overall demand may go down, but not -- we have so far not seen to do our products we are monitoring it carefully. I think the one place where we're starting to see a little more of that might be Latin America, just given some of the real hyperinflationary markets that you're starting to see there. But what we've really been pleased about in companion animal is the continued strength in willingness to spend and investing in innovative disruptive technology. So there are certainly differences as you get into individual markets across the globe overall continued strong demand. And I would double-click for you since you asked the global question in a few places. One in Brazil, where we only printed about 1% growth in Q2 overall. Companion animals still grew 35% in the quarter, and you look at China, where we only had 3% growth companion animal grew 24%. So even in what many people might consider emerging markets, we are still seeing incredibly strong demand for our products and for our innovation.
Operator: And this does conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I'd be happy to return the call to our host for any concluding remarks.
Kristin Peck: Great. Look, thank you, everyone, for your questions and for your continued interest in Zoetis. Just to summarize, we see continued strength across our diverse global portfolio, especially in our companion animal and pet care products. We are continuing to invest in talent and innovation and manufacturing expansions that can support our future growth. And we are updating and narrowing our full year guidance to reflect a positive outlook for the remainder of 2022 and obviously, as many other companies, the negative impact of recent changes to foreign exchange rates. So I look forward to keeping you updated on future calls. Thanks so much. Have a great day.
Operator: This does conclude the Zoetis Q2 2022 earnings conference. You may now disconnect your lines, and everyone, have a great day.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-05-05 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the First Quarter 2022 Financial Results Conference Call and Webcast for Zoetis. Hosting the call today is Steve Frank, Vice President of Investor Relations for Zoetis. The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, and will not be forwarded automatically. In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately 2 hours after the conclusion of this call via dial-in or on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.
Steve Frank: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Zoetis first quarter 2022 earnings call. I am joined today by Kristin Peck, our Chief Executive Officer; and Wetteny Joseph, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements. and that actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statements in today's press release and our SEC filings including but not limited to our annual reports on Form 10-K and our reports on form 10-Q. Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and the company's 8-K filing dated today, Thursday, May 5, 2022. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. With that, I will turn the call over to Kristin.
Kristin Peck: Thank you, Steve, and welcome, everyone, to our first quarter earnings call for 2022. Zoetis delivered a strong quarter to start the year with 9% operational revenue growth and 8% operational growth in adjusted net income driven by the strength of our companion animal portfolio. We generated similar growth for both the U.S. and international segments, with 9% and 8% operational growth, respectively. Our strength across parasiticides, dermatology products, monoclonal antibodies and diagnostics are all capitalizing on the marriage of positive trends in pet care with customer-driven science coming from Zoetis. In the first quarter, we grew 20% operationally in our companion animal portfolio. As we expected, our livestock portfolio continued to face challenges, declining 6% operationally in the quarter largely due to declines in swine product sales in China and generic competition from DRAXXIN. As we look at the rest of the year, we are updating our guidance to reflect the negative impact of recent changes in foreign exchange rates, but this has no impact on our previous operational growth rates and assumptions for the year, even as we face uncertainties related to the war in Ukraine, COVID-19 lockdowns, inflation and ongoing supply chain constraints, we remain confident in the underlying strength and performance of our business. Our diverse portfolio, global scale, talented colleagues and continuous innovations remain the foundation of our long-term success and durability, and we continue to invest in the resources, marketing programs and manufacturing capacity we need to support our growth. In R&D, we're building new capabilities and pipeline across our companion animal and livestock portfolios to ensure our long-term performance. In the first quarter, we continued to receive approvals for new products and indications, develop life cycle innovations for major brands and expand our portfolio into new markets. On the livestock side of the business, we expanded our cattle vaccine portfolio with an approval in the U.S. of Protiviti, the first modified live vaccine to offer protection against mycoplasma Bovis. This vaccine provides cattle producers and veterinarians with broader overall protection against bovine respiratory disease. We also gained approval in Brazil for Draxxin KP, which is also a treatment for BRD and combines the antimicrobial properties of DRAXXIN with the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ketoprofen to rapidly reduce fever in a single dose. Draxxin KP is also approved in the U.S., Canada and European Union, Australia and Mexico, and it has been an important part of how we continue to distinguish the DRAXXIN brand in the face of generic competition. In poultry, we received approval in Brazil for Poulvac® Procerta™ HVT-IBD, our recombinant vector vaccine that is also approved in the U.S. and Canada. On the companion animal side of the business, we received another approval for Solensia, the industry's first monoclonal antibody for osteoarthritis pain in cats, adding Australia to the U.S., European Union, U.K., Canada and Switzerland and another mAb therapy, Cytopoint, received a claim extension in Canada so it now covers both the treatment of atopic dermatitis and allergic dermatitis in dogs. Cytopoint and Apoquel continue to grow significantly and expand the dermatology market as disease awareness and treatment options become more known to pet owners. We have a strong leadership position based on our innovative science and do not believe competing products will come to market in 2022. We also continue building our multipurpose diagnostics platform, Vetscan images with the recent addition of blood smear testing. Introduced in September 2020, Vetscan images is a first-of-its-kind technology with a multitude of applications, including AI fecal analysis, digital cytology image transfer and now AI Blood smear, all helping veterinarians broaden their in-clinic diagnostic offerings to provide the best care possible for dogs and cats. For the last two years, I've been speaking to you about our catalyst for growth, and those continue to drive our performance. Our outlook for growth in international markets remains very positive based on a diverse global footprint and continued expansion opportunities for key brands like Simparica Trio, Apoquel, Cytopoint, Librela and Solensia. In terms of Ukraine, we have condemned the Russian invasion from the outside, and we are deeply saddened by the senseless violence being brought upon the people of Ukraine. Our company, colleagues and the Zoetis Foundation have worked together to provide veterinary care, medicines, financial support and evacuation assistance to those in need. With every decision, even the most difficult and complex ones, we're guided by our purpose to nurture the world and human kind by advancing care for animals. While we have suspended all investments and promotional activities in Russia, the continued care of pets and livestock remains an essential responsibility for Zoetis and our colleagues, and we remain focused on maintaining a critical supply of animal medicines and vaccines for veterinarians and producers there. We anticipate a negative impact of about 1% to our original full year growth expectations due to Ukraine and Russia, but we are maintaining our previous operational growth rates based on the overall strength of our companion animal business and the positive momentum of expanding our U.S. pet care and diagnostic commercial teams. Speaking of Diagnostics, another catalyst for growth, we delivered 12% operational growth in the first quarter. We continue to invest significantly in this space to accelerate our growth. For example, we've been shifting our go-to-market model this year and building a dedicated field force for our diagnostics portfolio. This hiring is a significant part of a 40% increase to our total U.S. companion animal field force. We see field force expansion as a key lever to supporting growth opportunities in our diagnostics and pet care businesses. We also continue to see very strong growth in pet care as we expand our major companion animal brands in markets around the world. Simperica Trio is doing very well as it continues to gain market share based on veterinarians preference for an innovative triple combination parasiticide for dogs. Pet owners have also been demonstrating strong loyalty rates after trying Trio, and we are excited by the ability of our direct-to-consumer campaigns and additional field force colleagues to increase interest in this product. Librela is also doing incredibly well across Europe, and we remain confident in the blockbuster potential for Librela in 2022 and Solensia in the longer term. As we see improvements in supply, we will be launching Solensia in additional markets such as Canada and Australia this year. In terms of the U.S., we are still planning a launch of Solensia in the second half of the year, and we anticipate approval for Librela by the end of the year, assuming FDA inspections are completed at facilities outside of the U.S. Overall, we continue to benefit from pet care trends in terms of increased demand, clinic revenues, pet ownership and spending habits. Finally, a brief update on supply. As I mentioned last quarter, we are managing certain isolated supply constraints for Librela, Solensia and some of our other products as we compete for some limited manufacturing inputs critical to human health during the pandemic. We were also seeing additional global supply challenges related to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the recent COVID-19 resurgence in China. While some of these challenges are Global manufacturing and supply network to mitigate any impact to our overall business. And our commercial teams are ensuring control launches for new products and coordinating with customers to minimize any impacts on their animal care. In conclusion, we are off to a good start for the year, and we're maintaining our operational growth expectations for the full year. Our diverse and durable portfolio, global scale and pipeline of innovations have us well positioned to meet customer needs and shareholder expectations for this year and beyond. Thank you. Now let me hand things off to Wetteny.
Wetteny Joseph: Thank you, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. As Kristin mentioned, we had a very strong start to the year with continued growth across a number of our core product franchises. Today, I will focus my comments on our first quarter financial performance, the key drivers contributing to our performance and provide an update on our full year 2022 guidance. In the first quarter, we generated revenue of $2 billion, growing 6% on a reported basis and 9% on an operational basis. Adjusted net income of $625 million grew 4% on a reported basis and 8% on an operational basis. Of the 9% operational revenue growth, 3% is on price and 6% from volume. Volume growth of 6% consisted of 5% from new products, which includes Simparica Trio and Librela, 3% from key dermatology products, while other in-line products declined 2%. The decline in other in-line products was expected and largely the result of a difficult comparison to the prior year and the impact of our swine business in China. Companion animal products led the way in terms of species growth, growing 20% operationally with livestock declining 6% on an operational basis in the quarter. Our small animal parasiticide portfolio was the largest contributor to growth in the quarter, where our innovative and diverse fleas, tick and heartworm portfolio drove growth of 25% operationally. Simparica Trio posted global revenue of $164 million, representing operational growth of 83% versus the comparable 2021 period. In Q1, Simparica Trio was the number one canine parasiticide sold in the U.S. in terms of revenue, and we recently launched Trio in Japan, a sizable international heartworm market. Meanwhile, our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint, had significant global growth again with $307 million of revenue, representing 28% operational growth against a robust prior year in which key derm grew 24% in the first quarter. In Europe, our recently launched monoclonal antibody Librela, which is for osteoarthritis pain in dogs, also meaningfully contributed to growth in the quarter, posting $21 million in sales. Our Global Diagnostics portfolio recorded $98 million in revenue and had operational sales growth of 12% in Q1, growing across both our U.S. and international segments. Growth was largely driven globally by consumable usage and new products. We also continue to see growth in the placement of new devices in international markets. Diagnostics remains a key growth driver for Zoetis, and we continue to make significant investments in our field force, new technologies and reference grew 24% in the first quarter. In Europe, our recently launched monoclonal antibody, umbrella, which is for osteoarthritis pain in dogs, also meaningfully contributed to growth in the quarter, posting $21 million in sales. Our Global Diagnostics portfolio recorded $98 million in revenue and had operational sales growth of 12% in Q1, growing across both our U.S. and international segments. Growth was largely driven globally by consumable usage and new products. We also continue to see growth in the placement of new devices in international markets. Diagnostics remains a key growth driver for Zoetis, and we continue to make significant investments in our field force, new technologies and reference lab. I think revenue will continue to grow at levels above what we were seeing prior to COVID as the standard of veterinary care continues to increase through innovation, better demographics, higher compliance and more pets. Companion animal growth in the U.S. was driven largely by sales from our parasiticide portfolio as well as key dermatology products. Growth of Simparica Trio was again strong in the quarter with sales of $147 million in the U.S., growing 77%. We continue to meet our clinic penetration targets and take share within individual clinics with additional runway for future revenue growth. Federal on and satisfaction material is approximately 90% key dermatology products sales were $194 million for the quarter, growing 23% with APOQUEL and Capon each significantly contributing to growth. Our investment to support the portfolio have been instrumental in driving more patients into the clinic, and we will continue to invest meaningfully in this space as a large portion of dolls with dermatitis remain undertreated, representing an opportunity to further expand the market. In an effort to support all of our long-term sustainable sources of growth in our companion animal portfolio. In April, we launched our new pet care go-to-market strategy, expanding our U.S. companion animal field force by approximately 40% and creating dedicated and separate diagnostic and pharma coverage for our portfolio of products. U.S. livestock declined 11% in the quarter, primarily resulting from our cattle business. This was expected as we experienced challenges from generic competition for Jackson, which didn't exist in the same quarter last year as well as elevated input costs continuing to weigh on producer profitability. Meanwhile, upholstery business continues to be negatively impacted by the expanded use of lower cost alternatives resulting from reduced disease pressure from smaller foxises as well as generic competition for Zoamix. Swine products sales grew in the quarter as a result of favorable market conditions for producers and higher disease equivalence. Moving on to our International segment, where revenue grew 3% on a reported basis and 8% operationally in the quarter. Companion animal revenue grew 23% operationally, and livestock revenue declined 3% operationally. Increased sales of companion animal products resulted from the growth of our key dermatology products, monoclonal antibodies for alleviation of ore pain and our parasite portfolio. Semak brands continue to benefit from our international direct-to-consumer campaigns in Latin America and parts of Europe, and we remain excited with the long-term prospects of these programs. We are encouraged by the performance of our monoclonal antibody for OA pain with Librela generating $21 million and Cerencia delivering $3 million in first quarter sales. Librela remains on track to exceed $100 million in revenue this year. As we mentioned last quarter, Librela became the number one pain product in the EU in the first year of launch, with the underlying performance metrics being very favorable for future growth. Reordering rates remain at around 90%. Compliance exceeded our initial expectations, and we'll continue a significant opportunity to expand the pain market with a meaningful percentage of dogs on Librela being new to the market. Meanwhile, international livestock declined 3% operationally in the quarter. opportunity to expand the pain market with a meaningful percentage of dogs on Librela being new to the market. Meanwhile, international livestock declined 3% operationally in the quarter. This decline was driven predominantly by our swine portfolio in China. As we indicated over the past several months, increased port supply in the market like to a significant decline in pork prices, which impacts producer profitability. In addition, our first quarter of 2021 presented a difficult comparative period as pricing and producer profitability in that quarter had been at an all-time high. While we expect China to return to growth in the back half of the year, we anticipate a challenging second quarter for our swine portfolio. Partially offsetting our decline in swine was growth in our fish, poultry and cattle portfolios. Our fish portfolio grew double digits again this quarter, driven by growth of the AlphafluxCLIce treatment product and AlphaGeLivVac vaccine for SRS in Chile. Sales of cattle products grew in key markets due to favorable market conditions and pricing in Brazil and Australia as well as demand generation efforts in emerging markets such as Turkey and China. Now moving on to the rest of the P&L for the quarter. Adjusted gross margin of 71.6% improved Advertising and promotion as well as direct-to-pet owner campaigns for key brands. R&D expenses increased 4% operationally due to higher compensation costs. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 18.9%, a decrease of 20 basis points, driven by the impact of favorable discrete tax items and settlements with certain tax authorities, slightly offset by changes in the jurisdictional mix of earnings. And finally, adjusted net income grew 8% operationally and adjusted diluted EPS grew 9% operationally for the quarter. Capital expenditures in the first quarter were $115 million. We are still anticipating a significant increase in capital expenditures for the full year 2022, primarily related to investments in Ireland, the U.S. and China to support manufacturing capacity needed to meet our long-term growth demands. In the quarter, we returned over $0.5 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. We purchased approximately $361 million of Zoetis shares, representing our largest dollar-based quarterly share repurchase ever. Now moving on to guidance for the full year 2022. Foreign exchange rates on our updated guidance are as of late April and reflect the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Please note that any update to our full year guidance are related directly and only to foreign exchange and that the ranges of our operational growth rates for revenue of 9% to 11% and adjusted income of 10% to 13% remained the same as our previous February guidance. We are holding these top and bottom line operational growth rates the same despite the conflict in Russia and Ukraine, negatively impacting our expected full year operational growth by 1%. We feel we can offset this impact with the strength of our companion animal portfolio. Beginning with revenue for the full year 2022, we are decreasing both the low and high end of the range by $100 million to reflect the impact of foreign exchange. We are now projecting revenue of between $8.225 billion and $8.375 billion while maintaining our expected operational growth of 9% to 11%. and bottom line operational growth rates the same despite the conflict in Russia and Ukraine, negatively impacting our expected full year operational growth by 1%. We feel we can offset this impact with the strength of our companion animal portfolio. Beginning with revenue for the full year 2022, we are decreasing both the low and high end of the range by $100 million to reflect the impact of foreign exchange. We are now projecting revenue of between $8.25 billion and $8.375 billion while maintaining our expected operational growth of 9% to 11%. For adjusted net income for the year -- adjusted net income is now expected to be in the range of $2.365 billion to $2.4 billion, while maintaining our expected operational growth of 10% to 13%. And finally, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.99 to $5.09 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.65 to $4.77. Sales of companion animal products will be the primary growth driver in 2022 with the continued strength of our diverse prior silicide portfolio, further expansion of our key dermatology products, the adoption of our monoclonal antibodies for OA pain and growth in point-of-care diagnostics. We also continue to see a very favorable global companion animal backdrop for 2022. For livestock, the fundamental macro trends, which make animal protein on essential business remain intact, and we believe more normalized growth will occur in 2023. While our guidance represents our expectations for the full year, I would like to provide some color on the expected phasing of growth for the remainder of 2022. We expect top line operational growth for Q2 to be slightly below Q1 as today business and certain supply chain activities. We also expect a similar foreign exchange impact in Q2 that we experienced in Q1, where reported revenue was negatively impacted by about 3%. In addition, the significant investments we are making early in the year to support future revenue growth, including field force expansion in the U.S. and incremental DTC advertising will drive OpEx growth in Q2 at a faster rate than revenue, impacting Q2 bottom line profitability more materially than in the back half of the year. We expect that foreign exchange in Q2 will have a negative impact to the bottom line of about 5%. Our full year 2022 guidance once again reflects our value proposition of growing revenue in line with or faster than the market and growing adjusted net income faster than revenue. Our success is derived from our diversified portfolio of enduring brands driven by multiple sources of in-line growth, and agile and disciplined innovation engine and our infrastructure to develop and expand markets globally. We extract to continue to execute across multiple dimensions of our business and capitalize on favorable end market dynamics for the foreseeable future. Now I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Erin Wright of Morgan Stanley.
Erin Wright: Great. I have one on companion animal trends that I have to ask here. What are you seeing at the clinic level if you could parse out a little bit more of what you're seeing across the U.S. and international in terms of demand trends, what you're seeing in terms of capacity constraints at the vet clinic level? And what is implied in your guidance at this point in terms of operational growth across the companion animal segment? And then a follow-up on Trio, I guess, where do you stand now in terms of market share in canine parasiticide at this point? And how much do you think Simparica Trio is taking share versus expanding the market with greater compliance?
Kristin Peck: Okay, Erin, it's Kristin. Great to hear from you. So we fundamentally and structurally believe the pet care industry is in great shape. I think as you've seen some of these trends over the last few years, there's a very high standard of care. The demographics of who is adopting these pets over the last few years being millennials, the number of pets you have out there and honestly, the aging of pets. So we do not think there is a demand problem. I think you saw in the quarter potentially a difficult cost to what you saw last year. If you look overall, a 5% increase at the vet clinic, there is a little bit less traffic, as you referenced. I think those are some of the shorter-term capacity constraints. But remember, we've got a lot more pets. So you're really -- the base is much larger than it's historically been. But given Omicron, there was definitely some challenges at some of the vet clinics. But the other thing to consider about the data that we would just highlight is that it really pulls out a lot of the large corporates who have found more innovative ways to structure their business to add more capacity. And I think you'll see more of that coming overall. There were the short-term labor shortages. The other thing to really focus on, we would say is if you look at Zoetis' business, it's a little different, the nature of our business and our innovation, we have a lot of chronic medications. It doesn't require tons of visits. So we focus a little bit more on the spend per visit as we look at it. We also have alternative channels, which for us in the quarter grew 34%. So we remain very optimistic with regards to pet care trends overall? And maybe, Wetteny, you can take her second question on Simparica.
Wetteny Joseph: Yes. Sure, Erin. Look, very, very pleased with the performance of Simparica Trio posting $164 million of revenue in the quarter, up 83%, became the number one canine parasiticide in the U.S. And as we've shared before, we have 90% penetration across large corporate accounts, et cetera. And within those penetrated clinics, we continue to take share as well. Satisfaction level with our product is about 90% among pet owners, and we also just launched Simparica Trio in Japan, which is a key heartworm market as well, just in the middle of this quarter. So I'm very pleased with the performance with Trio.
Operator: Our next question comes from Christine Rains, William Blair.
Christine Rains: I was just wondering if I could have any update on diagnostics contribution to the quarter and overall performance? Is growth tracking with your expectations? And can you comment on system placements versus testing volume growth. And if you would have made any additional reference lab purchases?
Wetteny Joseph: Yes, sure. I'll take this, Christine. Thanks for the question. Look, I'm very pleased with the performance of our Diagnostics business in the quarter. We grew 12%, posting $98 million of revenue. We really saw strong growth across both U.S. and international, both replacements as well as consumables. So we're very pleased with the performance of the business. In terms of reference lab acquisitions, we did not have any in the quarter. Obviously, we made a number of acquisitions that we -- in the U.S. and continue to make investments across technology. You might have seen images, for example, we've added additional indications here with blood smear in addition to fecal and digital psychology. So we continue to be very pleased with the performance of the business.
Operator: Our next question comes from Louise Chen of Cantor.
Louise Chen: Congratulations on the quarter. Just curious what has been the impact of inflation on your Animal Health business, both companion and livestock and how do you see potential increase in inflation or continued inflation impacting your business going forward?
Kristin Peck: Thanks, Louise. I'll start and then I'll move it to Wetteny. We've seen historically that pet owner spending has been incredibly durable right now, we've got about 63% of our revenue in companion animal. But if you look at the February research, 86% of pet owners would spend whatever it takes. So we do see inflation, and Wetteny can certainly get into how we've taken price, et cetera. But I think we've obviously seen increase in labor cost and freight and fuel. But Wetteny can really talk about the fact that we've been able to leverage price especially in our companion animal business. So Wetteny, do you want to go over some of those numbers?
Wetteny Joseph: Yes, sure. Given we continue to see very strong underlying demand from pet owners, we have very innovative products across our portfolio. We've been able to demonstrate that we can take price at or above inflation levels in the past, and we don't see any reason why we won't do that now. If you look at this quarter, for example, our total growth included 3% of price. Now if you parse that out and you look at just companion animal globally, we took 6% of price. And so we'll continue to use that lever as we proceed. But given the dynamics, Kristin just mentioned, underlying strength in the market, we'll continue to have that availability to us.
Kristin Peck: And the only thing I'd add there is, despite inflation, I would just note that in 2021, we increased our margins and our guidance for 2022 does the same. So I think it really shows the durability and resilience of our industry.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nathan Rich of Goldman Sachs.
Nathan Rich: Kristin, I'd be curious to get your view following up on the commentary you have on just vet visit trends and vet spending trends. Do you see more variability in sales for your products that are administered need to be administered by the vet? And can you just remind us how big of a percentage of your companion animal business that is? And then a quick follow-up for Wetteny. It looks like the revenue guidance came down by $100 million. It looks like operating profit may be down by $50 million. So it seems like a high decremental margin on the revenue reduction. I guess does that just reflect kind of the composition of the expense base? Just to be curious kind of any color you can shed on that dynamic. Thank you.
Kristin Peck: Sure. I mean, I'll start off with your first question. Again, if you look at our overall portfolio and the nature of our business, I think the level of innovation, we're not as susceptible to vet visit trends. You basically what percentage has to be administered in the vet clinic. I don't know maybe around 50% that would be vaccines injectables. But I think if you look at the sales of Librela being now the number one pain product in Europe, clearly, for things that are really important to pet owners, they are getting into the clinic. Regular checks for vaccines, we're not seeing any significantly negative trends there. So I think chronic medications, which is a huge part of our business. And if you look at dermatology and parasiticides, which are growing at pairs are growing at 25% in the quarter, derm at 28% in the quarter. We're clearly not really suffering from the slight decline in the U.S. in trends. But Wetteny, you can take that second question.
Wetteny Joseph: Yes, sure. As we've said, we've revised our guidance solely to reflect FX. We continue to maintain our operational guidance range, both top and bottom for the company that we came into in February that we gave. So from an FX perspective, top line impact is about 3%. It's about $260 million of an impact. And as you referenced, the change you're reflecting the change in FX has a wider impact on the bottom, and that's really largely driven by FX in losses given our exposure across certain currencies, particularly the euro. If you look at the first quarter, for example, you see a wider impact at the bottom that you see at the top, driven by the impact of that as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Ryskin of Bank of America.
Michael Ryskin: Congrats on a strong result. I want to start with livestock markets. I mean we've known livestock was going to be weak for a while, and so it's not a huge surprise. But so I just want to get an update on how you're seeing a couple of factors that are going, both DRAXXIN, are you still sort of projecting lapping the tough comps around the summer and sort of what are your expectations for DRAXXIN exiting this year and next year, and then broader conditions such as drought in the Midwest and the United States, rising input costs. Sort of how do you see that playing out for U.S. livestock and internationally? And then a follow-up question for Wetteny, if I might. You guys touched a number of times in the prepared remarks on field force expansions or investing in growth, investing in the opportunities in companion animal. Just wondering if you could go into a little more detail on how that's going to play out? When do you see that shown up in the numbers when you think you'll start seeing the payoff for that? And just sort of talk about labor pressures, wage pressures, how that affects your thought process there?
Kristin Peck: Great. Mike, I'll take the first part of it, which is the broader livestock trends and then Wetteny can take the DRAXXIN and the field force question that you've got. I mean, look, as you know, well, historically, livestock has grown around 4% I think if you look at 2019 and 2020, you saw sort of some unusual events that affected overall industry livestock growth. Obviously, African Swine Fever in China, as you remember, and then overall COVID, but then as I think as you look at 2021 and 2022, Zoetis has been unusually impacted and that has everything to do with where DRAXXIN is. And Wetteny can get into the numbers, but that has played out exactly how we expected it to. Our long-term outlook, as Wetteny mentioned a few minutes ago in his prepared remarks, remains unchanged. We think you're going to start to go back to more normalized growth in 2023 and beyond, basically because feeding the world is a powerful trend, the desire for protein and higher quality protein. But let me let Wetteny get into some of the specifics on the DRAXXIN numbers and then your second question.
Wetteny Joseph: Yes. So as we said from the very beginning with the cycle DRAXXIN, we expect it to have about a 20% impact to the top line in the first year and another 20% in the second. So what we're seeing across livestock right now is playing out exactly as we thought. In fact, in 2021, we did a little bit slightly better than that with respect to DRAXXIN. And we continue to have the effects -- positive effects of life cycle innovation like Draxxin KP, and we're maintaining most of our volume. And the margin for DRAXXIN remains very attractive for us as well. So as we expected, we've seen competitors come in, but the performance has been at or slightly better than we expected. Broadly speaking, I think if you look at swine, for example, in China, there was a pretty significant impact on the quarter with respect to large stock. Again, we expected that coming in. And it's really looking at where swine prices are in China versus a year ago, where they were at all-time highs and have been at all-time lows essentially here and the lockdowns having an impact on sort of demand consumption as well in this case. So with respect to the field force, if I can transition to that part of your question, very pleased to be able to expand our field force here. We have the broadest portfolio across the market. And if you look at innovation that we have coming as well with respect to the pain franchises for Solensia that we are probably launching across the second half of this year. And as we get approval for Librela and launched that as well in the U.S., we continue to have opportunities to really capitalize on the market dynamics and the strong demand and have additional field force, which we see a strong return on those as well. We're also launching a dedicated sale force for diagnostics, separate and apart from our Rx teams, which we believe will have, again, a very positive return for us as well. Now you can see that with those plans, we still have an operational levered P&L where we're growing the bottom line above the top line. So top line in 9% to 11% and the bottom at 10% to 13% with approximately a 40% increase in our field force.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jon Block of Stifel.
Jon Block: Great. Maybe just a couple of quick ones. For U.S. Librela approval, was that a slight push, Kristin, to year-end '22 for mid-'22? If it was, maybe just if you could elaborate on what still needs to get done there for approval? And if it is here in '22, how are you from a supply standpoint? Do you think that product will be ready for early 2023 U.S. launch? And then maybe just as a quick follow-up. Wetteny, can you talk about the supply chain and cost and how you feel there? Companion animals expected to be a big year-over-year in '22. So you've got this positive mix shift, you've got price running ahead of what it normally does. I think you called out 3% versus 1% last year. And GM still expected to be flattish. So you just would love some color on how you're feeling in the supply chain.
Kristin Peck: Sure. Thanks, Jon. I'll start with the first question and let Wetteny take the second. With regard to Librela, no, this is exactly as we expected. We were expecting an approval later this year. We continue to expect that, as we wrote in the market, there's no change there. We still require an ex-U.S. site visit, as we said all along. So I would say there's really no update there. And to your second question, when would you expect a launch? We're obviously, as we would in any product working to build up supply. But as always, in our industry and especially with regards to biologics and monoclonal antibodies, the standard in our industry is it takes somewhere between three and 9 months to get up to a full launch. So is a monoclonal antibody. We'll do an early experience sometime in the first half, again, depending on when the approval is and launch shortly thereafter. We're quite excited about this. Obviously, we're working hard to build up that supply as soon as we get the approvals of the site, et cetera. So everything on Librela is exactly where we were before, really absolutely no change there.
Wetteny Joseph: Yes. And I'll take the supply chain part of the question, Jon. Look, our supply chain has proven to be very resilient despite challenging elements over the last couple of years. We delivered 15% operational growth last year with 14 of that in volume. So we put an ability to continue to navigate through those. Currently, we are looking at China, for example, where the lockdowns have had an effect certainly in our first quarter, and we see that in our second quarter as well, which is why we included those in our prepared commentary around Q2 expectations. But in terms of price, we are pulling that leverage 3% total for the company. On the companion animal side, which now that's about 53% of our company if you look at the first quarter, companion animal has grown almost 60% over the last two years, if you look back to 2019 level. So again, very strong market dynamics and demand. We do see the mix shift being very positive for us with more companion animal and with our innovative products that are launching as well. But we do have some offsets when you look at livestock, particularly DRAXXIN, as we just talked about in line with our expectations, but certainly are giving price and maintaining the volume and, as I said, still at attractive margins for us. But that's really the main offset if you look at it across the year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Balaji Prasad of Barclays.
Balaji Prasad: One each on combined and livestock, firstly on atopic dermatitis. I estimate that you currently probably have around 35% of the market share in the U.S. between Cytopoint and Apoquel. With the -- what percent of the incremental market is allergic dermatitis and is this market open for you as you get the label extension. On the same subject, do you also have an update on your oral JAK inhibitors and which is expected to come later this year, how that would influence the market share at all? On the livestock side, could you quantify if there are any opportunities that are coming to you through the Chinese consumption shifting towards beef and poultry will be swine, are you there's not much of a trend there?
Kristin Peck: Sure. I'll start on the overall derm. As you saw, it grew about 28% in the quarter, driven by expanding our direct efforts. Certainly, you see we're investing more in our field force pet care rewards. I also think genuinely, it's just more people home with their pets. I don't have the specific share numbers. We can certainly get back to you on that I think it's over 70% in the U.S., our share of the atopic dermatitis, allergic dermatitis markets overall in the U.S. and especially it's even more if you want to look at revenue. But we're really pleased with where that's going. With regards to competition, I know our favorite question, we don't absolutely know. We would expect competition on it. At this point in time, as we look at 2022, we are not expecting competition in 2022, we would expect it in 2023. As our latest intelligence, obviously, we could be wrong there. But expectation is competition for derm on a small molecule basis will come in 2023. With regards to our own pipeline internally, we don't discuss that. So I don't think we have any color there. But I don't know, Wetteny, do you want to take the second question?
Wetteny Joseph: Yes, sure. Just one thing to add on the first one. For us, really, when we look at Derm, it's less about market share, it's a lot more about market expansion. There's certainly an opportunity when we look at the number of dogs that suffer from each [indiscernible] are not being treated. About 6 million, and of the 7.6 million that are being created, so a good portion of them are undertreated with either antihistamines or steroids. So we do think there's an opportunity with respect to the under treatment there. Now I'll shift over to your question around livestock, particularly around China. We have seen an increase in beef consumption here, which certainly benefits us when you look at our business in Brazil, for example, that exports into China from a beef perspective as well as in China set of activities. And so it's still -- in terms of in China, it's still relatively small compared to swine, for example, but we are seeing good trends there that are favorable to us.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Schott of JPMorgan.
Chris Schott: First, can you just remind us about your sensitivity to economic growth? I know you're seeing very healthy demand in the companion side right now and you've been able to take price. But if we enter a mild recession in some parts of the world, particularly Europe, what type of pressures would you anticipate, if any, to your business from that? And my second one was on protein demand. I know you've touched on this in a couple of other questions, but it does seem like we're entering kind of a challenging macro environment with food prices growing very rapidly, especially in the emerging markets. Do you see that as a risk at all in terms of global protein demand consumers trading down on protein that could kind of dampen kind of your livestock recovery as we look out to kind of 2023 and beyond.
Kristin Peck: Sure. Thanks, Chris. Good to hear from you. As you think about the economic challenges, potential economic risk across the globe, I think one thing you've seen about the animal health industry I was referencing before, the research is 86% will spend what it takes. And I think it's also really important to focus on the fact that our companion animal business is growing 50% between 2019 and 2021. As Wetteny mentioned, it was about 63%. And that is just a more durable business as you think about getting through economic challenges. We grew through the beginning of COVID, for example. As you look at it, we've grown during the Great Recession. And that was when our companion animal business was only 35%. So I think structurally, if you look at our business, it's more positive now than it was during the Great Recession, so I do think we're going to be pretty resilient as we go through those times. But I'll let Wetteny add anything wants to and then take your protein demand trend question.
Wetteny Joseph: Yes, I think you've covered it well, just a companion animal. It's a bigger percentage of our business now is proving to be very resilient. And structurally with respect to demographics we have more Gen Z and millennials, owning pets, more pets. And if you look across our portfolio, a number of chronic conditions that we're treating that are very resilient even as we've seen in the past and structurally even stronger now. With respect to livestock, you do see the potential for people to trade down in proteins going from beef down to chicken or pork and then et cetera. So we do think that can happen in terms of looking across the globe. We do have a growth portfolio across different species, obviously. But that is one of the areas that we think is a little bit less than what we see in companion animal, where extremely resilient. Now we do, overall, though, when you look at protein consumption, we do see that growing over time, particularly as you could look across emerging markets, growing populations increase in sort of sole income, et cetera, and growing middle class across different markets. We see those continuing to maintain growth to protein consumption, we do have the pandemic, which actually has been negative from a lifestyle perspective. I think folks look at the pandemic and think about the positive effects on the companion animal side. but that has actually been largely negative. And so we do believe that they'll -- in addition to our DRAXXIN, which we've talked about, we do anticipate a return to growth in livestock as we get out into 2023, 2024 timeframe.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Scala of Cowen.
Steve Scala: You mentioned enhanced spending per pet. Our understanding is that this is due to two things, enhanced compliance and catch-up in routine wellness checks. Is that what you've seen? If so, how much does each contribute? So how much does enhanced compliance contribute versus catch-up in routine visits. The concern is that the catch-up in routine visits would seem like a onetime boost. And if that's the case, then what are the long-term implications of not -- no longer getting that boost and just enjoying the trends of the enhanced compliance?
Kristin Peck: Sure. I mean, I guess what we would say is that you're seeing more animals, you're seeing Wetteny's mentioned the demographics of who is adopting these animals, people who spend more time, more money on them, the aging of pets. So I'm not sure we would probably parse the data the way you do to be perfectly honest. Obviously, we are seeing increased compliance. I think alternative channels sort of online and autoship, even from clinics, is really helping driving that increased compliance. But I would say if you look at our portfolio, it's innovation. It's bringing disruptive innovation that people are excited about, looking at Paris, a single product that does three things. people are excited about. You look at monoclonal antibodies. You look at dermatology. We have great chronic medications that are not as susceptible to how many visits you make. If you get a prescription for par, it lasts the year. So I guess we would look at the data slightly differently than what you're looking at it. And more importantly, for our business, we think the nature of our business and the level of innovation and the demographics of both the number of animals and who's adopting them remains very positive.
Wetteny Joseph: Yes. I would say it's a combination of just an increased standard of care for animals, particularly for pets that's aided by the innovation that's come out of Zoetis across derm and parasiticides and now with pain and the demographics of the owners that actually put a premium on the health of their pets that's driving this. And I think people are doing more in those visits as well, which is driving sort of the revenue per visit figures that you see, which is, again, part of the reason that we don't think the visits themselves are as meaningful as the spend per visit.
Operator: Our next question comes from Elliott Wilbur of Raymond James.
Elliot Wilbur: One question around the EU launch experience and dynamics to date with respect to Librela and Solensia. Just how some of the early experience is shaping expectations for the U.S. launch areas of over underperformance where you've been positively surprised. And just thinking about dynamics such as persistence, do you have any sense of the number of patients started on therapy that are returning for follow-up injections, Librela share of new patient starts. And I know it's still relatively early, but is -- or are you seeing or are you expecting to see an increase in overall patient volumes from the launch of these products? And then just as a quick follow-up here, how important was -- or is the mAb opportunity in the U.S. in terms of driving your decision behind the sales force expansion?
Kristin Peck: Sure. Thanks, Elliot. Great questions on Librela. We are super excited at the launch there. To get to some of the specific information you have for us. As we said, this is now Librela in Europe is now the number one selling product for pain. What's really exciting also about that is 40% are patients that are new to the category. So I think this is really changing the game for a lot of people, maybe for safety reasons, couldn't take what the other products were are really coming into the vet clinic. And to get to your other question, there's a 90% reorder rate. So which gets that -- if you come in for one injection, are you staying with the product? The answer is yes. And this is why we believe in its first full year in Europe alone, Librela will be a blockbuster product for us. We did about $22 million in Q1. This definitely does inform as we think about U.S. launch. It informs why we want to start with early experience getting each of the best, especially the KOLs used to what it looks like. How to treat, how to manage it. And then really building that excitement which worked incredibly well for us in Europe which will do again in the U.S. And really I think our expectations for the product have increased based on the success we’ve seen already. So Solensia, we are very excited as well. It's a very different market, it didn't exist before. As we talked about we're really creating the market as what is demonstrated time and again. It's ability to do that as it in derm. But again you got to get the cast to the clinic as you know there are less medicals lives than dogs. You've got to help cat owners know what pain looks like. But we remain super excited about Solensia. It will just be, as we said, the ramp will look slightly different on Solensia than it does with Librela. But we're just as excited, and we think it's potential is very strong there. Do you want to add anything, Wetteny?
Wetteny Joseph: No, just a part of the question on the field force, I wanted to just make a comment on, which is, look, we have the broadest portfolio, as I mentioned before. And we continue to add innovative products to that. And so we carefully analyze sort of the coverage across clinics and across products for our field force and are very confident that this is an investment that's going to have that's going to yield positive returns for us across our products, existing products, opportunities to expand in the existing products as well as new products that are coming on.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session at this time. I'd be happy to return the call to Kristin Peck, CEO, for any concluding remarks.
Kristin Peck: Great. Thank you all for your questions and for the continued interest in Zoetis. I just want to summarize, I think Zoetis is off to a strong start of the year. We've got continued strength in products for pet care, and I think as you've seen, a diverse and durable global portfolio, we're really happy to be maintaining our operational growth expectations for the full year despite the negative impact of foreign exchange and other headwinds. And we're continuing to make ongoing investments in talent and technology, manufacturing expansions and innovation that have us well positioned to support our future growth plans as well. So I look forward to keeping you updated on future calls and hope you have a great day. Thanks so much, everybody.
Operator: This does conclude today's Zoetis Q1 2022 earnings call and webcast. You may now disconnect, and everyone, have a great day.

===== 2021 Q4  (2022-02-15 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Financial Results Conference Call and Webcast for Zoetis. Hosting the call today is Steve Frank, Vice President of Investor Relations for Zoetis. The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, and will not be forwarded automatically. In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately 2 hours after the conclusion of this call via dial-in or on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.
Steve Frank: Thank you, Catherine. Good morning, everyone and welcome to the Zoetis fourth quarter and full year 2021 earnings call. I am joined today by Kristin Peck, our Chief Executive Officer; and Wetteny Joseph, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I’ll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statement in today’s press release and our SEC filings, including, but not limited to, our annual report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q. Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures which were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and the company’s filings dated today, Tuesday, February 15, 2022. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. With that, I will turn the call over to Kristin.
Kristin Peck: Thank you, Steve and welcome everyone to our year end earnings call for 2021. I am happy to report that Zoetis delivered its strongest performance ever in 2021, thanks to our innovative, diverse and durable portfolio and the talent and commitment of our colleagues. We grew revenue 15% operationally, which is once again above the anticipated growth rate for the animal health market. And these results were highlighted by 27% operational growth in our companion animal portfolio with 1% operational growth in livestock. Our parasiticide dermatology vaccines, diagnostics and monoclonal antibody therapies all contributed to these strong results driven by the positive trends in pet care, trends that we see continuing to be a key growth driver in 2022 and beyond. From a segment perspective, we saw solid balance across our global footprint with the U.S. up 14% and international growing 17% operationally. Operationally, for the year, China grew 25%, Brazil grew 28% and other emerging markets grew 22%, leading the way for our international performance. Another major growth driver for the year has been our global diagnostics portfolio, which grew 21% operationally with significant strength in international markets and the continued launch of VetScan Imagyst, our AI-driven diagnostics platform. Based on the strong revenue performance, we were able to deliver 19% operational growth in adjusted net income for the year, while investing significantly in our latest product launches as well as staffing, R&D and manufacturing projects for future growth. Looking ahead, we believe this momentum sets us up well for 2022. We expect to continue growing revenue faster than the market in the coming year driven by continued strength in pet care, expansion of our diagnostics portfolio internationally as significant growth in both companion animal and livestock product sales for emerging markets, including China and Brazil. As a result, we are guiding to full year operational growth of 9% to 11% in revenue. Wetteny and I will discuss more details about the full year 2022 guidance. But let me share some views on the year and other updates. First, the essential nature of animal health continues to be affirmed by our performance during the COVID-19 pandemic. We have seen the fundamental drivers such as increased emphasis on pet wellness, a growing global population and continuous consumption of animal-based proteins all reinforce the animal health industry as a positive investment choice. In terms of the companion animal market, people’s commitment to the health and well-being of their pets has continued to drive higher spending and new opportunities for innovation, geographic expansion and increasing levels of care. Pet owners spending in animal health remains one of the more durable trends in consumer spending as people place a premium on the health and well-being of their pets, even during challenging economic times. In January, the Human Animal Bond Research Institute and Zoetis released the results of a new global survey of more than 16,000 pet owners and 1,200 small animal clinics, which reinforce how deep the connection is between pets and pet owners and how that dynamic relates to views on veterinary care and the related benefits of pet ownership. In the study, 92% of respondents said there was no reason they could ever be convinced to give up their pets and 86% said they would pay whatever it takes if their pet needed extensive veterinary care. The strength of the human animal bonds strongly correlated with higher rates of veterinary treatment for both preventative care and specific conditions in their pets. This study and other research support our focus on advancing an innovative pipeline for pain, dermatology and parasiticides for pets and we continue to invest in our field force, direct-to-consumer marketing and manufacturing capacity to bring these products to market. Moving on to the livestock industry, the need for safe and reliable sources of animal protein continues to be a fundamental growth driver for the industry, particularly in emerging markets. In any given year, weather, disease and market dynamics may have various regional impacts, but the underlying demand continues to be served locally or through global trade across more than 100 markets, where Zoetis products are sold. We have continued to see Zoetis’ livestock business show modest growth during the pandemic and recent economic challenges based on our strength internationally. We see that international growth continuing this year, while we continue to see declines in the U.S. driven primarily by generic competition in certain product lines. Our competitive strategies in pricing and new lifecycle innovations will help us mitigate some of that impact. Livestock products are a key element of our global strategy and long-term growth and we have continued to expand our vaccine product lines like Poulvac Procerta for poultry and Alpha Ject Micro for fish as well as DRAXXIN KP as a treatment for cattle. We are also exploring more livestock innovations around greater efficiency, precision animal health and more sustainable food production. We have been focusing on our investments in vaccines for prevention and maintaining healthy animals, data analytics for more individualized animal care and research into other sustainability improvements around immunotherapies. I was particularly excited by two recently announced additions to our precision animal health portfolio, Performance Ranch, a new cloud-based cow-calf management software this simplified tracking of individual animal performance and health product usage and our new block yard platform, which is blockchain technology developed in cooperation with IBM to provide a secure way to share information across different segments of the animal production supply chain. For Zoetis, we continue to stay focused on our five strategic priorities for the long-term and we are optimistic about the growth drivers we see for 2022. Pet care will remain a major growth driver for Zoetis globally based on our diverse and innovative portfolio. We see continued growth potential for our dermatology portfolio, which surpassed $1 billion in revenue for the first time in 2021. Our parasiticide driven by our triple combination, Simparica Trio as well as Revolution Plus, Stronghold Plus, Simparica and ProHeart 12 will continue to achieve growth as we gain market share in major markets and look at further lifecycle innovations and label gains across the portfolio. Librela and Solensia, our monoclonal antibodies for control of osteoarthritis pain in dogs and cats will continue to increase their revenue in 2022, primarily in the EU and we are making regulatory progress for these products in the U.S. We received FDA approval for Solensia in January with the launch expected in the second half of the year and we still anticipate approval of Librela in the second half of the year, assuming FDA inspections are completed at a facility outside the U.S. As we begin 2022, we are seeing strong demand in the EU for Librela and Solensia and we remain confident in the blockbuster potential for Librela in 2022 and Solensia in the longer term. We continue to optimize our global supply chain and manage ongoing challenges, which have been creating isolated constraints for Librela, Solensia and some of our other products. As always, maintaining a consistent reliable supply for our customers is our top priority and we have been communicating with them about any impacts to their orders. We want to ensure all pets can continue their treatments without interruption, especially for chronic treatment of OA pain. Our global manufacturing network is working around the clock to ensure reliable supply for our customers as they did throughout 2021 and our full year guidance and strong growth reflects our views on supply. Diagnostics is our next major growth driver in 2022 with a fully integrated point-of-care business that is prime for strong growth internationally, along with the expansion plans for relatively new reference lab operations. We are making significant progress in one of the fastest growing markets for animal health. We are adding more dedicated field force and customer service resources, while developing more offerings that will leverage our portfolio across the continuum of care. And finally, we see significant growth opportunities in emerging markets, including China and Brazil, where we see excellent opportunities for both our companion animal and livestock products based on increased medicalization and other positive trends. Meanwhile, our R&D team, along with external partners, will continue to generate the industry’s most productive pipeline in the years to come, with more than $500 million in R&D spending in 2021 our largest ever annual investment for R&D. We continue progressing research to address allergies, livestock health, chronic pain and inflammation, chronic kidney disease and diagnostics through our vaccines, therapeutics and digital technology platforms. In conclusion, I want to thank our colleagues for delivering another terrific year and for always bringing the value of Zoetis to our customers, everyday. Zoetis remains well-positioned in terms of our market leadership, financial strength, investment strategies and diverse portfolio to deliver sustainable growth to investors in 2022 and beyond. Now, let me hand things off to Wetteny.
Wetteny Joseph: Thank you, Kristin and good morning everyone. 2021 was an exceptional year for us with revenue of $7.8 billion and adjusted net income of $2.2 billion both exceeding the high end of our November full year guidance range. Full year revenue grew 16% on a reported basis and 15% operationally with adjusted net income increasing 21% on a reported basis and 19% operationally. Looking deeper into the 2021 numbers, price contributed 1% to full year operational revenue growth, with volume contributing 14%. Volume growth consisted of 6% from other inline products, 5% from new products, including Simparica Trio and 3% from key dermatology products. Revenue growth was again broad-based with the U.S. growing 14% and international growing 17% operationally. Our strong performance was driven by our innovative, diverse and durable companion animal portfolio, which grew 27% operationally. Our livestock business, which faced generic competition on key franchises as well as challenging macro conditions in certain markets, grew 1% operationally on a year-over-year basis. Performance in companion animal was led by our small animal parasiticide portfolio bolstered by full year sales of Simparica Trio, which generated revenue of $425 million, an increase of $305 million compared to 2020 sales. Sales of Simparica also grew double-digits for the year, with operational revenue growth of 13%. For the year, the Simparica franchise grew 82% operationally, with revenue of approximately $0.75 billion. Our key dermatology products performed incredibly well, growing 24% operationally with approximately $1.2 billion in revenue for the year, performing above our expectations. Our diagnostics portfolio grew 21% operationally in the year, with strong contributions from our U.S. and international segments and we will continue to make meaningful investments in the coming years to drive global growth. We do believe the adoption of diagnostics products and services outside the U.S. represents larger growth opportunities geographically and feel we are favorably positioned to capture future growth in those markets. Our livestock performance in 2021 depicts the importance of geographical diversification. Generic competition and challenging market conditions weighed on our U.S. performance, but were offset by solid growth internationally, primarily in emerging markets. The modest livestock growth on a global basis was in line with our expectations for the year. Moving on to our Q4 financial results, we posted another strong quarter, with revenue of $2 billion, representing an increase of 9% on both a reported and operational basis. Adjusted net income of $474 million is an increase of 8% on a reported basis and 5% operationally, of the 9% operational revenue growth, 1% from price and 8% from volume. Volume growth of 8% consisted of 5% from new products, which includes Simparica Trio, 2% from key dermatology products and 1% from other inline products. Companion animal products led the way in terms of [indiscernible] growth, growing 21% operationally, with livestock 6% on an operational basis in the quarter. Small animal parasiticides were the largest contributor to growth in the quarter, where our innovative and diverse fleet, tick and heartworm portfolio grew 32% operationally. Simparica Trio posted revenue of $124 million, representing operational growth of 106% versus the comparable 2020 period and the third consecutive quarter with sales exceeding $100 million. Meanwhile, our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint, again, had significant global growth in the quarter, with $360 million of revenue, representing 23% operational growth against a robust prior year in which key derm grew 27% in the fourth quarter of 2020. Our livestock business declined 6% in the quarter as a result of generic competition for DRAXXIN on favorable market conditions in the U.S., primarily resulting from elevated input costs as well as softer conditions in China, losses driven by reduced pork prices. Our fish business grew double-digits in the quarter and along with the strength of our emerging markets, partially offset the broader decline. Overall, livestock performance in the fourth quarter was in line with our expectations. Now, moving on to revenue growth by segment for the quarter, U.S. revenue grew 9%, with companion animal products growing 20% and livestock sales declining by 13%. U.S. pet care vet practice trends remained robust in Q4, with practice revenue growing approximately 8% with visits growing 3% despite challenging prior year comps. Companion animal growth in the quarter was driven by sales from our Simparica franchise as well as key dermatology products. We are driving growth in both therapeutic areas by making meaningful investments, primarily through direct-to-consumer advertising and field force and we continue to be pleased by the return on investment the programs are yielding. Growth of Simparica Trio was again strong in the quarter, with sales of $114 million growing more than 100%. We also met our clean penetration target and continued to take share within the clinics. Key dermatology sales were $216 million for the quarter, growing 22% with Apoquel and Cytopoint each growing significantly. Our investments to support the franchise have been instrumental in driving more patients into the clinic and we will continue to invest meaningfully in this space as the large portion of dogs with dermatitis remain untreated, representing an opportunity to further expand the market. U.S. livestock fell 13% in the quarter, primarily resulting from our cattle business, which as expected, was challenged by generic competition for DRAXXIN as well as elevated input costs continuing to weigh on producer profitability. Our poultry business was negatively affected by reduced disease pressure from smaller flock sizes as well as generic competition, while swine faced competitive pricing pressure on anti-infectives and vaccine products. Moving on to our international segment, where revenue grew 8% on a reported and operational basis in the quarter. Companion animal revenue grew 23% operationally and livestock revenue declined 2% operationally. Increased sales of companion animal products resulted from growth of our key dermatology products, our monoclonal antibodies for alleviation of OA pain and our parasiticide portfolio. Several key brands are benefiting from our international DTC campaigns in Latin America and parts of Europe and we remain excited with the long-term prospects of these programs. Overall, companion animal grew double-digits operationally in every major market in the quarter. We are encouraged by the performance of our monoclonal antibodies for OA pain, with Librela generating $15 million and Solensia delivering $3 million in fourth quarter sales. In the fourth quarter, Librela became the number one pain product in the EU in its first year, with the underlying performance metrics being very favorable for future growth. Reordering rates were in excess of 90% and compliance rates exceeded our initial expectations. In the past, we have highlighted the significant opportunity to expand the pain market. Therefore, we were extremely pleased to see approximately 40% of Librela and Solensia sales or from patients receiving medication for the first time. International livestock declined 2% operationally in the quarter as declines in cattle and swine were partially offset by growth in fish and poultry. Cattle declines were largely in the EU and Canada as generic competition for DRAXXIN weighed on sales. The decline in swine sales was primarily the result of lower pork prices in China negatively impacting producer profitability. Our fish portfolio grew double-digits again this quarter driven primarily by growth of Alpha Flux in Chile and the growth in poultry was largely attributed to further key account penetration. Now, moving on to the rest of the P&L for the quarter, adjusted gross margin of 69.6% increased 190 basis points on a reported basis compared to the prior year resulted from favorable product mix, lower inventory charges, favorable FX and price. This was partially offset by higher freight, manufacturing and other costs. Adjusted operating expenses increased 12% operationally with compensation-related costs being the primary driver of the 15% operational increase in SG&A as well as 3% operational increase in R&D expenses. Increased international advertising and promotion expense for key brands also contributed to higher SG&A, while R&D had increased project spend in the quarter. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 18.6%, an increase of 510 basis points, driven by the impact of prior year discrete tax benefits and changes to the jurisdictional mix of earnings. And finally, adjusted net income grew 5% operationally and adjusted diluted EPS grew 6% operationally for the quarter. In December, we announced a 30% annual dividend increase continuing our commitment to grow our dividend at or faster than the growth in adjusted net income. In the quarter, we repurchased approximately $200 million of Zoetis shares and announced the authorization of a $3.5 billion multiyear share repurchase program. Because we generate significant free cash flow, we have the ability to grow our business through organic investments and business development and return excess cash to shareholders without consuming our cash balance or being dependent on elevated leverage. Now moving on to guidance for 2022, please note that guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late January. We are expecting an unfavorable foreign exchange impact versus prior year by approximately $160 million on revenue, which is roughly 200 basis points and approximately $0.12 on EPS, which is about 250 basis points. For 2022, we are projecting revenue between $8.325 billion and $8.475 billion, representing 9% to 11% operational growth. We again expect companion animal to be the primary growth driver in 2022 with the continued strength of our diverse parasiticide portfolio, further expansion of our key dermatology products, the adoption of our monoclonal antibodies for OA pain and the growth in point-of-care diagnostics and reference labs. We see a very favorable companion animal backdrop for 2022 while expecting certain vet clinics trends to moderate over time we believe they will remain above pre-pandemic levels. The catalyst for growth in 2022 and beyond stem from a younger pet owner demographic and the standard of care increases, which took shape over the prior 2 years. Our innovative portfolio, geographic representation and significant investments in key brands have us positioned extremely well to capture a meaningful portion of that growth. We anticipate modest livestock growth again in 2022 led by the contributions of our emerging markets. The macro trends which makes livestock and essential business remain intact, and we believe more normalized growth will occur in 2023. I’d like to touch upon the key assumptions that underpin our expectations for revenue growth. Beginning with companion animal, we do not assume a triple combination product will launch in the U.S. in 2022 to compete against Simparica Trio or competitive entrants for our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint. As Kristin mentioned, in 2022, we expect Librela to become a blockbuster product in the first full year of sales with revenue exceeding $100 million largely from the EU markets. We remain very optimistic about the potential of Solensia as well. While the revenue curve will have a different shape due to the lack of an established feline pain market, we review Solensia as a long-term blockbuster product, which suggested a significant unmet need in animal health. In livestock, we expect generic competition to negatively impact DRAXXIN revenue by approximately 20% in 2022 comparable to the impact we saw this year. For the remainder of the P&L, adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue is expected to be approximately 29%, where favorable product mix and price are expected to generate margin expansion. Adjusted SG&A expenses for the year are expected to be between $2.07 billion and $2.12 billion with the increase from 2021 focused on supporting primary drivers of revenue growth, including investments to support new and existing products as well as diagnostics. Adjusted R&D expense for 2022 is expected to be between $540 million and $560 million. Zoetis is the leader in animal health because of the novel products, disruptive innovation and life cycle enhancements we bring to the market. Our internal R&D engine remains the primary source of innovation, and we are committed to ensuring it will continue to be significantly funded as a priority in capital allocation. Adjusted interest and other income inductions are expected to be approximately $240 million, representing a minimal year-over-year change. Our adjusted effective tax rate for 2022 is expected to be approximately 20%. The increase in 2022 is primarily related to the favorable impact of foreign derived intangible income and nonrecurring net discrete tax benefits that occurred in 2021. Adjusted net income is expected to be in the range of $2.415 billion to $2.470 billion, representing operational growth of 10% to 13%. Our guidance once again reflects our value proposition of growing revenue in line with or faster than the market and growing adjusted net income faster than revenue. We are anticipating a significant increase in capital expenditures in 2022 primarily related to investments in manufacturing expansions in Ireland, the U.S. and China. Finally, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.09 to $5.19 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.75 to $4.87. While guidance represents our expectations for full year financials, I would like to provide some color on the expected phasing of growth in 2022. We expect top line growth to be fairly consistent between the first half and second half of the year. However, due to the impact of generic competition for DRAXXIN, isolated supply constraints and the continued weakness of our swine business in China, we expect growth in the first quarter of 2022 to be lower than the remaining three quarters. In addition, the significant investments we are making early in the year to support revenue growth, primarily in companion animal, including diagnostics, along with very challenging comparative periods for T&E and other expenses, will impact Q1 materially more than the subsequent quarters. Now to summarize, 2021 was another exceptional year, our best performing year with 15% operational revenue growth and 19% operational growth in adjusted net income. Our guidance for 2022 reflects the strength of our innovative portfolio, our ability to successfully launch new products and establish new markets and our confidence in the end market dynamics for the spaces we compete in. Now I’ll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We will go first to Louise Chen with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.
Louise Chen: Hi. Congratulations on the quarter and thanks for taking my question. So you’ve been very successful over the years in your R&D efforts. And where do you our next wave of innovation coming from? And is it going to be companion or livestock focused drugs or diagnostics? Thank you.
Kristin Peck: Thanks, Louise. Good to hear from you. We are quite excited with regards to our pipeline. And I really think it is the innovative nature of Zoetis that has made us so successful. As you look at the pipeline, we’re excited about a number of areas, both across pet care and livestock. In pet care, continuing to innovate in the parasiticide space, it’s a $5 billion market. I think we can continue to bring innovation there, certainly, growing our osteoarthritis monoclonal antibodies for pain, Librela, Solensia continuing to innovate in the derm space. You saw us add Apoquel chewable in Europe, for example, there also leveraging that whole platform of monoclonal antibodies for other indications, we think is a big opportunity, really excited on diagnostics, the ability to continue to bring really disruptive innovation there. Certainly, our Imagyst platform and some of the new indications there is a great example. We also think taking a lot of our products and growing them in emerging markets will be valuable. And as you move into the livestock space, we’re excited about vector vaccines and poultry, vaccines in cattle and in swine and then really investing as well in our precision livestock farming and genetics portfolio. You probably saw we launched two new products there over the last few weeks. So we think there is significant innovation across both pet care and livestock and believe we have strong platforms in R&D for growth, investing over $500 million in R&D.
Operator: We will take the next question from Mike Ryskin with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Mike Ryskin: Great. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the quarter and strong guide. Just to start, I know you touched on this in the prepared remarks, but I have to ask a follow-up on the Trio competition. We heard from one of your competitors that they may be closer than that. So even though you don’t expect competition and it’s not built into your assumptions for 2022, how would you react if you did see it? How would your assumptions be impacted? And how do you think you would adjust pricing or go-to-market? Sort of how would you see a flow through? And if I could ask just a quick follow-up to that, on pricing in general across the portfolio, what are your expectations for 2022? Are you going to be able to take more price, less price? Obviously, there is an inflationary environment. You have to think about livestock versus companion differently. So could you just talk us through your assumptions on price across the portfolio?
Wetteny Joseph: Yes. So let me take that first. With respect to Trio, we continue to be very pleased with the performance of Trio and really the entire Simparica franchise. When you look at Trio, we delivered $124 million of revenue in the quarter. When you look across the franchise, we continue to see really strong growth. For the year, the franchise grew 82% across the board, so very pleased with that. And we’re putting significant investments behind the product and across Simparica as well in markets where you don’t see heartworm being prevalent. And so we’ve seen Simparica grow 13% on the year. And so we continue to make those investments in our field force as well as advertising and DTC campaigns across – our confidence is that we will continue to see growth even when this competitor is in this space. We have seen that in other cases where other products have come into the market. When you look at the fleet tick heartworm market, it’s the biggest market within animal health with $5 billion, and there are other products in the space that have better sizes of $800 million-plus. So as we look here, we continue to see more headroom to continue to grow this brand and this franchise even when there is competition. When I look at price, we delivered 1% of growth in price net in 2021. And we’re probably looking at about the same sort of range when we think about 2022. You have to keep in mind while we see opportunities to take price across the board, particularly in companion animal and behind our innovative brands and seeing really strong demand in the end markets. We will continue to pull that lever. In terms of what’s going the other way, as you’re aware, DRAXXIN is one with competitive – generic competition there with respect to that as well as Zoamix in BMD, we’ve seen that sort of partially offset, I would say, but we still delivered a net price increase in 2021 and we believe even as we look to offset inflation as we have done in 2021, we will have the opportunity to do that. We do look at price on a market-by-market and SKU-by-SKU basis. And so we deliberated about where we can be more aggressive, and we will take those opportunities as we go through.
Operator: We will take the next question from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Nathan Rich: Hi, good morning. Thanks for the questions. I had two on Librela. Kristin, I think you said you expect Librela to be a blockbuster in ‘22. What have you seen with respect prescribing patterns for vets that have started to use the product? I mean has this displaced other products? Or are vets just diagnosing OA more? And can – and does the guidance for it being a blockbuster in ‘22 assume a U.S. launch? And then just as a quick follow-up to that, could you just go into more detail on the supply disruption that you mentioned for Librela? Is it an API issue or a factory issue? Just any more details that you could share there, that would be great. Thank you.
Kristin Peck: Sure. Sure. Thanks, Nathan. We are very excited at the trends we’re seeing in Librela in Europe. For starters, it is now the number one selling OA pain product in Europe, which is pretty incredible given it wasn’t even a full year in Europe. And what’s really exciting about that is we’re seeing 40% of the prescriptions of pets that are new to the category. So I think for a lot of pet owners who are worried about safety or efficacy of the previous portfolios, they really see this as really a game changer. And the people who have been on it, we’ve seen a 90% reorder rate from clinics and very high compliance. So once they are on it, really staying with it, which gives us great confidence as we look into 2022 that we can get Librela to be a blockbuster product. To your question about, does that assume a U.S. launch, it definitively does not assume a U.S. launch. We would not – with an approval late in the year, we would not be able to launch Librela in 2022. So that would hit blockbuster status just outside of the U.S. And as you look at some of the supply challenges, the inputs to Librela are the same inputs as you would make a human COVID vaccine. So we’ve been really thoughtful about where we launch and making sure we do market by market, ensure we can supply. We have had challenges intermittently just having to do with the fact that the inputs are the same. So I think our supply chain team has done a phenomenal job. I mean, as a matter of fact, we’re already the number one selling in OA pain, but we are really thoughtful about where we’re launching. A lot of those are getting addressed. The capacity and a lot of those component parts in human health have increased. So we become more confident every quarter we can do that. But that is what was driving some of the short-term intermittent supply challenges we had in Europe. But I think if you look at our obvious guidance for this year, we can clearly see if we’re going to hit $100 million that we’re pretty confident we can address those.
Wetteny Joseph: Yes. And I would just add with Librela in the fourth quarter, we were deliberate about holding back even new patients coming on. We just want to make sure that we can secure the inputs so that when it all comes on, they can stay on given that it’s chronic OA pain conditions. So – and we’ve been able to secure materials and be able to run, and we’re confident in in our forecasted demand here to be able to manufacture and deliver those.
Operator: The next question comes from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Erin Wright: Great, thanks. A question on the monoclonal antibody, can you speak to the pipeline outside of Solensia? And you have significant capacity there and you’ve entered multiple partnerships, including [indiscernible] products. How would you think about the targets there and the time line? And what’s next on that front? Do you see several monoclonal antibody launches for you over the next 3 to 5 years? And then on diagnostics, you mentioned increased focus internationally. And can you speak to how that strategy is progressing, I guess, both in the U.S. and internationally for reference lab as well as on point of care. And is international reference lab also on your radar screen? Thanks.
Kristin Peck: Thanks, Erin. Yes, if you look at the monoclonal antibody platform, we do see this very much as a platform for growth with Librela and Solensia being the second and third. As you know, we also have a Cytopoint. We are the only one with any monoclonal antibodies approved right now. So I do think we have a good head start. We do see this similar to what you see in human health with application across a number of diseases. So we have not been terribly public about that pipeline. I think we’ve talked about a few such as chronic kidney disease, etcetera. But obviously, in our world, our pipelines are not public, but we are very excited. We have invested in building significant capacity across monoclonal antibodies both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. in multiple facilities just given our excitement on the fact that this is a really important space. We do have a number of partnerships with human health companies and even some small animal health companies in this space. So we’re really excited at the pipeline and believe we can continue to launch new products, new mAbs over time. And I will let Wetteny take the diagnostic question.
Wetteny Joseph: Yes, we continue to be very excited about the diagnostics space with growth above the animal health space in general. If you look at 2021, we delivered 21% growth in diagnostics across the year and particularly when you look at – although we grew both across U.S. and international. And we’ve always said that international was the more level playing field where we look to be aggressive and we continue to make investments across field force, reference labs, etcetera, here. You’ve seen us innovate in this space with Imagyst, the first AI platform with – indication. We look at additional indications coming on there as well. And so we will continue to make those investments, and diagnostics is one of our key growth drivers as we look ahead.
Operator: We will go now to Jon Block with Stifel. Your line is open.
Jon Block: Thanks, guys. Good morning. It seems like you’re implying 2022 companion animal growth, roughly mid to high teens, a very solid growth rate. Maybe I can just put you guys a little bit on some of the key products, any specifics for Trio when we think about 2022 or call the Simparica franchise and/or the atopic derm franchise just maybe in terms of contribution to growth? And then a little bit of a follow-up. Those Librela – certainly the Librela numbers are really solid international numbers, add the gate where the medicalization rates are usually a lot lower. So Kristin, can you just comment, does this still hold where, longer term, this is still like a 70-30 U.S. international split in terms of revenue from those novel therapeutics when we look out a number of years? Thanks, guys.
Kristin Peck: Sure. I will start with your second question on just Librela, Solensia and international. They are solid. Look, we are really focused on increasing the medicalization and the adoption of new technologies outside the U.S. I think it’s been a key focus for Glenn David since he has moved into the international group. I mean as you know, there is a very similar number of animals in the U.S. and outside the U.S. And to your point, historically, the revenue splits have been quite different. But we are really looking at, especially in categories right now where we are the only product out there, derm is one, but even monoclonal OA pain, really thinking of unbranded, really seeing we can raise the standard of care, it’s a key focus for us as well on the diagnostics space, how we increase medicalization outside the U.S. I think it will evolve over time. And I am not sure when it gets to the equal number of animals. But really why we feel we have a lot of optimism international, if you think about some of the emerging markets, where they are adopting new technologies, and that curve is quite different. So, if you look at the increase in China, Brazil, across a number of emerging markets, they are really moving up that curve much, much more quickly. And we also see our belief that we can continue to do that in some of the key categories. And to your point and your first question, we continue to see growth potential in derm. We do not expect a competitor in 2022 in derm. Again, I don’t have any data, but you always ask me, why do I leave that, I mean based on just what I know today, we could obviously be wrong. So, we are going to invest aggressively as we have been doing in direct-to-consumer. We still believe there are 6 million untreated dogs in the U.S. alone who have itch and don’t have treatment. And if you saw the growth that we delivered in 2021 across derm, it’s 24% growth and already at over $1 billion, we still see growth in derm. Certainly in paras, we are going to aggressively grow that portfolio through direct-to-consumer advertising amongst other things in 2022 to make sure we have the highest share as we enter. I think the brand equity there has been really strong. So, we continue to see significant opportunities as well in paras. So – and I think you also can add in emerging markets across all these continuing to do really well. So, as we look at growth, obviously, growth will be led, as you referenced by our companion animal business in 2022. And I think what’s important is there is not one key platform that’s driving that. It is multiple. It is derm, it is paras, it is diagnostics, it’s mAbs, it’s emerging markets. So, we do think we have a range of platforms to continue to grow in 2022 and beyond.
Operator: We will go now to Chris Schott with JPMorgan.
Chris Schott: Great. Thanks so much for the questions. Just a follow-up on Librela and capacity in the U.S. launch. I guess by the time that drug is approved later this year, do you expect some of these issues will be addressed by then, or should we be thinking about either a gap between approval and rollout or a more targeted rollout as you are dealing with capacity? I am just trying to get a sense of is this something that’s the next few quarters that you are going to be addressing most of this, or is this going to be an ongoing kind of challenge given the kind of broader capacity demands in the industry out there? And then the second question, I was – just maybe a longer term operating margin question. And the guidance implies moderating – moderate kind of operating margin improvements in ‘22. As I think about longer term, do you see kind of a sustained period where we are going to see OpEx growth that’s kind of keeping up with overall sales growth so that you are seeing some margin improvement but not a ton, or do we think about a window where there is maybe a larger margin improvement cycle coming as we maybe think out to 2023 and beyond as maybe some of these initial investments on derm, Trio, etcetera, kind of start to plateau at some point in here? Thanks so much.
Wetteny Joseph: Yes, sure. Let me take both. So, going to your first question with respect to Librela, as we said in the prepared commentary, we continue to anticipate approval sometime late in 2022, that is hedging on an inspection that the FDA has to do at a facility outside the U.S. By the time this product gets approved and as we continue to leverage our global manufacturing footprint and our plans, we anticipate having the manufacturing capacity that we need to meet demand across the market. Now, we will certainly leverage our learnings from our launches outside the U.S. in terms of how we go about executing that with respect to early experience programs, etcetera. But at this point, we are confident in our ability to manufacture to meet customer commitments across that product when it gets approved. Now, going on to operating margins, as we have said, we see opportunity to really invest behind a number of areas to drive long-term sustainable growth. And we are doing so, whether you look at R&D, investments in our field force, for example, investments in advertising campaigns, DTC campaigns behind our brands that we can really drive growth in – particularly in areas where we have an advantage like being the only triple combination in the U.S. as we speak as well as in the derm area. As we do that, we will be aggressive, but we are mindful to grow the bottom line faster than the top line. And that may narrow the range that you see from time-to-time. But certainly, the business has the ability to continue to expand margins, and we have demonstrated that. But we are going to be aggressive about those opportunities when we see them, which may narrow that range. In terms of how long do we continue to see that, as long as we see the opportunity to continue to drive growth and grab more share, we will execute on those, but be mindful of that value proposition.
Operator: We will go now to Balaji Prasad with Barclays. Your line is open.
Balaji Prasad: Hi, good morning and congratulations on the quarter. Firstly, on the R&D pipeline, the innovations that you called out and the focus that you called out six, seven areas for innovation, I am not sure if I am reading too much into it, but I thought oncology pipeline was the same. I remember this being flagged as an important carrier in the past. Have you had a change of thought around oncology as a key area of innovation? And just on Librela, does your success in the first year drive you to revisit your thoughts around the longer term opportunity in the clinic pain market? You have called it out as a market which can potentially double over the next few years. Is there an upside risk to those numbers? Thank you.
Kristin Peck: Sure. As we talk about the pipeline, certainly oncology is in there. We don’t get very specific with regards to that. I don’t believe we have ever said anything specific with regards to oncology historically. It’s certainly an area we are looking at, but I would say some of the other focus areas we talked about, we used to think in the near-term will likely drive more value. As you look at Librela, as the outlook changed. I mean we think that taking a $400 million market that’s been established for a long time in doubling it is pretty aggressive. We are – we probably have more conviction in our ability to do that is what I would say just based on the first two full quarters that we have launched the product outside the U.S. So more confidence there and more confidence as well that we can take what is almost like a nonexistent market in the cat for Solensia and make that a $200 million. So, I am not sure we are willing to say above that. I think doubling a market as a pretty aggressive timeline – pretty aggressive there. But I do think our commitment and our conviction and our ability to do that and do it faster, certainly, I would say, is strong.
Operator: Our next question comes from Christine Rains with William Blair. Your line is open.
Christine Rains: Hi, congratulations and good morning. I am just hoping to have some more color about the Solensia rollout in Europe and how that can translate into the U.S. So, just kind of how are you reaching cat owners given the low medicalization of cats and the fact that cat owners don’t really bring their cats into the vet very often? And also, is this a vet-administered product or something pet owners can do at home via injection? Thanks.
Kristin Peck: Sure. The one thing we have done with Solensia was the learning from Cytopoint. Certainly, as you bring new technologies and create new markets, it starts with really with your KOLs. So our plan, as you probably saw in 2021, which was first start with early experience with some of the key opinion leaders in each of the markets to get them experience, to get them talking for general practitioners to be able to call them and sort of hear their experiences seeing videos. As you think about, you made a really good point you have seen with regards to pet owners. We are also trying to provide tools for pet owners to be able to know when their cat is in pain. Cats do a great job of hiding it. So, that’s really been a focus on videos to show them what it looks like, so they can sort of notice it, giving a big awareness campaign there and then helping vets understand how to make it easier for people to either bring their cats in or there is some now cat-only clinics or the ability to have vets go out and do injections or have technicians go out and do injections. We are not focused right now on having monoclonal antibodies being able to be done by consumers at their house. This is a pretty advanced technology. Our focus is really on helping to raise awareness, increase the medicalization and make treating these cats easier either at the clinic or at home. There is really no reason, for example, technician, once the vet that has seen it can’t do the monthly injection at home. So, we are just seeing really positive, but it takes a thoughtful creation of the market. And as I talked about before, that would be our plan in the U.S. as well. We will start with early experience, get that – get the KOLs talking, get things of able to be seeing multiple cats. And that really helps us, once you get in the GPs, ensure that they are using it and they know how to do it successfully. So, that is our plan as we think about it.
Operator: We will take the next question from Elliot Wilbur with Raymond James. Your line is open.
Elliot Wilbur: Thanks. Good morning. I guess just two questions for Kristin, specifically with respect to your outlook for the livestock segment in aggregate, anything you could say about growth expectations for the specific species and what – which of those may have more risk based on your current assumption than others? And then just switching gears to the international markets and specifically thinking about regions where you showed 20% plus or stronger growth, Chile, Italy, China, etcetera, can you just talk maybe a little bit more about the key drivers there? How much of the growth is coming from companion versus livestock? Which markets is the company over-performing? And what are the key drivers of that over-performance? Thanks.
Kristin Peck: Sure. Thanks, Elliot. I will take the first, and I will let Wetteny take your second one on some of the specific international markets. As we talk about livestock, first of all, it has been hit much harder with COVID than the pet care space. Pet care has actually been a beneficiary of COVID. And it’s, by its nature, a cyclical industry. So, it can go up and go down. Ultimately, we believe as you look at sort of once we get past the DRAXXIN and some of the other big product LOEs, it will go back to mid-single digit growth. But if you double-click that a little way, obviously, the biggest challenge for us specifically has been cattle, and that’s really been led by DRAXXIN, which overall last year declined by 15%, which was in line with our expectations. We expect in 2022 to have a 20% decline as we had a full year with generic competition there. But there is a lot of bright spots as you look at different species to your point. You look at fish, they grew 23% in 2021. We see that as a fast-growing species with really positive fundamentals. We think poultry, which grew last year 6%, maybe a little bit more challenged, obviously, in the U.S. with some of the generic competition there. But we are really excited about some of the innovative things that we are launching there. We saw swine last year at 4%. So, livestock is not one, as you know, and it obviously varies by market. And I think it’s important to sort of note as you look at international, it was growing in livestock significantly last year. So, if you really pull out the DRAXXIN effect. As we look at livestock, we do believe it will go back to, for us and for the industry, mid-single digits. For us, we have just got to get out of some of these near-term LOEs. We are also excited about our pipeline there, which we think, again, can drive incremental growth above the market as we launch innovation into that sector. So, I don’t know, Wetteny, you want to take some of the specifics on the international markets, emerging markets, Brazil, China.
Wetteny Joseph: Yes, absolutely. Look, one of the most remarkable things, at least in my first year here, that I have come to realize is what we are seeing in terms of trends on companion animal not just in the U.S., but we are seeing them across the emerging markets. Now if you step back, international is still about just over 50% of our international revenues, our livestock and companion animal is about just over 40%. However, the pace of growth that we are seeing across markets, I am comparing absolutely phenomenal. Markets like China that used to be mostly livestock is now about 50% companion animal. And elsewhere, even when we talk about Brazil, we are seeing a really great year across cattle, etcetera. Brazil is growing double digits in companion animal. So, we believe those trends – those same reasons that are driving growth for companion animal, where pet owners prioritize the health of their pets and are willing to spend more on them, we are seeing those across international markets and we see those outpacing growth versus livestock, although we have seen livestock growth in international markets, as Kristin mentioned. It was 8% growth in livestock in 2021 across our international markets. And if you look at species, fish, for example, is 100% of our fish business is outside the U.S. So, that’s one area of growth that we anticipate as well. So hopefully, that gives you some color looking across international.
Operator: The next question comes from Navann Ty with Citi. Your line is open.
Navann Ty: Hi, good morning. Could you discuss your expectation on vet staffing in the near-term and the potential impact on Zoetis Companion Animal segment, if any? And then I have a second question on Simparica Trio. Can you give us more details on the label expansion, how significant could be the new indications? Thank you.
Kristin Peck: Thanks so much. I will start with the vet staffing. They are sort of short-term and long-term. We did see something challenges in the U.S. in December and January, given absenteeism with COVID, and that was sort of short-term. So, as you look at trends overall in the U.S., we continue to see those to be strong with 8% revenue growth led by a 3% increase in traffic and spend per visit at 5%. Double clicking on that traffic 3%, we think, again, it will get back to sort of what are our more normal trends. There has been a challenge, as you mentioned, given there are so many more pets being seen, making sure that the staffing levels at both the vets and the technicians side remain strong. We are really focused on partnering with both the ADMA and the ADMC in the U.S. and honestly, around the globe to ensure there is a reliable supply of vets and vet technicians. But importantly as well, to make sure that the veterinary profession and vet clinics remain really attractive jobs, and so it’s really partnering with different organizations to make sure that, that is the case. I would say everyone is aligned here. I think you are seeing significant increases in compensation for many of these vets. We firmly believe that they are doing the right things to make sure that they can provide the great customer care and pet care that they need to. But obviously, it’s something that we are highly invested in partnering across the industry to make sure that pets get the care that they need and the staffing levels remain high. It is a challenge given the very quick growth in the number of pets that were adopted over the last 2 years. So, the challenge is there, but we are really confident that in partnership with many other companies, pharmaceutical companies as well as vet clinics and associations, we can ensure that the vets and the vet technicians can meet that need. Do you want to – there is a question on Trio label extensions in the future. I don’t think we have been specific about what we are looking at there and we wouldn’t just for competitive reasons.
Operator: The next question comes from Kathy Miner with Cowen. Your line is open.
Kathy Miner: Hi. Thank you. Just a couple of follow-up questions. First on Solensia and the U.S. launch, can you just clarify that the launch in the second half of this year is just a setup for getting education and preparation as opposed to any supply issues? And will you be coordinating the marketing with Librela in the U.S. once it gets approved? Second question, just to follow-up on the derm side of it, for 2022, I don’t think you said a growth target, but clearly, you have got to be pretty optimistic with no competition coming in for this year. Do you think that you could see growth get – matching the 2021 trends? And do your assumptions for the derm include a U.S. chewable or any feline options? Thank you.
Kristin Peck: Sure. So, with regards to Solensia, yes, we are focused when we think about the long-term to ensure that we start with early experience. We build that market, and we will obviously launch shortly thereafter. But we are not concerned there on a supply issue. The plans that we have assume supply for exactly what we are planning on doing. So, that is not what’s driving that one. And derm in 2022, we continue to expect robust growth obviously with – right now, as we talked about, we are not expecting competition next year, of course, we could be wrong, but we are not. And therefore, we will invest aggressively, not just in the U.S., but outside the U.S. That does not, to your question, assume that we have Apoquel chewable in the U.S. and nor does that number that we are talking about in derm assume that we are having it for cat. So, we really believe with Apoquel, Cytopoint, Apoquel chewable outside the U.S., we can continue to drive robust growth in 2022 across the category.
Operator: This will conclude our Q&A session. It is now my pleasure to hand the program back to Kristin Peck for any additional or closing remarks.
Kristin Peck: Great. Look, thank you, everyone, for your questions and your continued interest in Zoetis. Just to summarize, I am really proud of what Zoetis delivered in 2021, having our best year ever. And we see that positive momentum really continuing into 2022, as I think you heard today from both Wetteny and myself, we will continue to build on our diverse global portfolio and really our strength in pet care, diagnostics and emerging markets to grow faster than the market in 2022 and beyond. And we are committed to the investments in talent, technology, manufacturing and innovation that will spur our future growth. So, thanks so much, everybody, and talk to you soon.
Operator: This does conclude today’s program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-11-04 08:30:00) =====

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for your questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions]. If at any point your question has been answered, you may remove yourself from the queue while pressing the pound key. In the interest of time, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and then queue up again with any follow-ups. Your line will be muted when you complete your question. [Operator Instructions]. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.
Steve Frank: Thank you, Operator. Good morning, everyone. And welcome to the Zoetis Third Quarter 2021 Earnings call. I am joined today by Kristin Peck, our Chief Executive Officer and Wetteny Joseph, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projection. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statement in today's press release and our SEC filings including, but not limited to our annual report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q.  Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures which were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or US GAAP. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable US GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release, and in the Company's 8-K filing dated today, Thursday, November 4th, 2021. We also cite operational results which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. With that, I will turn the call over to Kristin.
Kristin Peck: Thank you, Steve, and welcome everyone to our third quarter earnings call. We delivered strong results. Again, this quarter with 10% operational growth in both revenue and adjusted net income driven by our innovative portfolio of petcare parasiticides and dermatology products. Our US business grew revenue 7% operationally, while international grew revenue 14% operationally. In terms of species, our Companion Animal portfolio generated 19% operational revenue growth in the quarter with great performance in markets around the world. Our latest innovation in parasiticides, the triple combination Simparica Trio is increasing its global adoption. Our groundbreaking dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint, continue to redefine and expand the category.  And we completed the first full quarter of sales for both of our new monoclonal antibody therapies for osteoarthritis pain in dogs and cats, Librela and Solensia. These new products are exceeding expectations and receiving very positive feedback from veterinarians and pet owners in European markets, where they've been launched. When you add all of this to our growth in diagnostics for Companion Animals, I see our business continuing to capitalize on the positive demographics for pets. Increased spending on pet wellness and treatment will be sustainable well beyond the pandemic. And our portfolio and pipeline habits well-positioned to continue leading and innovating in this market. Livestock product sales continue to present a more complex picture for the industry and Zoletis with market dynamics vary widely by species and geographies. As we expected, our livestock portfolio declined 2% operationally in the third quarter, largely due to generic competition across, cattle, poultry, and swine and most significantly in the US We have taken proactive strategies to protect these product lines, including the introduction of a lifecycle innovation like drafting KP. But pricing pressure remains due to the increasing effects of generic competition. On the positive side, we saw 7% operational growth for livestock and international as markets like Brazil, Chile, and other emerging markets performed well.  Our long-term advantage in livestock continues to be our diverse portfolio and strength across geographies and product categories like medicines, vaccines, and medicated feed additives. We also continue to invest in R&D programs that align with our customers long-term needs for more efficient and sustainable production methods, which can be built anew therapies, analytics and digital solutions. We remain on track for a record setting year with updated guidance for operational revenue growth in the range of 14% to 14.5% and adjusted net income growth in the range of 16.5% to 18% for 2021.  Our major catalyst for growth has performed well this year and have more runway ahead for 2022 and beyond. And when do we make the right investments and continue successfully executing our growth strategies. Our strength in petcare has an incredibly strong foundation across parasiticide, dermatology and vaccine. To the first 9 months of 2021, our Companion Animal portfolio has grown 29% operationally. We also remain very excited about the long-term blockbuster potential of our new monoclonal antibody franchises in pain, Librela and Solensia, as they grow in Europe and we make progress on approvals in the US We currently expect approval of Solensia in the US in the first half of 2022, with Librela remaining more likely in the second half.  Our revenue growth in international markets has been 20% operationally to the first 9 months, driven by China, Brazil, and other emerging markets. We continue to expect growth to come across both our Companion Animal and livestock portfolios in these markets. Finally, our diagnostics portfolio remains a key catalyst for growth with 28% operational growth through the first 9 months. We are gaining significant traction with our expansion of the point-of-care portfolio in markets outside the US We always believed international expansion was one of the biggest value drivers for the Abaxis acquisition once we combine that portfolio with the global Zoetis footprint.  The acceleration of international growth for diagnostics is a very positive sign and continues gaining momentum. We also recently added digital cytology testing to our VetScan images platform in the US, UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. This means we can now offer a network of expert remote pathologists, in addition to artificial intelligence technology for fecal testing. We're seeing our strongest early adoption of VetScan images in Germany, Australia, Spain, and the UK. And we will continue developing additional applications for the platform over time. In addition to our ongoing investments in R&D programs and direct-to-consumer campaigns, we are investing in manufacturing capacity to meet increasing demands for our new parasiticide products and monoclonal antibody therapies.  Expansions are underway at our sites in Kalamazoo, Michigan, Lincoln, Nebraska, and Tullamore, Ireland. All of these are significant multiyear projects to ensure we have ongoing reliable supply, while maintaining a diverse global network of third-party contract manufacturers that give us the greatest flexibility and redundancy. Our supply chain team has done an excellent job over the last two years to optimize inventory levels of key products, while minimizing the impact of a challenging global supply landscape. We continue to carefully monitor and manage our supply chain and inventories.  And finally, before I hand things off to Wetteny, I wanted to note our recent news about changes in our R&D leadership team. Long-time R&D leader, Cathy Knupp will be retiring at the end of the year and ensuring a smooth transition through February. I am very grateful to Cathy for building the most innovative and productive R&D organization in the animal health industry. And for leaving us with a rich pipeline of future innovations and R&D talent, which includes her successor, Rob Polzer. Robin has been with Zoletis since 2015. Working on many of the innovations that have come to market recently in parasiticides and monoclonal antibodies.  He has experienced running our global therapeutics and biologic R&D organization and is the right leader for the future of innovation at Zoetis. In closing, I want to thank our colleagues for delivering another great quarter and bringing the value of Zoetis to our customers every day. We are confident in the updated guidance we have provided and see the fundamental growth drivers of our business continuing into 2022 and beyond. Now, let me hand things over to Wetteny.
Wetteny Joseph: Thank you, Kristin and good morning, everyone. The focus of my comments today will be on our third quarter financial results, the contributing factors that drove our performance and an update of our improved full-year 2021 guidance. In the third quarter, we generated revenue of $2 billion, growing 11% on a reported basis, and 10% operationally. Adjusted net income of $597 million was an increase of 14% on a reported basis and 10% operationally. Operationally revenue grew 10% with 2% from price and 8% from volume. Run growth is comprised of 5% from new products, including Simparica Trio, and 3% from our online portfolio, primarily our key dermatology franchise. Now let's dive further into the details of the quarter.  Companion Animal products again led the way in terms of species growth, growing 19% operationally, with livestock declining 2% operationally in the quarter. Our parasiticide portfolio made the largest contribution to Companion Animal growth driven by sales of Simparica Trio and continues strength across our broader portfolio including the Proheart franchise, Simparica, and Revolution Stronghold Plus. We also saw robust growth in our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint. Simparica Trio had another exceptional quarter posting revenue of $122 million, representing operational growth of 140% versus the comparable 2020 period, with year-to-date sales of $350 million.  We believe the global fleet second hardware market will continue to expand and that our broad and innovative portfolio, which were 32% operationally in the quarter has us well-positioned to capture share and outpace our competitors. Global sales of our key dermatology products were $321 million in the quarter, growing 26% operationally. Total sales exceeded $300 million for the first time in Company history. And we remain ahead of schedule to surpass $1 billion in dermatology sales for the year. Our diagnostics portfolio had operational sales growth of 7% in Q3 against a very challenging comparative period as the third quarter of 2020 had a sharp increase in wellness visits following wide fill clinic closures in the second quarter.  Our International Diagnostics portfolio performed very well, which as Kristin mentioned, was a key component for the strategic rationale of the Abaxis acquisition. Diagnostics remains the key growth driver for Zoetis, and we will continue to make significant investments in new technology, expand our reference [Indiscernible] footprint, as well as provide flexible solutions to our customers. Our equine products delivered strong results with operational sales growth of 20% in the quarter as horse shows and racing return to pre-pandemic levels and field growth in vaccines, as well as nutritional and pain products.  The expected decline in livestock in the quarter was primarily driven by our US cattle and US poultry businesses as our international segment delivered operational growth across all species. Globally, our cattle business declined 5% operationally in the quarter driven by the impact of generic competition for DRAXXIN and a difficult comparative quarter resulting from COVID-19 dynamics and earlier fall cattle run in the US in the third quarter of 2020. Poultry also declined in the quarter as producers in the US rotated to lower-cost alternatives to our premium products as a result of current market dynamics. Sales were also negatively impacted by generic competition of Zoamix and BMD, our alternatives to antibiotics in medicated feed additives.  The decline in cattle and poultry offset the growth in fish. Swine was essentially flat in the quarter as decline in the US, primarily from pricing pressure on our anti-infective and vaccine portfolio as a result of generic competition, offset the growth internationally from further key account expansion. Overall, we delivered another strong quarter, bench marked against a very difficult prior-year comparative period on both the Companion Animal and livestock sides of our business. Now, let's discuss the revenue growth by segment for the quarter. US quarterly revenue exceeded $1 billion for the second consecutive quarter, with revenue growth of 7%. Sales of Companion Animal products grew 17%, and lifestyle product sales declined by 13%.  For Companion Animal, Petcare trends continued to be robust. Vet clinic revenue and patient visits grew again this quarter against growth rates from the third quarter of last year, which were well above historical levels. Our view remains unchanged that certain trends will moderate, but we remain above pre-pandemic levels. Growth in US Companion Animal was led by our parasiticides portfolio and our key dermatology products. Simparica Trio continues to perform well, with US sales of $110 million and year-to-date sales north of $300 million.  This quarter is also an excellent representation of our commitment to invest in the broader parasiticide portfolio as we launched the targeted DTC campaign for Proheart and prevalent heartworm geographies. Key dermatology sales were $270 million in the US for the quarter, growing 20% with significant growth for Apoquel and Cytopoint. US diagnostic sales grew 2% in the quarter, which as I mentioned earlier had a very difficult comparative period. However, year-to-date performance has been strong at 23% growth. US livestock sales declined 13% in the quarter.  Our US cattle business faced the comparative period that's a robust growth at third quarter performance of 2020 benefited from an early for cattle run and pent-up demand work its way through the system. In addition, generic competition had not entered the market in the third quarter of 2020. Our generic defense strategy has been successful as we have been able to maintain a greater volume share of the [Indiscernible] market than originally expected. Although additional generics will likely enter the market in the coming quarters. From an end market perspective, producer profitability remains challenged by input costs, primarily feed and labor.  US poultry sales declined in the quarter as smaller flocks resulted in lower disease pressure, allowing producers to expand usage of lower-cost alternatives through our highly efficacious premium products. In addition, generic competition is creating pricing pressure on our Zoamix NBNT franchises. To summarize, our US operations delivered another strong quarter driven by our innovative and robust Companion Animal products along with petcare and markets, displaying very strong fundamentals. The near-term weakness in our US livestock business has been expected and has been more than offset by the strengthened Companion Animal, which demonstrate the importance of diversification across species.  Now, turning to our international segment. Revenue of our International segment grew 14% operational in the quarter with Companion Animal revenue growing 24%, and livestock revenue growing 7% operationally. In the second half of 2020, we saw a material uptick in medicalization rates and standard of care by pet owners, a trend which has continued through the third quarter of this year. We entered and made significant investments in advertising promotion to capitalize on favorable market conditions and drive growth. Companion Animal achieved broad-based growth internationally in the quarter, led by strong performance of our key dermatology products.  Through 3 quarters of 2021, year-to-date sales are in excess of total sales on the entire prior year. In addition, we are in the early stages of a DTC campaign for key dermatology, which we expect will create additional demand for our products. Paracitisides had a strong quarter internationally, led by significant growth in the Simparica franchise, which benefited from DTC campaigns and drove growth in Brazil, Eastern Europe, and Latin America. Librela our monoclonal antibody for alleviation of [Indiscernible] pain in dogs, has done extremely well, generating $15 million in quarterly sales in a select number of markets.  Feedback from veterinarians and pet owners on the quality-of-life improvement for the patients has been extremely encouraging. Our feline monoclonal antibody for alleviation of [Indiscernible] pain Solensia, had positive feedback from the early experience programs in Q2 and launched in the EU this quarter. [Indiscernible] in cats is a significant unmet need in animal health and our view is that Solensia will become a blockbuster product, with the pain market for cats becoming approximately a $200 million global category overtime. Our international diagnostics portfolio grew 20% operationally in the quarter, with significant growth in consumable and instrument revenue. And strong growth across a number of geographies such as the UK, Australia, China, and various other markets.  Moving onto livestock, our international business again delivered growth across all species, led by strong operational growth in cattle and fish. Cattle growth in the quarter was driven by further key account penetration and favorable export market conditions in Brazil, in several other emerging markets. Our fish portfolio continues to perform very well, growing 21% operationally. Growth in our fish portfolio was primarily the result of increased sales of our Alpha Flux Sea lice treatment product, as well as strong growth in vaccines. Performance in swine and poultry were also fueled by growth in key accounts, as well as overall market growth, primarily emerging markets.  At a market level view for international segment, all major markets grew operational in the third quarter with the exception of France, which was essentially flat in Q3. Emerging markets was again a key contributor to our international performance, led by Brazil, which was 22% on an operational basis. As we expected, growth in China slowed in the third quarter as lower pork prices challenged with this or profitability. However, the Companion Animal business in China, which grew double-digits once again, offset the weakness in swine. Overall, total emerging markets has grown significantly in both the quarter and on a year-to-date basis. Our international segment again delivered strong results of robust growth in Companion Animal and growth across all species in livestock.  On a year-to-date basis, our international segment has grown 20% operationally with our Companion Animal and livestock businesses, each growing double-digits. While following pork prices in China are creating a headwind that is moderating growth in swine, it is more than offset by the growth across other species and markets for the demonstrating the importance of our diversity across species and geography.  Now moving on to the rest of the P&L. Adjusted gross margin of 70.7% increased 110 basis points on a reported basis compared to the prior year as favorable product mix for an exchange, low inventory charges and price were partially offset by higher manufacturing costs, freight and distribution costs. Adjusted operating expenses increased 19% operationally, with SG&A expenses growing 20% operationally resulting from increased compensation-related costs, as well as increased advertising and promotion expense, freight, and T&E. Our [Indiscernible] expenses were 17% operationally driven by higher project spend.  The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 16.7%, a decrease of 330 basis points due to favorable changes to the jurisdictional mix of earnings including increased favorability related to foreign derived and tangible income, and an increase in favorable discrete items compared to the prior year's comparable third quarter. Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS grew 10% operationally for the quarter, primarily driven by revenue growth, gross margin expansion, and a lower effective tax rate.  Our liquidity position remains very healthy. And in the third quarter were $3.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents following a $600 million repayment of long-term debt in August. Our financial flexibilities in a very strong position, which allows us to make meaningful investments in our business while returning excess cash to shareholders, as demonstrated by our repurchase of Zoetis shares of approximately $200 million in the quarter. Now, moving on to our updated guidance for 2021 through a raising and narrowing as a result of our performance in the third quarter and confidence in our ability to deliver sustainable future growth. Please note that our guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of mid-October.  For revenue, we are raising and narrowing our guidance range with projected revenue now between $7.7 billion and.$7.75 billion and operational revenue growth between 14% and 14.5% for the full-year versus the 12.5% to 13.5% in our August guidance. Adjusted SG&A expense for the year are expected to be between $1.91 billion and $1.94 billion versus $1.87 billion and $1.91 billion in our prior guidance.  The guidance rate largely represents additional compensation-related costs, as well as increased advertising and promotion spend to support growth of new products and key franchises. Adjusted net income is now expected to be in the range of $2.2 billion and $2.225 billion, representing operational growth of 16.5% to 18% compared to our prior guidance of 13% to 15%. Adjusted diluted EPS is now expected to be in the range of $4.62 to $4.67, and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.23 to $4.29. Now, to summarize, before we move to Q&A.  Three quarters, we've delivered strong operational top and bottom-line growth with revenue growing 17% operationally. And again, raised and narrowed our full-year 2021 guidance. We have achieved significant growth across our key franchises and are extremely excited about our new product launches, and product pipeline. Now, I hand things over to our operator to open the line for your questions. Operator.
Operator: And at this time, [Operator Instructions]. Again, in the interest of time, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and re-queue again with any follow-ups, your line will be muted when you complete your question. Today's first question comes from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Michael Ryskin: Great. Thanks for taking the question, guys and congrats on a strong quarter and raised the guide. I want to start on DRAXXIN real quick. You touched on generic impact in US livestock a number of times in your remarks, we assume that's predominantly from DRAXXIN. Can you give us an update if you're seeing any stabilization there or are you expecting for the headwinds in 4Q '22 or 4Q or 2022 or given those trends improve and stabilize from here?
Wetteny Joseph: Yes. Thank you. We were very pleased to deliver another strong quarter and position to raise a guidance once again for the year. With respect to DRAXXIN, as expected, we continue to see the effect of the LOE and DRAXXIN was down about $15 million in the quarter. Now, our defense strategy here is working well and we are largely maintaining our market share although that does have the effect on price. So, we're very pleased with how the product is performing as well as DRAXXIN KP in terms of maintaining largely the market share from a volume perspective here. As we look forward, we are expecting further generic competitors to come into this space from a DRAXXIN perspective, and that we believe will continue into next year as well.
Kristin Peck: And the only thing I would add there, as we said, this is completely in line with our expectations, not just that we gave this year, but that we've been talking about when the generic enters. We generally said it takes somewhere between 20% to 40% over a number of years. We said in the beginning of this year that that would likely be a little faster and we're on track to be doing that. We expect probably somewhere around a 20% head-on price for us on this product in the year. So, in line with the expectations, Mike.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Louise Chen with Cantor. Please go ahead.
Louise Chen: Hi. Thanks for taking my question here. So, as we start to think about 2022, what are some of the pushes and pulls hereperce for example, will recovery from food services and restaurants be a tailwind in 2022 for livestock? And what else should we be thinking about? Thank you.
Kristin Peck: Thanks, Louise. We are really excited for a number of the growth drivers that we saw this year, which we really think will continue into next year. I think our strength in parasiticide, our strength in derm, I mean, that will be a billion dollars this year growing at 26% in the quarter. Diagnostics, again, year-to-date, 28%, we think continues into next year, really strong performance in our emerging markets. China, Brazil, and other emerging, which I think will continue into next year, not to mention our pain monoclonal antibodies. So, I think we have a lot of the growth drivers this year that we think will continue into next year.  I mean, obviously things we're going to watch for next year, there could be headwinds for us. Could be the timing of competition for potential product against Apoquel or Simparica Trio, as Wetteny mentioned in his remarks, we're not really expecting that until the second half of 2022. Again, we don't have great visibility into that. Obviously, we think [Indiscernible], once we lap some of this draft and impact that will lessen as a real headwind for us. But overall, we really think that durable growth drivers you saw this year really continue into next year and we're pretty confident about that.
Operator: We will take our next question from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Nathan Rich: Thanks so much. If I can maybe follow up on the revenue outlook, Wetteny, for 4Q. I think historically 4Q has been a bit of a stronger quarter. You mentioned the competition on DRAXXIN. Is there any other dynamic that we should have in mind in terms of the revenue cadence for the fourth quarter? And I guess, with the focus on inflation and cost pressures in the market, do you feel like you've seen any pre-buying of products or stocking up from customers in either the livestock or companion business. Thank you.
Wetteny Joseph: Yes. Sure. Look, we continue to see really strong underlying market dynamics overall. And our portfolio is really well-positioned and continues to perform very well against those dynamics. As we discussed on the prior earnings call, what we're seeing in terms of growth rates in the second half of this year is more reflection of how the phasing occurred last year versus this year, given our position in the market. Again, the strong market dynamics that we continue to face here. If you look at last year, the second half had almost 17% more revenue in the back half in the first half of last year.  And so that's really what's driving the comp here. Those are the phasing of last year where this year is a little bit more normalized. As Kristin just referenced, we see a number of growth drivers for us, not only from the overall market, but also our portfolio across [Indiscernible], as we look at pain, diagnostics as well, with the one area -- the area that we're watching, including DRAXXIN. To your point around inflation, is you know given our portfolio and innovative products that we have and demand we see for those products, they position us well to take price. And you saw a 2% price in the quarter included in 10% operational growth.  And we'll continue to look at opportunities to continue to do that as we go into next year, you saw in the quarter our gross margins actually expanded by 110 basis points versus last year Q3, and so that despite some headwinds in the areas of freight, etc. So, we'll continue to monitor those and take price where we can give the innovative products that we bring to the market [Indiscernible]
Operator: And our next question is from Jon Block with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Jon Block: Great. Thanks, guys. Good morning. See if I can [Indiscernible] a couple. The first on livestock and quite honestly was pleasantly surprised by the international livestock up 7% operationally. There's just a lot of noise out there with other companies and swine chatter. So, I guess the first question is, was that a clean number? No pull forwards and maybe just talk to this market overall, do you still view it as a low single-digit grower for you this year with eventual improvement to mid-single-digit in call it '22/'23? And then just a pivot, Kristin or Wetteny.  I know we're not going to get a 2022 guide, but maybe conceptually at a high level, how do we think of '22 in terms of a year where the delta -- how do we think about the delta between revenue and EPS growth? And I guess where I'm going with this is a lot of innovation for you where you're still dominating the market. So conceptually, do we just think about it as another year of spending, supporting the portfolio of DTC where the delta between those 2 revenues -- revs and EPS might be a little bit tighter than prior years? And sorry for the long-winded questions. Thanks.
Kristin Peck: Sure. I'll take the first part of the question then I will let Wetteny take the second half, Jon. Livestock is a complex picture. So, I think your insight is quite well-founded. In the sense of not just the difference between US and international, but the difference between the specie. So, as you rightly mentioned, the US was down significantly in livestock and that's pretty much generic competition against DRAXXIN, Zoamix and some other products that we mentioned before. But to your point, international was up 7% and that was still with a really rough time in China as you saw in the quarter with China livestock down about 10%, but more than made up for by China's Companion Animal.  And really it has to do with the mix between species that are growing quite quickly for us like fish, cattle, and poultry, maybe struggling but you look at strong growth in emerging markets, which is what's really booing livestock. And as we've said in previous quarters, how US livestock goes does not mean how overall lifestyle goes. So, I think we really, the diversity of our portfolio across species, across geographies continues to really be one of the strengths for us at least. And we do think overall you'll see a flat to low single-digit growth overall across the Company for us in livestock, that maybe a little bit slower than the market, as we said, because of DRAXXIN and some of the key LOEs that we have.  And ultimately, once we lap some of those LOEs, we think you do go back in '23, '24 to a mid-single-digit exactly where we've always been. So, the historic growth of livestock is around 4%. And as we said, we think it absolutely returns there. And what's the reason to believe? Well, if we're growing international in the quarter at 7%, and really the US is mostly getting hit by the generic. Once we lap those, we do believe you can get back to a livestock growth in the sort of mid-single digits, the way it historically has been. But I'll Wetteny take your second question.
Wetteny Joseph: Yes. As we've discussed just before here, we're well-positioned, going out of this year into next year, to continue to sustain growth beyond this year. In terms of how you might see things flow through the P&L, our long-term value proposition is to grow adjusted net income faster than revenue. We don't see any reason to depart from that. However, given the opposition across a number of really key brands and demand that we see, we'll take the opportunity to invest behind those brands to drive DTC by other awareness campaigns, etc. We're also are investing in R&D, as well as Diagnostics and other areas that we believe will help us accelerate and enhance growth going forward. So that may, at times, cause that difference to be a little bit tighter as you said, from time to time, but it's to drive that growth -- that enhanced level of growth that we see, given the opportunity that we see in the market.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Erin Wright: Okay. Thanks. Can you provide us any metrics on the contributions from Librela and Solensia in the quarter or any metrics around reorder rates of the products in certain markets and how the launch is progressing relative to your expectations at this point in the expected timeline again for the US launch. And then second, just more broadly on Companion Animal trends. Any monthly metrics you can give us over the course of the quarter and kind of what's expected for the fourth quarter and beyond in terms of the underlying demand trends across that market? Thanks.
Wetteny Joseph: We continue to be very pleased with the performance of Librela and Solensia in the European markets where we've launched the product. The feedback has been very, very strong from vet and pet owners as well. We saw $50 million of revenue from Librela in the quarter and about $2 million from Solensia. Again, really the first full quarter of those products being in those select markets for us. In terms of where we're expecting approval for next year and we continue to expect approval for Librela as Kristin mentioned, in the first half of the year.
Kristin Peck: Solensia.
Wetteny Joseph: I'm sorry. Solensia in the first half. Sorry about that.
Kristin Peck: No worries.
Wetteny Joseph: Solensia in the first half. With Librela, more likely in the second half of the year in the US.
Kristin Peck: And I'll take the second half of your question, Erin, with regards to US Companion Animal trends. We don't have the monthly data, but just putting some of this in context, we believe that we look at the data overall right now. We're seeing overall vet clinic revenue growing 7%, which is higher than the historical rate. It's been a little bumpy over the year. I mean, weather, lots of different dynamics have been driving it. You saw 8% in Q1, 14% in Q2., we are seeing 7%. The way we sort of see this is, we think it overall will be higher than historical norms. Is it -- is the double-digit that you saw consistently in 2020?  No, but I don't think -- we saw very weak as you saw in Q1 and there's a huge bounce back in the second half as we saw last year, we do think that revenue at that clinic will continue to grow above historical rates. We're not really sure, as I said last quarter that we think that's going to be double-digit, but historically it grew 5 to 6. Is it going to be 7 to 8? I think our view is it will still be stronger than normal, but maybe not in the double-digits overall. But I mean, its still seeing strength, if you -- anyone of you who have been trying to get an appointment for your dog or your cat at the vet, it's pretty challenging to get one. So mostly because the demand really does remain high there.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan, please go ahead.
Chris Schott: Great. Thanks so much for the questions. I just -- my question on the derm portfolio, you've built a billion-dollar franchise here, but it's really about competition coming in 2022 or beyond. What are you anticipating in terms of the impact that a competitor launch could have? I think historically you've talked about a second entry, more building the market than maybe directly cannibalizing your existing business. But I guess as you've had a longer window of time to develop this, do we reach a point where that competitive launch, I guess, more impacts your growth versus -- I guess the heart of the question is, how much more room is there for market expansion as a new player comes in? Thanks so much.
Kristin Peck: Sure, thanks Chris. Yes, I mean, our derm portfolio has continued to grow and I think what we've really discovered is there still a large number of untreated animals out there. So, if you look at, we still believe there are 7,000,000 dogs that are diagnosed with some form of itchiness that are still not being treated. We do believe there's significant market growth. There's still geographic expansion. We've really invested heavily in direct-to-consumer advertising to grow this market. People are home more with their pets.  They're spending more time. So, I think people are really starting to notices itch and bothering them more maybe than it did historically. So, they are seeking help. We've also really invested in programs such as in the US are Petcare rewards program, which it making customers loyal to our product. So, we have been expecting competition to be frank. We probably thought it would've happened before now, but we think there's lots of rooms to continue to grow this market. And so, will it remain at 26% of you saw in the quarter? Our growth might go down a little bit, but I still think this will be a growing market for us, just given the large number of untreated dogs in the US and around the globe.
Operator: And our next question comes from Balaji Prasad with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Balaji Prasad: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for questions. Main focus on China, but the [Indiscernible] and it's because you often spoken about China as a major market, understandably. Can you help us understand the expectation that are in the market and any comparative range of prizes that you think this market would support? And also, far behind would applicable to be in terms of getting introduced are launched in China. Thank you.
Wetteny Joseph: Yeah, I'll start and see what Kristin what's to add here with respect to China. As expected, we saw growth decelerate in China this quarter with about 1% growth in the quarter but keep in mind, China has actually grown 35% on a year-to-date basis. We're up against a very solid comparative on last year where we saw 63% growth in the quarter. And swine was actually up 159% in the same quarter last year. Again, the pricing dynamics [Indiscernible] which we discussed on the last call started about mid-June.  And so, we expected to see sort of decline in the pork area. Now, the other part of your question is long-term. What do we expect in the market? We do see continued opportunity to grow substantially in China over time as we bring more and more robotics to the market. But also, if you look at what's happened since African swine fever, you see a concentration more on larger producers versus backyard forms, and we think that [Indiscernible] well in terms of whole medicalization over time, as well for our premium products with respect to swine.  And then on the Companion Animal side, we continue to see really robust growth in China. In Companion Animal, we saw double-digit growth this quarter. And Companion Animal which obviously was partly offset by the swine. So long term, we continue to expect really solid growth in China, which is our second largest market, driven by the market dynamics that we discussed. Although there may be cycles that we'll see in swine as we're going through right now from a pricing standpoint.
Kristin Peck: The only thing that I could add to that, is we obviously have launched Apoquel there. It is doing well, it is growing. This is a specialty product in a market that's traditionally been mostly a primary care generalist market. So, we're really excited to grow that. And I think we have a very strong pipeline of products coming into China and new innovation that we're going to be bringing in just like we brought in Apoquel, the approval right now for Cytopoint, which has not yet launched there. And honestly lots of products behind that we're really excited to be launching in China. So, we -- it is our second largest market. We do think it's going to continue to have very strong growth. As Wetteny said, with our year-to-date at 35%, we're really bullish on our ability to continue to grow in China.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Scala with Cowen. Please go ahead.
Steve Scala: Thank you. I have a question on Librela and Solensia in Europe. There are several parts of the question. Are owners are returning monthly for the next injection or is the time between injections longer than that? What is the average patient cost of each injection? And just to clarify, I think you said Solensia in cash is $200 million opportunity. Why is that? Why is that only $200 million? Why isn't it multiples of that? Thank you.
Kristin Peck: Sure. Again, I can start there. We are really pleased with Librela and yes, we are seeing animals return. I don't have the specific number of days that they're coming back. We can certainly look into that and see if we can get that data for you. It is priced at a premium to both Rimadyl, as well as to Gala plans on the market, so given it has a phenomenal, both safety and efficacy profile, it has been priced at a premium. The price obviously varies from market-to-market, so I don't think we have that overall information. With regards to the second part of your answer on Solensia, half is it quite different markets.  So, although today the market in dogs is 400 and we believe we can double it. The market is actually pretty higher to size in cats. There are very few approved products out there today to treat cats, so I hardly even say what it is. It's not zero, maybe tens of millions, it's certainly not hundreds of millions of dollars. And cats are less medicalized than dogs. So, you really have to first medicalize those cats. You have to be able to -- cats like to hide their pain. So, you also have to find a way that pet owners can notice pain in cats better and identify it and bring them to the vet.  So, the reason we've said it's a smaller market is, the number of cats that are medicalized are just smaller, and then the number that are actually treated is really small. So, the first thing is you need to be able to identify [Indiscernible] with pet owners, convince them to take their cats to the vet and build a market from scratch. Cat owners, when they used to call the vet when their cat was severing from pain, from osteoarthritis. We're told it really wasn't anything. There's no product in the US, for example, whatsoever.  So, it's really about retraining pet owners that there is a product that can meet their cat sneeze, and helping vets really bring the cat into the vet. A lot of pet owners don't like putting their cats in crates to bring them to the vet as you probably know. But we're very confident that we have a strong pipeline for cats that will increasingly medicalized cats’ overtime and helped build this market. But as we said, just given the number of medicalized cats will be a smaller market than the dog space. And it will likely take a little longer to build it.
Operator: And our next question comes from Christine Rains with William Blair. Please go ahead.
Christine Rains: Hi. Congrats on a great quarter and good morning. My question is that we noticed that Trio declined sequentially for the first time, so I was just hoping to have some color on this and how it's performing versus your expectations. Thanks.
Wetteny Joseph: Sure. Look, we saw another strong quarter across our parasiticide franchise. Small animal parasiticide grew about 32% in the quarter with $391 billion. We've had Trio sales of $122 million, $350 million so far through this year on a year-to-date basis. The part that continues to do extremely well, particularly in our large corporate accounts, where the penetration rates about 90% and we're seeing about 80% of the order rates as well. So, we continue to gain share in this very large market.  If you recall, last year we launched the product, and so we've now -- without lapping it. And in terms of parasiticides, a sort of seasonality starts to play into [Indiscernible] in terms of what you might see as well. So, this is really in line with our expectations and we couldn't be more pleased with how the product is doing in the market. And now that we've really penetrated well with the large corporate accounts, we're now going into some of the mid-size accounts as well. So, we continue to see the product gain momentum and again, in line with our expectations.
Operator: Your next question comes from Navaan Ty with Citi. Please go ahead.
Navaan Ty : Good morning. Can you share your stats of pet ownership going forward and average revenue per Companion Animal visit? And apologies if I missed them. And can I quickly ask are you able to comment on the EU Commission investigation to the Belgian office? I understand it was related to anti-trust allegation. Thank you.
Kristin Peck: Sure. I'll start with your question with regards to the investigation and then Wetteny can take the second half of your question on Companion Animal. On the [Indiscernible] inspection pertains to the [Indiscernible] decision to discontinue the clinical development of a single experimental drug candidate. We're working with the EC to ensure it has all the necessary information that it needs. And we are confident that we can align the concerns which are prompted the investigation. So, I think your second part of the question was on Companion Animal trends. The 7% which was broken up between 3% on traffic and 4% on spend per visit, but I don't know Wetteny if you've got any comments on that?
Wetteny Joseph: Yeah, sure. As Kristin mentioned, we saw 7% revenue growth for vet with about -- with visits up 3% and a revenue per visit up about 4%. And that's up against a prior year where we saw real increase in the third quarter in terms of vet visits, etc., given the effects of the pandemic. We continue to expect that these statistics will continue to be above pre-pandemic levels, or they would moderate from their peaks. Other -- two other important points to recall here is that if you look at pet ownership or more, we're seeing millennials and Gen-Z bring pets into their homes, and they are doing a lot more research and looking at petcare and wellness, and they are willing to spend more on their pets. So, the increase in pet ownership, we expect that to continue to provide really strong tailwind in the industry for spending on pets as we look forward and as those pets continue to age as well.
Operator: And our next question comes from Dave Westenberg with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Dave Westenberg: Thanks. Good morning. I have a question on potential competition for Simparica Trio. I know it's been a bit of a moving target. I think initially you thought it could even happen this year and I think it's been pushed out to the rate three times, perhaps to second half of '22. Just curious. I know competitor tight-lipped about what they're doing. But any thoughts from year-end and why there continues to be a delay here, do you think it's regulatory? Or it -- could it be technical? And if it's technical, is this something that could delay competition for many years to come? And then just -- hypothetically, if competition comes into derm segment around the same time as competition comes for Simparica Trio, do you think you have the flexibility to show above segment growth during this period? Thanks.
Kristin Peck: Sure. I wish we knew exactly. I mean, we had the same theories that you do that there could be certain technical reasons for some competitors. And let me be clear. Everyone's working in this space. This is the parasiticides. It's the largest single market in Animal Health at $5 billion. So, I think if you're pretty much any of the large companies we compete with, they're all trying to come up with their own triple combination. So, I don't know that it's the same thing that's holding each of the companies back.  I mean, we're not really clear. It definitely could be regulatory, it could be technical, it could be manufacturing CMC. We're not exactly clear. And to your point, there's really very few public companies who actually disclose much about their pipeline. So, our ability to know where people are is quite limited. We just -- and we always -- I know it's a little [Indiscernible] keep pushing it out. Sort of like 6 to 12 months from whenever you ask the question because we haven't seen it and we haven't heard it in corporate accounts and they're negotiating with us, we think it's definitely another 3 -- every quarterly with another 3 plus months out. And that's really where some of our back comes from.  And yes, we are confident that even if you'll see, we are planning on competition in these key products, but I think that it's the strength and diversity of our pipeline globally that makes us confident we can continue to grow above market. We've got diagnostics, we've got pain mAb. We still think you're going to be growing in [Indiscernible] to be honest with you, it's still a lot of unmet medical needs, so yes, we remain confident that we can grow above the market even if we do start to face competition in some of these key franchises.
Operator: And we'll take a follow-up from Balaji Prasad with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Balaji Prasad: Hi, thank you for the follow-up. And just a question on DRAXXIN, I mean, [Indiscernible] in detail, but I know that you've got approval for DRAXXIN KP in July, probably launches some time in Q3. So, a lot of expectations from the KPs [Indiscernible] ensure that the market stays flat or is this go for this to [Indiscernible] growth? And secondly, on the same, it seemed that 'til now [Indiscernible] launched January versions. You call out a couple of more generates. Any more are you expecting next year? Thank you.
Kristin Peck: Sure. DRAXXIN KP was part of our defense strategy. I don't think it's going to restart growth for us necessarily to market as we're seeing generic competition, but it is as Wetteny outlined in his remarks at the beginning of this call. It's helped us retain our share. It provides incremental innovation and incremental benefit to our customers and a reason, obviously, to stay with that. Yes, we have had in the US two competitor s so far. We've heard up to three more are potentially coming. I don't know why they haven't -- we would've expected them this year, so their approval -- whether or not they actually entered the market, we're not really --we not sure when and if on that, but we would've said we probably have a few more entering.
Operator: It appears we have no further questions. I'll return the floor to Kristin Peck for closing remarks.
Kristin Peck: Great. Look, thank you everyone for your questions today and for your continued interest in Zoetis. Just to summarize, I think we delivered another strong quarter of results driven by our diverse global portfolio and strength in Petcare parasiticides and dermatology products. We are raising our guidance for the full-year 2021 and we remain on track for a record-setting year for us. And we're continuing to invest in the areas to support our long-term growth. And we remain confident in the fundamental growth drivers for animal health and for Zoetis into 2022 and beyond. So, thanks so much for joining us today. Have a great day.
Operator: This will conclude today's program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Steve Frank: Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Zoetis second quarter 2021 earnings call. I am joined today by Kristin Peck, our Chief Executive Officer; and by Wetteny Joseph, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statements in today's press release and our SEC filings, including but not limited to, our annual report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q. Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and in the company's 8-K filing dated today, Thursday, August 5, 2021. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. With that, I will turn the call over to Kristin.
Kristin Peck: Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. I hope you and your loved ones are all staying healthy and getting vaccinated for COVID-19.  I’d like to start the call by welcoming our new Chief Financial Officer, Wetteny Joseph, who is joining me on the call today. As the former CFO of Catalent, Wetteny is a veteran of the biopharma industry and very familiar with many of you in the investment community. Wetteny joined us on June 1 and is off to a fast start learning all about the company and animal health, everything from cattle guarding and drive impacts to pet care trends and parasiticide season.  I am confident that Wetteny will make strong contribution to our ongoing market performance, value creation and leadership in animal health. I also want to take a moment to thank Glenn David for his partnership and all of his contributions to Zoetis as CFO over the last five years. Glenn has taken on a new role overseeing our international operations, and other business units including PHARMAQ, BioDevices, and Pumpkin Pet Insurance.  I know he will bring his signature leadership qualities, business skills and industry knowledge to this role and continue driving profitable growth in these areas.  Now turning to the second quarter, we achieved strong results once again with 22% operational growth in revenue and 28% operational growth in adjusted net income. Our companion animal portfolio generated 36% operational revenue growth, driven by our pet care parasiticides, key dermatology products, vaccines and diagnostics.  Meanwhile, livestock product sales were up 3% operationally and remain in line with our expectations for more moderate growth this year. The second quarter results also reflected favorable comparisons to last year's second quarter, when the uncertainty of COVID-19 and related lockdowns were more severely felt across the animal health industry.  We are raising full year guidance for revenue and adjusted net income again this quarter to reflect our first half performance and confidence in the underlying growth drivers of our business. We remain on track for a very strong year and continue to focus on sustaining our investment in long-term growth opportunities.  With the strong cash flow and positive outlook, we are investing internally and externally in innovative new products, market expansion plans, and direct-to-consumer promotions that will support future growth. Our team has been delivering strong growth, based on internally developed companion animal, parasiticides, led by our Simparica, PROHEART Revolution Plus franchises. We’ve redefined care for the dermatology category with our development of Apoquel and Cytopoint, and we see more growth potential coming from our monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain, new vector vaccines for poultry, and the industry's first cloud-based diagnostic platform with AI capabilities.  In terms of our monoclonal antibodies for of alleviation of OA pain in dogs and cats, we continue to anticipate U. S. approval for Librela and Solensia in 2022.  Meanwhile, initial customer response from vet and pet owners in Europe has been excellent and we recently received approval of Solensia in Canada. I always say, with great pride, that we have the best field force in the animal health industry and we will continue to expand the scope, effectiveness and digital tools in ways that can enhance our customers’ experience and support our growth objectives.  We've also seen a positive return on our investments in direct-to-consumer promotions for Simparica Apoquel, and disease awareness over the years. And DTC remains an area of ongoing investment to support our parasiticide and dermatology portfolios.  And finally, we continue to look externally for business development opportunities that can complement our portfolio and expand our market presence or capabilities. Yesterday, we announced plans to acquire Jurox, a privately held animal health company based in Australia expected to close in the first half of 2022.  The acquisition will provide us with growth opportunities, manufacturing capacity, and increased capabilities in Australia, our fifth largest market. And also bring us a range of companion animal and life livestock products primed for global expansion.  As I wrap up my remarks, our growth story for this year remains very consistent based on three recurring catalysts. First, our companion animal portfolio, driven by our triple combination Simparica Trio and other parasiticides, our dermatology treatments, Apoquel and Cytopoint, new monoclonal antibodies for pain and our Vet Scan diagnostic systems.  The entire portfolio is benefiting from strong pet care trends in terms of increasing clinic visits, rising spend per visit and a focus on diagnostics and specialty care, especially among newer and younger generations of head owners.  Recent estimates for market growth in companion and animal products are in the high-single-digits and Zoetis continues to expect to grow faster than the market. We are gaining share in the approximately $5 billion global parasiticides market for pets, and we excited by veterinarian and pet owner responses to our new monoclonal antibodies for pain.  We also continue to see progress in the early launch of VetScan Imagyst, which leads to our second catalyst for growth, diagnostics, which posted 38% operational revenue growth in the second quarter and access to vet clinics in the U. S. rebounded from the year ago quarter.  Our third growth catalyst is international, where we continued to generate strong operational growth, driven by China and Brazil, which grew at 30% and 40% respectively.  All our catalysts for growth are buoyed by our priority to Champion, a healthier and more sustainable future, the commitments to our communities, animals, and the planet. You can read more about our progress on these ESG goals and our first Sustainability Report, which is published in June.  In closing, we had a great second quarter and we're focused on delivering our record-setting year. The market dynamics in animal health remains strong, steady and resilient, even during the challenging times, based on people's unbreakable bond with animals.  For the remainder of the year, our diverse portfolio, innovative pet care products, strengthen in diagnostics, and expansion in international markets will continue driving our performance.  Now, let me hand things off to Wetteny. 
Wetteny Joseph: Thank you, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. Before I discuss our second quarter performance, I would like to take a moment to express how excited I to join Zoetis, a company with an exceptional opportunity for meaningful for long-term growth, driven by the durability and resiliency of the existing portfolio, a robust product pipeline and a key focus on future innovation.  I look forward to leading an outstanding finance organization and maintaining the financial principles and investment strategies, which position Zoetis as the world leader in animal health. I would also like to express my appreciation to the Zoetis colleagues and the investment community for such a warm and gracious welcome.  I had the pleasure of speaking with several of our investors since becoming CFO and I look forward to connecting with many more in the coming weeks.  Now shifting the focus to earnings. This morning, I will provide commentary on our second quarter financial results, the key contributing factors to our performance and an update on our improved full year 2021 guidance. In the second quarter, we generated revenue of $1.9 billion, growing 26% on a reported basis and 22% operational.  Adjusted net income of $566 million was an increase of 33% on a reported basis and 28% operationally. Operational revenue grew 22% with 2% from price and 20% from volume. Volume growth includes 12% from other in line products, 6% from new products and 2% from key dermatology products.  We delivered another strong quarter and remain encouraged by the performance of our business, health of the overall industry and our outlook for the future. It is worth noting that Q2 2020 is a favorable comparative period due to the impact of COVID-19.  The pandemic caused widespread uncertainty last year, which led to clinic closures, supply chain disruptions, and shifts in consumer demand from restaurant and foodservice to grocery stores. This materially impacted several aspects of our companion animal and livestock businesses.  Now let's dive further into the details of the quarter. Companion animal products led the way in terms of species growth, growing 36% operationally with livestock growing 3% operationally in the quarter. Performance in companion animal was again driven by our parasiticides portfolio, led by sales of Simparica Trio and with significant contributions from the broader portfolio.  We also continue to see growth in our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint, as well as in vaccines and diagnostics.  Simparica Trio had continued to perform exceptionally well, posting revenue of $139 million, representing growth of more than 200% versus the comparable 2020 period. In addition to sales, we are exceeding our other performance measures as well, such as clinic penetration, share within penetrated clinics and reordering rates.  The strength of our entire companion animal parasiticides portfolio was evident again this quarter growing 50% operationally with meaningful growth in the ProHeart and Revolution strong growth franchises in addition to the Simparica franchise. Having the broadest and most innovative portfolio within a larger and expanding therapeutic area is as bullish on future growth in parasiticides.  Global sales of our key dermatology portfolio was $280 million in the quarter, growing 22% operationally. Cytopoint had an particularly strong quarter, growing 42% operationally and generating quarterly revenue of $100 million for the first time since launch. Year-to-date sales for key dermatology products of $524 million in our view remains unchanged that sales will exceed $1 billion this year.  Our diagnostics portfolio had operational growth of 38% in Q2, led by increases in consumable and estimate revenue as the business continues to recover from the impact of the pandemic. With our sustained investments in diagnostics, the newest technology we are bringing to the market and the ability to leverage the breadth of our medicines and vaccines portfolio, we are well-positioned to grow faster than the diagnostics market, which is expected to grow double-digits and outpace the overall animal health markets.  Livestock growth in the quarter was primarily driven by our cattle and swine businesses. Cattle grew 3% and swine grew 6% operationally, despite price reductions as part of our generic defense strategy and higher input costs, weighing on producer profitability in the U. S. Data suggests the foodservice service and restaurant industries continued to recover in the second quarter, which is a crucial dynamic for demand of our premium products.  Poultry was the only species to decline in the quarter, which fell 4% as producers in the U. S. expanded their use of lower cost alternatives to our products. The decline in poultry partially offset the growth in cattle, swine and fish products.  Now let's discuss the revenue growth by segment for the quarter. U.S. revenue grew 22% with sales of companion animal products growing 34% and livestock product sales declining 8%. U.S. quarterly revenue exceeded $1 billion for the first time in company history.  For companion animal, pet ownership and pet spending trends remain robust. Placement revenue increased double-digits in the quarter and patient visits and spend per visit were up as well. While we expect some of the trends to moderate, our view is we will remain above pre-COVID-19 levels.  In addition, a meaningful portion of pet acquisitions, which occurred during the pandemic were by millennial and GenZ. This infuses a solid foundation of younger pet ownership, who are willing to spend disproportionately more on all aspects of pet than prior generations and will be a key growth driver for companion animal medicines, vaccines and diagnostics moving forward.  Our companion animal parasiticides portfolio was the largest contributor to companion animal growth in the U.S. growing 59% in the quarter. Key hematology products, vaccines and diagnostics also contributed to growth.  Simparica Trio had an incredibly strong quarter in the U.S. with sales of $120 million generating the highest revenue by a single product in the U.S. for Q2. The Simparica franchise generated sales of $153 million, growing 96% and remained the number two brand in the U.S. flea tick and heartworm markets.  Key dermatology sales were $197 million for the quarter, growing 23% with significant growth for Apoquel and Cytopoint. Diagnostics sales increased 22% in the quarter with growth in instruments, rapid, test, point-of-care consumables and reference lab revenue.  U.S. livestock sales fell 8% in the quarter, driven by declines in cattle and poultry with swine essentially flat for the quarter. Q2 cattle sales were negatively impacted by a promotional program in the first quarter of this year, which pulled forward a portion of second quarter sales.  In addition, price reductions as part of our generic defense strategy and higher input costs weighing on beef and dairy end-markets, presented challenges to our cattle business this quarter. Poultry declined in the quarter, as produces expanded use of lower cost alternatives to our premium products as a result of higher feed cost and labor wages and smaller flux sizes reducing disease pressure. We also face generic competition for Zoamix, our alternative to antibiotics in medicated feed additives.  To summarize, our U.S. operations delivered another strong quarter, led by our innovative and robust companion animal portfolio. The end-market dynamics for companion animal remain extremely healthy with pet ownership and pet spending trends driving an environment conducive to sustainable future growth, which is expected to more than offset the near-term weaknesses in our U.S. livestock business.  Now turning to our international segment. Revenue in our international segment also grew 22% operationally in the quarter with companion animal revenue growing 41% and livestock revenue growing 10% operationally. The trends fueling strength in our international companion animal business are very similar to those in the U.S.  The increasing medicalization rates and standard of care by pet owners, coupled with significant investments in advertising and promotion to support new product launches and key brands drove growth across our parasiticides, vaccines, diagnostics, and key dermatology portfolios.  Diagnostics were one 106% operationally in the quarter, with consumables and instrument revenue, each exceeding 100% operational growth.  Librela, our monoclonal antibody for of alleviation of OA pain in dogs launched in the EU in the second quarter. Feedback from the early experience trials in Q1 was encouraging and second quarter sales exceeded our expectations further supporting our optimism on the long-term blockbuster potential of the product, as well as monoclonal antibodies as a platform for future growth.  Our feline line monoclonal antibody for alleviation of OA pain Solensia began early experience programs in the second quarter with an EU launch following in Q3. As previously mentioned, OA pain in cats is a significant unmet need in animal health and we're excited to provide pet owners with a novel product in a space that has previously lacked innovation.  Meanwhile, our international livestock business had its second consecutive quarter with growth across all species led by strong operational growth in cattle and swine. Cattle growth in the quarter was driven by marketing campaigns, key account penetration and favorable export market conditions in Brazil and several other emerging markets.  Revenue growth in swine is largely attributed to China, which grew 38% operationally. The theme for growth in swine remain consistent with previous quarters has large key accounts increased their use of our vaccines and other products as they continued to expand production as the market shifts from smaller farms to larger scale modern operations.  Our fish portfolio continues to perform very well, growing 25% operationally. Growth was driven by strong performance of Alpha Flux in Chile, vaccine volume in Norway and the 2020 acquisition of Fish Vet Group. From a market perspective lens, all major markets grew double-digits in the second quarter with the exception of Japan, which declined slightly in Q2.  China and Brazil had strong quarters, growing 30% and 40% respectively on an operational basis. Growth in companion animal across emerging markets remains a key driver of our international business and in addition to the growth in China and Brazil, our other emerging markets companion animal business grew 68% operationally.  Overall, our international segment delivered strong results, demonstrating the importance of our diversity across species and geography. The livestock business continues to perform well and increasing pet acquisitions and pet care spending are extremely encouraging trends for long-term growth in companion animal.  Now moving onto to the rest of the P&L. Adjusted gross margins of 71% is essentially flat on a reported basis, compared to the prior year, as favorable product mix and price were offset by higher manufacturing cost and freight.  Adjusted operating expenses increased 23% operationally, resulting from increased compensation-related costs, advertising and promotion expense and freight.  The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 20%, a decrease of 230 basis points, driven by the favorable impact of a jurisdictional mix of earnings, lower GILTI tax and an increase in favorable discrete items, compared to the prior year's comparable quarter.  Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS grew 28% operationally for the quarter, primarily driven by revenue growth.  We remain in a very strong liquidity position and continued our share buyback program, repurchasing approximately $165 million worth of shares in the quarter. The strength of our balance sheet and substantial free cash flow generation allows us to make significant investments for future growth, while still returning excess cash to shareholders.  Before I review our updated guidance, I would like to reiterate a point that has been discussed on prior earnings calls, which is that, we expect growth to moderate in the second half of the year as a result of varying comparative periods, where pent-up demand created by COVID-19 in the first half of 2020 worked its way through the system in the second half of the year in addition to the expected increased generic competition for DRAXXIN.  Adjusting for the variability in the comparative period due to the pandemic, our phasing of top-line growth would be more normalized and consistent quarter-to-quarter throughout this year.  Now moving on to our updated guidance for 2021, which we are raising and narrowing as a result of our second quarter performance, strength of our product portfolio, and favorable market dynamics, which we expect to continue in the second half. Please note that our guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of mid-July.  For revenue, we are raising and narrowing in our guidance range. We’ve projected revenue now between $7.625 billion and $7.7 billion and operational revenue growth between 12.5% and 13.5% for the full year versus the 10.5% to 12% in our May guidance.  Adjusted SG&A expense for the year are expected to be between $1.87 billion and $1.91 billion, versus $1.82 billion and $1.87 billion in our prior guidance. The increased spend represents additional advertising and promotion investments, a significant portion of which will occur in the third quarter, as well as compensation-related cost due to the company performance.  Adjusted net income is now expected be in the range of $2.135 billion and $2.175 billion, representing operational growth of 13% to 15%, compared to our prior guidance of 12% to 14%.  Adjusted diluted EPS is now expected to be in the range of $4.47 to $4.55 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.09 to $4.19.  Now to summarize before we move on to Q&A. Our strong performance in the first half of 2021 continues to underscore the value of our diversity, innovation and durable business model. We again raised and narrowed our full year 2021 guidance and expect to grow faster than the markets. We continue to focus on long-term sustainable growth by investing in our pipeline, including infrastructure to support current and future product launches and remain very positive in our outlook for sustainable growth beyond this year.  Now I’ll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator? 
Operator: [Operator Instructions]  And we will take our first question from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. 
Michael Ryskin : Thanks for taking the question, as always I will congrats on another strong quarter. I want to start with Simparica Trio, just a really break out quarter with $139 million. I mean, by our projections, something in the $450,000 to $500,000 range, has been out of the picture for the rest of the year. So I just want to get better a sense of where you're seeing an incremental growth coming from? I mean, we did note a little bit of a tick down in regular Simparica in the U.S. year-over-year.  So just wondering if you could kind of little again on cannibalization just revenue expectations as you move forward?  And then, my second question will be on the operating leverage. I was wondering we’ve talked about in the past, but definitely saw a notable step up sequentially in SG&A coming in somewhat above my estimates. You mentioned a lot of the advertising spend, a lot of compensation-related expenses. Could just give us a sense of how much this is expected to persist going forward?  Obviously, it’s going to play a big role in the operating leverage in the second half of the year and given some of the comps, I want to get a better sense of what goes into that $490 million and sort of how to think about that? 
Kristin Peck : Great. Thanks, Mike. I'll take the first question and I'll let Wetteny take the second question on the leverage. Yes, Simparica, and Simparica Trio did had a phenomenal quarter. Overall, as Wetteny mentioned, we had 50% growth in parasiticides. But, as you look at the quarter for Trio with the $139 million, it was incredibly strong. And I would say, Trio is and has been outpacing our expectations. In fact, the Simparica franchise in Q2 was the second largest in the flea tick, heartworm space.  So, we're very excited. We expect to continue to see this product grow. The market itself has now grown to over $5 billion. So, we remain super excited. We're doing well both on our penetration of clinics, as well as reorder. So we see strong momentum that we think will continue into the second half of the year. So, I’ll let Wetteny take your second question. 
Joseph Wetteny: Yes, in terms of SG&A, indeed, the step up that you see in terms of our trend there is really largely driven by R&D investments, as well as advertising and promotion behind our strong brands, given momentum that we have in the market and the strong market conditions that we are in. We are really putting advertising behind our key brands  You mentioned Simparica as a franchise, both Trio, particularly in the U.S. and other markets, but also Simparica continues to grow internationally for us and we want to take advantage of the momentum that we have in this very large market, $5 billion plus. And so, we'll continue to do that as we enter into the back half of the year, particularly, in Q3, as we said in the prepared commentary. But that's really largely what’s driving in.  In terms of compensation-related costs, this is really more of a variable low compensation areas that are really in line with the performance of the company there, as well. 
Operator: And we will take our next question from Jon Block with Stifel. 
Jon Block : Great. Thanks, guys. Good morning. Chris, maybe I'll start on the monoclonal and I know it's early, but how are you seeing Librela being used in these international practices? In other words, is it market expansion? Is it taking share from other solutions or cannibalization or remedial? Any color you have there would be helpful.  And then just to shift gears on livestock, it's always choppy and can move around. But is there anything more structural going on in the U.S. market in regard to generic competition? And maybe on that last point, how is traction playing out? You mentioned that it seems like maybe less impact to-date, but is the overall year assumption still unchanged? Thanks guys. 
Kristin Peck: Sure. Thanks, Jon. Good to hear from you. I'll take the first question and I'll let Wetteny take the second question on livestock. We have been very excited at the uptick in Librela. As what we're seeing and your question about how is it really being used. We've seen really strong efficacy of the product. The feedback we've gotten and through early experience in our first quarter of sales is just us really quick efficacy.  So, they are noticing differences pretty quick. It's improving quality of life, better socialability. So we really think more and more vets are looking at this as a first-line therapy. We do think that there are significant opportunities for Librela to grow the category.  The dog categories you've talked about before, currently is $400 million. But we believe by bringing this type of innovation to the market, support them globally, but bringing this type of innovation from the safety and efficacy profile, we think we have the ability to potentially double that market, if you look at how many dogs there are, how many have away and how many are treated.  So, we look at the opportunity to grow this market in a few ways. Certainly, as I talked about getting more animals, getting more days on treatment, and better compliance and then, certainly with price of this product is priced at a premium to those are already in the market. So Wetteny, do you want to take the second question on livestock? 
Joseph Wetteny: Yes, sure. Look, in terms of livestock, we don't see a structural change here in terms of your question and the performance that we're seeing is right in line with our expectations. Livestock grew 3% on the quarter. And as we've said, livestock has tend to grow somewhere around the 4% range in the past but we expect it to be in low-single-digits.  This year, and really the global growth in that area is driven by international markets, particularly when you think about emerging markets like China and Brazil, et cetera, in the U.S. with the generic competition for DRAXXIN, we expected to see some headwind there. And it's really playing out in line with our expectations.  One more point I’ll make is, if you recall, in Q1, we did have some promotions again in line with our generic defense strategy that really accelerated some of our revenue into Q1 from Q2. So that's playing out a little bit in terms of what you're seeing in the livestock figures for the U.S. But we expect to see further declines in terms of livestock for the remainder of the year and all that’s factored into the guidance that we raised today as well. 
Operator: And we will take our next question from Louise Chen with Cantor. 
Louise Chen : Hi. Thanks for taking my question here. Just curious how durable you think this increase in the vet visit, plus spend per pet will be over the longer term? Thank you. 
Kristin Peck: Thanks Louise. Great to hear from you. Yes, we're very confident in the durability of the companion animal trends that you've seen throughout 2020 and 2021. So, as you look in the quarter, we saw overall clinic revenues up 14% and that was equally split between vet visits and spend per visit. And our confidence in the fact that these durable trends really have to do with a few things; one, there are more pets. We've talked about that for a number of quarters.  The other thing is, it's going to increase in the standard of care, the expectations of pet owners, greater use across the portfolio, greater use of diagnostics, more people home noticing more about their pets. But the other really important trend that's going to continue to play out is who is adopting a lot more of these pets and that's a lot of millennials and GenZ and they tend of spend more on their pets. They're very engaged in their care. So, we see these as durable trends that will continue, and will remain a big growth driver for the company over the coming years. 
Operator: And we will take our next question from John Kreger with William Blair. 
John Kreger : Hi. Thanks very much. I have a gross margin question. I realize the monoclonals are sort of a new class for you guys as Solensia and Librela ramp, do you expect the gross margin on those products to be better or worse than what you see across your traditional product portfolio? 
Joseph Wetteny: Yes. Look, we certainly - given the safety and efficacy profile of these products, we expect to be priced at a significant premium to existing therapies including on remedial. So, I would say, it would be above sort of our average gross margin that you see across our portfolio. 
John Kreger : Great. Thanks, Wetteny. 
Joseph Wetteny: Thanks, John. 
Operator: And we will take our next question from Katie Try. Sorry, Katie Tryhane with Credit Suisse. 
Katie Tryhane : Hi. Thanks for my question. You highlighted the strength in diagnostics. Can you just speak about some of the advantages and success that you've had with bundling strategies with therapeutics? And can you speak to what you're seeing in terms of competitive placements for instruments? You also called out the new VetScan Imagyst platform.  I mean, how has that been performing today? And how do you expect that to contribute to growth in the business going forward? Thanks. 
Kristin Peck: Thanks, Katie. As you look at diagnostics, it was a very strong quarter with 38% operational growth. Diagnosis, as we've talked about remains a very attractive segment with double-digit growth. And it really - it's core to the way that that practice operates.  Again, pets cannot tell you exactly how they are feeling. So we continue to see this being a really strong part of our continuum of care strategy. It's critical to the best practice. We did incredibly strong growth as you saw in the quarter in international making significant placements, very strong in the U.S. and we're focused on a few things there.  Certainly, it's placements as we talked about where we are seeing good growth there, stronger in the quarter in international than the U.S. but also really driving consumable use. And we think that remains a big opportunity for us versus competition getting more consumable use in the placements that we have. And then, really adding on to the innovation, so, if you look at the images launch, it had done better than our expectations. We continue to see very strong growth there.  Right now, the indication for the VetScan Imagyst is in sequel and that's a large market, it’s about $500 million, growing at 7% to 8%. So, we see really strong growth there. I don’t know, what 8% and adds? 
Joseph Wetteny: Not it’s probably 1%. 
Operator: And we will take our next question from David Westenberg with Guggenheim Securities. 
David Westenberg : Hi. Thank you for taking the question. I am going actually continue on that concept. And can you - that was just asked with Katie. Can you help us conceptualize the size of the non-therapeutic revenue for Zoetis on a go-forward basis? And whether or not we should see it as a revenue contributor or as maybe a means of driving therapeutic revenue?  And I am going across the categories with like diagnostics, insurance, Embrex, genomics, et cetera. And then, just a quick clarification question to the answer to Jon Block’s question on the doubling of the pain market. Was that just in dogs? And then, cats is just a plus beyond that or was that $800 million or the doubling of $400 million just the dog and cat? Thank you. 
Joseph Wetteny: I'll start and see if Kristin wants to add anything. In terms of non-therapeutics, if you look at diagnostics, for example, where we saw 38% growth this quarter. So roughly $99 million of revenue on the quarter on the base of what we reported for the year. So, in relative terms, it's not the largest proportion of our revenue streams, certainly, but we are, very much excited about the potential for the future in the very fast growing markets as diagnostics which is expected to grow faster than the overall animal health space for us.  And really one more point that I'll make is, overall, we expect diagnostics as Kristin covered earlier, does have the impact continuum of care, we think overall increasing the use of diagnostics as we look to medicalization across pets will have a positive effect on overall therapeutics in the long haul, we think that's also an exciting opportunity for the long-term. 
Kristin Peck: Sure. And I can take your second question with regards to the cat market. Yes, we think that would be incremental. It is a little hard to size the cat market today. There is really not much of an OA pain market in the U.S. There is some international products that are approved. But, as we talk about doubling the dogs from $400 million to $800 million, if you recall and it's again it's a little hard to size the cat market, maybe it's a $100 million. We think you can double that as well.  So I think that could be a $200 million market, which would make the OA category for us across dogs and cats, potentially a $1 billion market that we can play. And so, we think this is a very exciting space for us. 
Operator: And we will take our next question from Balaji Prasad with Barclays. Your line is now open. 
Balaji Prasad - Barclays: Hi. Good morning, and thanks for questions. Just a couple for me. Firstly, on the parasiticides market, do you have a sense of relative size of where mix gotten better in the quarter and if Trio growth came in at the cost of competitors or some market expansion?  On the same point, you recently got a label expansion for Simparica. Could you also just describe take us through the implications for it commercially? And on the guidance side, could you also just take us through what led to a 1% revenue guide change and the 2% increase in SG&A? And where those increased expenditure is going into? Thanks. 
Kristin Peck: Sure. Thanks, Prasad. I'll take the first question, and I will let Wetteny take the second one. As we look I don’t – I can't get into what our competitors products sales are. We remain quite excited for what the comparative is doing. We did get the additional label claim that was expected, that was included in the guidance that we had.  In the sense of where are we getting some of those sales from, it is an end. So, we are both growing the market. I think more people are moving back into prescribed products versus some the over-the-counter. But we're also seeing that we are taking share from many of our competitors, as well. So, it's an exciting opportunity across both dimensions.  Wetteny, do you want to take this other question? 
Joseph Wetteny: Yes. Look, one thing I would add in terms of parasiticides, I think it's a $5 billion market, that's growing around 5% and we're gaining share in this marketplace. We do think that with a triple combo, it's improving compliance with respect to heartworm, et cetera and so that we'll have the opportunity to continue to expand the market, as well.  So we're very pleased with the performance across our parasiticides portfolio and the share that we're gaining. We will continue to invest behind this product and this portfolio, as well. 
Kristin Peck: Did you want to take the increase in guidance question? 
Joseph Wetteny: Yes, look, certainly, and when you look at our guidance, compared to where we started in the year and given the overall market - positive market dynamics that we see, our portfolio is performing very well. Kristin covered some of the trends around vet visits and so on. All those are contributing towards optimism and you've seen the year-to-date performance that we've delivered.  And in fact, we've taken our guidance in terms of top-line operational growth up from where we started in the year at 9% to 11%, now at 12.5% to 13.5%. So full three points above where we started the year. So, we're very pleased with how we started the year. I think if you look at from a overall perspective, certainly, the first half and the second half of the year, if you look at purely top-line, it's really roughly in line, pretty consistent sort of phasing across the year.  The growth rates will moderate based on last year, largely not really a matter of how this year is executing for us. We're in a very positive market dynamic with very strong performance across our portfolio. Last year, given the pandemic, there was a bit of variability across the year. There was disruption in the first half of the year, given COVID-19, which created more demand that got pent-up and caught up in the back half of the year.  So that's going to create a dynamic in terms of what the Vs look like in terms of growth rates first half versus second half. But we are very pleased with where we are and we are going to continue to invest behind our key portfolios and brands. 
Operator: And we will take our next question from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. 
Chris Schott : Great. Thanks so much for the questions. I just want to focus a little bit more on U.S. livestock. Can you talk a little bit again about the 2Q dynamics? Because it seems like you were going up against a fairly easy comp, but this was still down about 8% So, I was trying to get a sense of like, as we think about the rates of decline you're expecting in the business in the second half of the year, just help us conceptualize what type of erosion you're thinking about as we go up against, what seems like some tougher comps for those quarters?  And then, maybe from a longer term perspective, just walk a little bit through about how you're thinking about recovery for U.S. livestock as we think about both poultry and cattle as we get past some of these kind of more challenging near-term dynamics and just think about the longer term business? Thanks so much. 
Kristin Peck: Thanks, Chris. I'll start on more on the strategic drivers and I'll Wetteny get into some of the specifics here. Livestock really has performed as we expected. As we talked about going into the year with the of LOE of DRAXXIN, we did expect a decline in general as we talked about for the last few years. That's generally 20% to 40% over two to three years.  And as we said, we thought that would be faster. As you look at the quarter, we did see a 19% decline overall in DRAXXIN, specifically. And I think that is of the key factors in the U.S. And as Wetteny mentioned earlier, I think this will continue. But if you look at broader livestock, historically, it's a low to mid-single-digit grower.  Certainly, if you saw in 2019 with AFS and China and 2020 with COVID, it's been lower than what you've historically seen. We do believe as we said that overall this will trend back to a market growth in the mid-single-digit, call it, around the 4% range, maybe be 3% to 5%.  And then we think the vet will be in line with that, it could be slightly lower over the next few years if you see this year and really the strategic driver of that is that we have a number we have the largest number of products hitting, lots of exclusivity. And as you look at our guidance, that's why it is baked in. So, it wasn't just DRAXXIN we also have one in poultry, you were just referencing had Zoamix and BMB as well.  But again, we've got good growth in some of these other species as well. If you look at poultry, we're really excited at the growth of vector vaccines. It’s a $300 million market, growing 13%. We've already launched two of them Newcastle and IBD and that will be a growing portfolio for us. But, I'll like Wetteny get into some of the more specific numbers, but I do think if you look at livestock just more strategically on a higher level, I think it's going to be a lower grower than companion animal. But we do think it goes back to historical levels. Wetteny, if you want to build on that? 
Joseph Wetteny: Yes. Look, I mean, look, if you look at livestock across the world with protein consumption population growth, income levels rising, et cetera, we expect those to continue to drive growth in livestock for the long-term. We delivered 3% on the year, as we said it’s as expected and as was covered in the prior earnings call, we expected declines in the U.S., particularly given the generic entry for DRAXXIN.  Now, the first quarter did benefit a bit from two things. One, there was a little bit of a delay in terms of the entry of generic for DRAXXIN, but also we ran a promotion in the first quarter that accelerates some revenue into Q1 taking it out of Q2. So, if you take those in consideration, which are exactly in line with our defense strategy, livestock really is performing exactly as we expected.  Now, given that the intensification of generic competition as we expected, just began really into the late first quarter into the second quarter, we expect the decline to continue. And again, they are right in line with our expectations here. 
Operator: And we will take our next question from Steve Scala with Cowen. 
Steve Scala : Thank you. A local paper in Nebraska reported last week that Librela is being manufactured at the Lincoln plant. If that is correct, then is that product ultimately destined for the U.S.? And as the U.S. regulatory process evolves, can you confirm that it is still the case that no new clinical data is required? Thank you. 
Kristin Peck: Sure. We mentioned - I mentioned earlier, we do believe we will see approval in the U.S. for both Librela and Solensia in 2022 with Librela most likely in the second half. We have long-term strategies from obviously multiple sites. I don't think the U.S. will be manufactured out of Librela at launch. We certainly are looking at potentially adding sites just given the strength as I mentioned earlier of that product.  So, we have been having ongoing conversations of regulatory authorities and we remain on track for the guidance we previously provided, which is approval for both of those products with Solensia likely earlier in the year and Librela later. But you should not probably expect that we are producing out of Lincoln Nebraska at launch for Librela. 
Joseph Wetteny: Look, given our global footprint and presence, you should not beat anything into the location of manufacturing in terms of where products are destined to. In particular, we'll continue to leverage both our footprint as well as third-parties that are manufacturing. And so I wouldn't draw any conclusion from that. 
Operator: And we will take our next question from Elliot Wilbur with Raymond James. 
Michael Parolari: Hi guys. This is actually Michael Parolari filling in for Elliot. Thanks for taking my question. So, I believe you said in the past that Trio has had about a 90% uptake on top corporate accounts. Just wondering if you provide an update though on penetration across all targeted accounts. And then, in relation to the DTC campaign, I know you said in your prepared remarks that it remains beneficial.  But just wondering if you could give a updated timeline line on how long you could see it continuing? And then also how you see incremental spend really driving ROI here? Thank you. 
Kristin Peck: Sure. Thanks, Michael. We continue to see very – we are at or surpassed all the clinic penetration that we expected for Trio. So we're quite pleased with that. And right now, we're a little more focused on reorder rates, as I mentioned. We think reorder trend for us now is I think our penetration is where we would expect it and it’s very broad across the U.S. for Trio and we're to really focused on those reorders, which we now have at 80% continuing to grow those overall reorder rates.  Direct-to-consumer advertising is critical in this category. It is $5 billion. It is a category that consumers really do go in and ask for brand. We do obviously track our ROI in this and as you've seen and as Wetteny mentioned earlier, we will continue to invest behind this brand. We have seen incredibly strong ROI in doing so. And that is why you're seeing us step up that spend.  As we talked about earlier, it has outpaced our expectations. I think that has everything to do with the innovative nature of this product, but it also has to do with the investment we put behind that in direct-to-consumer advertising and investing with our field force and we will continue to do that. You should expect this year and next year, certainly, we have a window of opportunity with no competition in the U.S. and we will leverage that opportunity.  We still don't know exactly when we'll see competition. At this point, we don't expect any into the second half of 2022 at the earliest as we mentioned. But as long as we do not have competition, we will invest aggressively behind this brand. And even when we do, we will do it as well, because we've seen very strong ROI in doing that. 
Operator: And we will take our next question from Navaan Ty with Citi. 
Navaan Ty : Hi. Good morning. Could you comment on the capital allocation? Should we expect to a continuity of financial policy going forward? And also, following Jurox, should we expect further geographic expansion via bolt-on acquisition in addition to the internal investments? Thank you. 
Joseph Wetteny: Yes, sure. So, in terms of capital allocation, you should expect consistency in terms of how we've managed capital allocation with the focus first and foremost on internal investments. We have opportunities in terms of R&D, investing behind our brands, on advertising and promotion perspective, CapEx to support our growing pipeline including monoclonal antibodies, et cetera. That's really our first priority.  Of course, we'll take advantage of any opportunities from a business development perspective for M&A that helps to accelerate our growth in various markets in areas, as well. So that really follows in terms of investments. And then, as we have free cash flow generation very strong free cash generation, we'll look to return cash to our shareholders.  We’ve increased our dividends as you've seen typically faster than our revenue and we reinitiated our share buyback program, which we were continuing. So, that remains consistent, I would say with the best. 
Kristin Peck: And then, on direct, do you want to just comment on that BD geographic expansion? 
Joseph Wetteny: Yes. So, look, certainly in Jurox, we are excited to be bringing them once we get through the process here over the next six months and close the transaction. We try to bring Jurox into the Zoetis family. Australia is our fifth largest market globally. And this is really at our core. It does increase our presence in a therapeutic area with the leading product, as well.  So we're very excited about that opportunity and what it does for us. And we will continue to look for bolt-on opportunities to bring on both the core, as well as other areas of the business whether it's diagnostics or what have you, as well. 
Operator: And this does conclude today's question and answer session. I will now turn the program back over to Kristin Peck for any additional or closing remarks. 
Kristin Peck: Great. Thank you everybody for your questions today and for your continued interest in Zoetis. We look forward to keeping updated on our business throughout the remainder of the year and continuing to deliver on our results and innovations that you and our customers expect. So, thanks so much for joining us today. Stay safe. 
Operator: This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time and have a wonderful day.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-05-06 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the First Quarter 2021 Financial Results Conference Call and webcast for Zoetis. Hosting the call today is Steve Frank, Vice President of Investor Relations for Zoetis. The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, and will not be forwarded automatically. In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call via dial in or on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode. And the floor will be open for your questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.
Steve Frank: Thank you, Keith. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Zoetis first quarter 2021 earnings call. I am joined today by Kristin Peck, our Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn David, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statement in today's press release and our SEC filings, including, but not limited to, our annual report on Form 10-K in our reports on Form 10-Q. Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures which were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and in the company's 8-K filing dated today, Thursday, May 6, 2021. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. With that, I will turn the call over to Kristin.
Kristin Peck: Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. I hope you and your loved ones are all staying healthy and able to get vaccinated for COVID-19, if not already, then soon. We've been very fortunate in the U.S. as vaccination rates are up and infection rates are trending down overall. But that is not the situation everywhere. In many countries, improving access to vaccines and controlling infection rates are critical hurdles for a more comprehensive global recovery. Yet with the extraordinary measures being taken by so many, I remain optimistic about the steady progress we're making to beat this pandemic. I'm also very proud of what we've been able to do at Zoetis and our own small way to support the global effort. We've been able to keep our colleagues safe, encourage and assist them with vaccinations where possible, and continue serving our customers in the care of their animals. And we're off to a very strong start in 2021, executing on strategies for building on our innovative pet care portfolio, expanding in key markets by the U.S. and accelerating our growth in diagnostics. In the first quarter, we grew our top line revenue at 21% operationally, our best quarter ever, with 25% operational growth internationally and 19% growth in the U.S. China and Brazil led our international performance with 75% and 48% operational growth respectively, exhibiting their strength in both companion animal and livestock product sales. In total, our companion animal portfolio grew 34% operationally based on the strength of our parasiticide and dermatology products, while our livestock portfolio grew 8% operationally with solid growth in cattle, swine and fish products. Digging deeper on pet care, it has been one year since the launch of our triple combination parasiticide, Simparica Trio. It is exceeding expectations and has been well received by customers, with a-90% plus penetration rate in our largest U. S. corporate accounts. Simparica Trio is the latest growth catalyst for a portfolio of small animal parasiticides. After several successful innovations in the last few years, these products made up 16% of our total sales in the first quarter and includes such brands as Simparica, Simparica Trio, Revolution, Stronghold and ProHeart. We believe the ongoing market shift to e-commerce is another boost for this category, helping to increase compliance and months on therapy. And our direct-to-consumer campaigns for Simparica and Simparica Trio continued showing a solid return on investment in markets around the world. Meanwhile, our key dermatology portfolio led by Apoquel and Cytopoint, demonstrated continued double-digit growth. We are seeing excellent traction and significant growth of off the range international markets. Our dermatology portfolio has further growth potential as we continue expanding our international customer base and seek to become a more common first-line treatment for osteoarthritis in dogs. Veterinarians and pet owners alike appreciate the exceptional standard of care that our products can provide. In the companion animal space, we also continue to be pleased with our diagnostics portfolio, which grew 47% operationally in the first quarter. We have grown our point-of-care diagnostic sales made excellent progress on improving our connectivity solutions in veterinary practices, and have seen our cloud-based VetScan Imagyst platform receiving very positive customer feedback, with placements exceeding expectations in the early launch. We're also making progress on our reference labs integrations and look forward to future expansions in this space, both in the U.S. and internationally. Our growth in livestock was driven by the performance of cattle, swine and fish in the first quarter. Cattle product sales in the U.S. were strong as the food service sector has started to recover and generic competition for DRAXXIN was later than expected. Meanwhile, swine benefited from the continued recovery from African swine fever in China. Thanks to the unprecedented growth in revenue and our continued financial discipline and adaptability throughout COVID-19. Our adjusted net income 3%, 4% operationally. Looking ahead we are leading guidance for operational growth and full year revenue to the range of 10. 5% to 12%. And while we had an unusually strong first quarter, we expect more normalized revenue growth in the second half of the year due to tougher comparative quarters and increasing generic competition for DRAXXIN. Glenn will provide more details on other guidance updates in his remarks. Since the beginning of the year, Zoetis has continued to advance our key priorities, including key milestones for new products and life cycle innovations and geographic expansions for major brands. Since our last earnings announcement, we received approval in the European Union for Solensia the first injectable monoclonal antibody for the alleviation of pain associated with osteoarthritis in cats and will be launching this year. Osteoarthritis is vastly underdiagnosed and undertreated today due to limited options for therapy and difficulty recognizing pain in cats. Meanwhile, Librela, our monoclonal antibody for the alleviation of OA pain in dogs, has launched in the EU. And we're seeing a great customer response from vets and dogs owners who referenced increased activity, social ability and quality of life for their pets. In the U.S., we continued discussions with the FDA regarding our regulatory submissions and manufacturing inspection for Librela and Solensia, and we now anticipate approvals for both products in 2022, with Librela likely later in the year. We will provide updates on U.S. revenue expectations for these products in 2022 as we get further clarity on approval timing and rollout plans. It is also worth noting that in China, which is our second largest market in terms of revenue, Zoetis recently received approvals for several leading products, Fostera PCV MH a 1-shot vaccine for pigs, Excenel RTU EZ, a key anti-infective for cattle and swine, and Revolution Plus, our latest parasiticide for cats. We continue to strengthen our portfolio in China, one of our key catalysts for growth. We're also maximizing our key brands with more geographic expansion. In poultry, we expanded our line of recombinant vector vaccines with approval of Poulvac Procerta HVT ND in Canada, Brazil and several other smaller markets. And in parasiticide, we received additional approvals for Simparica Trio in Japan, Mexico and several other smaller markets. In terms of sustainability, we published our long-term goals in March with specific commitments to continuities, animals and the planet. We've built a comprehensive and rigorous approach through our Driven to Care program, and our goals include support for 10 of the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. We'll be releasing more detail on these goals and our initial progress in our sustainability report this June. In closing, the fundamental growth drivers for our industry continue to show strong and sustainable momentum. Pet adoption trends and higher spending per visit in the U. S. along with increased medicalization rates in markets outside the U.S. all continue to bode well for significant growth in our companion animal and diagnostic portfolios globally. We feel very confident about where our companion animal business has come over the last few years, launching innovative new products, defining new standards of treatment and expanding our global reach. In 2014, our companion animal business was 34% of our total revenue. Last year, it had grown to 55% based on the strength of our innovation and investment in growth, and we see that continuing to expand. In livestock, the industry is in a more limited innovation cycle, and we expect modest growth for the year. Livestock growth is tied closely to the pandemic and how quickly the foodservice industry recovers. For Zoetis, we also anticipate increasing headwinds of generic competition to DRAXXIN, but we expect our life cycle innovation and competitive strategies to help us mitigate the impact. While U.S. livestock may present challenges for us in the near term, I feel very positive about our catalysts for growth in pet care, diagnostics and international markets like China and Brazil. We continue to be led by our companion animal parasiticide and dermatology portfolio with more growth to come, and we see a bright future ahead for our monoclonal antibodies for pain.  Diagnostics is accelerating its growth as we increase our global footprint, expand our reference labs and demonstrates the potential for VetScan images to veterinary clinics. And internationally, China continues to be a market with significant growth potential, not only in swine products but with a sizable opportunity for increased medicalization of pets. And we expect major growth to continue in Brazil across the companion animal and livestock portfolios. As always, we remain confident that Zoetis' diverse portfolio across products and geographies, our continued pipeline of innovative new products and life cycle innovations, and the agility and commitment of our colleagues will continue driving our success in 2021 and beyond. Now let me hand off to Glenn, who will speak more about our first quarter results and updated guidance for the full year 2021.
Glenn David: Thank you, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. As Kristin mentioned, we had a very strong start to the year, delivering substantial growth on a global basis and across species and therapeutic areas. Today, I'll focus my comments on our first quarter financial results, the key drivers contributing to our performance, and an update on our improved full year 2021 guidance. In the first quarter, we generated revenue of $1.9 billion, growing 22% on a reported basis and 21% operationally. Adjusted net income of $603 million was an increase of 33% of on a reported basis and 34% operationally. Operational revenue grew 21%, resulting entirely from volume increases with price flat for the quarter. Volume growth of 21% includes 13% from other in line products, 5% from new products, and 3% from key dermatology products. Companion animal products led the way in terms of species growth, growing 34% operationally, with livestock growing 8% operationally in the quarter. Performance in companion animal was driven by our parasiticide portfolio, which includes sales of Simparica Trio in the U.S., certain European markets, Canada, Australia and Mexico. We also saw growth in our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint, as well as in small animal vaccines and diagnostics. Following blockbuster sales in year one, Simparica Trio begin 2021 with strong first quarter performance, posting revenue of $90 million, growing sequentially each quarter since launch. The underlying dynamics that drove first quarter sales are very favorable for significant future growth, such as increasing clinic penetration and robust reordering rates within penetrated clinics. I'd again like to mention how pleased we are with the performance of our broader parasiticide portfolio which, in addition to the Simparica franchise, had significant growth in the Revolution, Stronghold and ProHeart franchises as well. U.S. market share within the flea, tick and heartworm segment is now at an all-time high of 31%, representing an increase of more than 9% for the first quarter versus the same period in the prior year. Global sales of our key dermatology portfolio were $245 million in the quarter, growing 24% operationally. We remain confident that key dermatology sales will exceed $1 billion this year. Our diagnostics portfolio grew 47% in Q1, led by increases in consumable and instrument revenue. 2020 presented challenging conditions for our diagnostics business, as social distancing restrictions limited our ability to enter vet clinics and increase our market share. However, our vast product portfolio, commitment to innovation, and ability to leverage the breadth of our medicines and vaccines portfolio has us well positioned to grow faster than the overall diagnostics market. Livestock growth in the quarter was primarily driven by our cattle and swine businesses. Improving market conditions from the COVID-19 recovery as well as successful promotional activities led to increased sales across the cattle portfolio. In addition, later-than-expected timing of generic entrants led to strong first quarter sales for DRAXXIN. Our swine portfolio grew 19% operationally as large producers continued rebuilding herds as they recover from African swine fever and created significant demand for our products. Poultry sales declined in the first quarter as producers expanded their use of lower-cost alternatives to our premium products. The decline in poultry partially tempered the growth in cattle, swine and fish. Now let's discuss the revenue growth by segment for the quarter. U.S. revenue grew 19%, with companion animal products growing 32% and livestock sales declining by 4%. For companion animal, pet ownership and pet spending trends remain promising. While severe weather caused a slight decline in vet clinic traffic for the quarter, revenue per visit was up more than 10%. In addition, pet ownership has increased and is trending towards a younger demographic, and younger pet owners typically spend more on pet care. This is a key driver for increased revenue per visit and creates robust demand for our diverse portfolio. Our small animal parasiticide portfolio was the largest contributor to companion animal growth, growing 74% in the quarter. Diagnostics, key dermatology products and small animal vaccines also contributed to growth. Simparica Trio continues to perform well in the U.S. with sales of $83 million. The Simparica franchise generated sales of $112 million in the quarter and is now the number two brand in the U.S. flea, tick and heartworm segment. Companion animal diagnostic sales increased 62% in the quarter as the continued recovery at the vet clinic and a favorable prior year comparative period led to significant growth in point-of-care consumable revenue. Key dermatology sales were $157 million for the quarter, growing 16% with significant growth for Apoquel and Cytopoint. U.S. livestock declined 4% in the quarter, driven primarily by poultry as producers switching to lower-cost alternatives unfavorably impacted our business. Swine also declined in the quarter, which is attributed almost entirely to a favorable nonrecurring government purchase, which occurred in Q1 2020. Cattle grew 6% in the quarter as promotional programs and the timing of generic entrants drove growth across the product portfolio. Growth in cattle partially offset the declines in poultry and swine. To summarize, U.S. performance was once again strong in what remains a very favorable companion animal market environment, in which we offer the broadest and most innovative product portfolio. Although livestock declined in the quarter with expectations of further declines for the year, we are encouraged by a series of foodservice trends such as increased dining out and school and business reopenings. Revenue in our international segment grew 25% operationally in the quarter, with companion animal revenue growing 37% operationally and livestock revenue growing 17% operationally. The strength in companion animal was fueled by the continuing trends of pet adoptions, increasing standard of care by pet owners, and our investments in advertising, all of which drove growth across our parasiticide and dermatology portfolios. Companion animal diagnostics grew 18% in the quarter, led by a 24% increase in point-of-care consumable revenue and a second consecutive quarter of double-digit increase in instrument placement revenue. We began early experience programs for Librela, a monoclonal antibody for alleviation of OA pain in dogs. The feedback from the programs has been extremely positive, and further solidifies our view of the long-term potential of the product with an EU launch currently underway. Our feline monoclonal antibody, Solensia, will begin early experience programs in Q2. And with an EU launch to follow in the third quarter. Solensia will provide cat owners an innovative therapy to address one of the largest unmet needs in animal health. Our international livestock business saw double-digit growth across all species with the exception of poultry, which grew low single digits in the quarter. Swine revenue grew 29% operationally led by growth in China of 128%, marking the third consecutive quarter with swine growth in excess of 100%. While additional outbreaks and strains of African swine fever have occurred, we believe it is contained to a specific region and a limited number of customers. Cattle grew 11% operationally in the quarter as a result of marketing campaigns, key account penetration, and favorable export market conditions in Brazil and several other emerging markets. Our fish portfolio delivered another strong quarter, growing 39% operationally driven by strong performance in Chile, the timing of seasonal vaccination protocols, and the 2020 acquisition of Fish Vet Group. All major markets grew in the first quarter, many in double digits. China total sales grew 75% operationally, which, in addition to the significant growth in swine, delivered 59% operational growth in companion animal. Brazil grew 48% operationally in the quarter as sales of Simparica, the leading oral parasiticide in the Brazilian market, drove a 73% operational increase in companion animal. Overall, our international segment delivered strong results, again, demonstrating the value of substantial geographic and species diversification. Our companion animal business benefited from favorable trends such as rising medicalization rates outside the U.S. And while swine was the largest growth driver for our international livestock business, the contributions were broad-based with growth across all species. Now moving on to the rest of the P&L. Adjusted gross margin of 71% increased 70 basis points on a reported basis compared to the prior year as a result of favorable product mix, partially offset by foreign exchange and other costs, including freight. Adjusted operating expenses increased 8% operationally, resulting from increased compensation-related costs and advertising and promotion expense for Simparica Trio. This was partially offset by reductions to T&E costs as a result of COVID-19. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 19%, an increase of 230 basis points driven by a reduction in favorable discrete items compared to the prior year's comparable quarter, partially offset by the favorable impact of the jurisdictional mix of earnings. Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS grew 34% operationally for the quarter, primarily driven by revenue growth. We resumed our share repurchase program in the first quarter, repurchasing approximately $180 million worth of shares. Along with our dividend, share repurchase is a critical component of our shareholder distribution strategy. We remain in a strong liquidity position and are highly cash generative. And as a result, we expect to be able to execute on all investment priorities including direct-to-consumer advertising, internal R&D and external business development, while still returning excess cash to shareholders. Now moving on to our updated guidance for 2021, which we are raising as a result of our first quarter performance. Please note that our guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late April. For revenue, we are raising and narrowing our guidance range, with projected revenue now between $7.5 billion and $7.625 billion and operational revenue growth between 10.5% and 12% for the full year versus the 9% to 11% in our February guidance. Adjusted net income is now expected to be in the range of $2.12 billion to $2.16 billion, representing operational growth of 12% to 14% compared to our prior guidance of 9% to 12%. Adjusted diluted EPS is now expected to be in the range of $4.42 to $4.51, and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.08 to $4.19. Our key assumptions for 2021 have not changed materially since the guidance we provided on our Q4 2020 call. However, our current view is that we will not face competition in the U.S. for Simparica Trio or our key view is that we will or our key dermatology products until the second half of 2022. On our fourth quarter call, I mentioned that we anticipated growth to be heavily weighted towards the first half of the year, and I'd like to take this time to expand upon that further. We are expecting first half 2021 growth to materially outpace growth in the second half of the year, primarily resulting from Simparica Trio sales and the favorable Q2 2020 comparative period related to COVID-19. Subsequently, we expect growth to moderate in the second half of the year as a result of increased generic competition for DRAXXIN as well as challenging comparative periods when pent-up demand in the first half of 2020 worked its way through the system in the second half. Now to summarize before we move to Q&A, we've delivered strong operational top and bottom line growth in the first quarter with significant gains in both companion animal and livestock and across nearly every therapeutic area and geography. In addition, we raised and narrowed our full year 2021 guidance. And while growth will moderate in the back half of the year for the reasons I outlined, we again expect to grow faster than the market and feel very positive about our position for sustained growth beyond this year. Now I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question today from Erin Wright with Crédit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Erin Wright: Great. Can you speak a little bit more about the underlying trends you're seeing across the U.S. livestock business? How has that segment performed quarter-to-date? And it seems that DRAXXIN competition has played out a little bit better than your expectations, but has anything changed in terms of how you're thinking about that headwind over the course of 2021? And then my second question is on parasiticides. It does represent a larger portion of your portfolio than it has historically. I guess how should we think about the seasonality of that business, the purchasing patterns both across retailers and vet clinics? And did you see any sort of pull forward outsized stocking dynamics in the quarter that we should be aware of and what your guidance now assumes for Simparica Trio?
Kristin Peck: Sure. Thanks, Erin. As you think about U.S. livestock, as Glenn mentioned, overall U.S. livestock was down 4%, but there was lots of different trends in there. U.S. cattle was up 6% in the quarter. And I think if you look at that, that was driven by later-than-expected entrants in the generics. So we were expecting more entrants sooner. But to your point, we don't really think it's going to end up playing out any differently by the end. And so what do I mean by that? If you look at that, we think the entrants will come, we think once they do, we'll likely end up -- if you look at generics, it's certainly 20% to 40% on penetration. And what we said is we think that's likely what it's going to be with DRAXXIN, both in the U.S. and in the EU and really around the globe. But as you think about that, it's likely going to happen a little bit later in the year. So we did do better in the beginning of the year. But if you look at that and you compare it to how we did internationally on DRAXXIN more specifically, so although you saw 6% growth in DRAXXIN in the U.S. internationally -- sorry I meant overall DRAXXIN internationally is actually down, and that was because we did have a multiple entrants sooner in that. So I don't think livestock really is going to play out any differently. We did see, as Glenn mentioned, a decline in poultry overall. And there is some seasonality obviously if you think about cattle. Swine was down and poultry. But overall I think we continue to remind, if you look at livestock overall for us, it was up 8%. I think what often people underappreciate it is that 60% of livestock is outside of the U.S. And although we focus a lot on U.S. cattle, the growth as you saw in China across swine which had 128% growth, and in Brazil still meant livestock did quite well. As you think about the parasiticides, I'll let Glenn sort of take some of that and get into some of the more specific trends.
Glenn David: Yes. So thanks, Erin. So from a parasiticide perspective, we had a really strong quarter with the Simparica franchise, 133% growth in the franchise. Great performance from Simparica Trio with $90 million in the quarter alone, and Simparica also delivering $74 million with 38% growth. In terms of seasonality, we typically do see Q1 and particularly Q2 being the stronger quarters from a parasiticide portfolio perspective, particularly in the U.S. However, as we do see Simparica Trio on a ramp-up curve, the impact of that seasonality may be a little different this year as we do expect to continue to increase our clinic penetration and adoption and market share within the clinics as well. So there definitely is some seasonality within the parasiticide portfolio. But with the continued ramp-up on the product, it may not be as severe as you would typically see with an established product.
Operator: Our next question is from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Michael Ryskin: I want to start on China, just really incredible growth this year -- this quarter. Obviously, you highlighted some of the aspects there. African swine fever bounce-back. And then companion has been doing well there for a while, and it's nice to see that, that continues to grow. I'm just wondering if you could opine on how sustainable that is. I mean that 123 million number, is that a new jumping off point that we should be thinking about in terms of run rate going forward and obviously growing from that? Or could there have been some bulk orders, for example in swine, as some of these producers restart their operations? And then another question for Glenn. On the OpEx guide, I'm just wondering if you could talk through a little bit of the details of what you're assuming for operating leverage in the second half. Are there any additional DTC programs for Trio? Are you restarting to see any expense? Is there any inflation factor in? Just wondering how we should think about the SG&A ramp going forward.
Kristin Peck: Thanks. Thanks, Mike. So starting with China, and I'll let Glenn take the second question. We do think this is a very sustainable growth driver in China, and really what drives that is a few things. One, I think you'll see African swine fever continuing a rebuild of the herd there. It is going to take a few years to rebuild that, so I think that is going to be for the next few years of sustainable growth. You saw swine grow in the quarter at 128%. But I think what's also really important to focus on is how well companion animal did, which grew 59%. We've been launching a number of new products, as I mentioned in my opening remarks. We had the launch of Fostera PCV MH as well as Revolution Plus. So continuing to bring in new products, seeing really, really good growth across both companion animal and livestock, makes us believe that China and the investments we've even talked about in building additional facilities there and growing our biologics footprint, we are very bullish on China continuing to be a sustainable growth driver for the company. Do you want to take the question onwards?
Glenn David: Yes. And I just want to make other comments on China, Mike, to your other question as well. We did have $123 million in sales. Q1 typically does tend to be the larger quarter of sales for China. So that necessarily isn't one that you would run off of for the rest of the year. But to Kristin's point, I'm very excited about the growth prospects that we have for China for the year. In terms of the OpEx, we grew 8% in OpEx in the first quarter, which is pretty indicative of what the guidance range would indicate for the year. But there'll be different dynamics throughout the quarters to that. So for Q1 with the growth of 8%, that really was driven by a lot of the incremental DTC that we had for Simparica Trio in the quarter. And also, we didn't have savings from T&E in Q1. We had the savings from T& E in Q1, because in Q1 of 2020, that was pre-COVID. We still had our elevated T&E spend. As we move throughout the year, obviously we're not going to have that benefit. So the impact of the incremental DTC for Simparica Trio will be there, but we also increased our spending for DTC for Simparica Trio throughout the year last year. So a number of different factors, but the overall level of growth for the year perspective is pretty similar to what we saw for the quarter.
Operator: And our next question is from Jon Block with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Jon Block: First one, Glenn for you, just in the overall top line steps up, do we attribute that solely to companion animal? It seems like livestock, just based on your comments, might still be in the up low single-digit range. And maybe more specifically, is the step-up in companion just due to Trio? I mean if you annualize out the 90 million, you get to 360 already. And it seems like that was in and around the original guidance when we think about the contribution to growth. And then, Kristin, maybe just can you give a little more color on what you're seeing in the poultry market? Was those lower end competitive dynamics specific to the U.S.? Did it surface in international? Maybe what's going to be the Zoetis' response in coming quarters?
Glenn David: Sure. So in terms of the overall top line step-up in the guidance, there are a number of factors that drove that beyond just companion animals. So obviously very pleased with the performance of Simparica Trio, and that is definitely one of the drivers for the guidance range. But as Kristin mentioned, also very strong performance in China, off to a very strong start to the year. Strong performance in Brazil as well, Brazilian market grew 48% for the quarter. So that's off to a very positive start. And then our diagnostics business as well. We had 47% growth in our diagnostics business in the quarter. So many of our key growth drivers for the long term performed very well in the quarter, which also then enabled us to raise the guidance for the year. So it's across a number of different of our key strategic growth drivers that enabled us to raise that guidance. In terms of poultry in the U.S., we did see some challenges this quarter as our producer customers did move to some cheaper alternatives from our products. That is something that we'll evaluate through the year. We do expect that there will be a movement back at some point to our products, but that's something that will evolve over time in terms of the efficacy that they see from those cheaper alternatives compared to our more premium products.
Operator: Our next question is from Louise Chen with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.
Louise Chen: So I wanted to ask you how you think the animal health industry might change post-COVID? And do you still expect a headwind this year? And what have you factored into your guidance for recovery?
Kristin Peck: Sure. Thanks, Louise. We look at some of the trends you've seen this year, and a lot of these are more sustainable on the pet care side. And I think the trends, that I'll talk about in a second, are a little bit different on the livestock side. What you've been seeing over the last few quarters is an increase in revenue per visit. That has been sustainable. And as we looked last year at the sort of 10%, again as we talked about in Glenn's remarks, a 10% increase in revenue per visit. And what's been driving that is there's increased pet ownership, and that really has maintained. People are continuing to spend more time with their pets. I think you see the trend of these new pets being adopted by millennials and Gen Z, and they spend more on those pets. So we see that as a trend that will continue to drive growth overall for the industry. And then these pets will ultimately age. And as these -- all these new pets age, a lot of our chronic products will become even more relevant. I think this is also driving important growth in our diagnostics business, which grew 47% in the quarter. Again, pets can't tell you what's wrong with them, so I think vets are getting really increased focus on doing diagnostic tests in a lot of these wellness visits. If you think about livestock, I mean there's two trends to look at. One is just when we produce more protein as people go out more, really what you're going to need to see to be significant improvements here globally as an increase in travel and entertainment. And I think we're now seeing people going back to school, maybe going back to work, maybe traveling from personal. But getting that travel and entertainment industry back up will help drive the growth in livestock globally, I think, over some of these coming quarters. So slightly different trends, but we continue to remain bullish. And the way we see our growth is with an increasing pet care business. We see great growth in pet care from everything from our in line, our products, our derm, our new mabs. Looking at increased growth in China and Brazil, which again as we talked about, we think is sustainable. And then lastly, continued investment in growth in our diagnostics business, which we're quite excited about.
Operator: Our next question is from John Kreger with William Blair. Please go ahead.
John Kreger: Question about Librela, Now that, that product is launched in the EU. Can you talk a little bit more about the clinical differentiation you're seeing compared to some of the existing oral alternatives?
Kristin Peck: Sure. We're -- as you probably know, we began the early experience in the EU, and we'll be launching formally in Q2 for Librela. The early experience information that we saw was really, really positive. Both -- obviously it's got a strong safety profile. But the efficacy, it's working very quickly faster than I think some of our customers expected. And they're seeing significant improvements in the quality of life and in the pain of these dogs. So we remain very bullish that customers are looking for an alternative to the products in the market right now. And we've seen a really strong uptake in that. This is still a significant market. If you look at sort of $90 million in the EU today, 40% of those dogs have OA, and currently only 28% of those are treated. So the early experience data that we've seen to date and the early launch makes us very optimistic for the success of this product. And as we mentioned before, we expect this product to be a blockbuster.
Operator: And our next question is from David Westenberg with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahed.
David Westenberg: So can you remind us why there's such species-by-species differences in the U.S. and international livestock market, given that protein is inherently global? And then for my second question on the diagnostic portfolio, I think you confirmed 46%. That is a huge number. So can you talk about the components of growth of that, and if some of that in the kind of the organic growth rate there?
Kristin Peck: Okay. I'll take the first question, and then Glenn can take the second one. Although protein is global, the dynamics are very different in each species in a few ways. One, obviously if you look at consumption, as people move into the middle class they're generally starting with milk and then eggs then poultry. Then they move up to swine and then beef. There's also differences geographically on what people consume. Obviously, China is a huge swine market. That's not true in the U.S. where you see probably more poultry and beef. So there are really different consumption trends as well. The other real big differences is who produces in each market in each species, how much is exported. In the U.S., there's a significantly larger export market for poultry and for swine. So there's very different dynamics for each of the different species as people trade up and trade down different protein sources. As you think about where people are sourcing those processors who are big export markets versus internal production. So -- and it does lead to very different dynamics. The other major dynamic you should think about is that the ability for each producer to change their supply is actually quite different. Once you have a supply of cattle, they take many years to grow. You can't all of a sudden pare back in cattle. Poultry producers can decide not to use a bunch of eggs and grow chickens, which only take a few months. So it's very different in their ability to react to the market, and therefore you do see different decisions being made. And you probably saw in the papers today, there's huge demand for poultry right now, and I think poultry producers are going to have to sort of start scaling up. They can do that quickly. They can make those decisions and expand their flocks very quickly. That is a very difficult thing, it takes a lot of time for a swine or a cattle producer. So that's why you sometimes see some of these different dynamics across species.
Glenn David: And regarding diagnostics, a very strong quarter for our diagnostics portfolio. We grew 47% in the quarter overall. And that growth was really balanced from many different areas. So we saw the U.S. grew 59% in the quarter in diagnostics, with strong growth in our consumables really pulling through the increased instrument placements that we saw last year really drove increased consumables in the quarter. Also strong performance for our reference lab business and increased growth in our instrument revenue as well. So really strong performance in the U.S. And also for the U.S., it was an easier comparative period to Q1 of last year as well. International, very positive growth as well, growth of 24%, again really driven by strong growth in consumable usage in the international markets as well as increased instrument revenue as well. So very balanced strong growth in our diagnostics portfolio in the quarter. And we think that sets us up well for the year, and we do expect that our diagnostics business will outpace the growth of the overall diagnostics market in 2021.
Operator: Our next question is from Elliot Wilbur with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Elliot Wilbur: A question for Glenn and Kristin, I guess with respect to expectations of additional competition on Trio and in the derm portfolio, I mean what's changed in terms of your line of sight there, based on specific feedback from the channel or just the absence of any competitive noise, whatsoever? And then quick question for Glenn, just thinking about SG&A trends over the balance of the year. I mean the guidance at the midpoint on SG&A and the top line implies roughly a 300 basis point step up. How much of that is just sort of increase in normalized baseline expenditure versus targeted investment spend? And how should we be thinking about the progression of SG&A levels over the balance of the year, relative to some of the investment programs that you have budgeted?
Kristin Peck: Sure. Thanks, Elliot. I'll take the first question. Yes, as Glenn mentioned in his opening remarks, we are not expecting competition in the U.S. for Simparica Trio or for our derm portfolio, Apoquel or Cytopoint, until maybe mid- -- the second half of 2022 at the earliest, to be honest with you. This is just based on our competitive intelligence, which is, as we said from the start, is not perfect. There is not great information, but we definitely don't expect it this year. And based on what we've heard, we don't think it's in the first half of next year at the earliest. So again, we are always prepared for competition to come. We're never exactly clear when it will be. But I think our -- we're very optimistic that we -- the very least this year in the e first half of next year. And we'll be aggressive in growing these products as we've seen.But I would remind you, certainly if you look at Simparica Trio, that we've done incredibly well with Simparica, and it was the third to market. And we continue to grow this franchise already around the world, the Simparica franchise even with other competitors on the market. So anything you want to add there, Glenn? Do you want to take the second question?
Glenn David: No, I'll move to the second question in terms of the OpEx spend and what we there are a number of different areas that are driving the incremental OpEx this year. Part of it is a normalization from the COVID impact in 2020. We would expect that T&E expenditures would begin to increase, particularly in the second half of the year. But also our compensation costs as we ramped up hiring some positions that may have been on hold, with the impact of COVID, were just more difficult to fill. We are increasing our hiring really to support the strength of many of our key brands and to continue the growth there. From a DTC spending perspective, we would expect more DTC spending this year driven by a couple of different factors. A, we have some Simparica Trio on the market for the full year. So we will support that with advertising expenditures for the full year as well. And we also continue to see strong growth in many of our brands, such as our dermatology portfolio, and will continue to increase and support those brands those brands of direct-to-consumer advertising, not only in the U.S. but outside of the U.S. as well where we are increasing our DTC spend behind many of our brands, including Simparica as well as our dermatology portfolio. So there are a number of areas will spend really to support the significant revenue growth opportunities that we see not only for this year but for many years beyond.
Operator: Our next question is from Balaji Prasad with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Balaji Prasad: Just two for me on following up on Librela, could you maybe give us some thoughts around the gross margin impact of the 40 to 60 pound price points that they're introduced at? And what's your internal expectations around usage of this product? How do you see it evolving? While recommendation is once a month injection, so one. Two, on ASF, in the past you have been quiet about ASF vaccines. We saw news flows recently that started some trials and collaborating on it. So could you maybe take us through your -- what the time lines around the trials are? And when do you expect to be a part of the ASF vaccine program?
Glenn David: Sure. So from a Librela gross margin perspective, I'll start with pricing for Librela, which is very important in terms of the overall profitability of the product. Now that we've launched in the EU, we have priced that product at a premium to the current therapies on the market, really consistent with some of the other products that have brought significant innovation in some of our other categories, such as dermatology. You would see Librela price at a premium similar to that. So we would expect that Librela will be a high-margin products consistent with the overall companion portfolio, which typically is above our overall gross margin level. So that will be a positive contributor to gross margin over time. In terms of ASF and our development for vaccines, as we've said before, this is a very complicated disease state. It's going to take many years to find a solution. We are active in those development studies, but it will be a multiyear time frame before we find a solution for African swine fever.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Kathy Miner with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.
Kathy Miner: Two questions, please, first on Librela. Can you clarify, I believe in your comments you said that you expected approval of Librela later in the U.S. than Solensia? Does this reflect just filing timing? Or is there some other dynamic here? And the second question, a little bigger picture on business development, it seems Zoetis has been pretty quiet in terms of M&A this year. Can you comment a little bit about your outlook for the rest of 2021 and some of the areas you may be focusing on there?
Kristin Peck: Thanks, Kathy. Yes, as we mentioned, we are expecting the approval of both Librela and Solensia in 2022. And if there's nothing specific about why Librela is actually later than month. It has to do with filing timings and just general process on the 2 of those. But again, we remain quite confident and optimistic in the approval of both of those. And as we get closer, we'll be able to provide more specific guidance on revenue and launch timing, et cetera. But no, there's nothing specific as to why Librela is going to probably be later in the year than Solensia. it's just timing of submissions and back and forth with the regulators. So Glenn, do you want to take the second?
Glenn David: Yes. So from an M&A perspective and our areas of focus for 2021, so build development remains a key area and part of our capital allocation strategy, and we remain focused on that. A couple of areas that we continue to pursue, consistent with what we've discussed in the past, is any specific geography where we may have an opportunity to gain additional share or presence in an area, that we may not be at the level of market share that we are globally. Those are areas that we will continue to focus on and look to bring in additional products into our portfolio. Also, many of the areas that we've stressed as areas of strategic importance to us, whether that's in areas such as precision livestock farming, genetics, diagnostics. Those are areas that we'll also continue to remain focused on as well as if there are only development assets as well that we believe would bring strength of our R&D portfolio, we can generate greater value than the existing company. So we remain focused on M&A. We evaluate many opportunities, and we will look to continue to use that as a prime area for capital allocation moving forward.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
David Risinger: So congrats on the exceptional performance. I think you hear my 6-year-old puppy in the background barking, and I'm wondering if you have a barking consumption. Anyway, so I wanted to just move little bit a if my phone line cut out. So could you provide additional details on companion animal innovation prospects beyond monoclonal antibodies for pain? It'd be helpful to understand areas of unmet need and the potential cadence of material new companion animal product introductions in coming years. And I know that you can only comment on this at a high level, but anything you can offer would be helpful. And then second, given likely inflationary pressures ahead on costs, what is your plan for product price increases in companion animal and livestock?
Kristin Peck: We are quite excited with regards to our innovative portfolio in both companion and livestock. And as you think about companion animal, we're really focused on continuing to grow our franchise in parasiticide and look for additional products there. Continuing to look at exciting areas such as additional add-ons in our dermatology portfolio. And really, we think the platform of our monoclonal antibodies goes way beyond pain, to be honest with you. There's lots of other chronic and other conditions. We think that technology will help with and super excited about our portfolio in diagnostics. Really building new indications with our images platform, our AI, cloud-based diagnostics expanding reference lab. So I think there's a really bright future as we look at continuing to expand our pet care portfolio globally. So Glenn, I don't know if you want to take the question with regards to inflation.
Glenn David: Yes. With regards to inflation and the impact in -- we'll have on pricing across our portfolio, so we do expect over the long-term to continue to be able to take price increases ranging from 2% to 3% per year. This year will be a little muted in 2021 because of the impact of the DRAXXIN LOE. But beyond this year, we do expect to be able to return to that 2% to 3% average pricing. That will vary based on the product as well as the geography. Typically, in our more innovative products, we're able to take a little bit above that 2% to 3%. Products that have been on the market a little longer generally get a little below that 2% to 3%. And then in higher inflationary markets, we typically take pricing beyond that 2% to 3%. So we don't see any significant changes to that in the short to medium term, other than the fact that in 2021 because of the impact of the DRAXXIN LOE, we'll be below that 2% to 3%.
Operator: Our next question is from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Nathan Rich: Maybe going back to the launch of Librela and Solensia in Europe. I guess Kristin the -- given your experience with the kind of early feedback from vets, I mean has that changed your expectations around what the launch curves could look like? Because these are kind of new products to treat pain. So just wanted to get your kind of updated thoughts on what you think kind of uptake will look like? And should we think about the launch curve maybe similar to the derm portfolio, kind of given that both of these therapies were relatively kind of innovative at their launch?
Kristin Peck: Thanks, yes. I think we are very bullish with regards to the launch curves of both Librela and Solensia in the EU. I think we're now just in early experience with Solensia, so it's probably a little earlier there. But again, as we said I think a little bit previously, I do think the launch curves are going to look different between Librela and Solensia a little bit. Librela is going to enter an established market. The great news is the vets are already very comfortable with injectable monoclonal antibodies even Cytopoint. So I think you'll see a really nice uptick, and I think we'll do very well there. Solensia is a little different. You have to get more cats to the clinic. You have to medicalize those cats and treat them. It's a little harder to sense OA in cats. That being said, we'll have a much better sense as we get to the next quarter since we're just beginning early experience right now. We're really bullish on this in the medium term how fast that uptake happened. I think early experience, which is what we're in right now, we'll be able to better inform that as we get to the next quarter. But the science behind it, the safety, the efficacy is really, really strong. And what's different, as we've talked about for Solensia, there really are very few alternatives for cats. So if we can build a market, which I think Zoetis has demonstrated its ability to do, we're really excited about what that launch curve will be better informed as we finish early experience, which we're adjusted now. Anything you add on that one?
Glenn David: No, I just echo what you said, Kristin. I'm very excited by the feedback that we saw with the early experience program. It does give us even greater confidence and more enthusiasm around the potential for these products in the EU and globally. And we're continuing to update our forecast based on the feedback that we get.
Operator: And our next question is from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Chris Schott: A couple of ones here. Just on Trio, I guess with competition not expected until the second half of '22, does that change how you're thinking about kind of peak market share potential for the product, given you have this kind of three-year window to really establish yourself in the market prior to seeing any type of real competition here? And then second, I know you talked -- touched on this a little bit before, but so on livestock in general. It seems like we're for a very strong start of the year. I know part of that is DRAXXIN. But with reopenings seeming to go pretty well in most markets so far, are you feeling better about these markets than the beginning of the year? Or are you still a bit cautious, just given kind of some of the -- I guess uneven openings that we're seeing across the world?
Kristin Peck: I'll start and let Glenn build on this. We are very optimistic on Trio, and ultimately it probably changes the curve a little bit of how fast we get that competition on the market. But I think it's important, as I mentioned in my earlier comments, these products still grow even when competition enters. And I think this is something we keep underscoring. When compared to there to market. It is growing like crazy and taking share. I think when you put the marketing muscle, the technical experience muscle of Zoetis behind the product. Even with competition, we still expect these products to grow. So we will probably build our share faster but we do expect even with competition that these products in these categories will continue to grow also bringing more people into prescription products versus some of the over the cattle, really bringing new solutions I think we'll continue to grow these products in the longer term. I don't know if you want to build anything that and address the life back one.
Glenn David: Yes. No, just to say, obviously the longer out in the market alone, the better in terms of accelerating that peak sales curve. But to Kristin's point, this is a very large market, and we do see products on the market and franchises on the market that are approaching $1 billion today, even without a triple therapy in the U.S. So we think there is significant opportunity for future growth for this franchise. In terms of livestock, we are off to a strong start, and we do think that the reopening trends are positive for the overall animal health industry and the growth in livestock. We're also very pleased with the performance that we've seen in many of our key markets, particularly outside of the U.S. markets such as China and Brazil and what we've been able to accomplish there. And we expect those trends to continue to be very positive. Obviously, we do have some dynamics, particularly to our portfolio within livestock with the impact of DRAXXIN. But overall the fundamentals in the industry are remaining positive. Profitability is up for many of our producers, which is also very encouraging for the overall industry, and we think will be positive for the longer-term outlook for livestock.
Operator: Next question is from Greg Gilbert with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.
Greg Fraser : It's Greg Fraser on for Greg Gilbert. On international livestock, obviously very robust growth in the quarter. And you spoke to the dynamics in China and some other markets. As the strong demand trends for the overall business continued in the second quarter? And how are you thinking about growth for international livestock for the full year?
Kristin Peck: Yes. So just when you look at our overall livestock portfolio globally, we grew about 8% this quarter. As you mentioned, that was really driven by the international growth of 17%. As we said in our February call, we do expect that globally, the livestock business will grow in the low single digits. That hasn't changed materially based on the strong performance that we saw in the first quarter. So with that growth, we would expect international livestock to grow more rapidly than the U.S., really driven by the dynamics with China and Brazil, but still expecting low single-digit growth for our livestock business for the year.
Operator: Navaan Ty with Citi. Please go ahead.
Navaan Ty: Actually, my question has been partly answered this. Could you comment on maybe the pet ownership and the average revenue per companion animal going forward and longer term? And remember, we expected growth to moderate once we all return to the office. Do you have updated thoughts on that front?
Kristin Peck: Sure. Thanks. As you think about pet care, we've been having a few quarters with 10% or higher revenue per visit. That has been -- continued to be sustained. We think the trends driving this is the increased pet ownership, which hasn't changed. There was a little bit of a fear, as we were in Q3 of last year with a lot of these dogs being returned or cats returned or re-homed, and we really haven't seen a significant trend there. So we think the increased pet ownership even if people go back to work, most people are going to have flexible arrangements. They're still going to be home with their pet more than probably they were before. And they build a bond with those pets and they notice things and they build habits that we think will be sustained as we do that. And again, the other important trend here is who is owning these pets? Millennials and Gen Z, who tend to spend more pet. So we really continue to see pet ownership trends and spend for pet continuing. I mean is it going to be 10% every quarter? I'm not so sure. But historically just to remind you, I think it was 5% to 6% historically. So it's still a very strong growth driver overall for the industry, and I think these trends may be higher than what it historically has been on a go-forward basis, just given who's adopting the pets and increased focus on the pet is an important part of the family.
Operator: We'll go next to David Steinberg with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
David Steinberg: I just had one question to follow up on potential Trio competition. A year ago, you were expecting competition I think the second half of this year. And then you pushed it into next year and now second half of next year. And so just curious, I know you said you have limited visibility, but what do you think the sources of the delay might be? Would it be technical manufacturing or formulation issues or heightened regulatory issues, delays in inspection or FDA looking for different things. Just curious since you initially thought it would be relatively soon, what could be the technical and regulatory issues surrounding the potential delay in the launch of competitive.
Kristin Peck: Thanks, David. I have to say you have a very good list there of potential reasons. I mean the honest answer is we don't really know why there are specific delays? And are they dissimilar delays for different companies. It's very difficult for us to assess that. There's not a lot of great details information. So I mean our list of the ones that we consider were all the ones you just mentioned, to be perfectly honest. But which one it is for which company? I'm not really sure. I mean some -- maybe because they launched their first litter, for example, one of the companies. But for the others, it's not exactly clear exactly what is driving those delays. So I wish I could be a little more helpful here, but honestly we don't really know.
Operator: It appears we have no further questions. I'll return the floor to our speakers for any closing remarks.
Kristin Peck: Okay. Well, thanks for your questions today and for your continued interest in Zoetis. We look forward to keeping you updated as our business throughout the year and continue to deliver our results and innovations that you and our customers expect. So thanks so much. And stay well, everybody.
Operator: And this will conclude today's program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-02-16 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020 Financial Results Conference Call and Webcast for Zoetis. Hosting the call today is Steve Frank, Vice President of Investor Relations for Zoetis. The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, and will not be forwarded automatically. In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call via dial-in information or on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. The floor will be opened for your questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.
Steve Frank: Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Zoetis fourth quarter and full year 2020 earnings call. I am joined today by Kristin Peck, our Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn David, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statement in today's press release and our SEC filings including, but not limited to our Annual Report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q. Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and in the company's 8-K filing dated today, February 16, 2021. We also cite operational results which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. And with that, I will turn the call over to Kristin.
Kristin Peck: Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. I hope you and your loved ones are all staying healthy. As we all know, we're still experiencing hard times in many regions, as COVID cases continue and new variants of the virus emerge. But I hope you share my optimism that with progress in vaccinations and continued adherence to safety protocols, better days are ahead. The year 2020 will be remembered for COVID-19, but for Zoetis it also reaffirms the resilience of our business, the essential nature of animal health and the agility and dedication of our colleagues in the face of industry and personal challenges. Throughout the year, we successfully ensured colleagues' safety and maintained reliable supply for our customers. We kept driving innovation and strengthening our diverse portfolio of 13 blockbusters and more than 300 product lines across eight species and seven major product categories. We successfully launched our triple combination parasiticide Simparica Trio. We also achieved approvals for the first ever long acting monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain in dogs and cats, with Librela’s authorization for dogs in the European Union and several other markets, and Solensia’s first authorization for cats in Switzerland. We also continue to build on our vaccine portfolio in livestock with the approval of our CircoMax [Myco] [ph] swine vaccine in the European Union. And in poultry, we continued advancing our recombinant vector vaccine with the approval of Poulvac Procerta HVT-IBD in the U.S. Meanwhile, in diagnostics, we successfully launched Vetscan Imagyst, our breakthrough platform using cloud-based artificial intelligence for veterinary clinics. We were able to do all this while staying anchored to our purpose, and advancing the five long-term priorities that I set out at the beginning of the year, including sustainability, where we made important progress in our ESG programs and metrics reporting. We look forward to sharing our long-term ESG goals in the coming weeks. And finally, we delivered financial results for 2020 that were in line with the guidance we provided last February before the impact of the global pandemic was known. For the full year, we generated 9% operational growth in revenue, primarily based on new products in our companion animal business, the continued strength of our key dermatology portfolio and growth in China. And as part of our long-term value proposition, we once again grew revenues faster than the anticipated growth for 2020 and faster than the historical industry rates of 4% to 6%. As part of our value proposition, we also delivered on growing our adjusted net income faster than revenue. For the full year, we delivered operational growth of 10% in adjusted net income while adapting our operations within pandemic, and continuing investments in our pipeline and new product launches. We generated strong fourth quarter results, which Glenn will discuss in a minute. And these performance trends give us confidence in our growth drivers and strong momentum for 2021. We expect to continue growing revenue faster than the market in 2021, driven by ongoing strength in pet care, continued expansion in markets outside the U.S., most notably China, and acceleration of our diagnostics portfolio penetration. We are guiding to operational growth of 9% to 11% in revenue for full year 2021. Growth expectations for the companion animal market are in the mid single digits. And we expect [indiscernible] to grow significantly faster than that based on the continued uptake of Simparica Trio, the strength of our key dermatology portfolio and the launch of monoclonal antibodies in markets outside the U.S. Positive pet care trends during the pandemic based on increased adoptions and people spending more time with their pets should continue driving market growth in the near-term. Data in the U.S. shows visits to veterinary clinics have rebounded and the average revenue per visit has continued to increase. Over the long-term, we see these trends moderating as adoption rates normalize and people eventually returned to the workplace. The specialty care regimen and chronic care treatment that began in the pandemic should continue, and our innovative portfolio across dermatology, parasiticide, pain, vaccines and diagnostics have us well positioned for continued growth [impacting] [ph] share as we shift the curve. In terms of livestock market, we expect low single digit market growth in 2021, as the impact from COVID-19 will still be felt as a number of products experienced loss of exclusivity. We expect the [indiscernible] to grow in line with the market, even as we face increased headwinds from generic competition for Draxxin, our leading anti-infective product. We are confident we can leverage our lifecycle innovation strategies together with the overall diversity of our livestock portfolio, including swine product sales in China, to help us address the loss of exclusivity for Draxxin and maintain livestock growth that will support our 2021 guidance. Longer-term, we will continue to invest in livestock innovations and data-driven animal agricultural solutions. As we continue through 2021, we will be building on the progress against our five priorities; driving innovative growth, enhancing customer experience, leading in digital and data analytics, cultivating a high-performing organization and championing a healthier, more sustainable future. Our investment plans and focus on growth for 2021 include continuing the successful launch of Simparica Trio in the U.S. and other markets, as well as the ongoing adoption of other new parasiticide, Revolution Plus and ProHeart 12. Driving growth in dermatology through increased use of direct-to-consumer advertising and disease awareness campaigns in the U.S. and globally. Our focus remains on growing this market and increasing customer loyalty to our innovative treatments, which we expect to help us top $1 billion in annual sales for the first time. As noted earlier, we'll be investing in the launch of the first monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain in dogs and cats in Europe in the first half of 2021, and advancing the regulatory process in the U.S. and other markets. While we remain confident in the eventual U.S. approval of these products based on the safety and efficacy data we submitted, at this point, we believe it is unlikely we will receive approvals for Solensia or Librela in the U.S. in 2021. We continue to work through regulatory reviews and manufacturing inspections with the FDA, and we will continue to keep you updated on this process on future calls. And finally, we're continuing our development of digital and data solutions that will support more individualized animal care and more efficient and sustainable operations for producers. In conclusion, I'm incredibly proud of what our people accomplished in the face of such uncertainty during 2020, and it gives me great confidence in our continued success and full year guidance for 2021. As we navigate through recovery from the global pandemic and capitalize on the growth opportunities we see ahead, but optimism comes from what drove us over the last year. The resilience and essential nature of the animal health industry, the diversity, innovation, and market leadership of our portfolio, and the agility and passion of our colleagues to face any challenge. Now, let me hand it off to Glenn, who will speak more about our fourth quarter results and guidance for the full year 2021.
Glenn David: Thank you, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. We had another exceptional year with revenue of $6.7 billion and adjusted net income of $1.8 billion, both exceeding the high-end of our November full year guidance range. Full year revenue grew 9% operationally and 7% on a reported basis, with adjusted net income increasing 10% operationally and 5% on a reported basis. Going deeper into the numbers, price contributed 2% to full year operational revenue growth with volume contributing 7%. Volume growth consisted of 3% from new products, 3% from key dermatology products and 1% from acquisitions with other in line products flat for the year. We again saw broad-based revenue growth with U.S. growing 11% and international growing 7%, operationally. The innovation we brought to the market and the diversity of our portfolio was key to our strong performance, as companion animal grew 17% while livestock was flat on a year-over-year basis. Performance from companion animal was led by our parasiticide portfolio bolstered by the launch of Simparica Trio, which generated revenue of $170 million. This added approximately $150 million of incremental revenue and exceeded our expectations set prior to the pandemic. Sales of Simparica also grew double digits for the year with operational revenue growth of 16%. Our key dermatology portfolio demonstrated continued strength in 2020, growing 23% operationally, generating revenue of $925 million and increasing more than $170 million versus prior year. The COVID-19 pandemic created a difficult market environment for livestock. However, we are encouraged by the resiliency displayed in 2020. We remain optimistic that global livestock will return to modest growth in 2021 as the recovery from African swine fever in China continues and consumption patterns normalize. Operational growth and adjusted net income of 10% was driven mainly by strong revenue growth and operating margin expansion. Now moving on to our Q4 financial results, where we posted another strong quarter with revenue of $1.8 billion, representing an increase of 9% operationally and 8% reported. Adjusted net income of $438 million is an increase of 3% operationally and flat on a report basis. Operational revenue grew 9% with 2% from price and 7% from volume. Volume growth of 7% consisted of 4% from new products, 3% from key dermatology products, 1% from acquisitions and a decline of 1% from other in line products. Companion animal products led the way in terms of species growth, growing 25% operationally, while livestock declined 5% operationally in the quarter. Companion animal parasiticide grew 52% in the quarter, gaining market share in the U.S. of more than 7% in the flea, tick and heartworm segment versus the same period in the prior year. This includes the continued adoption of Simparica Trio which generated sales of $60 million in Q4. Our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint again had significant global growth in the quarter with $257 million of revenue, representing 27% operational growth versus an extremely difficult comparative period in which key derm grew 29% for the fourth quarter of last year. Our diagnostics portfolio again made positive contributions to revenue with reference lab expansion and double-digit growth in consumable and instrument revenue. The recovery in wellness visits continues to be a catalyst for growth following the slowdown from social distancing restrictions earlier in the year. As we noted on our previous earnings call, the early fall cattle run hold a portion of fourth quarter sales into the third quarter, leading to a weaker quarter in cattle than we would typically expect. This was the primary driver of the 5% operational decline in livestock for the fourth quarter. For the remainder of the livestock portfolio, swine posted a second consecutive quarter of growth. With the herd rebuild continue in key accounts as the market recovers from African Swine Fever in China. Our aquaculture business grew high-single digits in the quarter and along with swine partially offset the decline in cattle and poultry. Now moving on to revenue growth by segment in the quarter, U.S. revenue grew 11% with companion animal products growing 30% and livestock sales declining by 15%. For companion animal, the positive trends at the vet clinic continued in Q4 with patient visits up 2% and revenue per visit increasing by 13%. Companion animal growth in the quarter were driven by sales of our Simparica franchise, as well as key dermatology products. We maintained an increase investment in direct-to-consumer advertising in both therapeutic areas and continue to see a good return on that investment. Simparica Trio performed well again in the quarter, with sales of $56 million. We remain extremely encouraged for the future growth of our product and the growth of the overall market segment as a material portion of Trio sales came from new patients to the category. Key dermatology sales were $176 million for the quarter, growing 32% with significant growth for Apoquel and Cytopoint. Our investments to support the franchise have been instrumental in driving more patients into the clinics. Companion animal diagnostics sales increased 22% in the quarter as a result of reconciled expansion and growth in point of care instruments and consumables. U.S. livestock declined 15% in the quarter driven primarily by cattle, which had a portion of Q4 sales pulled into the third quarter as a result of the earlier movement from pasture to feedlot. The remaining species declined as well with COVID-19 and pricing pressure negatively impacting our swine business. Poultry declines are largely attributed to product rotation and less producer profitability, leading to reduced usage of our premium products. To summarize U.S. performance innovation and return on investment, once again drove exceptionally strong growth in companion animal, while livestock was down in the quarter, the results were in line with our expectations. Revenue in our international segment grew 7% operationally in the quarter. Companion animal revenue grew 17% operationally and livestock revenue grew 2% operationally. Increased sales of companion animal products resulted from growth in our parasiticide portfolio, vaccines and key dermatology products. Parasiticide growth in the quarter was again driven by comparative franchise with further adoption of Simparica Trio. In Q4 we observed a series of favorable market trends, such as increased pet ownership and medicalization rates in Asia. Overall companion animal grew in every major market except Italy and the UK, which had arguably the strictest lockdown protocols. Companion animal diagnostics grew 16% in the quarter led by an increase in point of care consumable usage. Swine revenue grew 14% operationally, posting a third consecutive quarter of double digit growth. Swine sales in China grew in excess of a 100% for the second straight quarter. Key accounts expanded their use of vaccines and other products as they continue to rebuild herds from smaller farms to large scale operations. China, total products grew 45% operationally in the quarter and 34% operationally for 2020. Brazil was also a significant contributor to international growth in the quarter, growing 18% operationally. For the fourth quarter and full year 2020, Brazil delivered double digit growth in all species except poultry, which modestly declined. Overall, our International segment delivered strong results despite the challenges presented by COVID-19. Our diversity across products and geographies enabled our International segment to again be a significant driver of growth. Now moving on to the rest of the P&L for the quarter, adjusted gross margin of 67.7%, fell 80 basis points in a reported basis compared to the prior year resulting from other manufacturing costs, inventory charges, recent acquisitions and elevated freight expense. This was partially offset by favorable product mix and price increases. Adjusted operating expenses increased 10% operationally, resulting from increased advertising and promotion expense with Simparica Trio and Apoquel, partially offset by T&E savings. Return on investment from our DTC campaigns has been very favorable and we remain – and will remain an important investment to support future growth of the business. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 13.5%, a decrease of 70 basis points driven by the impact of net the discrete tax benefits, partially offset by jurisdictional mix of earnings. And finally adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS for the quarter grew 3% operationally. In December, we announced 25% annual dividend increase continuing our commitment to grow our dividend at or faster than the growth in adjusted net income. In addition, we resumed our share repurchase program in January with $1.4 billion of remaining capacity under the current authorization. Now moving on to the guidance for 2021, please note the guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late January. For 2021, we are projecting revenue between $7.4 billion and $7.55 billion, representing 9% to 11% operational growth. We are expecting foreign exchange favorability in 2021 of approximately 200 basis points. We expect companion animal to be the primary driver of growth in 2021 with the continued strength of our diversed parasiticide portfolio which includes full year of Simparica Trio sales. We believe market dynamics for companion animal will remain strong in 2021, allowing for further expansion of our key dermatology products, as well as our diagnostics offerings, which we anticipate will grow faster than the overall animal health market. While we expect the pace of certain trends that accelerated in 2020 to moderate, such as increased spend per visit. Our view is that 2020 has a status of the higher base for future growth. We anticipate livestock will return to global growth in 2021, primarily driven by more normalized food consumption patterns. Geographically, we expect total company sales growth to be relatively balanced between our U.S. and International segments. However, we do expect continued and meaningful growth in China and other emerging markets. I'd like to touch upon the key assumptions that underpin our expectations for revenue growth. Beginning with dermatology, our guidance does not assume a meaningful competitive entry in 2021. And with continued investments behind the franchise, we believe revenue will exceed $1 billion for the full year. We also do not assume the triple combination product will launch in the U.S. in 2021 to compete against Simparica Trio. We're extremely excited about our monoclonal antibodies for pain, with both Librela and Solensia having long-term blockbuster potential. However, as Kristin mentioned, while both products will launch in the first half of 2021 in the EU and other international markets, we do not currently expect either product to receive approval in the U.S. this year. For the remainder of the P&L, adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue is expected to be approximately 30%, which is relatively consistent with our cost of sales in 2020. Adjusted SG&A expenses for the year are expected to be between $1.775 billion and $1.85 billion. With the increase in 2020 focused on supporting primary drivers of revenue growth, including recent and future product launches, key brands and recent acquisitions, and reference lab expansion in diagnostics. Adjusted R&D expense for 2021 is expected to be between $500 million and $520 million as we remain committed to investing in pipeline opportunities for new therapies and life cycle innovation. Adjusted interest and other incomes deductions is expected to be approximately $260 million with the increase over 2020 driven by increased interest expense, as well as lower interest income. Our adjusted effective tax rate for 2021 is expected to be approximately 20%. The increase in 2021 is primarily related to the impact of favorable non-recurring discrete items that occurred in 2020. Adjusted net income is expected to be in a range of $2.08 billion to $2.13 billion, representing operational growth of 9% to 12%. Our guidance reflects our value proposition of growing revenue in line with or faster than the market and growing adjusted net income faster than revenue, during the year when we'll be making meaningful investments to support future growth. Consistent with 2020, we are anticipating elevated capital expenditures in 2021 to support investments in manufacturing, focused on internal sourcing of API, capacity increases and facilities to support pipeline opportunities. We're also investing in information technology to support our recent acquisitions, as well as digital capabilities and data analytics. Finally, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.36 to $4.46 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.02 to $4.14. While guidance represents full-year expectations, we do anticipate growth will be more heavily weighted towards the first half of the year. This is largely due to full-year Simparica Trio sales and a favorable comparison versus Q2 2020 as a result of COVID-19. To summarize 2020 was another exceptional year in which we delivered 9% operational revenue growth and 10% operational growth and adjusted net income. And the year represented a unique set of challenges. Our guidance for 2021 highlights our ability to grow revenue organically above the market and grow adjusted net income faster than revenue even during times of elevated investment. Before turning it over to Q&A, I'd like to express how proud I am of our colleagues and all we've accomplished amidst an unprecedented set of circumstances. While there is no assurance that the New Year will be without similar challenges faced in 2020, we cannot be more excited about the opportunity to again deliver on our long-term shareholder value proposition. Now I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And then we will take our first question from Jon Block with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Jon Block: Thanks, guys. Good morning. Congrats on just a great 2020. For the quarter, 4Q 2020 gross margins were a bit below despite big companion animal growth. And next year it seems like you're guiding to flattish, call it, gross margins again, despite what seems like positive mix shifts. So, Glenn, can you talk about that a bit? Why are we not seeing a bit more in gross margin considering the companion animal performance? And is expanding gross margin still a part of the long-term story? And then I'll stick with sort of guidance. Just really big hummers on 2021 guidance out of the gate. You talked about livestock versus companion. Can you talk through the components of companion animal a little bit more? I don't know if I specifically heard a Trio number, but is it safe to assume Trio of $400 million plus in any other components you’d call out? Thanks, guys.
Glenn David: Sure, Jon. So firstly, you look at the gross margin expectation for 2021. It is relatively flat versus 2020. As you mentioned, the mix with companion animal will be beneficial as we move into 2021. Some of the offsets to that, there were some of the investments that we're making in other areas such as reference labs, which come at a lower margin, particularly in the early stage of their life cycle is we're building those labs, [indiscernible] the margins will be a little lower until they reach their full operating scale. So that's some of the offsets. So there are some positives in terms of the companion animal mix. Some offsets there with some of the longer terms we’re investing and making in other areas. In terms of the drivers of companion animal growth, so obviously we do expect Trio to be a significant driver of growth for 2021. We're not putting a specific number on Trio, but we would expect the contribution from growth in 2021 to be at least as big as what we achieved in 2020. So that'll obviously be one of the drivers, also continued growth in our dermatology portfolio. We saw very strong performance in 2020 with 23% growth in that portfolio operationally for the year. We do expect that portfolio will exceed $1 billion as we move into 2021. Also in companion animal diagnostics, we expect very rapid growth in diagnostics as well. In the fourth quarter, we saw 20% growth and we expect that will help carry us forward with the strong momentum that we had in the quarter into 2021, as well as strong performance that we're seeing in many of our emerging markets, such as China and Brazil. So those are some of the factors that are driving the strong companion animal growth.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Michael Ryskin: Hey, thanks, guys. I'm going to ask a quick two-parter. First one is going to be on the livestock market, and just specifically on Draxxin. Are you starting to see some competition? I know the patent has just rolled off, but any early comments you can tell us in terms of pricing from competing launches and sort of [indiscernible] expectation of the market share? But also what steps you are taking? And how meaningful the headwind do you expect in 2021? And then broader on livestock, we've read a lot about input costs going higher on corn, things of that potentially pressuring producers in some markets, poultry and swine. How does that factor into your outlook for a low single digit growth? And then a second question would be just a little bit more on the companion animal expectations for 2021. I mean, obviously, you're growing well above the market, but any thoughts on sort of in line portfolio? And you commented on Trio, and you commented on strong derm strength, and that you see in Librela. But just can you sort of comment on Revolution Plus and on the rest of the in line portfolio there?
Kristin Peck: Thanks, Mike. So starting on Draxxin, we are expecting a number of competitors to enter in the U.S. market. Again, the LOE is this month, so it hasn't happened yet. I would say more probably entrants than we expected a few months ago, but we don't think that will last. Obviously, I think the market will shake out obviously to a few. As we said previously, typically, we expect about - to lose about 20% to 40% share over several years. In the case of Draxxin, given the large number of competitors, we do expect that to be factor, but we don't really expect it to be overall different. And really partly what drives that I think is we do believe that a lower price on Draxxin will expand the market for macrolides overall, and therefore the market itself will grow. We also think we're positioned well from a broad portfolio, strong technical. We do expect that the price to come down in that 20% to 40% that is an expectation. But as we said, this is all baked in right now to our guidance, so the expectation around where Draxxin is going to be is there. And if you look at broader livestock, you referenced some of the [info] [ph] costs. As you heard in some of our opening remarks, we are expecting low single digit growth, so a return to growth in livestock overall. And some of that will be led in the U.S. [indiscernible] a lot of that will be led outside the U.S. As a reminder, about 60% of our livestock business is outside of the U.S. and we're seeing incredible growth right now in China and some other markets, Brazil, et cetera. So overall, we do think some of the [info] [ph] costs in U.S. will be a pressure, but we have, given the diversity of our portfolio, looking at some large markets, our second largest market is China, our third largest market is Brazil, we do see strength in livestock there. So we overall do believe livestock will return to low single digit growth in 2021. And we continue to believe it will return to normal growth in the mid single digit range 4% to 6% over the medium term. So, Glenn, I'm not sure if you want to take the incremental question on the broad companion animal trends in 2021.
Glenn David: Yes. So the trends for companion animal will remain very strong. It's really driven by the breadth of our portfolio. So we talked a lot about the growth that we expect to see from Trio from our derm portfolio, from our diagnostics portfolio. Also in 2021, we'll have the launch of our monoclonal antibodies for pain in Europe, as well as some other markets. We’ll also be a key contributor to growth. But then there are other products that round out the portfolio; products such as ProHeart 12, products such as Revolution Plus. Also the growth that we're seeing in markets like China, where companion animal is growing very rapidly, markets like Brazil. So there are really many areas of growth that we see. And that's driven by the fact and we do have the broadest portfolio in companion animal. We're able to leverage that with our customers.
Operator: And our next question comes from Louise Chen with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.
Louise Chen: Hi, thanks for taking my question. So what are the macro factors that you see for Zoetis in 2021, as it pertains to livestock feed prices, weather, any other headwinds or tailwinds that you see out there? Thank you.
Kristin Peck: Sure, Louise. Good to hear from you. As you look at livestock overall, we're seeing some of the macro trends as sort of a recovery in China around AFS is driving significant portion of the growth from a swine perspective. China is still going to be importing a decent amount probably less than in 2020 from other markets around the world sort of maintaining that. We're also hopeful that you'll see an increase in dine out, which will send a signal to the industry to expand herds. So I mean 2020 was obviously hit with many different factors, but we do see both an increase in demand. And in markets where our technologies have really leveraged some of the emerging markets, we're seeing significant uptick there. There will remain challenges in some of the U.S. producers, obviously, for some of the [info] [ph] costs, et cetera, but we do believe you'll see more of a return to normalcy as we move into 2021. And that's why we were guiding at sort of the low single digit, but we do believe in the medium-term, we'll be back to sort of a mid single digit overall.
Operator: And our next question comes from Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Erin Wright: Thanks. I'm curious how the multi-formulation approach towards parasiticide is resonating across your customer base. I guess this is [indiscernible] you haven't had any strength historically [indiscernible] cannibalization of legacy products there playing out in line with your expectations? And then my second question is on the new pain meds. How should we think about the contributions from them this year in Europe or other countries, will be meaningful at all? And how should we think about the dynamics that are impacting approval in the U.S.? Do you still anticipate? Are you still confident that these will be blockbuster products for you with the launch in the U.S. in 2022?
Kristin Peck: Thanks, Erin. I heard the second question on labs, which I can answer. You were breaking up in digitizing on the first question. I think we more or less have it, so let us give a shot, and you can comment if we missed out some of what we heard. So starting on your second question on the labs, we were very excited to now have Librela approved and launching in the first half of this year in the EU, Brazil, Canada and Switzerland. And Solensia, we continue to expect approval in the EU in the first half of this year and to be launching sort of mid-year. We already do have approval on Solensia in Switzerland. And we remain confident in the eventual approval based on the safety and efficacy data we submitted in the U.S. But if you saw in our remarks and our release, the approval timeline has moved out a bit. We believe this has to do with the fact that this is the first monoclonal antibody approved by the FDA in animal health. Our previous one Cytopoint was actually USDA. It's making it a little harder for us honestly to predict some of the regulatory process. We're continuing to work through the regulatory process and manufacturing inspections, and we'll continue to keep you updated. We don't think that changes the overall peak sales of this product at all, but it is a slightly different process. And I guess, Glenn, might have understood a little bit better, but we'll try your first question. I know we missed it.
Glenn David: Yes. So, Erin, I think your question was around how we're performing with the breadth of our portfolio from parasiticide with our customers. And I think that's going very well in the veterinary clinics. We're really able to offer our customers a variety of options based on how they want to best treat the animals. And I think that shows in the performance that we saw on the Simparica franchise in 2020. Not only did we exceed our goals for Trio with $170 million in sales in the year, but we also saw significant growth in Simparica, which really exceeded our expectations. So we grew operationally 16% with Simparica. What we saw was that the advertising and driving patients into the clinic for Simparica Trio actually benefited the overall portfolio. We also saw a very positive growth in ProHeart 12 as well. So we think the breadth of the portfolio and the parasiticides was really a benefit and our field colleagues really able to execute very well with that portfolio.
Kristin Peck: Was that your question? Did we get it all? All right, you can come back in the queue. We missed you, sorry about that and look a little bit digital.
Operator: Okay. We'll take our next question from John Kreger with William Blair. Please go ahead.
John Kreger: Hi, thanks very much. Just maybe a quick follow-up on the Librela and Solensia timeline in the U.S. Do you have a sense for how far pushed back the approval of timing might be? And do you think you need to collect additional clinical data?
Kristin Peck: Yes. We don't have a great sense right now. We're still working through the regulatory and manufacturing process. We also – the FDA is going to require inspections. Our facilities are outside the U.S. So the exact timing of when they're going to be able to do that is a little bit uncertain. So I don't have a great sense. If we did, we would have obviously given more specific guidance. We do not expect it to be in 2021, which is what we're being fair right now. And as soon as we know more, we'll be happy to update in future calls going forward, but unfortunately I don't have greater – again, we remain very confident that it will eventually be approved. But we need to go through a new process with a regular that hasn't an animal health under CBM approved in monoclonal antibodies previously. So it's a little bit different for us. So this is the best we know at this point.
John Kreger: Great. Thank you. And then a second question. Can you maybe just sort of frame the diagnostics plan for 2021? It seems like results are starting to accelerate there. Are any of the investments being focused in the livestock? Should we really think about your efforts right now being concentrated with companion animal?
Kristin Peck: Sure. For 2021, our focus remains on companion animals. We're very pleased with our progress on placements, which is a really good leading indicator of usage. As you saw, we had double-digit consumable growth as well, which we're quite pleased with. As we look at new products, we've added the Imagyst platform. We're excited with its first indication, obviously in fecal, that's the AI-powered one. We're looking for additional indications there. So the last piece there would also be reference labs. So we're continuing to expand our U.S. reference lab. So we’re probably adding about three to five more labs this year. So we believe diagnostics is a core part of our portfolio. It's a market that grows at 10%, but we're really pleased that we're starting to see some strong momentum across the different parts of it. So both reference lab as well as placements as well as consumables. So we remain very committed to the space and are pleased with our progress over there.
Operator: And our next question comes from David Westenberg with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.
David Westenberg: Hi. Thank you for taking the questions and congrats on a great year. Can you give us a little bit of flavor on where Trio is taking share from? I think you mentioned there's some new to the category, but I'm just kind of trying to get a flavor is it legacy – just legacy flea and tick? I mean, what component is heartworm? And basically, what I'm trying to do is get a good sense of how big this can grow in terms of both the heartworm market and the flea and tick market? And then just a second related question on Trio. Is there any synergies, particularly on the sales synergy from the direct-to-consumer marketing campaigns, you might be able to benefit maybe derm or maybe even there's a cost synergy? So thank you very much.
Kristin Peck: Sure. So starting on the Trio, we did see an increase in share in Q4 of 7%. So we are taking share in a number of places that's coming from. If you think about it, the first is new poppies, where I think we're doing quite well with new I think poppies. Also new people to the category overall, I would say, people who maybe previously had gotten products over the counter are moving in. And we are taking share from some of the other established competitors in this space. So I think we're seeing strong growth overall, I would say there and pleased at our share. If you look at the potential for the product, the two competitors NexGard and Prosecco are each $600 million products a day. So we continue to believe there's significant growth. We remain under index to be honest with you in parasiticide. So we continue to see this as a significant part of our overall growth From a sense – are there synergies with derm? Not really is what I would say, except for on a cost side. Obviously, we can get better buying power when you replace DTCs by leveraging the spend across both. But beyond that, we don't see strong synergies honestly between the DTC on one affecting the other, unless our clinic has to carry bolts and things like that, but we think maybe the only synergy there is just in our buying power by leveraging the combined DTC sense.
Operator: Now we can go to our next question from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Nathan Rich: Hi, good morning. Thanks for the questions. Kristin, maybe to start, what do you think the launch curve looks like for products like Librela and Solensia? Obviously, a new way for vets that treat osteoarthritis and chronic pain. I guess kind of what are your initial kind of impressions on sort of the level of demand that's out there from vets for this type of treatment? And how will Librela be priced relative to existing treatments on the market? I know it can be kind of up to $100 a month here in the U.S. I'm sure it varies a lot by market, but just any comment on pricing would be helpful.
Kristin Peck: Sure. I think the lifecycle for Librela and Solensia in the curve will be a slightly different. Librela is entering a market that's $400 million today. So it's an established market. So I think the ability for – people are already bringing their dogs in for OA pain. So I think we have the opportunity with Librela to expand the number of patients given the safety and efficacy profile and the compliance benefits of the product. I think we can also increase days on therapy. So it also helps us to grow the market and then obviously price to your point. So it is priced at a premium to many of the products on the market today. It is not – obviously, we don't have a price in the U.S. since we don't even have an approval yet in the U.S. I think Solensia is going to be a little bit different because the curve is going to take a little longer. And that has to do the fact that there really isn't a market today in most parts of the world. If you had a cat, there really was no treatment, so cat owners have kind of been condition to not bring their cats in. We've started focusing, about a year ago to try to build that market, make pet owners aware what OA pain looks like in cats and get – encourage them to start bringing their cats to the vet, and then getting vets to treat that. We think it's a significant market, but you have to first medicalize some of these conditions and treat it. It's significant. There's 60 million cats in the us U.S. And really only – but 40% of them have away, but only 18% of them are really identified by that. So we think both are significant markets that we can grow the market. So Solensia is more about creating a market. And I think you can look at our success in doing that with dermatology with Apoquel and Cytopoint. So we're investing early as Glenn has been talking about some of the guidance over the last year and for 2021 and building those markets. But I would assume the curves of Librela will be much faster than the curves of Solensia as we're building a market.
Operator: And our next question comes from Balaji Prasad with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Balaji Prasad: Hi. Good morning and congratulations on the results. A couple of questions from me. Firstly, since livestock recovery this year seems to be so contingent on China. And there are news of regulatory of illegal vaccines being used and the recurrence of ACF. So I want to understand what you're seeing on the ground and how should we have our heads around the re-hurting cycling in 2021? Second on operating margins, considering that you will not have the dilutive impact of diagnosis that we saw in 2020. Should we be looking for better operating margins considering that revenue mix is better? Livestock should be in a recovery? And if so, what are the offsets to this. Thanks.
Glenn David: Sure. So when you look at overall livestock, and particularly in China, so we've seen very positive performance in livestock in China this year. So from a livestock perspective, we grew 45% in China this year and we expect continued strong performance in China in 2021 as we continue to see the herd rebuild, recovery from African swine fever. And where we're seeing that recovery is particularly in our larger accounts and the larger accounts use more of the multinational products than our premium products. So we've seen a really rapid acceleration of our growth, for example, in the second half of the year in swine in particular in 2020, we grew over 100% in swine in China. And we expect very positive momentum moving into 2021 and very significant growth from China in 2021. In terms of the operating margins, there are a couple of things to look at as we move into 2021. A, number of areas of investments that we have in our SG&A, really continuing to support the growth of Trio as well as the monoclonal antibodies for pain as well as dermatology. We've increased our DTC investment in 2020, particularly around Trio and derm, and we plan on continuing that in 2021, as we saw very positive return on investment there. Obviously, we'll continue to invest in R&D. And that'll be an area of continued investment as we've seen a very positive return on that investment as well. The other thing to consider when you look at the overall guidance, which – with revenue growing 9% to 11% and income growing 9% to 12%; one of the reasons that income isn't growing more rapidly is the change in assumption in tax rate between 2020 and 2021. In 2020, our rate was 18.3%. Our guidance for 2021 is approximately 20%. If you neutralize for the impact of the tax rate, our adjusted net income would actually be growing 2% faster, so more 11% to 14%. So we are seeing margin expansion, but the impact of the tax rate is diluting that to some degree.
Operator: And we'll go next to Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Chris Schott: Great. Thanks so much. Can you talk, first, maybe a bit about innovation on the livestock side? It seems like the market between COVID and similar dynamics has been kind of a bit lackluster in terms of growth the last few years. So what does it take to get back to mid single digit growth on the livestock side? And what are some of the bigger innovation trends we should be watching there? And then a second question was just following up on the topic of margins. As we start looking after 2022 and beyond, should we be thinking about a sustained window of higher expense growth as you get many of these new launches off the ground? Or as a lot of that groundwork already been, I guess, invested as we go into 2020 and 2021? I'm trying to get a sense of how we should think about longer-term margin expansion dynamics, assuming we continue this very healthy top line set up that seems to be playing out. Thanks so much.
Kristin Peck: Thanks Chris. We have been talking about the fact that to really get to the mid-single digits in a sustainable way. You're going to need innovation. I think there are few spaces where you're already starting to see that and some that will be coming. The first is around the vector vaccine space, which we have been talking about. In 2020, we launched our first one in the U.S. for Newcastle. In 2021, we launched one for IBV. We're looking for more launches there. This is a significant market, it’s about a $300 million market growing double digit. So we do see vector technology and poultry, which is one of the faster growing, species being an area of innovation and growth for us. We also think more broadly that immunotherapies are going to be really important for two reasons. One, there are alternatives to antibiotics and secondly, healthier animals are more productive. So it also increases productivity for producers. So I think immunotherapies, which we've been working on for a while and have a partnership with Colorado state to develop will be important. The other sector that I think is really important to focus on is precision livestock farming which we also think has great potential. We're leaders right now in the genetic space there and genetic testing, we also purchased PLA as you know, we're looking at really back-to-back individual animal care and herd monitoring and I think that's probably the next big wave, that's probably more of a medium-term growth driver, but I think there's a number of spaces where you're going to see innovation at the livestock, across vectors, immunotherapies, and precision livestock farming. I'll let Glenn take the second question on long-term margin expansion.
Glenn David: Yes. So in terms of the long-term margin expenses, there are a couple of factors to consider. So for 2021, we mentioned that the gross margin is relatively flat and talked about some of the drivers of that with some of the investments we're making in reference labs, also the impact of the Draxxin LOE this year on gross margin. So as we move into the 2022 and beyond some of those impacts will be a little less than we would expect to see continued expansion in gross margin. In terms of the overall operating expenses, beyond 2021, obviously there will be one-year where T&E normalizes, when things get back to normal from COVID, but beyond that impact, we would expect that we would continue to be able to grow our expenses at a pace below that of revenue. So we'll probably continue to grow R&D in line with revenue. That may vary any given year based on the opportunities, but SG&A based on the infrastructure that we have globally established, we should be able to grow that somewhere between inflation and revenue. So we would expect to continue to see expansion there on an overall operating margin perspective.
Operator: Our next question will come from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
David Risinger: Yes, thanks very much. And let me add my congrats on another phenomenal year as well. So I have two questions first with respect to the monoclonal antibody approval delays. So it's for both cats and dogs, but it wasn't quite clear to me whether the FDA wants more clinical data or whether there are manufacturing issues because – manufacturing questions, because I think Kristin, you had mentioned manufacturing. So if you could just clarify on both of them what the FDA issues are, whether they're clinical or manufacturing? And then second. , Zoetis’s R&D has obviously been amazingly differentiated from competitors, struggled to bring blockbuster companion animal products to market, even including follow-ons to Zoetis’s top growth drivers over several years. And so considering that, can you just help us understand the unique aspects in Zoetis’s R&D and its ability to maintain separation from the competition? Thank you.
Kristin Peck: Sure. Thanks David. With regards to the monoclonal antibodies Librela and Solensia, it really is just working through the regulatory process and the questions that they're asking and they're requiring inspections of site. So at this point we have not been asked for any clinical data, but we're still in the regulatory process is what I was saying. It is the first time doing that with the FDA, so it's just a new process for both. Understandably it's the first time they're looking at some of these types of products, so they have a number of questions. So it really is just going through the regulatory review process and trying to manage new manufacturing inspections, which I do know probably the COVID is definitely affecting that a little bit, but we're just working through that. So at this point, we have not been asked for any additional clinical data and we don't think there's any manufacturing issue at this point. We're just still working through the review process and what their expectations are. With regards to Zoetis R&D, you know what I was saying is, I think it's the partnership between R&D, manufacturing and our commercial organization. It's taking those insights to the commercial as customer needs and partnering early on with R&D to develop products. I think the other thing we've done really well is partner with manufacturing to be able to scale those products and be able to bring them to market. We manufacture own monoclonal antibodies. As you know we've got very strong manufacturing capability, which is I think important for launching many of the products and scaling up at the level. We certainly learned the hard way early on in our journey about investing in that partnership, when we thought some of the challenges we had got supplying Apoquel. So I think from an R&D perspective, obviously I think we have great scientists, but I think it's the rigorous though process and partnership they have with our commercial and our manufacturing colleagues and our willingness to invest in disruptive technologies and take those risks that we've been doing. We've been managing over the last eight years. Anything you would add there Glenn?
Glenn David: I think it's exactly what you said, Kristin. We talked about the inter-connect capabilities between commercial manufacturing and R&D. And I think that works extremely well here. Like Kristin said, identifying what the key needs are in the marketplace, early on coming up with solutions and making sure that the products that we're able to manufacture and we've been very successful in doing that.
Operator: Our next question will come from Kathy Miner with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.
Kathy Miner: Good morning. Thank you. First question I have is relates again to the monoclonals. Can you just clarify when you talked about plant at-site inspections being needed is it correct then that both either one or both of the monoclonals are manufactured outside of the U.S.? The second question also on the products. Is the intention to launch both the cat and dog ones at the same time, is there an advantage to doing one or the other and we can speak just about the EU markets, where you have approval. And the second question on the derm products, you've targeted 1 billion in sales for this year. Can you talk about some of the drivers behind that? Is it outside of the U.S.? Is it more , et cetera? Thank you.
Kristin Peck: Sure. So first of all Kathy, great to hear from you. Secondly, on the math they are both the manufacturing facilities are different for them, but they are outside the U.S. And prior approval inspections, regulator can handle them differently, but they are going to be required probably for both of these products and they are both different, but they're both outside of the U.S. And I think your second question was around the derm sales growth in U.S. or ex-U.S. We still believe we're under penetrated outside the U.S. There’s the same number of dogs in the U.S. and outside of U.S. gets two-thirds of our sales in derm remain in the U.S. So we do there’s significant opportunity. It has been hard to get scale outside the U.S., historically mostly because we have been now able do direct-to-consumer advertising, that is brand specific. One of the investments we are going to make for the first time is doing just overall disease awareness in direct-to-consumer advertising in 2021. So we cannot be specific with brands, but in derm, we really are the only products. So hopefully if you raise awareness around a disease and that there are treatments you can encourage people to speak to their vet and get the best care. So that I think is one of the reasons why International, we are hoping will start to grow faster, but I have to give our U.S. team tremendous credit and they continue to grow the market. The investment in direct-to-consumer advertising, raising awareness to our products are bringing more pets in and getting more pets treated in. In the U.S., there are still 6 million dogs, who need our products or need a derm solution who aren't getting one. So we do believe there's still growth in the U.S., although we would expect, though I'm sure I know last years, we've seen very strong growth out of the U.S., we would expect over time for the U S growth start to decline the overall growth and more of the growth to come from international, but we still believe there's significant potential in both.
Operator: And our next question will come from Elliot Wilbur with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Elliot Wilbur: Thanks. Good morning. And congratulations on the strong performance of Trio in a challenging year. Kristin, just maybe want to dive in a little bit more on the launch details around the product. Seems like obviously one of the reasons for its relative success this year versus earlier expectations was just more or less cannibalization of Simparica than originally expected. But wondering if you could just share with those additional metrics in terms of where you are with respect to clinic penetration rates? How many targeted clinics have you been able to actually reach, just additional metrics around the uptake in launch would be helpful? Then just thinking about the product longer term, obviously very strong first year. Well, if I think about launching the logs on the human health side, I mean generally five years out, you're looking at something on the order of 6X to 10X, first year sales, not sure if that's applicable in the companion animal market, but just some thoughts in terms of maybe longer term launch analogs with respect to the product? Thanks.
Kristin Peck: Sure. With regards to the launch of Trio. I would say there's a lot of unique characteristics of the Trio launch. A, we launched at the height of the pandemic in the U.S. So I'm not sure how to compare that to other people's launches. We were slower to penetrate clinics, I would say in Q2 and Q3, but we're quite pleased that by the end of the year we reached all of our penetration goals. So I think our penetration has been quite strong, given the delay really the outperformance was our share once we were penetrated within the clinic, the ability to get more of the patients on our product has been really strong. And that gives us good confidence as we move into 2021. As Glenn mentioned a few minutes earlier, we are expecting a similar contribution. For starters, we'll have a Q1 where we didn't have sales last year, but with the penetration we were able to achieve by the end of the year, which is reaching the goals we had wanted. We think that we can just get the same pull through that we had at those clinics in 2021, we'll continue to see a great growth across with them there. We're also seeing it also pull our broader parasiticide portfolio. So I'm not sure I would say – I would use a human health analog, but I continue to remind everybody works. We remain under-penetrated in this space. And the herd is the single biggest category in the animal health space, it's $4 billion globally with $2.5 billion in the U.S. Continuing to see about 15% growth in Simparica beyond Trio, globally, it shows that there's significant opportunity here for us to continue to grow. And we were quite pleased if you looked at overall care, we had an increase in share of 7% in Q4. So we think we can continue to take share on this and grow it overall. So I'm not sure it looks like human health. But with our biggest competitors already being $600 million products. I think we've got strong ability to continue to grow as get at least our fair share in this space.
Glenn David: Yes. And the only thing, I have to add in terms of the question on peak sales. What becomes challenging with peak sales is the timing of competition and that remains unknown. Obviously for 2021, our current guidance does not expect another triple combo within the U.S. and the timing of that will obviously impact what our overall peak sales could be for the product.
Operator: And our next question will come from the Navin Jacob with UBS. Please go ahead.
Sriker Nadipuram: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question, this is Sriker Nadipuram on for Navin Jacob, I just have a couple of specific questions. Can you quantify that revenue impact in 2020 of the earlier fall cattle run? And do you expect this to recur – this adverse negative revenue impact you expect this to recur in 2021? And then can you quantify the difference in gross margin in diagnostics from your therapeutics portfolio or your corporate average? Thanks very much.
Glenn David: Yes. So in terms of the impact of the early fall cattle run for 2020, that did not have an impact for the year that was just the seasonal impact between Q3 and Q4. I think you saw the very strong performance in Q3, you saw the opposite occur in Q4 of this year, and then predicting seasonality of that in 2021 obviously is difficult, but we focus more on the full year obviously in terms of the overall impact. In terms of gross margin for the diagnostic business, we don't specifically provide gross margins by therapeutic area or by species. But overall we always say our companion animal business obviously has the higher margin, diagnostics in general is lower than some of our key therapeutic areas.
Operator: And our next question will come from David Steinberg with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
David Steinberg: Thanks. I have two questions. [indiscernible] one of the tailwinds from the pandemic, the increased adoptions around the country, around the world and in previous comments, I think you said there were about 3.2 million adoptions annual. I was just curious, now that 2020 is in the books, do you have any data, how many more adoptions there were last year? And the other tailwind, you've called out is just the increase in dollars per visit. And as most pet owners get vaccinated, they go back to work, how durable do you think both the increased dollars per visit and increased adoptions are. And is there any chance that could reverse when those people are back to the office? And a final question Trio, potential Trio competition, I think Glenn you said no expectations for competition this year, you previously said no competition in the first half of this your, when do you actually, I know it's murky, but when do you actually think there might be your first competitor and also what gives you such great confidence that there would not be any competition in 2021, I simply asked that because it was such a successful launch , it's obviously a target for competitors? Thanks.
Kristin Peck: Sure. with regards to pet adoption, there are 135 million pets in the U.S. In a typical year, you see about 3.2 million adoptions. So even a 10% increase in that isn't going to dramatically change things, but we are seeing an increase in vet visits which we think is a positive trend. And we do expect that to continue in 2021. So as Glenn mentioned earlier, we did see a 2% increase in vet visits in Q4. We are expecting that to continue. So I think you are seeing maybe a proportional to what were the incremental pets that were adopted. We don't have very specific numbers, but, I would say assume it's somewhere between like 2% and 10% there, it'll be helpful. And I do think we're going to continue to see an increase in visits. You asked us well about spend per visit, which was incredibly strong in 2020. We don't believe it's going to remain that strong to be honest with you. We still think it will grow. If you look generally speaking at our space, we've seen overall revenues of clinics growing in the mid-to-high single digits on normal year. I'm not sure what 2021 is going to look like, but assuming it's somewhere close to a normal year, we do think you're going to see strong growth overall there in spend, overall revenue in the vet clinic, both with growth in total number of visits, as well as a spend per visit. With regards to the trio questions on competition. We don't have the visibility that human health has as to when we'll get competitors. To be very frank, we would have expected a competitor by now. We would have expected one in derm as well. So we're not exactly sure what the challenge is, but we don't have a great way of knowing other than rumor mill in the market and strategic accounts who often try to renegotiate with us when they think a competitor is entering the market, which we haven't seen yet, that does not mean that, someone couldn't surprise us. So there could be, but we want it to be clear what our guidance was based on. So at this point, given we don't have any specific knowledge, we will assume we do not have competition in 2021. And as to when they would come, honestly we don't really know, but to your point, these are large markets, both your question on Trio but as well as derm and we are expecting competition. We just at this point do not have any specific knowledge. So our guidance did not include an assumption for competition in either space. Our next question from Gregg Gilbert with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.
Gregg Gilbert: Hi, going back to the diagnostics field. Glenn, you mentioned a growth rate there, I think 20% plus. Can you talk about to what degree that rate is influenced by M&A, if at all? and maybe more broadly about your strategy there? Clearly there's an element of sort of building and catching up, but I'm also curious on sort of how you're trying to differentiate or leapfrog competition broadly from a diagnostic standpoint? And then Glenn, are you seeing any signs of upward pressure on key input costs? As the world thinks about commodity price inflation or at least the potential for it? Thanks.
Glenn David: So in terms of the diagnostics growth for the quarter, like you said we did see a 20% growth in diagnostics. A part of that was driven by the reference lab acquisitions that we had. So net of that organic growth was around 12% to 13% in diagnostics for the quarter. So still very positive growth in the quarter. We saw a nice momentum as we move throughout the year, and we think that'll carry us well into 2021. Also, we established a much better infrastructure for diagnostics in 2020 in two ways. A, we fully integrated into our core SAP system in the diagnostics business. So we now are able to provide one phase to our customer in terms of billing as well as product offerings. The other thing that we did was we made significant improvements in our bi-directional connectivity, improving significantly throughout the year. At the beginning of the year, we had that connectivity to about 30%. We increased that at the end of the year to over 70%. So we think that establishes very well as we’re moving to 2021, as well as some of the new innovation we're bringing with the images platform as well. So we think those are some of the key drivers as we move into 2021, as well as the continued reference lab expansion that we're embarking on. So we're very excited about the growth that we expect to see in diagnostics in 2021. In terms of key input costs and inflation for us from a manufacturing perspective, there's nothing in particular that we see particularly challenging. Obviously for 2020, we had some elevated freight costs because of the impact of COVID-19 that will probably continue as we move into 2021 that is embedded in our guidance, but nothing else of a significant impact.
Operator: There appears to be no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to the speakers for any additional or closing remarks.
Kristin Peck: Thank you. Thanks everybody for your questions and your continued interest in the Zoetis today. We look forward to keeping you updated on our business throughout the year and continuing to deliver the results and innovations that you and our customers expect. Thanks so much for joining us.
Operator: Thank you. And this does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-11-06 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Third quarter 2020 Financial Results Conference Call and Webcast for Zoetis. Hosting the call today is Steve Frank, Vice President of Investor Relations for Zoetis. The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, and will not be forwarded automatically. In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately 2 hours after the conclusion of this call via dial-in or on the Investor Relations section of Zoetis.com. At this time all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for your questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.
Steve Frank: Thank you, Keith. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Zoetis third quarter 2020 earnings call. I am joined today by Kristin Peck, our Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn David, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I’ll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements, and that actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statement in today’s press release and our SEC filings, including, but not limited to, our annual report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q. Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and in the company’s 8-K filing dated today, November 5, 2020. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. With that, I will turn the call over to Kristin.
Kristin Peck: Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. Once again, I hope you and your loved ones are safe and healthy as this pandemic continues to be pervasive and unpredictable, with COVID cases spiking again in several regions of the U.S. and around the world. We are all facing the uncertainty and fatigue that has come with this pandemic. But I’m also grateful and pleased today to share results that reflect the resilience of the animal health industry, the outstanding performance of our colleagues at Zoetis and the essential value we are providing our customers. At Zoetis, we stayed very responsive to the needs of our colleagues and customers throughout the year. We’ve prioritized – our global supply chain and manufacturing operations are running well with safety and quality as our top priority. And we’ve maintained operations at normal capacity and with no loss output. As we look ahead, we’re fortifying our network of suppliers and building inventory level. We’re also planning further contingencies for supply and distribution in the month ahead. Our R&D programs also remain on track despite the pandemic challenges, and our field force has been very adaptive to the changing protocols, lockdowns, and customer needs in various markets. Thankfully, our purpose, caring for healthier animals and a healthier world has never been more important, apparent and appreciated. Thanks to the resilience of our customers and the commitment of our colleagues, we were able to generate better-than-expected results in the third quarter. Our diverse and innovative portfolio has been driving growth this quarter with companion animal products up 20% operationally and livestock product sales up 9% operationally. Our newest parasiticides, including Simparica Trio, Revolution Plus and ProHeart 12 led the way again, along with vaccines, key dermatology products and our diagnostics portfolio, including reference labs. The third quarter also benefited from sales growth in the U.S. cattle market and China’s swine market. As a result of the sales growth and target investments, we delivered adjusted net income growth of 20% operationally for the third quarter, reflecting on our 9 month performance and despite expectations for a more modest fourth quarter, we are increasing our revenue and adjusted net income guidance for the full year. Glenn will provide more details around guidance updates in his remarks. This year has shown once again that animal health is a steady and reliable sector, even in times of economic hardship. The world’s fundamental need for nutrition, comfort and companionship provided by animals has proven durable and enduring over time. In the U.S., veterinary clinic revenues for pets are increasing at double-digit rates. Pet owners are focusing again on wellness and chronic ailments, not just emergency visits and acute care. While spending more time with their pets, pet owners are much more attuned to their dogs and cats health, observing conditions like itchiness, dermatitis, and pain. While clinic visits are relatively flat in the U.S., they’re actually seeing an increase in average spend per visit. We expect to continue to see our strength coming from companion animal products, especially our parasiticide and key dermatology portfolios across global markets. Simparica Trio’s launch and penetration into new clinics in the U.S. and elsewhere is going well, despite the headwinds of COVID-19. And we’re seeing a good return to our direct-to-consumer advertising and digital campaign for Simparica and Apoquel. Meanwhile, in the livestock sector, producers are adapting to the changes in our end-markets for protein. And our third quarter growth was driven by increased sales in cattle, swine and fish. The spikes in COVID cases, limitations on dining out and shifts in production capacities will continue to make livestock a longer-term recovery story that may vary by region and species, another reason our diverse portfolio and global footprint is such an advantage. Looking ahead, we have stayed focused on advancing our 5 key priorities, drive innovative growth, enhance customer experience, lead in digital and data analytics, cultivate a high-performing organization, and champion a healthier and more sustainable future. Throughout the year, we’ve stayed on track with our execution and investments in these areas, supported by a strong cash position and clear strategy. In the third quarter, we achieved an important milestone for our pipeline for pain management and pests. As you know, there’s been limited innovation in this area over the last 20 years. And we’re excited by the potential of monoclonal antibodies or mAbs to be the next breakthrough in long-term pain management. We’ve been building on our research and leadership in monoclonal antibodies for several years, and gained valuable experience in the development and launch of our dermatology product Cytopoint in 2016. In September, Zoetis received a positive opinion on our latest mAb, Librela, from the Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products in Europe. Upon full approval by the European Commission, Librela will be the first injectable monoclonal antibody licensed for alleviation of pain associated with osteoarthritis in dogs. The European Commission approval is anticipated later this year, with the potential launch in the first half of 2021. We have additional regulatory submissions for Librela under review by health authorities in the United States, Latin America and Asia Pacific. And we are progressing with similar regulatory reviews for monoclonal antibody therapy that can help manage osteoarthritis pain in cats, a condition that is vastly under-diagnosed or treated in cats today. We also continue to bring our leading product into new markets. On the companion animal side, Simparica was recently approved in China, and Cytopoint and Revolution Plus gained approvals in additional markets in Asia and Latin America respectively; and in livestock received approval in Japan for 2 of our leading swine vaccine, Fostera Gold PCV MH and Fostera Gold PCV; all great examples of how we build and expand our innovation-based franchises. Last quarter, I previewed our latest diagnostic innovation Vetscan Imagyst, which features a cloud-based artificial intelligence platform. Since then, we have launched it in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, the UK and the U.S. And customers have been enthusiastic about its potential to simplify point-of-care workloads and improve the consistency of results. And finally, we remain committed to creating a healthier and more sustainable world through our work as a leader in animal health. We’ve been formalizing our strategy this year and look forward to sharing baseline metrics that are aligned with leading ESG reporting standards before the end of this month. Now, let me hand it off to Glenn, who will speak more about our third quarter results and updated guidance for the full year.
Glenn David: Thank you, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. I hope you and your families are remaining safe and healthy during these difficult times, and I thank you for joining us today. We delivered another solid quarter with significant growth in both our companion animal and livestock portfolios. And we continue to be encouraged by the strength and resiliency of our business, despite the challenging environment due to the pandemic. Today, I will provide commentary on our Q3 results, update you on our improved full year 2020 guidance and discuss our expectations for Q4. In the third quarter, we generated revenue of $1.8 billion, growing 13% on a reported basis and 15% operationally. Adjusted net income of $524 million was an increase of 15% on a reported basis and 20% operationally. Foreign exchange negatively impacted revenue in the quarter by 2%, driven primarily by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Operational revenue growth was 15% with contributions of 2% from price and 13% from volume. Volume growth of 13% includes 5% from other in-line products, 4% from new products, 3% from key dermatology products and 1% from acquisitions. Companion animal products led the way in terms of species growth, growing 20% operationally with livestock growing 9% operationally in the quarter. Performance in companion animal was driven by our parasiticides portfolio, which includes sales of Simparica Trio in the U.S., certain European markets, Canada and Australia. We also saw growth in our small animal vaccine portfolio and our key dermatology products, Cytopoint and Apoquel. The positive momentum for Simparica Trio continued in the third quarter, and we expect full year incremental revenue of between $125 million to $150 million. As we’ve previously mentioned, the COVID-19 pandemic has limited our ability to visit and penetrate clinics at the rate we had originally expected. However, we are finding that once the clinic has converted to Simparica Trio, the adoption level within the clinic is resulting in meaningful incremental market share. We’re also extremely pleased with the performance of our broader parasiticide portfolio, which in the U.S., gained an additional 6% market share in the flea, tick and heartworm segment for the third quarter versus the same period in the prior year. Global sales of our key dermatology portfolio were $251 million in the quarter, growing 16% operationally and contributing 3% to overall revenue growth. Our diagnostics portfolio also contributed to growth due to the continued recovery of wellness visits following a slowdown from social distancing restrictions earlier in the year. Livestock growth in the quarter was primarily driven by our U.S. cattle business seeing a return to historical distributor buying patterns following the impact of COVID-19 in the second quarter. In addition, the fall cattle run occurred earlier in the year, causing a portion of fourth quarter sales to be pulled forward into the third quarter. And as a result, we expect a significantly weaker fourth quarter in cattle than we typically deliver. For the remaining livestock species, swine returned to growth in the quarter, resulting from expanding herd production in key accounts and increased biosecurity measures in the wake of African Swine Fever in China. We also remain encouraged by the strength of our aquaculture business, which posted a 4th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Poultry declined modestly in the quarter, which partially offset the growth in cattle, swine and fish. New products contributed 4% growth in the quarter, driven by companion animal parasiticides, Simparica Trio, Revolution Plus and ProHeart 12. Recent acquisitions contributed 1% of growth this quarter, including our expansion to reference labs and the Platinum Performance nutritionals business. Now let’s discuss the revenue growth by segment for the quarter. U.S. revenue grew 18% with companion animal products growing 21% and livestock sales increasing by 13%. For companion animal, we continued to be encouraged by vet clinic trends with revenue per clinic up 12% in the quarter and demand for our products remaining robust. Companion animal growth in the quarter were driven by sales of our Simparica franchise as well as key dermatology products. We continued to invest in direct-to-consumer advertising in both therapeutic areas, and we have seen a good return on that investment. Simparica Trio continued to perform well in the U.S. with sales of $44 million, despite difficult market conditions for a new product launch. Key dermatology sales were $180 million for the quarter, growing 17%, with significant growth for Cytopoint and Apoquel, resulting from additional patient share and an expanding addressable market. Diagnostic sales increased 28% in the quarter as a result of our reference lab acquisitions and increased point-of-care consumable usage. U.S. livestock grew 13% in the quarter, driven primarily by cattle. As I mentioned, purchasing patterns returned to historical levels, and we saw earlier movement from pasture to feedlot both contributing to a significant volume increase for our products. To summarize, U.S. performance was once again strong in what remains a difficult market environment. We remain enthusiastic about the recovery and trends we’re observing in companion animal products. While livestock delivered an exceptional third quarter, as we’ve indicated in the past, we do not expect a sustainable recovery until the middle of 2021. Revenue in our International segment grew 11% operationally in the quarter with growth across all species with the exception of poultry, which was flat in the quarter. Companion animal revenue grew 20% operationally and livestock revenue grew 6% operationally. Increased sales in companion animal products resulted from growth in our parasiticide portfolio, vaccines and our key dermatology products. Parasiticide growth in the quarter was driven by the Simparica franchise, including the continued adoption of Simparica Trio, as well as increased promotional activity for Revolution. In the EU, limited access to veterinary clinics due to COVID-19 restrictions presented challenges for companion animal product sales in the second quarter, but in the third quarter we saw pent-up demand begin to work its way through the system, particularly for small animal vaccines. Companion animal diagnostics grew 17% in the quarter led by an increase in point-of-care consumable usage. International livestock growth in the quarter was driven by swine, fish and cattle. Swine delivered another strong quarter with 16% operational revenue growth, primarily driven by China, which grew 159%. While a significant portion of China’s growth reflects the impact of African swine fever in the prior year, we’re continuing to see expansion in our key accounts as production shifts from smaller forms to large scale operations. Our fish portfolio delivered another strong quarter, growing 10% operationally, driven by an increase in market share in vaccines and the acquisition of Fish Vet Group. Overall, our International segment delivered strong results and was a key contributor to revenue growth with significant growth in companion animal, swine and fish. We are also encouraged to see cattle return to growth in what are still difficult market conditions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Now moving on to the rest of the P&L. Adjusted gross margin of 69.6% fell 50 basis points on a reported basis compared to the prior year as a result of negative FX, the manufacturing costs and recent acquisitions. This was partially offset by favorable product mix and price increases. Adjusted operating expenses increased 9% operationally, resulting from increased advertising and promotion expense for Simparica Trio and Apoquel. We have strategically reallocated savings, mainly from T&E costs into these high return promotional programs, which have been successful in increasing sales. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 20%, a decrease of 50 basis points, driven by the impact of net discrete tax benefits. Adjusted net income for the quarter grew 20% operationally primarily driven by revenue growth, and adjusted diluted EPS grew 21% operationally. The strength of our balance sheet, along with the significant free cash flow we generate, has enabled us to execute on our investment priorities including direct-to-consumer advertising, internal R&D and external business development. While we suspended our share repurchase program for the last 2 quarters to preserve cash during the pandemic, we remain committed to our 2020 dividend. In addition, share repurchases are a critical component of our shareholder distribution strategy and we’ll continue to evaluate the appropriate time to resume the program. Now moving on to our updated guidance for 2020. We are raising guidance for a second consecutive quarter as a result of our third quarter performance and the improving companion animal market environment. While the COVID-19 pandemic presents challenges and risks, we remain confident in the resiliency and durability of our diverse portfolio. Please note that our guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late October. For revenue, we are raising and narrowing our guidance range with projected revenue now between $6.55 billion and $6.625 billion and operational revenue growth of between 7% and 8% for the full year versus the 3% to 6% in our August guidance. Adjusted net income is now expected to be in the range of $1.79 billion to $1.825 billion representing operational growth of 6% to 8% compared to our prior guidance of 1% to 5%. Adjusted diluted EPS is now expected to be in the range of $3.76 to $3.81 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $3.38 to $3.45. We are anticipating a deceleration of revenue growth in the fourth quarter, resulting from weaker performance in our livestock business. The impact will filter down to adjusted net income, which will also be affected by increased expense as we invest in future revenue growth. In addition, adjusted net income has a difficult comparative period as a result of nonrecurring discrete tax benefits recorded in Q4 2019. In closing, we delivered another strong quarter, demonstrating the resiliency of our business, even in these challenging market conditions. I’d like to once again express how extremely proud we are of our colleagues, and the commitment they have demonstrated towards our customers and our company. Now, I’ll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Erin Wright: Great, thanks. So I have a couple of questions here. One is on the guidance, the step-down in organic growth trajectory in the fourth quarter. I assume that has to do with the underlying conduct, in the end you were speaking to. But is there any other dynamics we should be thinking about in the fourth quarter? And how that month-to-month trend has progressed here? And then, lastly on mix dynamics in the gross margin, what were some of the key drivers of the gross margin trend in the quarter? Has anything changed in terms of the underlying profit profile of the companion animal business? Just given the strength there, maybe we thought that would be a little bit higher. Thanks.
Glenn David: Sure. So I’ll take both of those questions, Erin, thank you. In terms – I’ll address the mix dynamics first. Nothing has changed really in terms of the underlying dynamics. A couple of factors related to the gross margin. A, foreign exchange was particularly unfavorable in this quarter, so that led to a step-up, a little bit in cost of goods, so that lowered the overall gross margin percentage. Also, we continued to invest in some of the new areas for growth, such as reference labs and some of the acquisitions, which also has a lower gross margin profile than our core business. But in terms of the underlying dynamics for companion animal and continued growth there being – continue to be an overall benefit for gross margin. But the FX as well as some of the investments we’re making in newer businesses such as reference labs did have a negative impact. In terms of the guidance for Q4 and the implied step-down in revenue, a couple of key factors there. A, U.S. cattle being one of the larger ones. We had a very strong quarter in U.S. cattle in Q3, really driven by 2 factors. A, the acceleration of the fall cattle run bringing some sales from Q4 into Q3. As well as a normalization of buying patterns in Q3 that resulted in some incremental sales that we did not expect to repeat in Q4. The other thing to consider for U.S. cattle in Q4 is the impact of DRAXXIN LOE in 2021. We do anticipate that some of our customers may change their buying patterns for Q4, which could result in less sales. As I mentioned, there are impacts beyond just revenue for Q4. Really, the adjusted effective tax rate is a big driver from an income growth perspective. We had a very favorable tax rate in Q4 of last year that will not repeat this year and will have a negative impact on our overall income growth.
Operator: And we’ll move to our next question. It comes from Jon Block with Stifel
Jon Block: Great. Thanks, guys. Good morning. Glenn, maybe just to start with you, and I’ll actually just pick up where you left off on DRAXXIN. I know you’re not going to go down the road of overall 2021 guidance. But obviously, we all sort of want to sharpen our pencils, if you would. And so, as we think about DRAXXIN in generic next year, should we just be cognizant of call it maybe a $300-million-plus top-line item with a year 1 20%-headwind-ish? If you could, comment on that. And then, Kristin, for you, congrats on moving the pain mAbs forward. Any commentary on the revenue ramp that we might see there? And if you feel like you’ve got a good runway with these offerings in front of any large molecule competition? Thanks, guys.
Glenn David: Sure, Jon. So, I’ll take the DRAXXIN question. So as you mentioned, DRAXXIN is a very large product in animal health, over $300 million, a large product for us as well. Because of that, we do expect to see significant generic competition and a number of manufacturers being prepared with a generic product. So we do typically see a 20% to 40% impact over time, once a product faces generic competition. Because of the size of DRAXXIN, we do expect that, that will occur over a little more rapid period than we’ve seen in the past with some smaller products
Kristin Peck: Sure. I’ll build on the profile for the mAbs. As we talked about, we did get the positive CVMP opinion on Librela. We are expecting an approval later this year with the hope of launching that in the first half of 2021. I know we’ll probably get a question why first half. It really depends, is it February, March, it will be around that timeframe. Remember, International has an earlier quarter. So we will start to see a ramp on that product in 2021. We are still expecting approval of the cat pain product, [Cylenthia] [ph], in 2021 as well. We’ll probably see approval of those in the U.S. in the later end of next year. So just to give you a sense of just where we see those revenues ramping, both cat and dog in the U.S. and EU.
Operator: And our next question comes from Mike Ryskin with Bank of America.
Michael Ryskin: Hey, thanks, guys. I’ll start with a quick one on sort of the rebound from COVID and the recovery in the quarter. I’m just wondering if you could parse into a little bit. You had a comment in some of your prepared remarks about potentially some pent-up demand in Europe. And I’m just trying to get a sense broader across the U.S. as well, how much you think the true underlying growth could have been versus what really is a little bit of pent-up demand? So I realize there’s a lot of moving parts in terms of vets, vet re-openings and new pet adoption, things like that, but just curious how to think about that going forward. And then, Glenn, got a quick follow-up for you. Another comment you made on increased spending, reinvesting in the business. As we look out to 4Q, clearly, there’s a big SG&A ramp in the guidance if you sort of bridge your revenue gap to your EPS target. I’m just thinking how should we think about 2021? What’s the appropriate base for that, because there’s obviously some spend that you pulled back this year. So how much of that comes back, how much extra do you need to invest for things like Librela and Trio next year? I’m just trying to get the moving pieces down. Thanks.
Kristin Peck: Thanks, Mike. I’ll start on the COVID recovery question. I think what you clearly saw in Q3 was a significant rebound in companion animal to people going back to vet business. But really, the big growth driver there wasn’t really an increase in vet visits from 2019. Maybe there’s an increase from Q2 to Q3. It was really an increased spend per visit, which we think is a trend that will continue as long as people spend more time at home with their pets, they are noticing more and more things are getting diagnosed, as well as increased use of diagnostics. And that is really we believe definitely U.S. trend, but we also believe a global trend there. So we think companion animal will continue to do well. I think in the remarks, what we had alluded to was that specifically U.S. cattle where, we saw real – in Q2 a significant dip, people not wanting to hold too many inventories. In Q3, it was just more of a return to – normalizing that. But the other trend was really the move, I mean, it wasn’t COVID related, just weather-related, moving of the fall run. So overall from a COVID recovery, I don’t think there’s any pent-up demand that we’re processing anymore. I think things have largely stabilized. Obviously, when you see the number of cases increasing in the U.S. and globally, that’s right now baked into the guidance we’ve given you, assuming that things don’t get remarkably worse or remarkably better. But I think all that’s sort of baked in. And as we look into next year, I think it’s a little too early for us to really tell exactly what that’s going to look like. But I think the key message for us, as you look at our performance and our guidance for the year, is that we’ve been an incredibly resilient and essential business. And that has really been great for our customers, for our colleagues and for our shareholders.
Glenn David: Yeah, Mike, in terms of the increased spending in the quarter, so as you mentioned, we did increase spending in Q3 with total OpEx up about 9%, and SG&A up 11%. And really, what we did there is we took a lot of the savings that we saw from T&E and made incremental investments behind some of our key growth brands, particularly Simparica Trio and Apoquel in the tune of DTC advertising, which was even greater than the savings that we saw from a T&E perspective, because we believe those are the right investments, and we’re seeing a very strong return on those, to support the future growth of the brands. In terms of what you mentioned for Q4 that the EPS gap between revenue and EPS, the gap there being driven by OpEx, obviously, the bigger driver there actually is more related to what I mentioned in terms of the change in the tax rate quarter-over-quarter and the incremental interest expense. It’s really not that OpEx. It’s disproportionate to revenues. The changes that we’re seeing year-over-year, just based on some quarterly fluctuations in the tax rate as well as the incremental interest expense that we’re going to see in Q4 based on the funding that we did earlier this year.
Operator: And our next question comes from David Westenberg with Guggenheim Securities.
David Westenberg: Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Congrats on a good quarter. So on Trio, at least from our research, we’re not seeing any competitive entrants yet and spring is a half year way, VMX is coming up in 2 months. Is there any – can you help us think about the difference in your – in the Trio peak sales expectation in the event the competitor doesn’t launch until after the spring? And then as a follow-up to Trio, how had a full season of it? Are you seeing more adoption from heartworm customers or maybe legacy tick and flea prescribers only? And kind of what I’m trying to get at that is, essentially there is regional differences in prescribing behavior and I’m just trying to figure out, again, market size question on Trio. Thank you.
Kristin Peck: Thanks, David. I’ll start with we’re not anticipating any combination competition in the U.S. this year or in the first half of next year. As we’ve talked about many times, we don’t have phenomenal intelligence the same way human health does, but we continue to believe that. And to build up on Glenn’s comments, as a result, we are investing heavily behind this product in DTC to gain market share as quickly as we can. As we look at sort of the growth, Glenn also mentioned in his remarks that the penetration of clinic is improving, but probably not as great as we would have wanted, given the difficulty in detailing the product in person. However, where we have penetrated, the sales have been much higher. And honestly, we’ve been cannibalizing Simparica much less than we expected. And we’re really seeing is an overall bringing more people in. If you look at flea, tick, heartworm, really only 10% of people who are even taking it are 100% compliant. So we think that remains a significant opportunity for us. And again, we have a strong franchise here across parasiticides and flea, tick, heartworm. And as Glenn also mentioned, we had a 6% share gain in the overall category, which I think is really impressive. So whether that’s Simparica, Simparica Trio or ProHeart 6 or ProHeart 12, we believe we have the portfolio for our customers no matter where they are in the country, how they practice or what their pet owners’ needs are. So we continue to believe there’ll be strong growth there, and we’re going to invest behind this brand next year, while we remain the only triple combination in the U.S.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Louise Chen with Cantor. Your line is open.
Louise Chen: Hi, thanks for taking my question here. So I wanted to ask you, broadly speaking, how should we think about 2021 sales and margins? And if you can’t give any specifics, could you talk about some likely scenarios that could play out given a lot of moving parts we see in the year to come? Thank you.
Glenn David: Yeah. So in terms of 2021, Louise, obviously, we will be providing guidance for 2021 in February as we typically do. A couple of things to think about, right, the long-term fundamentals of the industry remain very strong with increasing pet ownership and also animal protein consumption continuing to grow. I think the other thing to think about for 2021, I think COVID has proven that this industry remains extremely resilient and we’re still able to grow very rapidly, operate very profitably even during these times. Looking into 2021, there are some things that we’re very excited about. Obviously, the continued growth that we expect to see in Trio, continued growth of our derm portfolio, and obviously, the approval of our mAb portfolio and the launch within the EU coming in the first half of the year that Kristin mentioned. Some of the things that may be a headwind, obviously, are the DRAXXIN LOE. But again, with the growth that we expect to see in some of the other brands that we’ve mentioned, we do expect that for 2021 we’ll be able to continue to deliver on our long-term value proposition of growing faster than the overall market.
Operator: And our next question comes from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs.
Nathan Rich: Good morning. Thanks for the questions. Kristin, maybe to start, could you comment on the longer-term kind of market opportunity for the monoclonal antibody products in pain? How should we think about the market for osteoarthritis? And then beyond that, is there a potential to kind of expand to additional indications? And then I had a follow-up on diagnostics. Could you kind of comment on underlying growth excluding the reference lab acquisitions? And can you update us on your progress with getting customers to kind of utilize the platform across both the in-clinic and reference labs solutions that you have?
Kristin Peck: Sure. So thanks, Nathan. I’ll start on just looking at the overall market for pain, starting with Librela since it will probably be our first approval there at least in Europe. Pain right now in dogs is around a $400 million market, but there hasn’t been significant innovation in that space. And although we do not yet have a label for our product, we believe that a monoclonal antibody will have a strong efficacy as well as safety profile. And we think that we’ve demonstrated, certainly in derm, our ability to grow the market to really raise awareness, bringing innovation in, brings new customers in and new options. So we do really believe we can continue to do that. If you look at it today, there’s about 165 million dogs across the EU and the U.S., and about 40% of them will get OA. And right now, depending on whether in the U.S. or Europe, really diagnosis is somewhere between 25% and 40%. So we do believe there’s a significant opportunity to both grow the market as well as bring people in and better diagnose that to really help that. That’s really where we see our – the market on dog. If you focus on cat, we think there’s an even bigger market here mostly because many cats are not medicalized today. There are 160 million cats about 40% of them as well have OA. But here, you’re really seeing, whether you’re in the U.S. or the EU, only about 14% of them being diagnosed. And in the U.S., there really is not an alternative. There really is no pain product for cats. There are a few options in Europe. But we really see this as a significant opportunity and ability to grow the medicalization of cats and really to diagnose pain and to treat it. So we’ve demonstrated certainly in dermatology our ability to create and to grow markets. And we very much believe across both Librela and [Cylenthia] [ph] in dog and cat that we will have the opportunity to do that. We are not expecting competition at this point, certainly in 2021 from what we understand in this market. So we do believe it’s our ability to continue to drive growth and really provide new opportunities for both vets and pet owners to treat pain.
Glenn David: And in terms of the diagnostic growth. So if you look at companion animal diagnostic growth for the quarter, we grew about 24%. Backing out the impact of reference labs, that growth was around 13%. So we saw very strong growth in our consumable usage. Obviously, our instrument revenue was down as it’s been a little more challenging to get into the clinics took place new instruments, but very strong performance in our overall consumable revenue growth. In terms of the benefit that we’ve seen in the usage of both the reference labs and the point-of-care together, we are very early in our reference labs strategy. We are looking to build out a network across the U.S., but that will take some time. So we’re still early on in that build-out.
Operator: We will take our next question from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.
Ekaterina Knyazkova: Hey, this is actually Ekaterina on for Chris. Thank you for taking my questions. In the first question is you’ve touched upon this, but should we be thinking about the durability of some of the COVID-19 tailwinds that we’ve seen in U.S. companion like rising pet adoptions and increasing standard of care per visit? Do you think that this is something that reverses as those people come back into the office and don’t spend as much time with their pets? Or is this something that can be more durable as you think about 2021 and beyond? And then the second question is on the International companion business. So with some of the recent lockdown orders across Europe, what are you seeing on the ground in terms of any initial data points on clinic visits and foot traffic and things like that? How should we be thinking about the trajectory of the International companion business relative to what we saw with the first wave of COVID-19 lockdowns? Thank you.
Kristin Peck: Thanks, Ekaterina. What I think we’ve demonstrated is that overall animal health, and more specifically, pet care is a very resilient industry. And I think what we – what’s probably been a little bit different in COVID, in a pandemic and certainly an economic challenges, people are adopting more pets. And more importantly, they’re spending more time at home with those pets. So in a typical year, in the U.S., you’ll see about 3.2 million adoptions. We don’t have great data yet on what the increase is, but I think anecdotally, no matter where you sit, everyone has a new dog or cat in your neighborhood. So we’re definitely seeing, as you look at our vaccine sales, certainly an increase in some of these areas. But I really think what’s changing is dogs are becoming a greater part of the family. People are spending more time at home. I don’t think that’s going to change overnight. And therefore, they’re noticing more conditions with their dogs. They’re also spending more time at home, seeing our ads and realizing that they’re – if they have a dog who’s sick, there is a product for that. So I don’t think that trend – maybe it was more accelerated this year, but I think those dogs and cats are here to stay. I think people will change their behaviors, and some of them, I think, around spending more time with the comfort, be it emotional or otherwise, of pets will continue. And as you look at Europe, your question with regards to COVID in Europe, the data in Europe, as you know, is not as reliable and – as in the U.S., there’s not as many comprehensive data sources. But what we’re hearing anecdotally is our customers figured out in Q2 how to continue to see pets through curbside check-ins, and that really hasn’t changed. They figured out how to operate, given they’re an essential business and we really don’t – we have not seen so far any significant changes. Obviously, there’s incremental lockdowns being announced, obviously, in the last 24 to 48 hours in Italy and other places. But as you look at our guidance for the year, unless it gets significantly worse, we think that’s baked in. And I think if you look at what we’ve learned between Q2 and Q3, we think that our customers will be able to manage well as we move into 2021, certainly on the pet care side, to manage continuing to see pets and to diagnose them either through telemedicine or through curbside check-in. So we do believe the trends there are resilient.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Kreger with William Blair.
Jonathan Kaufman: Hi, good morning. This is Jon Kaufman on for Kreger. First, I would like to go back to diagnostics. I know your reps aren’t able to visit the clinics as much as usual, but can you talk about the initial reaction to the IMAGYST product? When your field teams are discussing this with clients, understanding that right now it’s only being used for fecal samples, how are they describing the potential for broadening out the potential use? I guess is there an expectation that there’s going to be a consistent introduction of new applications? And then I would also just like to ask about poultry. Can you just provide more details around what’s going on there? It’s typically one of your faster-growing areas in livestock. So just trying to get a sense of what changed this quarter. Is it part of a typical rotation of product usage? Or is it some sort of competitive dynamics there? Thank you.
Kristin Peck: Sure. I’ll start on the diagnostic, on IMAGYST. We are very pleased with how that’s going. As you know, the first indication for the IMAGYST, which is an AI-driven diagnostic, is in fecal. That’s about a $500 million market, growing about 7%. People are excited at the opportunity for this technology and certainly for additional indications. So we are on track there, and I think we’re very pleased with this progress. And given the positive receptivity to it, we are accelerating our investments to bring new indications overall there. And as you look at poultry, certainly in the U.S., there is definitely a rotation, which we always talk about, that was definitely a driver in the quarter, and I think you’ll see again moving into Q4. It’s also potentially one of the reasons we guided where we did on livestock overall in Q4. Obviously, there’s the overall impact to all of the livestock sectors of COVID and less consumption and more dine-in versus dine-out. But poultry specifically, it was more around the rotation there.
Operator: And our next question comes from Balaji Prasad with Barclays.
Balaji Prasad: Hi, good morning, and thanks for taking the question. So I want to get to China and discuss both the companion animal side and the livestock side of the business. So you had a 63% growth in China. And I thought I heard you say that you had 140% growth in livestock. So could you, a, quantify any kind of sort swine re-herding happening in China and how the effects you’re seeing on the business? And if the 140% number is correct? And secondly, on companion animal, could you speak about your expectations on Simparica? And also give us a sense of the time lag before you introduce Trio? And what are the gating factors to introduce that? Is it more regulatory or your own life cycle planning? Thanks.
Kristin Peck: Sure. I’ll start and I’ll let Glenn build on this. We were very pleased, obviously, with the growth in China and really the balance between companion animal and livestock there. Certainly, on the livestock side, we are seeing a faster-than-we-expected growth coming back from ASF. But really with the large integrated producers, there’s still a significant ASF challenge there. But given the biosecurity of some of them, we are seeing significant growth there. And in companion animal, similar to some trends at other places, is just great growth across the portfolio and strong performance there, certainly on Revolution, launching RIMADYL, just now getting the approval on Simparica. It’s more a timing of regulatory on Trio there, but I’ll let Glenn get into some specifics on the numbers and the growth.
Glenn David: Yeah. So just, again, to the details of the number. As you mentioned, overall, China for the quarter grew 63%. We saw 52% growth in companion animal and we saw 81% growth in livestock. And that 81% growth in livestock was driven by swine. So as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, swine grew 159% in China for the quarter. As we’ve continued to see the recovery in some of our key accounts and the larger producers, we’ve seen very strong performance of our products within those accounts.
Operator: And our next question comes from Navin Jacob with UBS. And we will actually move on to Kathy Miner with Cowen and Company.
Kathleen Miner: Thank you. Good morning. Just 2 questions, please. First, I’d just like to go back to the canine market, where you sized it up at about $400 million. Can you give us a sense of how much of that might be outside of the United States? And does the treatment of canine OA pain differ from the U.S. such that a launch or uptake may be different? And second question on Apoquel and Cytopoint. It looks like trends for those products continue to be very strong. So as you go forward, is this strength more sustainable than you may have initially thought pre-COVID just because there’s more pets that have been adopted and owners are at home more, so perhaps you see more use of these products? Thank you.
Kristin Peck: Sure. So digging in a – first of all, Kathy, great to hear from you. As we look at the pain market for dogs, it’s $400 million. If you look at the number of dogs, the EU has 90 million and the U.S. has 75 million. And as you look at, the 40% prevalence of OA is the same across. But in the U.S., really it’s only diagnosed about 28% versus 50% in the EU. The only thing we’ve learned with new technologies is that given we can do direct-to-consumer advertising in the U.S., we tend to be able to ramp faster to peak sales when we’re launching new technologies in the U.S. than we are able to do in Europe just given we can’t do direct-to-consumer advertising that’s brand-specific. So I do think we look at how fast can you ramp up that market in Europe. It will be slower than the U.S., what we have in U.S., just given the history. And ultimately, I think we’ll do well there. But I think it is a little slower, I would say, overall there. And your second question was around, what was it?
Glenn David: Around derm. So in terms of the opportunity for derm, so we continue to see really strong performance in the derm portfolio. We grew 16% this quarter with 21% growth year-to-date. In terms of the continued opportunity for growth, we see opportunities for growth in both the U.S. and International. So looking at the U.S., currently, there are about 75 million dogs in the U.S. and about 14 million dogs have itchiness. Of those 14 million dogs, today about 60% are treated. So there is still 40% of the dogs with itchiness that are not treated. So we do think there is an opportunity to continue to raise awareness of the disease state and get those itchy dogs continue to take Apoquel or Cytopoint. When you look outside of the U.S., we also see a big opportunity for growth. In terms of the breakout of our sales today, about two-thirds of our sales are U.S. and one-third is International. However, the number of itchy dogs is similar between those segments. So to the extent that we’re able to continue to drive that adoption and awareness, we do believe that there is continued growth expected in the International markets as well.
Kristin Peck: And the other thing I’ll say, we’re still looking at not having competition, so at the earliest the second half of next year. So we’re going to, obviously, continue to try to grow those as fast as we can and gain market share.
Operator: And our next question comes from Navin Jacob with UBS.
Sriker Nadipuram: Hi, everyone. This is Sriker Nadipuram on for Navin Jacob. Apologies for getting cut off before. But I just have a couple of questions. So in anticipation for the DRAXXIN generic coming next year, what level of destocking can we expect to see? And then, maybe just on the medicalization rate in osteoarthritis, what’s a good analog for how high you think it can get in dogs and cats in the U.S.? Thanks very much.
Kristin Peck: Sure. Starting on DRAXXIN, I mean, it’s a little bit hard to tell you exactly what we think the destocking will be. I think given the expectation for many of our customers that they will see significant new generic entrants, I’m sure they will think differently about building inventories ahead of normally what is our price increases in Q1, and that was sort of what Glenn was alluding to earlier. Obviously, we have a robust defense plan for DRAXXIN. It’s an important product. We still have – given its high margin – significant pricing leverage here. But obviously, we anticipate that some of our customers who would normally stock up at the end of the year ahead of the price increase will not be doing so there. And how high can medicalization rates get for OA? I mean you’d love to believe that all those dogs would be diagnosed. I don’t think you’re going to really ever get to that exact number. But we try to look at our ability, for example, in derm to try to do that. So we do think there’s a significant opportunity, both because they’re bringing innovation and we also believe that the anticipated potential safety profile of a mAb will bring more people out that are struggling certainly on the dog side, but definitely on the cat side as well. So I think it’s a little too early to say exactly where you can go, but there’s a significant opportunity. And we’ve demonstrated before that we’ve been able to grow markets as we’ve entered them with new innovative technologies.
Operator: Our next question comes from Elliot Wilbur with Raymond James
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, guys. This is actually [Michael Paralary] [ph] on for Elliot Wilbur. Thanks for taking my question. Most of my questions have actually been answered already, so I just have one for you on the topic of share repurchases. I know that you said that you’re continuing to evaluate the resumption of the program. But given the strong recovery in the business, I was just wondering if you guys had any timeline specifically on when you’re looking to resume the program, and if you’re looking for anything specifically on deciding whether or not to resume the program? Thank you.
Glenn David: Yeah, thanks, Michael. So in terms of share repurchase, we don’t have any specific timeline. Obviously, it’s something that we’ll continue to evaluate. There’s still a lot of uncertainty in the marketplace, particularly around COVID-19 and the timing that we expect to see a full recovery. So that’s one of the factors that we’ll continue to evaluate. One thing I’ll say though is our capital allocation priorities have not changed, right, in terms of investing in the business as our first priority. And I think you see us doing a lot of that this year, even in light of COVID, particularly with the investments that we’re making in DTC, the investments that we’re making in R&D to continue to support the medium, short and long term growth of this company, also significant investments that we’re making in manufacturing to ensure continuity of supply, and also investments that we’re making from an inventory perspective, again, to ensure continuity of supply. So we are really focusing on some of those internal investments. We’ve also been able to execute on some business development deals throughout this year as well even with the limitations that may be provided by COVID, but really good use of our capital across all areas.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is a follow-up from Balaji Prasad with Barclays.
Balaji Prasad: Hi, thanks for taking the question again. So I was just trying to check on your comment on the market share in the flea and tick and heartworm segment, 6% gain. I just wanted to clarify if that was based on a market size of $2.5 billion, $2.6 billion, or could you clarify that? Thanks. And secondly also, what was the actual number for Trio this quarter?
Glenn David: Yeah, so just to clarify, that was based on the U.S. market size of around $2.5 billion. And the second question was around Apoquel for the quarter – for Trio, I’m sorry. So, the Trio for the quarter, we did $50 million in sales for Trio for the quarter.
Operator: And at this time, there are no additional questions. I’d like to turn the program back over to Kristin Peck for any closing remarks.
Kristin Peck: Okay. Well, thank you all for your questions and continued interest in Zoetis. We look forward to keeping you updated on our business and continuing to deliver the results and innovations, that you and our customers expect for us. Stay well. Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you for your participation. This does conclude today’s program. You may disconnect at any time.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-08-06 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Second Quarter 2020 Financial Results Conference Call and Webcast for Zoetis. Hosting the call today is Steve Frank, Vice President of Investor Relations for Zoetis. The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer and will not be forwarded automatically. In addition, a replay of this call will be made available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call via dial-in or on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. At this time all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.
Steven Frank: Good morning, everyone and welcome to the Zoetis’ second quarter 2020 earnings call. I am joined today by Kristin Peck, our Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn David, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statement in today's press release and our SEC filings, including, but not limited to, our annual report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q. Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and in the company's 8-K filing dated today, August 6, 2020. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. With that, I will turn the call over to Kristin.
Kristin Peck: Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. I hope you and your loved ones remain safe and healthy as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect all of our professional and personal lives. On the call today, we will provide additional context around the impact of COVID-19 is having on our business, summarize the quarterly financial results, update you on our outlook and leave plenty of time to address your questions. In the second quarter, we delivered better than expected results given uncertainty around the COVID-19 pandemic. And I want to thank all of our Zoetis colleagues, who have shown amazing resiliency, customer focus and perseverance throughout the year and our response to these challenging times. In terms of numbers, our revenue grew 4% operationally with the U.S. segment up 6% and international up 3%. Our companion animal products continue to drive our business performance with 13% operational growth, livestock products declined 5%. Our adjusted net income increased 4% operationally in the second quarter. We have built a very strong companion animal portfolio over the last several years based on our internal innovation. And these products have helped offset some of the deeper market challenges in the livestock market today. Our recently launched parasiticide compared to Trio, ProHeart 12 and Revolution Plus as well as our key dermatology portfolio of Apoquel and CytoPoint provides us solid foundation that has continued to form well this year. We continue to be very pleased with the performance of our new triple combination parasiticide for dogs Simparica Trio, as well as the strength of the overall Simparica franchise. Glenn will share more details in his remarks. Our continued focus on meaningful innovations and the diversity of our portfolio across PCs, products and geographies remain core advantages for Zoetis during times of economic uncertainty and we've also seen the essential nature of animal health playing an important role in the resiliency of our business and our industry at this time. In terms of COVID-19, our veterinary and producer customers are under increased pressure to deliver critical animal care and maintain a reliable global food supply and we are fortunate to be able to support them in this mission. We continue to put the safety of our colleagues and customers first during this pandemic. And we're very pleased with our team's ability to maintain productivity, even with safety and social distancing adjustments at our facilities, as well as the ongoing use of remote work arrangements for the majority of our colleagues. Our field force has returned to meeting with customers in many geographies based on local guidance and practices. We monitor and adapt these plans on a daily basis based on local feedback and adjustments in markets that may be experiencing increased COVID-19 cases. Our teams are excited to be back out with our customers, but we're also preserving the lessons we have learned from effective online interactions, webinars, and e-commerce to evolve our sales and support. In terms of supply chain, Zoetis has maintained a reliable inventory of critical medicines, vaccines and diagnostics to our customers and distributors in more than a hundred markets around the world. And our research development programs remain on track in terms of filings clinical trials and interactions with regulatory agencies. We remain confident in the progress of regulatory reviews of our monoclonal antibody candidates for pain in cats and dogs. Our submissions are proceeding as expected. This year continues to be uncharted territory due to COVID-19 and the related trends affecting our customers. However, the underlying demand for healthy pets and a reliable source of protein remains fundamental to the global economy. In the second quarter, we benefited from the veterinary clinics in the U.S. recovering much more quickly from the COVID-19 impact than we anticipated. Veterinary practices in the U.S. adapted quickly the Cribb site visits and mobile clinics to deliver critical care and maintain relationships with our customers. We also saw an acceleration of companion animal product sales through e-commerce channels as a result of the lockdowns in many States. Veterinarians and pet owners are adapting more quickly to these online options as a way to fill prescriptions for parasiticides and other medicines. We also know people are spending more time at home with their pets. They may be observing conditions such as itchiness or pain, which has previously gone unnoticed. And so, we're actually seeing an increase in spend per visit in U.S. clinics. Meanwhile, outside the U.S., companion animal veterinary clinic performance has been in line with expectations despite wide market by market variations based on local dynamics. For Zoetis, we expect our overall revenue growth for the remainder of the year to be driven largely by companion animal products, especially our parasiticide and key dermatology portfolio. We plan to continue investing in direct to consumer advertising and digital marketing to support these products. Livestock is a very different picture and remains very challenged by the pandemic, especially in the U.S. Producers are adjusting to new market demands and distribution needs from food service and restaurant channels to more grocery and retail channels while also managing ongoing labor, safety and trade issues. As expected, U.S. livestock in the second quarter saw a significant downturn as we expect that to remain a challenge for the rest of the year. The pace of return to more food service and restaurant demand along with increased export opportunities will be the most significant factors in the recovery of livestock producers in the U.S. Internationally, livestock grew and performed in line with expectations across a diverse set of markets. We saw very positive results in places like China, where they're further along in their COVID-19 recovery, but we will be sensitive to see how Latin America and markets like Brazil perform in the remainder of the year due to COVID. As you look ahead, we remain focused on advancing our five key priorities to ensure our long-term success: driving innovative growth, enhancing customer experience, leading in digital and data analytics, cultivating a high performing organization and championing a healthier, more sustainable future. We've continued to make important investments in products and innovations across the continuum of care from prediction and prevention to detection and treatment of disease. Supporting successful launches as well as new life cycle innovations and expansions of major products into new markets continue to be the cornerstones of our durable and steady performance. In the second quarter, we expanded major vaccine franchises with the approval of our Vanguard B Oral for dogs in Brazil and our Fostera Gold PCV MH and Fostera Gold PCV Metastim for vaccines for pigs in Australia. We also continue to strengthen our diagnostic and digital capabilities building on recent acquisitions in point-of-care and reference labs along with additional investment. We plan to launch a new diagnostic platform for pet care in the third quarter called VETSCAN IMAGYST. We are very excited about the potential for this disruptive innovation, which will be the first systems to bring clinical pathology right to the point-of-care. This new multi-purpose platform uses a combination of image recognition technology, algorithms and cloud-based artificial intelligence to deliver rapid testing results to the clinic. Its first indication will be for testing fecal samples for parasites, making it quick and easy to test and treat pets in the same visit. We will have more to say in the coming weeks as we prepare for a global launch. We also view diagnostics is playing an important role in the continuum of care for fish. In the second quarter, we acquired Fish Vet Group to add more diagnostic tools to our aquaculture portfolio, including environmental testing, which is critical to fish farming. Finally, at Zoetis our key priority around high performing teams is tied to creating a culture where all colleagues feel valued and included and is reflected in our commitment to promoting inclusion, diversity and equity across our organization. Our leadership and board are dedicated to being a force for positive change across the globe to drive greater equity and inclusion. And we have dedicated financial and people resources to do so. As part of this plan, we have made commitments to publish our diversity statistics and to increase our representation of black colleagues and people of color overall in the U.S. As the world leader in animal health, we are committed to demonstrating our leadership on this important business and social issue. Now let me hand off to Glenn, who will speak more about our second quarter results and updated guidance for the full year. Glenn?
Glenn David: Thank you, Kristin, and good morning. I hope everyone is safe, healthy, and adapting to what is certainly an unprecedented time for all of us. Today, we'll provide additional commentary on our Q2 financial results, provide an update on our liquidity position and review our improved full year 2020 guidance. Beginning with the second quarter results, we generated revenue of $1.5 billion, which was flat on a reported basis and 4% growth operationally. Adjusted net income of $427 million, decreased 2% on a reported basis and increased 4% operationally. Foreign exchange in the quarter had an unfavorable impact of 4% on revenue. This was driven primarily by the U.S. dollar strengthening against the Brazilian real, Australian dollar, Mexican peso, and euro. Operational revenue growth at 4% was driven by 2% price and 2% volume. Volume growth. 2% includes 3% from new products, 3% from key dermatology products, 1% from acquisitions and a decline of 5% in other inline products.  Companion animal products led the way in terms of species growth, growing 13% operationally, while livestock declined 5% operationally. Companion animal performance was driven by a parasiticide portfolio, which includes sales of Simparica Trio in the U.S., Canada and certain European markets and our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint.  Revenue from the acquisition of Platinum Performance, and its nutritional products acquired in the second half of 2019, drove the growth in equine. Livestock declines in the quarter were driven by challenges to our U.S. livestock portfolio. Supply chain disruptions caused by reduced animal processing capacity and shifting consumer demand from restaurant and food service to grocery stores effected our customers' purchasing decisions. This decline was partially offset by strong performance internationally with growth in swine, fish and poultry. New products contributed 3% to overall growth in the quarter driven by Simparica Trio, ProHeart 12, Revolution Plus and our Alpha Flux parasiticides for salmon in Chile. We remain excited by the launch of Simparica Trio and are reaffirming the range of a $100 million to $125 million for full year incremental revenue. While vet clinic penetration is occurring at a more moderate pace as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, prescriptions in those clinics that have adopted Trio have been more robust and cannibalization of Simparica has been less than we anticipated.  Global sales of our key dermatology portfolio were $224 million in the quarter, growing 24% operationally and contributing 3% overall revenue growth. Recent acquisitions contributed 1% growth this quarter, which includes Platinum Performance and our reference lab expansion strategy.  Now, let's discuss the revenue growth by segments for the quarter. U.S. revenue grew 6% with companion animal products growing 19% and livestock products declining by 18%. Companion animal growth in the quarter were driven by sales of Simparica franchise, our key dermatology products and the impact of recent acquisitions. U.S. key dermatology sales were $160 million for the quarter, growing 26%. The continued strength of this portfolio was driven by expanded usage of both CytoPoint and Apoquel benefiting from our direct-to-consumer campaign, uptick in e-commerce channels and pet owners spending more time with their pets as a result of COVID-19. Simparica Trio performed well in the U.S. with sales of $36 million, despite challenging market conditions in Q2. We’re observing several positive trends, included rapid uptake in clinic that have adopted Trio smaller than expected cannibalization of Simparica. Sales coming from new patients for the category and taking share from current oral flea and tick competitors. Diagnostic sales increased 18% in the quarter, largely driven by our reference lab acquisitions. In addition, previous instrument placements created a solid foundation for consumables growth in the second quarter. U.S. livestock declined 18% in the quarter driven by lower sales across all species. In the second quarter, we faced challenges with significant declines in feedlot placements, reduced demand from the food service industry and the effects that had throughout the food supply chain and our customers, in addition to increased competition. To summarize, U.S. performance was strong in a difficult market environment. And the diversity of our portfolio, again, proved beneficial as growth in companion animal offset the challenges faced in the U.S. by our livestock portfolio.  Our international segment had operational revenue growth of 3% in the second quarter with more balanced performance across our companion animal and livestock portfolios. Companion animal operational revenue growth was 2% and livestock operational growth was 4%. Increase sales in companion animal products with a result of growth in our key dermatology portfolio and our Simparica franchise, including the launch of Simparica Trio in Canada.  While European markets were impacted significantly by COVID-19, the decline was offset by significant growth in other markets, including Japan and China. Diagnostics had a difficult quarter as wide-scale clinic closures resulting from COVID-19, limited the ability to place the instruments and negatively impacted consumable usage.  International livestock growth in the quarter was driven by swine, fish and poultry. Swine grew double digits in the quarter, primarily driven by China, which grew 25% as key accounts continue to expand their herds and production shifts from smaller farms to larger scale operations.  Our fish portfolio delivered another strong quarter. We saw favorable conditions in Chile and Norway that resulted in vaccinations being accelerated into Q2. In addition, we continue to see an uptake of the Alpha Flux parasiticide in Chile. Overall, our international segment was again, a positive contributor to revenue growth with performance in swine, companion animal, fish, and poultry, more than offsetting declining cattle resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.  Now, moving on to the rest of the P&L. Adjusted gross margin of 71.1%, increased slightly on a reported basis compared to the prior year due to price, favorable manufacturing costs and product mix, which were partially offset by foreign exchange, recent acquisitions and higher inventory charges. Adjusted operating expenses were flat operationally. The incremental advertising and promotion expense is related to Simparica Trio, recent acquisitions and R&D increases were largely offset by reductions to T&E and compensated related costs as a result of COVID-19.  The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.3%. The increase versus prior year is driven by the jurisdictional mix of earnings and the impact of discrete tax benefits recorded in Q2 2019. Adjusted net income for the quarter grew 4% operationally, primarily driven by revenue growth and adjusted diluted EPS grew 6% operationally.  Next, I'd like to cover our liquidity position and our capital allocation priorities. We ended the second quarter with approximately $3.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents, including the proceeds from our $1.25 billion long-term debt issuance in May, of which $500 million is earmarked for repayment of our November 2020 maturity. We have access to a $1 billion revolving credit facility and a coinciding commercial paper program, both of which remain undrawn. Given our strong cash flow and balance sheet, we remain committed to our capital allocation priorities for internal investment, M&A and returning excess cash to shareholders. Consistent with what I mentioned last quarter, we still anticipate elevated capital expenditures this year to support investments in manufacturing, information technology to support our recent acquisitions and capabilities in digital and data analytics.  With regard to returning excess cash to shareholders, we remain committed to our 2020 dividend, which represents a 22% increase over 2019. In Q1, we repurchased $250 million in Zoetis shares before suspending the program in the second quarter in order to conserve cash. We have approximately $1.4 billion remaining under our multi-year share repurchase program.  Now moving on to our updated guidance assumptions for 2020. Our cash performance has always given us confidence that the essential nature of our business, a diverse portfolio and the innovation we consistently bring to our customers would position us well during difficult market conditions. After assessing recent trends and our performance in the second quarter, we're further refining and raising our full year 2020 guidance. We expect recent positive companion animal trends in the U.S. will continue. Although vet clinic revenue may moderate somewhat as pent-up demand works its way through the system. Alternatively, we believe social distancing measures are negatively impacting the food service recovery and will continue to present challenges to our livestock business in the U.S. The more recent resurgence of COVID-19 cases in parts of the U.S. and expanding rates of infection in international markets continues to create uncertainty around the duration, scope and economic impact of the pandemic.  Please note that our guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of mid-July and given our global footprint, movement in foreign exchange has had an impact on revenue and adjusted net income since we issued our prior guidance in May.  Our current guidance includes favorable foreign exchange at revenue of approximately $50 million and approximately $10 million at adjusted net income versus May guidance.  For revenue, we're raising and narrowing our guidance range with projected revenue now between $6.3 billion and $6.475 billion and operational revenue growth of between 3% and 6% for the full year versus the negative 2% to positive 3% we had in our May guidance.  Adjusted net income is now expected to be in the range of between $1.685 billion and $1.765 billion, representing operational growth, a positive 1% to positive 5% compared to our prior guidance of negative 9% to negative 3%. Adjusted diluted EPS is now expected to be in the range of $3.52 to $3.68 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $3.14 to $3.32. In closing, while the COVID-19 pandemic has certainly presented a set of challenges we have not seen in the past. We're extremely proud of our colleagues and the commitment they have shown toward our customers, our company, and animal healthcare.  During this time, we have demonstrated the diversity and durability of our portfolio, the resiliency of our industry, and we have confidence in our ability to continue to execute on our strategy during these uncertain times. Now, I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?
Q - Jon Block: Great. Thanks guys. I guess, I'll try to just load everything upfront. Glenn, I think op margins were at an all-time high in the midst of a global pandemic, so congrats. But some of that was likely eaten by mix. Yet, it seems like that mix may remain, as you mentioned, intact or favorable for the next couple of quarters. So as we think about margins into the back part of the year, is there anything to call out overall? And what about the cadence of 3Q versus 4Q?  Kristin, for you, just to shift over there, maybe if you can just talk to what you're seeing for a competitive response on Trio. And just a clarification, the new platform for diagnostics of the new offering is that in a new VetScan analyzer that displaces the old one? Or is it a different unit specific for pathology? A lot there. But thanks for your time.
Glenn David: So Jon, I'll address the first part of your question with operating margins and mix. So as you say, we have very favorable gross margin in this quarter as well as the first half of the year. As we look into the second half of the year, we do expect there to be some deterioration in gross margin. And that does come from product mix, right? The separation that we've seen in performance in the quarter, livestock declined 5% operationally. Companion animal growth grew 13%. We expect that to narrow in the second half of the year, the differential in performance between companion animal and livestock. So that will negatively impact mix.  The other component is that we generally have a larger portion of livestock sales in the second half of the year than we do have in the first half of the year. The other component to consider is OpEx. As we move into the second half of the year and our field returns more and more to visiting clinics, T&E expenses, which has been very favorable, particularly in Q2, will rise as we go into Q3 and Q4. In terms of the dynamics between Q3 and Q4, don't really see any big differential in terms of the dynamics between Q3 and Q4.
Kristin Peck: Okay. Hey Jon. With regards to your question on competitive response to Trio. It's been the response that we largely expected. Obviously, this is an innovative product. They were very aware it was coming. They're obviously running promotions. You probably saw some stock-ins as we probably saw as you move from Q1 to Q2, but we're really not seeing anything that we weren't expecting overall.  And to address your other question with regards to images, it's a completely separate product. It is actually a scanner and a microscope that then uploads to the cloud for analysis. So it is completely separate than VetScan. And it's a platform. And the first product, as we mentioned, will be around fecal, but it is not a replacement at all of the VetScan machine. It's a separate one that is both a scanner and a microscope.
Operator: And our next question comes from John Kreger with William Blair. Please go ahead.
Jon Kaufman: Hi, good morning. This is Jon Kaufman on for Kreger. I'd like to focus a little bit on livestock here. It'd be great to get a sense of your expectation for what the outlook looks like, not just in the coming quarter or two, but really into 2021 and over the medium term. So I guess a couple of questions within that. First, how much of a residual impact will the processing capacity issues have?  And then second, on the lower foodservice demand, let's just say, hypothetically, the U.S. consumer really isn't ready to go out to restaurants until spring or summer of 2021, do you expect producers to exit and then you're serving a smaller end market? Or is it more of producers realize this is a period of limited profitability, but they don't adjust herd sizes and they stay in the market? Thank you.
Kristin Peck: Sure. Thanks, Jon. A few things on that. I think the two big trends you're seeing in U.S. livestock – and I’d say you have to look at livestock. 50% of our livestock business is actually outside the U.S. and it grew at 4%. So again, this speaks to the diversity of our portfolio. But if you look at the sort of global trends you're talking about with regards to the movement from eating out to eating in, we do expect that to continue. And the guidance we've given for the rest of the year is that, that largely doesn't change too dramatically. It's obviously too early to tell in 2021 how that ultimately adjusts.  The second factor to consider in the livestock overall is the packing plants, which have been an issue in the U.S. Packing plant capacity in the U.S. still looks to be about 95% to 97%. And in some businesses, that may be good, but that does continue to back up animals. But again, this is mostly a U.S. trend, although we have seen a few isolated issues outside of the U.S. and Europe, Australia and some other markets.  But again, I think what producers are doing are doing their best to actually alter where they can the flow of animals. This is much easier for poultry to do, given they only have to make decisions on 45 days. Pigs can do it over six months. So I think you will see a slight reduction in the U.S. in pork. It is much harder for cattle producers. Most of those animals are already here. So we do see cattle probably continuing to struggle probably through the first half of next year.  But I think the third factor besides the dine in, dine out and packing plants to consider is actually the export market. What has really helped maintain a lot of the lot of the U.S. livestock flows has been the export market, with the largest player there clearly being China. And given ASF, they are still in need of a tremendous amount of pork. So those are the three factors that we're considering that gives us confidence that, to your question, in the short to medium term.  In general, livestock has grown around 5%. Obviously, it's been a little lower in the last few years. And I think, again, International was 4%. We were negative in the U.S. We do think in the medium term it goes back to normal levels, but we do think livestock will continue to be challenged certainly this year and likely at least to the first half of next year. Thanks, Jon. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. 
Michael Ryskin: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Just two sort of quick ones for me. First, on the guide, for revenues and guidance of 3% to 6% core growth. I just want to make sure I'm not missing anything. Because you did 4% in the second quarter, you're over 5% year-to-date. Over end of the range actually impose pretty meaningful deceleration from the second quarter, and yet most trends are pointing upwards.  So I'm just wondering if you could go into that sort of what points you to 3%, what points you to 6%. When you guided in the first quarter you talked about a second wave in the fall and winter. Is something like that in your assumptions now? Or is there anything underlying going on there?  And then the second question, again, on the digital VetScan pathology instrument you talked about. Just a little bit of a follow-up. Is it an instrument-only product? Will there be consumables attached to it. And are you planning any different rollout in U.S. versus international? Thanks.
Glenn David: So Mike, just in terms of your first question in terms of the guidance in revenue of the 34% to 6% growth. So to your point, in the first half, we grew 5% with a limited impact from COVID-19 in Q1. That would imply a second half of 2% to 7% growth essentially. I think, a, it's first important to understand that, in the first half, that 5% growth did have a contribution from acquisitions of about 1%, which we won't have that same contribution in the second half of the year because of when the timing of those acquisitions occurred last year. So that really brings you to organic growth of about 4% in the first half of the year, which is the real comparator for that implied 2% to 7% growth in the second half of the year.  So really pretty balanced between first half and second half organically with the first quarter not really having a significant impact from COVID-19. To your question about what brings you to the low end of the range, that would be a more would be a more severe impact of COVID-19 than we're seeing today across our markets. What takes you to the higher end of that range is things sort of stabilizing as they are for the rest of the year without a more rapid or more significant impact of COVID-19.
Kristin Peck: Sure. And to take the second half of your question, Mike, on images, we will be launching the U.S. and a few markets outside of the U.S. as we move into the end of Q3 to Q4. And there are consumables, but the consumable – the consumables, obviously, reagents there, but there's also a read. So obviously, with every test that's done, the read that's done in the cloud is also a fee. So there are both – some products to use to prepare the specimen. But there's also – more importantly, the read of each test in the cloud. So it's a consumable, I suppose, but it's almost like a different way of looking at it, which is a cost per read. I hope that answers it. Thanks, Mike.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: [Indiscernible] for Chris. Thank you for taking the questions. The first one is on African Swine Fever. You've touched upon this in your prepared remarks, but talk about where we are in terms of the recovery in China. How much of the herd has been rebuilt? And would you expect this to represent a tailwind in the second half of the year?  And then another one on livestock. It seems a part of the dynamic that COVID is creating is producers switching to lower-cost alternatives. To what extent is this happening? And how sticky do you think this dynamic is as we think about recovery in 2021 and beyond. Thank you.
Kristin Peck: Sure. So Sure. So we'll start with your question with regard to African Swine Fever in China. What we've been seeing in China overall is that the larger, more sophisticated integrated producers are starting to rebuild their herd. As you saw, very strong growth in our China business of 24%. What you're seeing underlying this is the beginning of the rebuild of these herds. This is more isolated to sophisticated producers who can ensure biosecurity. Because to be clear, there's still African Swine Fever present in China. So I think what you're seeing is some of the smaller backyard producers are not rebuilding there, but we are seeing some of the more sophisticated ones doing so. And that is a positive trend for us because they would be more likely to use our products overall. But if you look at African Swine Fever, we are still predicting that China will have to continue to import pork a significant amount for the next few years.  So this rebuild is slow because, as I said, there is still African Swine Fever in China in a few isolated markets as well outside of China. So I suppose, if you look at that, for China, it will continue to be a tailwind for us, continuing to drive the China business as that herd rebuild.  And with regard to your second question on livestock and whether we're – some people are switching to lower-cost alternatives. Historically, that has been the case. So people will trade down. What's slightly different is that this is a pandemic with a recession. And I say that because, as long as there's more protein than people need, the price goes down. So hamburger meat right now is actually still pretty cheap.  So historically, we would've seen a recession. People trade down from beef to pork to chicken’s egg. So we think that's still a longer-term trend. But with the disruption right now and the overcapacity, you are still seeing some other proteins still in certain markets on a relative basis not be that expensive. So I think it's – I would say your overall hypothesis over the medium to long term is true, although in certain markets, given overcapacity, the difference in price is not as dramatic as it normally is.
Operator: And we'll take our – next question comes from Louise Chen with Cantor. Please go ahead.
Louise Chen: Hi, thanks for taking my question. So I wanted to ask you how COVID-19 has changed the way you do business on both the livestock and companion animal side? What efficiencies have emerged? And what could be here to stay? Thank you.
Kristin Peck: Sure. Thanks, Louise. I think, similar to all businesses, we are – we've had to adjust the way we operate, and I've been incredibly impressed as the resilience of our colleagues and our customers and their creativity. So the first trend is we've obviously moved a lot more to doing virtual seminars or webinars to handling orders and things like that by phone. Our customers have adapted to more telemedicine in certain markets around the world. And if you look at more broadly in the U.S. and in certain markets outside the U.S. to e-commerce. So that is obviously for us, it's supporting our producers, our veterinarians and pet owners to make sure they can access our products wherever they our products wherever they need. But I think some of the skills that our field force is now learning will be one that will help us in the future, obviously reduces some of the travel that some of them had to do.  But our field force across the world, where businesses are allowing, are actually back seeing customers. Now it's not as many customers as they saw before in a day, and that has to be both a customer and a colleague feeling comfortable in a given market. But it also has to flex, obviously, given some of the flare-ups in the U.S. geographically and across the world, a lot more flexibility there. So I think it's both our customers getting creative and flexible and our field force and some of our capabilities overall as the company to be able to meet our customers where they are. So I think I'm quite impressed at how our colleagues and our customers have adopted.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Westenberg from Guggenheim. Please go ahead.
David Westenberg: Hi, thanks for taking the questions and congrats on a great quarter. So for my first question, are you anticipating any kind of competitive launch in the derm in the next year, say, 2021? I know we've heard about potential competitive launches for five – probably five years now, but this time it kind of feels a little bit different. And then for my second question is on the diagnostic platform. Is there any limitation to the sample type, say blood fecal, urine even maybe physical tissue, et cetera? And is there a component that might have a reagent to it? Thank you.
Kristin Peck: Sure. Sure, so I'll start David with your first question on the Durham portfolio. We were obviously quite pleased with its performance in the quarter, growing 24%. This is now obviously a blockbuster products as well as category. And to your point, we have expected competition for a while given the attractiveness of the sector. At this point in time, as you know – we have very intelligence, as you know, in our industry with regards to competitive launches, but based on what we know today, we are not expecting a competitive launch in the rest of 2020 and likely the first half of 2021. Obviously that's always subject to change since we don't know exactly what our competitors are doing, but we continue to believe that we will have competition in the space, but we, at this point, do not believe it's in the next 6 to 12 months. So our focus right now on our Durham portfolio is building those brands as big as we can. And if you saw in the quarter, our focus on direct-to-consumer advertising in the U.S. to continue to grow our share and to build the market itself. So your second question with regards to the platform, the images platform, what we're saying is it's the first fecal will be the first. Obviously, it could look at lots of others. I mean that's still – product that is still in our research and development to look at other types such as obviously blood and other types. But those are not things we are prepared at this point to discuss, but obviously the platform lends itself to be able to do multiple different tissue types. Thanks so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Balaji Prasad from Barclays. Please go ahead.
Balaji Prasad: Hi, good morning and thanks for taking my question. So two parts. Firstly, Kristin, there's a material change in the competitive landscape with a new number two company. So I would like to understand your thoughts on what the Elanco and Bayer merger means for the industry and for Zoetis specifically as the number one company. Secondly, you've been championing technology adoption of the firm. So I want to explore one of the priority areas, you mentioned, digital and data analytics. And what does that mean in actual terms is the revenue driver is an operational efficiency measure or a mix of both? Thank you.
Kristin Peck: Sure. Thanks, Balaji. For starters on the combination of Elanco and Bayer, as we said previously, we don't really see this as changing the competitive landscape in any dramatic way. We've competed against both of them many times before. Obviously, the acquisition of Bayer by Elanco will increase their business in the OTC space, where we honestly don't really operate. We do in the direct-to-consumer side, but not in the over-the-counter. So it's not a space that's important to us, especially with our focus on the veterinarian where that's more of a retail market there. So we don't foresee that changing it. They're both been well-capitalized competitors historically, so we don't see that as a major change. With regards to digital and data analytics, I think, it's an - and it is both a revenue driver as we announced today with IMAGYST certainly looking at products that drive revenues, such as platforms, such as vet. We've also spoken about precision livestock farming. So there's a numbers of ways in both companion animal and livestock that this continues to help us drive revenue in, but it's also an area where we can also be much more efficient, better targeting our customers, looking at new ways through e-commerce and other channels. We've done some quite exciting things. In China, for example, launching our own revolution page there and leveraging different tools in digital and data to just also make us more efficient, so to drive revenue and just increase our efficiency. So I think it is a – it's both. Thanks, Balaji.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Nathan Rich: Good morning. Thanks for the questions. I wanted to start with Simparica Trio. You mentioned the clinic penetration is occurring, I think, at a more moderate pace than what you initially anticipated. Kristin, it'd just be great to get your view on kind of what you've seen so far and maybe what factors have had the biggest impact on pace of uptake? And do you think that we'll see the typical seasonality that you usually see in the parasiticide business, obviously a lot different about this year than maybe past year? And then the second question, if I could just ask it upfront. On the vet channel overall, how much of the strength do you think kind of might be backlog or pent-up demand versus what might be, excuse me, more sustainable as we think about trends in that part of your business over the balance of the year?
Kristin Peck: Thanks, Nathan. So as we look at Trio, we started shipping the distribution in late March and launched the product in April, right and probably the height of the pandemic at least in the U.S. What we've seen to date is that – that was more difficult for clinics to take on new products. That's often something that requires an in-person meeting and training of staff, et cetera. So we saw a slight – versus what we expected fewer penetration of clinics, but what we've been incredibly pleased about and why we've given the guidance of $100 million to 125 million, is that for the – we've been quite successful in corporate accounts ones that we engage quite early on this larger clinics and the ones we penetrated, our share in those clinics has grown faster than we expected. So I think that's been a positive. So I – again, we're continuing to grow our penetration of clinics, but we're quite pleased with the share. And what we're also pleased about is it's had less of an impact certainly in cannibalizing Simparica, which has been great. So we've certainly taken share from others, but our data also suggests we're also bringing new people back to the category of oral parasiticides, which we think is pretty exciting there. So, I think – whether this will be a typical season, if you look at some of the data with regards to vet visits Q2 year-over-year, they're still down, I think, about 3%, but it's a significant improvement from the negative 20 to negative 30 you saw it in the U.S. in the beginning of the quarter. But what's really interesting and what might affect your second – your question there is that the spend per visit, however, is up dramatically. So, latest data, we'll say it's maybe up about 7%. We do think that's going to moderate over time. This is probably people buying more of the products so they don't have to return to the vet in case there's something. So we do expect that to moderate some in the coming quarters, but that might mean that people may versus the normal – historical six months, six or so – six or seven months of buying the parasiticides, maybe they bought more. So we'll see that that goes, but we are expecting that to moderate. So I think, overall, we're looking for continued positive trends in companion animal, but I think it will be dependent on geography by geography.
Operator: And our next question comes from Kathy Miner with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.
Kathy Miner: Thank you. Good morning. I have two questions. First, just going back to the dermatology business given that you talked about the trends were good and people are staying home with their pets more. Could we anticipate greater near-term sales for both Apoquel and Cytopoint? And would this be true in both the U.S. and OUS? Second question, just on companion animal vaccines, when you talk about the vet visits and the greater revenue per visit, have you seen a ketchup in vaccines? And is this still working its way through the system? Or do you think we're already there? And just a clarification on the share repurchase, I just want to clarify that is in fact still on hold. Thank you.
Glenn David: Yes, so – Kathy, I'll take the questions on dermatology on and on share repurchase. So in terms of the derm portfolio, if you look back to last year, we had over $750 million in sales and we grew 29%, right. Obviously, with a bigger base of revenue, we were expecting that growth rate to slow down. When you look at year-to-date, however, we've grown 25%, and that has exceeded our expectations and there's been a number of drivers in that. We've continued to invest behind the portfolio, it should drive growth and we've seen a very positive return on that. So we do expect to see better than expected performance in the derm portfolio than we would have when we started out the year, which is really pretty impressive considering the impact of COVID-19 as well. And it's a franchise that we will continue to make sure that we invest behind the growth in. In terms of share repurchase, we did mention on the last call that we were suspending our share repurchase for Q2, we are also suspending for Q3, and we'll continue to evaluate that throughout the year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Gregg Gilbert with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.
Gregg Gilbert: Thanks. Kristin, I have a question. I'm sorry if this came up, I don't think it's a bit about insurance, both the company’s involvement and then a broader industry question. So first question is what have you learned about pet insurance? And what went well? And what did not go so well in your launch in that space? And separate from Zoetis’ involvement in that space, longer-term do you see broader based interest in pet owners buying insurance? It seems like everyone with pet sort of gripes about their out-of-pocket yet utilization of insurance is quite low. Do you think that's an employer mediate – employer mediated phenomenon that needs to be jump started or what are your thoughts on increasing penetration of insurance in the pet space over time? Thanks.
Kristin Peck: Sure, thanks, Gregg. When we entered the space, it was really about assisting the pet owner and getting the care and increasing access to care and supporting the vet and providing the best care they can. And oftentimes, one of the challenges there is the sort of unexpected expense. So our focus really has been in this to get like a product that's more attractive to the consumer or to your point, the U.S. versus the rest of the world is underpenetrated in pet insurance. But we think the primary reason there is not because of employers or anything other than we think, you know, some of the products have not been as attractive to pet owners. So we really felt that the way we launched this, the focus on the pet owner would be attractive. We are pleased with our performance to date of our product with regards to Pumpkin, which is our pet insurance. And we look at that what's going to drive that and what feedback, we did get some feedback from veterinarians and they had concerns with regard to the inclusion of parasiticide. So we did change the – that program a little bit to look – focus more on diagnostics. And this is part of continuing to launch a new product and really iterate with our customers both with pet owners and vets to make it as attractive as we can. This is still a very, very small business relative to the rest of our business to be perfectly honest with you. It's not terribly material, but we are very pleased with how the company has been doing to date and most specifically in the number of new policies they continue to attract. And our goal is that we can make insurance grow the overall market, which is not hard to do since in the U.S., I think it’s only 2% to 3% versus the other markets outside the U.S.
Operator: We will take our next question from Navin Jacob with UBS. Please go ahead.
Prakhar Agrawal: Hi, this is Prakhar Agrawal on behalf of Navin Jacob. My first question is on your antibodies. How do you see these products being differentiated versus some of your competitors, such as Elanco’s Galliprant, and how are you thinking about the market opportunity here? And second question is did you increase in alternative channels have a material impact on your margins this quarter and a longer-term with continued increase in alternative channels, how should we think about the impact on your margin profile? Thank you.
Kristin Peck: Sure. I'll start with the first question on the monoclonal antibodies and I'll let Glenn take the second question with regards to the alternative channels. Obviously, we don't have an approved product, so it's hard to say exactly how it would stack-up. But the focus on monoclonal antibodies is really a focus on a product with strong efficacy, with a strong safety profile. And these are large markets for example in the K9 space. We think that have gotten really comfortable with monoclonal antibodies as is evidenced by our performance on Cytopoint. It really also addresses a strong compliance issue, which is you remember to give the product to your dog every day. But it would say if you think about the feline or the cat monoclonal antibodies, there really aren't any products out there today in the cat space. So we think this is quite innovative in the cat monoclonal antibody space with really very little existing products that cat owners or vets can use. So we're quite excited, but until we have a profile it would be hard to say very specifically, but certainly from a compliance and safety perspective and efficacy, we think these will be very strong products that we think both vets and pet owners will be quite excited about. So, Glenn, do you want to take the second question?
Glenn David:  Sure. So in terms of the impact of alternative channels on our margins, it did not have a material impact, and that's just based on the overall size of our sales in those channels, right. It really is limited to our U.S. companion animal business. So while the channel has expanded significantly in the quarter, it still represents less than 3% of our sales. So it's still not a big impact on the overall margin, but just to give a sense of the growth that we have seen. In 2019, in our U.S. companion animal business, the alternative channels represented about $100 million of sales for the year. In this quarter alone in Q2 that number was about $50 million. So that gives you a sense of the rapid increase we're seeing in these channels, but it's still small over an overall portion of our business to really impact our overall margins.
Operator: And there does appear to be no further questions at this time. And I'll turn the call back over to your speakers for any additional remarks.
Kristin Peck: Okay, well, thanks everybody. I want to thank you for your questions and for your continued interest in Zoetis. While there's still many uncertainties around the impact and the resolution of COVID-19, the fundamental strength of our business and industry, we believe are proven and unchanged, and we remain very confident what Zoetis can achieve this year based on the diversity of our portfolio, the resiliency of our business, and certainly the spirit of our colleagues. So thanks for joining us today.
Operator: Thank you. And this does conclude today’s program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-05-06 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the First Quarter 2020 Financial Results Conference Call and Webcast for Zoetis. Hosting the call today is Steve Frank, Vice President of Investor Relations for Zoetis. The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, and will not be forwarded automatically. In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call via dial-in or on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for your questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.
Steve Frank: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I hope you are all doing well. Welcome to the Zoetis first quarter 2020 earnings call. I am joined today by Kristin Peck, our Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn David, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statement in today's press release and our SEC filings, including, but not limited to, our annual report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q. Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures which were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and in the company's 8-K filing dated today, May 6, 2020. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. With that, I will turn the call over to Kristin.
Kristin Peck: Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. I hope you and your families are staying healthy and safe. I think it's fair to say the past few months have been unlike any we've ever experienced in business or that any of us could have imagined for our families, friends and communities. The global COVID-19 pandemic has had such an incredible impact on our world and for many of us personally. It has given me a chance to reflect, not just on the financial numbers we reported today, but on the true value our business provides society, the role we play in public health, the support we deliver for our customers in crisis and the safety and security we provide to our colleagues. For Zoetis, we're privileged to play an essential role in sustaining and protecting animal and human life during the outbreak. Our products and services play a critical part in animal health, helping support pet care and the food supply, and we've continued to manufacture products and serve customers even in places that have imposed stringent limits on businesses in the wake of the coronavirus. Our colleagues are more committed than ever to supporting the nutrition and comfort that animals provide the world and that purpose has motivated us to continue serving our customers and communities in these extraordinary times. I'm especially proud of the efforts of Zoetis colleagues in supporting our local communities, healthcare workers and businesses during the outbreak. We've been contributing surplus personal protective equipment from our operations. We've been increasing production of human health diagnostics and answering requests from local hospitals for a variety of assistance. As far as the direct impact of COVID-19 on our colleagues, we've been fortunate to see only a small number of COVID-19 cases in our workforce of more than 10,000 colleagues. Thanks to increased safety measures, hygiene protocols and adjustments to our operations. About 70% of our colleagues today are working remotely. They are being productive as they adjust to new arrangements, juggle new home and family responsibilities and benefit from the use of technology infrastructure that we've invested in and continue to enhance at this time. The other 30% of our colleagues are working at our sites supporting essential operations such as manufacturing, distribution and logistics, clinical trials and research and technical services and support for customers. Our teams in Zoetis sites are adhering to strict health and hygiene protocols recommended by the WHO and CDC. They're practicing social distancing, operating in staggered shifts and participating in health monitoring, all as part of the adjustments we've made at each plant to limit potential exposure. Our 30 manufacturing sites remain open around the globe today and we've been able to maintain supply of critical product inventories. We've also shown excellent agility to deal with the local market changes in terms of border controls, regulatory changes and freight operations. I'm also pleased to say that even under these difficult circumstances, we were able to meet our launch timing for Simparica Trio, our highly anticipated triple combination parasiticide. We launched Simparica Trio in the UK, Spain, and Italy in February. Made initial shipments for distribution in the U.S. in March and initiated the full launch in the U.S. and Canada in April, with more markets to follow. We've seen significant interest in Trio and we've been supporting its introduction with consumer ads in the U.S. this spring. While we're excited by the introduction and the receptiveness of customers and pet owners, we've had to revisit full year projections for Simparica Trio, given the expected impact of COVID-19 and the recession. Glenn will speak more to this in his remarks. We are grateful, we've been able to keep our major R&D programs on track. We continue to advance our research in key areas such as monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain in cats and dogs and vector vaccines for poultry. We're continuing with regulatory reviews, commissions are going in and we're maintaining momentum at our most critical projects for the future, all while keeping colleagues safe. From a P&L perspective, in the first quarter, the pandemic had a limited impact on our results given the February quarter-end for international markets and the timing of shelter in place across the U.S. We generated 7% operational growth in revenue and 10% operational growth in adjusted net income, thanks to the strength of our diverse portfolio and global scope of our business. We expect a more significant revenue impact from COVID-19 in Q2 and for the year as the lockdowns and recession have a continued impact on our business, especially in terms of traffic at companion animal clinics and reduction in demand for protein from their restaurant and dine out sectors. We will need to watch carefully how the reopening of various markets in the coming weeks impact veterinary services for companion animals as well as livestock. Glenn will discuss 2020 guidance in more detail in a few minutes, but I'm pleased to share that Zoetis remains a resilient company at times like these, given the essential nature of our business and our diverse portfolio. In most markets, our sales teams are working virtually to respect local government guidance and limit potential exposure of COVID-19 for colleagues and customers. We've been keeping in regular contact with our customers through phone calls, video conferences, webinars and surveys. And we're responding as best we can to anticipate and address their most important needs. We're here to help them maintain critical care and supply for their customers at this time and adapt to a new normal for the future of animal care. For example, we've been advising customers on increasing digital content for their use of pet owners, offering telemedicine solutions through new partnerships, discussing their liquidity concerns, offering continuing education for veterinary staff and providing technical support services to deal with adjustments being made to food production. We are seeing many of the trends you are in terms of animal health and food supply as well as decreased traffic to veterinary practices, but history tells us that animal health medicines, vaccines and other products remain essential even in a challenging economy. On the livestock side of the business, the need for food hasn't gone away, but with restaurants and hotels closed, consumer demand has shifted to supermarkets. There's less demand for beef and dairy products while poultry remains strong as people choose less expensive proteins. As with every front-line business today, the biggest challenge our livestock customers are having is maintaining their operations with enough healthy workers to handle processing, packing, and delivering food. On the pet side of the business, veterinary traffic is down in places where containment measures are in place. Now, many vets are leveraging curbside check-ins, home visits, telemedicine and online pharmacy distribution to take the place of in-clinic visits. As you look ahead, our business continuity plans are working well and we continue to show great agility and responsiveness to this crisis. We are carefully managing our expenses and doing scenario planning for the medium and long-term, including hiring freezes and rejections to discretionary spending such as travel, entertainment and consulting. We have not had to engage in furloughs or salary reductions for our colleagues. Thanks to the resiliency and diversification of our business and our strong balance sheet. We continue to regularly assess any long-term needs depending on the duration of the pandemic and the resulting recession. Like all companies, we begun planning for the days when more of our colleagues will return to the workplace. Over the last few months, we have safely maintained operations in our manufacturing distribution and R&D facilities to ensure continuous supply to our customers while maintaining strict quality standards and keeping our colleagues safe. We plan to leverage these enhanced policies and procedures for a phased return to work that helps ensure the safety of not just our colleagues, but the customers they interact within the field. I am proud of our teams for their resourcefulness, flexibility and commitment to colleagues and customers. Their efforts are helping us to envision an even better way to work over the long-term. When we began this year, my first as CEO, I laid out five priorities for Zoetis and those are as relevant today as they were then. Our priorities remain driving innovative growth, enhancing customer experience, leading in digital and data analytics, cultivating a high performing organization and championing a healthier, more sustainable future. As we managed through the crisis to this new normal, we will find relevant new ways to adapt our strategies and tactics for the future. Even in the midst of COVID-19, we continue to act on opportunities to advance these priorities. Since February, we received approval of Simparica Trio in the U.S. and Australia and have launched it in several markets with the support of direct-to-consumer advertising and digital marketing where applicable. We acquired Performance Livestock Analytics, a company which brings us proven cloud-based management systems and data analytics for beef producers. And we announced Pumpkin, a new pet health startup is offering pet insurance and preventative care in the U.S. Once again, I'm very proud of the results we've been able to deliver this quarter and I look forward to your questions. Now, let me hand over to Glenn for more detail on the first quarter results and our updated view for the rest of 2020. Glenn?
Glenn David: Thank you, Kristin and good morning. Echoing Kristin’s comments, we find ourselves in a world we never imagined. I’m grateful for our colleagues as they balance new working arrangements, caring for their families, and keeping our essential business running during this crisis. Today I'll provide commentary on our Q1 results, provide clarity on our liquidity position and review our updated guidance for 2020. Historically, we know that Zoetis has remained a resilient company, given the essential nature of our business and our diverse portfolio. But no one yet knows the full extent, duration or implications that this pandemic will have. Our updated guidance reflects our best estimates based on what we know today. Beginning with the first quarter results, we generated revenue of $1.5 billion, representing an increase of 5% on a reported basis and 7% operationally. Adjusted net income of $455 million, increased 7% on a reported basis and 10% operationally. Foreign exchange in the quarter drove an unfavorable 2% impact on revenue, driven by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Operational revenue growth of 7% was driven by 3% price and 4% volume. Volume growth of 4% includes 2% from key dermatology products, 2% from new products, 1% from acquisitions, and a decline of 1% in other inline products. The first quarter was not materially impacted by the outbreak of COVID-19, given the February quarter end for our international markets and the timing of quarantine guidelines in the U.S. However, as indicated in our updated guidance ranges, we anticipate a more significant impact for the full year as the lockdowns and recessions have a continued impact on our business. Companion animal products led the way in terms of species growth, growing 10% operationally while livestock grew 3% operationally. Companion animal performance was driven by continued strength of our key dermatology products and parasiticide portfolio, which includes initial sales of Simparica Trio in both the U.S. and certain European markets. Revenue from the acquisition of Platinum Performance, which was acquired in the second half of 2019 and its nutritional products also contributed to strong equine growth. Livestock growth in the quarter was primarily driven by strong poultry, swine and fish performance partially offset by declines in cattle. New products contributed 2% to overall growth in the quarter, driven by some Simparica Trio and ProHeart 12 and our Alpha Flux parasiticide for fish in Chile. We remain very excited and confident in our ability to successfully launch Simparica Trio beginning with key markets in Europe and the U.S. However, we are now anticipating the incremental revenue for the full year to be in the range of $100 million to $125 million. The initial response from veterinarians has been extremely encouraging. However, due to the current COVID-19 situation, clinic penetration and adoption will be more gradual than initially expected. Global sales of our key dermatology portfolio were $194 million in the quarter, growing 25% operationally and contributing 2% to overall revenue growth. The ongoing strength of this portfolio was driven by expanded usage of APOQUEL, resulting from promotional investments, increased adoption of CYTOPOINT, as well as entry into new markets and price. Recent acquisitions and commercial agreements contributed 1% growth this quarter, which includes Platinum Performance, our reference lab acquisitions and the stable lab diagnostic test for equine. Other in-line products declined this quarter, primarily driven by declines in U.S. cattle related to ongoing beef and dairy market challenges. Now, let's discuss the revenue growth by segment for the quarter. U.S. revenue grew 9% with companion animal products growing 12% and livestock products growing 5%. Companion animal growth in the quarter was driven by increased sales of our key dermatology products, growth of the Simparica franchise and the impact of recent acquisitions. This growth was partially offset by declines in point-of-care diagnostics. U.S. key dermatology sales were $136 million for the quarter, growing, 31%. Growth this quarter was driven by ongoing promotional investments and expanded usage of CYTOPOINT in the clinic. Simparica Trio revenue in the quarter included initial sales, the distribution channels with product becoming available to veterinarians for prescribing in mid-April. We're supporting the launch with strong field force engagement and direct-to-consumer advertising. We remain confident in the long-term success of this product, despite launching within the current environment. Diagnostic sales in the quarter were primarily impacted by distributor purchasing patterns and slower demands in March related to COVID-19. U.S. livestock returned to growth this quarter, supported by positive performance in poultry and swine, partially offset by cattle declines. Poultry continues to benefit from our portfolio of alternatives to antibiotics and medicated feed additives, driven by new customer adoption and efficacy challenges for a competitive product. Swine also had a strong quarter, driven by increased sales of any effectives and the one-time replenishment of a classical swine fever vaccine stockpile by the USDA. Cattle product sales continued to be negatively impacted by unfavorable beef market conditions driven by feedlot placements of heavier and healthier animals with a lower risk profile and dairy continue to face headwinds from negative producer profitability and oversupply. To summarize, U.S. performance was strong, despite ongoing challenges in U.S. and dairy cattle markets. Our International segment had operational revenue growth of 4% in the quarter. Companion animal operational revenue growth was 8% and livestock operational growth was 2%. Companion animal product growth resulted from increased sales of our Simparica franchise, including the launch of Simparica Trio in certain EU markets and growth in our key dermatology portfolio. New diagnostic customer accounts and strong performance in China also contributed to growth in the quarter, despite the impact of social distancing measures in China. International livestock growth in the quarter was driven primarily by swine, fish and poultry. Swine returned to growth in the quarter, due to expanding herd production and key account penetration across emerging markets including China. Our short-term outlook for China remains neutral to slightly positive as they rebuild due to lower incidents of African Swine Fever. However, certain smaller markets in Asia continue to experiences challenges related to ASF. The fish portfolio benefited from the continued uptake of the Alpha Flux parasiticide in Chile, while poultry growth was driven primarily by price. Overall, our International segment continued to be a positive contributor to revenue growth with all species flat to growing, including swine returning to growth even in the current challenging environment. Now moving on to the rest of the P&L. Adjusted gross margin of 70.3% increased slightly on a reported basis compared to the prior year, due to price partially offset by the mildly deluded impact of recent acquisitions. Total adjusted operating expenses grew 7% operationally. The increase was primarily related to the impact of recent acquisitions, investments to support future growth of the business and direct-to-consumer advertising. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 16.8%, the decrease from the comparable 2019 period is primarily driven by the tax benefits from share-based compensation. Adjusted net income for the quarter grew 10% operationally driven by revenue growth and a lower effective tax rate and adjusted diluted EPS grew 10% operationally. Next I'd like to cover our liquidity position and our capital allocation priorities. We ended the first quarter with approximately $2 billion in cash and cash equivalents, as well as access to $1 billion revolving credit facility and a coinciding commercial paper program, both of which are undrawn. Given a strong cash flow and balance sheet, we remain committed to our capital allocation priorities of internal investment, M&A and returning excess cash to shareholders. Consistent with what I mentioned last quarter, we are anticipating elevated capital expenditures this year to support investments in manufacturing, information technology to support our recent acquisitions and capabilities in digital and data analytics. However, we are delaying expenditures that will not materially impact our medium and long-term growth strategy. Our strong liquidity also allows us to be opportunistic and continue executing on our M&A strategy. In consistent with what I've said before, our focus is on strategic acquisitions, not large scale transformational M&A. Our recent acquisitions of Performance Livestock Analytics is a good example. With regards to returning excess cash to shareholders, we remain committed to our 2020 dividend, which represents a 22% increase over 2019. In Q1, we also repurchased $250 million in Zoetis shares and we have approximately $1.4 billion remaining under our multi-year share repurchase program. However, in light of the current situation, we have decided to temporarily suspend our share repurchases and conserve cash. Now moving on to our updated guidance assumptions for 2020. As I noted earlier, we cannot know the full extent of the COVID-19 pandemic, as the situation continues to evolve daily. Our updated guidance reflects our current assumptions and may change materially as the situation progresses. Our guidance assumes that the economy begins to open up in the second half of the year with pet care visits returning to more normalized levels as the year progresses and our livestock customers being able to maintain their operations. It also assumes a continued recession this year. We have increased the width of our ranges, as the timing of returning to normal operations and the depth of the recession is still uncertain. Please note that guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late April and movement in foreign exchange rate has had a significant impact on our revenue and adjusted net income, since prior guidance, given our global footprint. Our current guidance includes unstable foreign exchange revenue of approximately $150 million and approximately $50 million at adjusted net income, primarily driven by the Brazilian real, Mexican peso and the euro. We are now projecting revenue between $5.95 billion and $6.25 billion, representing a 2% operational decline to 3% operational growth. Adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue is now expected to be in the range of 30.5% to 31.5%, increasing slightly from February guidance due to increased manufacturing and freight costs related to COVID-19. Adjusted SG&A expenses for the year are now expected to be between $1.455 billion and $1.545 billion with the decrease from the February guidance, driven by savings and compensation due to hiring freezes and reductions to discretionary spending, such as travel and entertainment and professional service spent. As Kristin indicated, our key R&D programs are progressing and so adjusted R&D expenses are now expected to be between $440 million and $465 million, consistent with our commitment to invest in pipeline opportunities. We're also continuing to invest in strategic areas of focus such as diagnostics, biodevices, and precision livestock farming and strategies to maximize the value of the continuum of care through integrated offerings. While we were taking measures to reduce expenses this year, we also remain committed to bring medium and long-term growth and value to our shareholders. Adjusted interest and other income deductions is now expected to be approximately $215 million with the increase over February guidance driven by lower interest income and other factors. Our adjusted effective tax rate for 2020 is expected to be in the range of 20% to 21%, consistent with February guidance. Adjusted net income is expected to be in a range of $1.52 billion to $1.64 billion representing an operational decline of 2% to 9%. Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $3.17 to $3.42 and reported diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.80 to $3.07. While our guidance represents full year expectations, we do anticipate revenue and adjusted net income to be most significantly impacted in Q2, based upon quarantine and shelter in place guidelines that have been put in place in most major markets around the world and the economic impact of recession. We anticipate the second half of the year will be impacted, but to a lesser extent. Now to summarize, before we move to Q&A. Pre COVID-19, 2020 was off to a strong start and inline with our expectations, with 7% operational revenue growth and 10% operational growth and adjusted net income. The essential nature of our business, the diversity of our portfolio and the durability of our business will allow us to continue executing on our strategy during this period of uncertainty. We're confident, we'll be able to maintain strong liquidity and manage effectively through this challenging environment, given our strong cash flow and balance sheet, and despite managing our spend in the short-term as we navigate through the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we remain committed to medium and long-term profitable growth through responsible investment. Now, I have things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Michael Ryskin: Thanks for taking the questions. I'll ask sort of a big picture one to get the ball wrong. Steve, Glenn, Kristin, you’ve all alluded to various expense on the economic impacts of the recession, both about the press release and in your prepared remarks. Could you just help us walk through the nuance of there and how you think about that affecting both the livestock markets and the companion animal market? Because as we think through it, all the other impacts through the livestock, slaughterhouse closures, the food service shift, the vet visits, that's still for the most part transient expected to bounce back later this year. But the recessionary impact on the guide, that's something that could very well persistent 2021 and 2022. So how do you think about that affecting the business, if you could offer any pointers related to 2008, 2009 that'd be really helpful as we walk through it. Thanks.
Kristin Peck: Sure. Thanks, Mike. I'll talk a little bit about some of the broader trends and then I'll let Glenn talk a little bit about what that means overall and guidance and how that translates. If we start at the vet clinic side and the pet care side. Q1, there really was limited impact just given the timing of the quarantine decisions across the world, and China tended to rebound a little bit. As we moved into early April, we did see significant impacts about – to about 20% to 30% reduction in the U.S., and in Europe, 30% to 50%. The very good news right now is that those are turning around quite quickly. We're seeing a significant improvement both in the U.S. and Europe in overall clinic visits. And so our expectation is obviously, overall a week Q2, but that will improve in Q3 and Q4, also because we strongly believe that that's our – being very thoughtful about how they increase their business, leveraging telemedicine, curbside, drop off, lots of different strategies there. As you look at the livestock sector, I mean, there are two big trends impacting this. The first is the shift out of dine-out and into grocery stores. Historically that was about a 50-50 split. And now about 80% to 90% of consumption is coming out of grocery stores. Historically those supply chains were quite different. So the channel migration there has been a little challenging as you've seen. And the second trend there has been an exacerbated in the U.S. specifically around the reduction and the battery, and at this point about a 15% reduction of processing capacity, given some of the outbreaks at some of those sites, which continues to be obviously in the news every day. Again, the good news is that's a U.S. trend and that trend is not relevant internationally. But what we do see sort of in the medium term as we look into Q2, Q3, Q4, as this will put a pressure on our customers, on livestock producers, it is decreasing price and therefore their profitability. It's likely going to decrease their herd size and also put pressure on their import costs and potentially have them trade down. The question is, how fast that works through? It’s quick to work through that in poultry, a little more challenging in swine and in catalyst we’ve seen – that really is just exacerbating as Glenn mentioned in his remarks, a trend we've been seeing for awhile. We strongly believe the long-term fundamentals remain strong in all these sectors. So the animal protein consumption will continue to grow. So I think a lot of this is a more of an impact as we work through some of these dynamics this year and the humanization of pets has never been more important than it is now, as you’ve seeing on adoptions of animals, and in previous recessions it’s pretty resilient. But I'll let Glenn sort of talk through how he thinks about those trends as we did our guidance.
Glenn David: Absolutely. Mike, to your question on the economic impacts of the recession, as we saw back in 2008, 2009, the animal health industry was essentially flat, showing strong resiliency. And then it had a pretty rapid bounce back in the next year growing around 7%. So in terms of the recessionary impacts, as Kristin said, the companion animal business, just due to a recession, we expect to be very resilient. We saw that back in 2008 and 2009, and the trends of pets becoming more part of the family has only continued even stronger there. In terms of the livestock area of the business, though, that's where the recession may have a larger impact. A, as people trade down to lower cost proteins, but also our livestock producers tend to go to cheaper products as their profitability is challenged, and we do provide premium products. So there will be some pricing challenges and just some overall challenges in the livestock industry more so than companion animal from a recession.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Erin Wright: Great. Thanks. A couple of questions here on the companion animal side. How much did Simparica Trio stocking contribute in the quarter? And how should we be thinking about that quarterly cadence in light of some of the COVID dynamics for Simparica Trio? Is the $150 million target for Simparica Trio still intact? And can you speak to also some of the traction you're seeing across the alternative online channel in the companion animal segment just amidst COVID and some of the dynamics there? How big is that segment for you now? Thanks.
Kristin Peck: Thanks, Erin. I'll start off and let Glenn build on it. We've been very excited at the very strong awareness and anticipation for the launch of the really innovative Simparica Trio. We did see stocking, as I think we mentioned in Q1, of around $15 million. That was really just the distribution. We did the full launch to vets and to customers in April, and we followed that shortly thereafter with a very strong direct-to-consumer advertising push, which has been very well received. We remain very excited about this product. However, we are cognizant that with the pandemic, social distancing as well as the recession, the outlook for 2020 will be adjusted. I'll let Glenn talk a little bit about that guidance. But outside the U.S., we launched in February in the U.K., Italy and Spain. We also recently launched in Canada. So we've remain very excited about the potential for this product, and we think we'll have a very good 2020, and we're pleased given – at the launch so far, and given what we're facing with the pandemic. But I'll let Glenn talk a little bit about the updated guidance.
Glenn David: Yes. In term of the updated guidance for Simparica Trio, we've now brought our estimate down from $150 million in incremental sales to $100 million to $125 million, and that's really based on launching in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. In terms of how we see the quarterly progression, we're not necessarily going to give quarterly forecast, but we did about $15 million in the quarter, and we do expect that to grow gradually over the year and to reflect more underlying demand throughout the year. To your question on the alternative channels, Erin, we are definitely seeing a ramp-up in alternative channels as a way for our customers to get their prescriptions filled. However, it's important to remember that, that is off of a relatively lower base still today. And also about 50% of our products do need to be administered within the clinic. So while we are seeing a rapid increase, it is off of a relatively small base.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Louise Chen with Cantor. Please go ahead.
Louise Chen: Hi, thanks for taking my question. So we're seeing a lot of headlines around protein supply chain. Are these headlines mostly noise? Or do they concern you in any way? And could you give more color on your producer supply chain assumptions in your guidance? Thank you.
Kristin Peck: Sure. Thanks, Louise. Unfortunately, I do not think they are noise, but they're indeed , very real to our customers. It is taking a large part of our field force and technical services supporting our customers through this. Shedding some of these packing plants and having 15% of the capacity of the U.S. packing taken offline, backs up significantly to our producers. They have nowhere to put animals. We are an economy in the livestock space that was just in time, and they were – trying to make sure they were as efficient as possible. So it is a quite serious issue for our producers, and it does have impact that will be important in 2020. It is decreasing the price that they're willing to pay. They don't need the animals. So they're paying less for them. That significantly hurts the profitability of our customers and certainly would courage them at this point to reduce herd sizes. So it does have an impact. As I was trying to express before, some of that impact, as you look at it, it can be turned around quite quickly in poultry, where 43 days, you can make some new decisions there to expand production. There's a little more time in pork. The effects took a lot longer to work through in the beef side. So we do think they will have an impact in 2020 significantly on the livestock side that was baked into the guidance we provided. But I'll let Glenn talk a little bit more to that.
Glenn David: Yes, to Kristin's point, we did bake this into the guidance. Now when you look at our guidance, we do expect that Q2 will be more severely impacted. So the challenges that we're seeing now in livestock with the plant closures are baked in, and we do expect that Q2 will be more severely impacted for livestock and also for companion animal as well as this is when we see the clinic visit probably at their lowest in Q2. When we look toward the full year guidance range, the higher end of our ranges do assume that our producer customers are able to return to more normal operations throughout the second half of the year.
Operator: We'll take our next question from John Kreger with William Blair. Please go ahead.
Jon Kaufman: Hi, good morning. This is Jon Kaufman on for Kreger. Thank you for taking the question. So one on the Pumpkin insurance launch. Can you talk about your pricing strategy here? How do your prices and coverage compare to others in the market? And on the preventive aspect of this, the direct-to-pet owner shipping. Is there a chance that you risk anchoring veterinarians because you're taking parasiticide sales out of the clinic? Or will there be some sort of reimbursement of that's related to these scripts? And then just another quick one here. I don't think I heard the dermatology sales breakout between U.S. and international. Can you provide those? Thank you.
Kristin Peck: Sure. I’ll start on Pumpkin, and then Glenn can follow-up on the derm question, John. We're very excited about the launch of Pumpkin. I think it's actually never been more relevant than it is as we enter a recession. The focus of the Pumpkin insurance and preventative plans is really increasing access to care. It's one of the biggest issues that pet owners have and their vet struggle with is, what's the price? Can they get a pet and can they afford care? And really the new value proposition that we were trying to offer vets and pet owners is a real focus on preventative. So our plan is unique and it really helps cover it completely two to three core vaccines for dogs and for cats, parasiticides for the year and that wellness visit, which is an important part. Many pet owners didn't want to get pet insurance in the U.S. because they felt like it only paid "if their animal got sick". And under the new wave that we have combined the insurance and the preventative care plan, we think pet owners will see the value at day one. And so although there are some changes to where that goes for a vet clinic, ensuring that those animals will be coming in regularly because that is a visit that's paid for, for the vaccines and the wellness visits and the parasiticides, we think, really does help the veterinarian. So as we sat down, I think there was a lot of – I think, from some of our competitors, noise around that when it first launched. But as we sat down to explain the vet, what we're paying for overall in a wellness visit, how we'll be encouraging that, how we'll be covering vaccines. I think veterinarians are quite excited at the opportunity as many new people have adopted pets. And the opportunity in the space overall, in the U.S., with penetration levels of pet insurance very low at 2%, 3% versus the rest of the world at 20%, 30%, 40%, is significant And we think, especially going into recession, this is an important part of ensuring that pets get the care and that they go to the vet to get that care. So I'll turn it over to Glenn to comment on the derm.
Glenn David: Yes. So in terms of the total derm sales breakout. So for the year, total was – for the quarter, total was $194 million with 25% growth, U.S. was $136 million with 31% growth and international was $28 million with 14% growth.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll go next to Jon Block with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Jon Block: Thanks, guys. Good morning. I'll ask both upfront. Kristin, maybe the first one for you. I may have missed it, but I don't think I heard a revised market growth figure versus the previous 4% to 5%, is there one there? And then if so, is your 0.5% operational midpoint, call it, still above market expectations? And then the second one, Glenn, just the flowdown in EPS was a little bit more – was little bit bigger than what we were expecting. So any color on the decremental margins as we think on how it impacted the P&L? I'm guessing maybe part of that is FX, but any color you can provide would be helpful. Thanks guys.
Kristin Peck: Sure, John. Great question. No, you did not miss the what is the new market projection to be. The groups that project the market growth, obviously, has not been able to do that yet, and this is a fast emerging. So there is no general sense. As we look at it, we continue to see that pet care will probably have the strongest growth globally overall, followed by poultry. As we look at the swine growth overall, although that we're seeing significant impacts in the U.S. right now, given ASF in China and really the strong demand that China is going to continue to have to import swine, we think swine will likely be okay. It will probably have some impact but will do better. And we see the greatest impact overall in cattle. As you look at our business, we're about 50% companion animal, 50% livestock. So it really – we haven't seen updated market growth numbers to how we compare to that. But we think we will be doing better than the market. And I think it might be helpful. Glenn can talk a little bit about you use the midpoint of the range, but we'll talk a little bit what the assumptions are for us at the high end of the range and what the assumptions are at the lower end of the range to help you better navigate that. So I'll let Glenn take that question as well as the EPS.
Glenn David: Yes. So John, when you look at the flow down to EPS, there are a couple of things that I want to point out. A, cost of goods is up since the last guidance, right, by about 50 basis points at the midpoint. Big part of that is driven by COVID-19 and some incremental freight costs. Those incremental costs, we expect to have to pay our suppliers for some of our key ingredients for the product. So that's one area that impacts the flow down to the bottom line. We did take cuts in SG&A about $100 million at the midpoint, as we've discussed. Well, we also do have additional interest expense. The previous guidance was $215 million. Current guidance is approximately $250 million, and that does take into account the fact that we will earn less interest income on our cash. And it also does contemplate that we may incur some additional debt throughout the year. So it's really the cost of goods and the interest expense that offsets some of the benefits that we were seeing in the other expense line that are impacting the EPS.
Operator: We'll go next to Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Chris Schott: Hi, great. Thanks so much for the questions. Maybe just the first one, just a clarification on the top line guidance update. I know you've touched on this on a high level, but can you just quantify how much of the sales revision are these kind of near-term COVID disruptions? Are people just not able to get to production sites and not able to see the vets versus how much is longer-term recession-related headwind? And maybe in the same vein, how much of the reduction is livestock versus companion? Is it 50-50? Is it 60-40? Any color there? My second kind of bigger picture question was on the companion side of the business and how sensitive that part of the portfolio is to a recession. Is that should we think about that business being more insulated than livestock? Or is there also some potential sensitivity we have to think about on that portion of the portfolio? Thanks so much.
Kristin Peck: Sure. I'll take pet care, and then Glenn can take overall guidance. With regards to pet care, in previous recessions, it has been a very resilient industry, and we think it will continue to be. I think if you look at the hit in Q2, it really obviously, recession impacts it, but less than most other sectors. But Q2 with people not going to the vet, which is not necessarily right now in Q2 recession, it was more related to the pandemic and the quarantine situation. And as you look at it, we still have a very strong portfolio that doesn't even require you to go to the vet. So even vet visit isn't always a great proxy for our business, since a lot of our products can be bought online. But there are a percentage of our business that's more in clinic. We're seeing much greater impact, for example, in diagnostics. But for us, diagnostics is only 5% of our business. So we do think pet care will be quite resilient in the medium to long-term and will bounce back. And it has historically, as Glenn mentioned, been quite resilient historically. But I think Glenn can do a good job of putting in context our assumptions as if we trend through the year at the high end of the guidance versus the low end of the guidance for both pet care and livestock.
Glenn David: Yes. So Chris, I'll just address your first question, and then we'll get into a little more of the details on the guidance. So in terms of COVID versus the recession, obviously, we think Q2 will be the most severely impacted, and COVID will be a big driver of that in both livestock and companion animal. In terms of then going forward, we do expect an impact from the recession, and we do expect that the recessionary impact will be more impactful on livestock than companion animal based on the reasons that Kristin just shared. However, I think when you look at the overall guidance, right, we did do a bottoms-up analysis to inform the guidance range because we do believe that the people in the markets are closest to this and have the best information. And what we got back was pretty clear that Q2 will be the hardest hit due to the impact of social distancing and the recession and the fact that the companion animal visits will be lowest in Q2, and livestock plant closures will also impact the livestock side of the business. When you look at the second half of the year, the high end of the guidance range assumes that the recessionary impacts continue, but that companion animal visits return to more normalized levels and that our livestock producers return to full operations. If you look at the lower end of the revenue range, that really assumes a very deep recession and also contemplates a potential second wave of the virus with social distancing measures negatively impacting both companion animal and livestock further in the second half of the year. So we're really just trying to be very transparent with investors as we always do, which is why we chose to provide the guidance with a broader range. However, as we look to the long-term future of both the industry and our business, we do expect that we will return to more normalized growth rates that we see in terms of revenue.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Westenberg with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.
David Westenberg: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. So I know you mentioned that, the online alternative channels is a little bit more of a low base, but we have seen a speed up in the adoption curve of online pharmacies. Now as we look to compliance in maybe the back half of the year, I mean, do you think – could we see maybe some upside from reorders that we not – would normally not see? And then my second question is a little bit more continued granularity on the guidance. So when we're looking at – in the last week, I think I've seen some data and talking to clinics about normalization almost in the last week. So when we're looking at Q2, I mean, should we assume the last couple of weeks is something that could happen in Q2? And I know that your crystal ball might not necessarily be perfect here. But just as we're modeling that, it's moving so fast, and it does seem like there's some positive bounce back in the last week. I just want to be fairly accurate in the way we're modeling that, so, thank you.
Kristin Peck: Thanks, David. I'll start with the online channels, and I'll let Glenn pick up your question on the more detailed guidance and what you're seeing as the trends right now in vet visits. The online channels have been a significant trend. I'd say from a few different places. And if they continue, I do think there is an upside with regards to compliance. We've seen a significant uptick in vets signing up for Covetrus as vet's first choice and vet source to make sure that their pet owners get their products, if they – even if they feel uncomfortable coming into the vet. We have seen – and they publish as well studies that once you get a customer on to your online home delivery that their compliance goes up, because it ships once a month and there's less of the stress. So we do think that's a potential upside. And again, it really just accelerated a trend that we thought would happen, but we have seen significant growth in that channel for us. And I think that's why, as I said before, our portfolio has been more resilient in some other companies, as many of our products you can get from home delivery. The other big channel that's been quite – growing quite quickly for us remains e-commerce. So Chewy has also increased its sales dramatically with us. Again, I want to go back to Glenn's earlier point. This is off a very low base. This was historically a very small percentage. It is growing very quickly and we do think, especially now consumers would like to get more shipped directly to them. So I think this is a trend that we're going to continue to see. And we do think it does have the upside over the medium term to improve compliance overall with pet owners. So that is a potential upside. I'll let Glenn take the rest of your questions with regards to guidance.
Glenn David: Yes. So in terms of guidance and for Q2 in particular, in some of the trends that we're seeing in the more current weeks, I think it's important, a, to break it out between the U.S. and international. So again, reminding because of our international close, Q2 for us will be the month of March, April and May. So recovery in terms of visits, we'll have a smaller benefit in international because it only applies to the end of April and early May. When you look at the U.S. however, in early April we were seeing visits down 20% to 30%. But to your point, we have seen those numbers begin to rise pretty significantly. And to the extent that that continues, that could limit the impact that we would expect to see in Q2, particularly on the companion animal side of the business. So those are positive trends and we hope that those trends do continue.
Operator: Our next question is from Balaji Prasad with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Balaji Prasad: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. So Kristin could I – we're discussed much about the near-term impact in with what we're likely to see in Q2 and Q3. Can I take a step back here and ask you about the longer term implications of COVID-19 on both livestock and companion animal side? How do you think about the change in industry dynamics here with user behavior, veterinary practices, meat producers and what it means more importantly for the long-term industry growth numbers that were discussed in both the companion animal and livestock side? Thanks.
Kristin Peck: Thanks. Absolutely, we very much still believe the longer term trends for this industry are very strong. If you look at the trend of the humanization of pets, I actually think has been accelerated. So as you look at the next few years of people likely spending more time at home, less travel, maybe potentially working from home more. They're around their pets longer, they tend to therefore want to take better care of them. They also tend to notice issues before they might have noticed them historically. So we think really the long-term trend here is very positive. And we'll continue the humanization of pets. And the only thing that will temper that is obviously a recession. But again, as we said in previous recessions, there has been quite a resilient space. I think as you look at the longer term trend in livestock, I think for the next, say as we've talked about this year, there's some significant impacts to many of our producers. But over the medium to long-term, feeding the world is an important secular trend that is not going to change. So supply chains will realign themselves so that it's more – it goes to the grocery store, we'll be better aligned to do that. They'll change it in the sense of dine-in, dine-out. They'll also evolve across species. So it may be that you will see poultry and pork do better over the short to medium-term. But in the end of the day, as we've seen over and over again in other crises and recessions, feeding the world is a strong secular trend. So we remain quite optimistic for the industry and specifically for our portfolio. If you look at our portfolio, it's very diversified and that has been very good for us over the years with about half in the U.S., half outside the U.S. with a 50/50 split between livestock and companion animals and watching that evolve. So we're very optimistic, continue to believe that the industry and more importantly, Zoetis will be resilient.
Operator: Next question is from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
David Risinger: Thanks very much. Sorry about that. So congrats on the Pumpkin innovative and compelling offering, it certainly differentiated. Could you help us understand the insurance element of the promotional offering including acute illness coverage and exactly what Zoetis is pitching to pet owners with respect to the insurance aspect? And then just a side comment with respect to the second wave that you're modeling, you're assuming that second wave in the fourth quarter, not this summer. Correct?
Kristin Peck: Okay. So I'll start with the insurance. I'll let Glenn take the question on the second wave. We're very excited about Pumpkin. What we think truly differentiates it is a preventative wellness plan. The insurance, again, we are not taking underwriting risk in this that is taken by Crum & Forster. I can't get into comparing individual plans. Obviously, it would depend on your pet, its age, as always all insurance does. I would say the insurance is a very strong insurance plans, but there's many comparable ones on the insurance. The unique part of the offering is the real focus on the additional preventative wellness plans or I think we have a very unique offering there and it's quite differentiated. But from an insurance perspective, it's quite competitive with other things out there. I wouldn't say the insurance alone is as differentiated. I would say how we work with our customers, the customer experience is quite differentiated. If you've checked it out and gone to the website, we're trying to make it easier for pet owners, simpler to understand, simpler to file claims. So we're really looking to innovate on user experience with regards to the insurance part of it. But the plan itself is comparable. What's really different is the additional preventative wellness plan, which I think is quite different. But I'll let Glenn take the question on the second wave.
Glenn David: Yes. And in terms of the second wave, again, that's one of the assumptions within the lower end of our guidance range. We would anticipate that that would occur later in the year. Not necessarily in the coming months.
Operator: We'll go next to Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Nathan Rich: Good morning. Just two quick questions for me. First, Kristin, just going back to your comment on Simparica Trio, could you maybe share some of the initial feedback that you've gotten from that? And how receptive do you think they might need to kind of using this product as the year-round treatment and potentially kind of switching has midyear. And then have you seen any change in your response from competitors that’s factored into your outlook? That's kind of the first question. The second question for Glenn, I think the companion animal growth rate internationally I think slowed a little bit from what the recent trend has been. Could you maybe just go into more details on what you saw there on the quarter?
Kristin Peck: Sure. Thanks Nathan. If you look at Trio, we think our customers have been quite receptive. They've been excited. This has been a highly anticipated product and the reception from many of our vets having something exciting and new to discuss with their pet owners to make sure that they can take care of a deadly disease like heartworm. And combine that with one of the best flea and tick products.  It's been quite positive. We've been seeing a pickup even more in the last few weeks as vets have had more time to engage. So, honestly, from the market – the vets have been very excited. We've seen great receptivity to our direct-to-consumer advertising. As we saw from some of our competitors, they did exactly what we expected. They definitely build the channel with as much product as they could in Q1 before our launch, as we had talked about at our Q4 call that was anticipated. And obviously, they will come after us, as they should. This is the single largest sector as you know in animal health and in the U.S. alone it’s a $2.5 billion market. So we're really excited. We continue to see, as you saw our guidance that this will drive significant growth for us overall as a company and certainly in the U.S. And we have been very pleased with the receptivity of both vets and pet owners to this new innovation. So Glenn, do you want to take this companion animal question?
Glenn David: Yes. So in terms of a companion animal in the international market, so we did see good growth of 8% in companion animal in the international markets. There were a couple of things that did factor into limiting that growth to some degree. So a, China grew 8%, which was actually a little below our expectations because of the impact of COVID-19 and the timing of COVID-19 within that market. We also did see declines in markets such as Italy and Canada. Italy was changed – was impacted by some changes in prescribing laws that we think again will recover it through the rest of the year. Whereas Canada was impacted somewhat by the timing of the launch of Simparica Trio, there was a hold on some of the sales for Simparica Trio from our customers in anticipation of Simparica Trio being provided shortly thereafter.
Operator: The next question is from Kathy Miner with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.
Kathy Miner: Thank you for taking the question. Just going to follow up a little bit more on the dermatology business, specifically, was there any stocking of Apoquel in the first quarter? And second of all, can you comment on Cytopoint, you've indicated that there was growth in the quarter and since this is a vet visit kind of product, just talk about those dynamics and how you see that as we get into Q2 and later in the year? And if there's any difference in this U.S. versus O-U.S. also. Thank you.
Glenn David: Sure. So from Apoquel perspective and just from a broader companion animal perspective, we did not see stocking within the quarter. This is something that we monitor and manage very closely and we prefer ourselves to mirror our underlying demand. So we did not see significant stocking in the quarter of any extent. And when you look at the breakout between Apoquel and Cytopoint, they both perform very well in the quarter, but Cytopoint did actually grow more rapidly as we think the convenience and the compliance and the fact that it is administered in the clinic certainly does help Cytopoint. We also saw very rapid growth in Cytopoint in international, growing approximately 71% as it was introduced in new markets as well so very strong performance across the entire portfolio of both Cytopoint and Apoquel.
Operator: Our next question is from Elliot Wilbur with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Elliot Wilbur: Thanks. Good morning. Question on return to baseline or normalcy trends in terms of vet visits on the companion animal side. Assuming that, in effect, does happen near year-end or sometime in the second half of 2020 at least, how are you thinking about and how should we think about revenue per visit? Is there a possibility of a trade-down effect? Is that something that you've incorporated into expectations? And maybe any color from – experienced during the Great recession with respect to that aspect of vet visits would be helpful. And just real quickly, if you could – could you just remind us of the relative margins within the livestock business between cattle versus swine and poultry? Thanks.
Glenn David: Sure. So in terms of the relative margins across the livestock business, they actually are starting to converge across them. But in general, cattle is a higher margin, then comes swine and then comes poultry, but they're all relatively close. And then in terms of the revenue per visit. So, a, in the first quarter, we did see very positive trends in terms of revenue per visit in companion animal. We get most of that data honestly within the U.S. So we haven't seen anything telling us that revenue per visit is declining significantly, but that is something that we will track throughout the year, but we have no data that indicates that, that is a trend that should reverse at any time soon.
Operator: Thank you. We'll go next to Greg Gilbert with SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Greg Gilbert: Thank you. I know that you and others are offering telehealth to vet customers. Can you talk about how that's being embraced and how that could affect the business longer term? And then secondly, what are you seeing in Asia? I realize it's early days, but what are you seeing in terms of a return to normal or an attempt to return to normal both from your own employee base as well as the customer base. In the U.S., we see a lot of companies guiding to some return to normal for their business by year-end, but those companies that are guiding have employees who are terrified to go back to work anytime soon. So just trying to – maybe that's a very U.S. sort of New York centric way of thinking. But I'm hoping you can offer some color from a more global perspective. Thanks.
Kristin Peck: Sure. Thanks so much, Greg. I'll start with looking at China. China really has come back. They have about 80% to 90% of vet clinics are now open. And they are seeing pet owners return, but they do – the pet owners do remain cautious. So I wouldn't say it's at exactly the same level. But if you look at – and we have significant operations in China. We are continuing to operate our manufacturing sites and other sites there. And our experience there is the measures that the government has put in place to control the virus and to do staggered shifts, et cetera and track and trace are not measures that so far, most of Europe and the U.S. are willing or are able to implement anyway. The ability to look at that as a proxy, we don't think that is a good proxy for what a return to the workplace looks like in the U.S. and in Europe. They're just – what they've done there is quite different. We did see a strong growth in China. As you look at Q1, they grew 13%, with 19% in livestock and 9% in companion animal. But we caution that looking at China and extrapolating to the rest of the world is probably not the best strategy. We do see and we've put a lot of focus in what a return to work looks like. We are leveraging our experience in our manufacturing sites, distribution and R&D sites that have been operational as an essential business throughout. And our plan is to leverage those learnings, where we looked at implementing health and hygiene measures such as social distancing, increased sanitization, temp checks and staggered shifts, and that is certainly the way we're looking to do that in the U.S. I think we talk a lot about office-based colleagues but field-based colleagues is another big category for us. And so we think it's going to take a little longer, and we'll obviously be leveraging other opportunities such as telehealth with – and webinars and things like that with our customers. We need to make sure that as our colleagues return, the customers are comfortable too. It's got to be two-sided. And with regards to your question, specifically on telehealth, we did see a quick uptick initially. It is a process change for clinics. So whether or not and at what level that really continues to take off, it's still early days. I've actually been doing a telehealth visit. I'd say it does help the vet do really simple checkups on a procedure to just make sure the pet’s okay. Remotely, it is actually more efficient and to get them paid for something that sometimes they call a customer and they were never paid for. So I do think it will take off, but it is a big process flow change for the vet and even integration to the system. So I think it will take a little time to see how fast that picks up. But we've heard a positive reception for most of our customers who've started to adopt it, but it does take a little time.
Operator: We'll take the next question from Navin Jacob with UBS. Please go ahead. Navin, check the mute button on your phone. Your line is open. We’ll go to the next one. We'll go next to Michael Ryskin with a follow-up. Please go ahead.
Michael Ryskin: On channel and your opportunity to move over there. Could you just given us an overview of the companion animal product portfolio you have now between vaccines and other injectables like Cytopoint? There's a large part of the product that simply cannot be moved on. And then on the other hand, you have parasiticides, growing presence there, Apoquel, other products that with a prescription, you can get it from Chewy and from other sites. Could you just discuss how Zoetis is positioned here in the online channel? And sort of big picture, do you anticipate COVID could drive a longer-term shift to more online pharmacy purchases, as opposed to people going to the vet. If people are trying to continue to practice some social distancing longer term?
Kristin Peck: Sure. As we look at our portfolio, the first thing I'd start with is almost all of our portfolio does require a prescription. So the vet will remain at the center of anything that happens. But to your question of sort of where they get products over whether it's in the clinic, through home delivery, via the clinic website or through Chewy, is really a focus. As you look about our portfolio, about 50% of our portfolio generally would be given in clinic. That would be a vaccine, an injectable, a surgical, something for urgent care, et cetera, and about 50% of our portfolio could eventually go to home delivery or online. And I think you're seeing the acceleration of that as we look at the sort of the pandemic impact overall in Q1. And I think that will continue to accelerate. But if you look at a lot of this, it still requires a wellness visit, it still requires a prescription. So the vet will stay center. But I do think you're seeing a real acceleration in home delivery and in places like Chewy. It has the upside of driving compliance, as we've talked about before and we do believe it will. We'll see how fast it continues to go. But I think once you get a customer in the habit of a monthly home delivery, it certainly makes their lives easier. And it will drive compliance overall.
Operator: And it appears we have no further questions. I'll return the floor to you, Kristin, for closing remarks.
Kristin Peck: Thanks so much. These are certainly unprecedented times. But the one thing, as I started out with, Zoetis as an essential business has also been a quite resilient company, and I'm quite proud of what our colleagues across the world have done to ensure that they've taken care of each other and supported our customers. Medicines, vaccines, diagnostics and many of our solutions will remain essential in the months and years to come. We think Zoetis has a diverse portfolio that addresses a broad spectrum of needs, and given the diversification of our portfolio and our very strong balance sheet, we believe that Zoetis is strongly positioned to manage certainly over this year and in the years to come. We're driven by two very important secular trends, both the humanization of pets and ensuring we feed the world. So we remain quite optimistic as we look to the end of 2020 and 2021 that Zoetis and our industry will continue to be essential and resilient. Thanks so much for joining us today.
Operator: And this will conclude today's program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q4  (2020-02-13 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day. And welcome to the Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2019 Financial Results Conference Call and Webcast for Zoetis. Hosting the call today is Steve Frank, Vice President of Investor Relations for Zoetis. The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you the viewer and will not be forwarded automatically. In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call via dial-in or on the Investor Relations section at zoetis.com. At this time, all participants are placed in a listen-only mode, and the floor will be opened for your questions following the presentation [Operator Instructions]. In the interest of time, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and then queue up again with any follow-ups. Your line will be muted when you complete your question [Operator Instructions]. It’s now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.
Steve Frank: Thank you, Keith. Good morning, everyone. And welcome to the Zoetis fourth quarter and full-year 2019 earnings call. I am joined today by Kristin Peck, our Chief Executive Officer and Glenn David, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our Web site and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements, and that actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statements in today's press release and our SEC filings, including but not limited to, our Annual Report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q. Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and in the Company's 8-K filing dated today, February 13, 2020. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. With that, I will turn the call over to Kristin.
Kristin Peck: Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. By now, you read our press release and financial tables on the Zoetis Web site, so I’ll take just a few minutes to recap the full year, talk about outlook for 2020 and outline some of the long term investment plans and growth opportunities we see for our Zoetis. Our CFO, Glenn David, will then cover the fourth quarter and our full year guidance for 2020, before we open the lines up for your questions. So let's get started. Zoetis delivered another year of strong growth and market leadership in 2019. Thanks to our diverse and durable portfolio and our commitment to continuous innovation. We grew revenue 10% operationally, which includes about 2% of growth from the Abaxis acquisition. This is once again above the market growth for animal health. We just expect it to be about 3% to 4% for 2019, reflecting the negative impact of African swine fever. We grew our adjusted net income faster than revenue at 14% operationally, continuing to achieve our goal of growing from profitability faster than revenue over the long term. In terms of other elements of our value proposition, we achieved several new approvals in areas that will strengthen our traditional portfolio of parasiticides and vaccine and we invested in critical acquisitions and partnerships that will accelerate our growth in areas where we are expanding, such as diagnostics. For example, we received approval for new parasiticides, such as ProHeart 12 in the U. S. and Simparica Trio in the EU and Canada. We are enhancing our vaccine portfolio with new products like Versican Plus Bb Oral, the first oral vaccine for dogs in Europe, and Poulvac Procerta HVT-ND, our first venture vaccines for poultry. We also continued to invest in building our overall diagnostics capabilities with acquisitions in the reference lab space, which will be give us a more holistic offering to veterinarians. And we expanded our equine and pet care portfolio into nutritional formulas with the acquisition of Platinum Performance, a premier leader in this market. Finally, in terms of our commitment to returning excess capital to shareholders, we generated a 2019 quarterly dividend of $0.16 per share, an increase of 30% from the 2018 dividend rate. And we completed approximately $625 million in share repurchases. We have built a strong record of delivering on this value proposition for shareholders over the last seven years. And I'm very confident we can continue on this path of long term growth and value creation, based on the capabilities, colleagues and customer focus we bring to every market opportunity. Looking ahead now to the rest of 2020, animal health remains a steady and reliable market based on people's increasing commitment to their pets’ health and based on the steady demand for safe and affordable animal proteins. For 2020, we currently expect the overall industry to return to growth of approximately 4% to 5%, excluding the impact of foreign currency. The market showed a dramatic shift in 2019 from African swine fever in China with at least 50% reduction in herd size according to reports. While this disease had a significant impact on our business in China last year, we see early signs of stabilization and the opportunity for the industry in terms of firms consolidating investments being made in better infrastructure and biosecurity and the frozen pork supplies being reduced. As the global pork market and trade picture sorts that more in 2020 and with increased export opportunities for many markets, we could see the overall animal health market return to slightly better growth rates. In terms of species, the swine market should be below the overall market growth for 2020. The companion animal and poultry markets are expected to be somewhat above the market growth and cattle is expected to be a little more limited than the market, based on the continuing challenges faced by beef and dairy customers. For Zoetis, we expect to grow faster than the markets for companion animal and poultry and in line with the cattle market. For the soy market, we would expect to be in line or faster than the market depending on the pace of recovery from African swine fever and its impact on additional markets this year. In terms of our guidance for 2020, Zoetis expects to grow revenue significantly faster than the industry in a range of 7% to 9.5% operationally. And in terms of adjusted net income, we expect operational growth in the range of 8% to 11%. To meet our goals for 2020, we will continue supporting our latest product launches in lifecycle innovations with direct-to-consumer advertising and the recently expanded pet care field force in the U.S. And in international markets, we're focused on supporting new products with field force expansions in certain markets and differentiating ourselves with a focus on direct field forces’ effectiveness and technical expertise. We will also continue investing in other accelerated growth areas, such as diagnostics, genetics, precision livestock farming and digital and data analytics. This will be an important year in diagnostics as we complete the integration of our systems and look to accelerate sales growth with more integrated offerings of medicines and diagnostics and importantly, we can deliver more value to our customers. And we'll continue advancing our pipeline with investments in parasiticides, vaccines, monoclonal antibodies and other therapeutic areas. The launch of Simparica Trio, our triple combination parasiticide is highly anticipated for 2020, and we remain confident in the U.S. approval in the fourth quarter with a loss shortly thereafter. As we have said recently, we completed the technical sections of the Simparica Trio package for the U.S., and are currently in the administrative review awaiting a final approval. We've already received approvals for Simparica Trio in the EU and Canada, and we expect the Simparica Trio launch in Europe to begin in certain markets this month as we take a phased approach to the launch there. Based on these assumptions, we continue to expect to generate incremental global sales of Simparica Trio in 2020 at approximately $150 million. I am energized by the opportunities ahead of us in 2020. We have a vibrant and growing companion animal portfolio, driven by internal innovation and more to come with Simparica Trio. We are delivering steady performance across our livestock products despite the market challenges some of our customers face from economic conditions, emerging infectious diseases and natural disasters. We're partnering with our customers in innovative ways to help them stay ahead of the curve on evolving technology, new commercial opportunities and shift in consumer trends. We are building out our capabilities in digital and data analytics to bring meaningful solutions to the challenges facing their farms and clinics, and we are executing on a strategy for growth with internal and external investments that have us well positioned for long term growth. I look forward to carrying on the company's successful formula of customer focus, innovation, and execution as we continue to deliver on our long-term value proposition to shareholders. Now, I’ll hand things over to Glenn.
Glenn David: Thank you, Kristin, and good morning. As Kristin indicated, we had another exceptional year with revenue of $6.3 billion and adjusted net income of $1.8 million, with both top and bottom line exceeding the high end of our guidance ranges for the year. Reported revenue growth was 7% for the year, including 3% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, which was driven primarily by strengthening of the dollar against the Euro, Brazilian Real and Argentinian peso. Operational revenue growth of 10% was driven by 2% price contribution and an 8% volume contribution. Volume growth included 2% from the addition of legacy Abaxis products, 2% from our key dermatology portfolio, 2% from new products and 2% from our other in-line portfolio. Revenue growth for the year was broad based with the U.S growing 11% and international growing 9% operationally. Companion animal led the way in terms of species growth, outpacing livestock for the year. Revenue from our key dermatology portfolio, our diverse parasiticide portfolio with several new launches this year and legacy of Abaxis product, drove companion animal operational performance up 23%. Livestock declined 1% operationally for the year impacted by the outbreak of African swine fever in China and challenging beef and dairy cattle market conditions in the U.S. Our poultry and fish product portfolios continue to grow, partially offsetting the cattle and swine headwinds. Operational growth and adjusted net income of 14% was driven by strong revenue growth and gross margin favorability. Now moving on to our Q4 financial results. We had solid performance again this quarter with revenue of $1.7 billion, representing an increase of 7% on a reported basis and 9% operationally. Adjusted net income of $440 million increased 15% on a reported basis and 13% operationally. Foreign exchange in the quarter drove an unfavorable 2% impact on revenue, primarily driven by the strengthening of the dollar against the Euro, Brazilian Real and Argentinian peso. Operational revenue growth of 9% for the quarter was driven by 1% price and 80% volume. The volume contribution of 80% includes 3% from new products, 3% from other inline products and 2% from key dermatology products. Contributions from legacy Abaxis products were not a material driver of growth in the quarter globally since this is our first full quarter lapping the impact of the prior year acquisition. Breaking down our operational revenue growth by species, companion animal grew 19% and livestock grew 2%. Companion animal revenue growth was driven by continued strength of our key dermatology products and our parasiticide portfolio, including new products, Revolution Plus and ProHeart 12 and the continued adoption of Simparica. Equine also contributed to growth in the quarter with a full quarter revenue from the acquisition of Platinum Performance and its nutritional products, as well as continued growth of our CORE EQ Innovator vaccine. Livestock growth in the quarter was primarily driven by strong poultry and fish performance, partially offset by declines in cattle and the impact of African swine fever. Swine increased 1% operationally in the quarter despite the impact of African swine fever. New products contributed 3% to overall growth in the quarter, driven by parasiticides Revolution Plus and Stronghold Plus as is known internationally, ProHeart 12 and the recently launched Alpha Flux parasiticide in Chile. Other inline products contributed 3% to growth in the quarter. This was primarily driven by revenue from recent acquisitions and commercial agreements, including Platinum Performance, our reference lab acquisitions, the statement lab diagnostic test for equine and companion animal parasiticides, including Simparica. This growth was partially offset by declines in U.S. cattle and the ongoing impact of African swine fever. Simparica contributed strong growth in the quarter with revenue of $42 million and 34% operational growth. For the full year, Simparica sales were $214 million dollars growing 40% operationally. Our key dermatology portfolio continued to grow globally this quarter, contributing 2% growth. Global sales were $200 million in the quarter, representing 29% operational growth. Full-year revenue for this portfolio was $754 million, growing 29% operationally. The positive performance in this portfolio was driven by increasing market share, price and expand the usage of both APOQUEL and CYTOPOINT into recently launched market. Sales in legacy Abaxis products was $68 million in the quarter, representing 5% operational growth over the prior year. Now let's discuss the revenue growth by segment for the quarter. U.S. revenue grew 6% with companion animal growing 15% and livestock defining 3%. Companion annual growth in the quarter was driven by increased sales of our two dermatology products, the impact of recent acquisitions, our parasiticides portfolio and a number of other inline products, including Cerenia and RIMADYL. U.S. dermatology sales were $133 million for the quarter growing 21%. Growth this quarter was driven by price and benefits from the direct to consumer advertising driving increased market share. Our parasiticides portfolio, including new products, such as Revolution Plus and ProHeart 12 and inline products, such as Simparica, contributed to strong companion animal growth. Positive companion animalperformance was partially offset by U.S. livestock declines in the quarters driven by cattle. Cattle product sales continued to be negatively impacted by unfavorable market conditions, driven by heavier and healthier animals coming in from pasture with a lower risk profile and pricing pressure driven by competition. Partially offsetting challenges in cattle was continued poultry growth, primarily from our portfolio of alternatives to antibiotics in medicated feed additives. We also benefited from new customer adoption and competitors having product efficacy and supply challenges. Swine also had a strong quarter returning to growth due to increase sales in medicated feed additives and vaccines. To summarize U.S. performance, innovation and returns on our investments drove positive results despite challenging market conditions impacting growth in cattle. Our international segment also contributed strong growth this quarter with operational revenue growth of 12%. Companion animal operational revenue growth was 26% and livestock operational growth was 5%. Companion animal growth was driven key dermatology products, growth in our parasiticides portfolio, including Simparica and our Stronghold franchise and legacy Abaxis products. International livestock also performed well, driven by growth in cattle, fish and poultry. This growth was partially offset by modest declines in swine due to the ongoing impact of African swine fever. Growth in cattle was due to favorable pricing, as well as increased feedlot placements in Australia, new customers in other developed and emerging markets and favorable conditions in key markets such as Mexico. The fish portfolio benefited from the continued uptake of the Alpha Flux parasiticide in Chile, while poultry growth was driven by price and increased sales of vaccines. As expected, swine remain challenged this quarter by the ongoing impact of African swine fever. We do see some positive signs, however, partially offsetting these declines with new markets launching our combination swine vaccines and growth in key accounts in China. Our outlook 2020 remains neutral to slightly positive for swine in China. In the near term, however, we remain confident that other regions and proteins will increase production to help mitigate the pork shortage and long-term industrialization of pork production in China will be a tailwind. Overall, our international segment continues to be a significant driver of growth supported by innovation and the diverse portfolio across products and geographies despite the impact of African swine fever. Now moving on to the rest of the P&L. Adjusted gross margin of 68.5% increased approximately 210 basis points in the quarter on a reported basis compared to the prior year. The increase was driven by foreign exchange, manufacturing cost efficiencies, product mix and price, partially offset by increased inventory charges. Total adjusted operating expenses grew 13% operationally. The increase was primarily related to compensation related expenses, the impact of recent acquisitions, direct-to-consumer advertising and investments to support future growth of the business. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 14.2%. The decrease from the comparable 2018 period is primarily related to non-recurring discrete tax benefits recorded in the fourth quarter of 2019, partially offset by the impact of the global intangible low tax income or GILTI tax, which is effective for Zoetis in 2019. Adjusted net income for the quarter grew 13% operationally, driven by strong revenue growth, favorability in gross margin and a lower effective tax rate. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 14% operationally compares to the same quarter in the prior year. Now moving onto guidance for 2020. Please note that guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late January. In 2020, we were projecting revenue between $6.65 billion and $6.8 billion, representing 7% to 9.5% operational growth. Foreign exchange is expected to be a headwind again next year of approximately 100 basis points. Innovation will be a key driver of growth next year, particularly in companion animal. Companion animal overall is expected to again outpace livestock, benefiting from our diverse parasiticide portfolio, key dermatology, diagnostics and strong market dynamics, including continued growth in emerging markets. And as Kristin mentioned, our guidance assumes an incremental $150 million in revenue related to Simparica Trio. This estimate represents revenue for roughly three quarters of the year. And in 2020, as Kristin indicated, we anticipate all livestock species returning to global growth. From a geographic perspective, we anticipate balanced growth between our U.S. and international segments. Adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue is expected to be in the range of 30% to 31%, neutral to slightly increasing from 2019 due to unfavorable foreign exchange and mildly dilutive acquisitions, partially offset by price and positive mix. Adjusted SG&A expenses for the year are expected to be between $1.59 billion and $1.64 billion with an increase over 2019, focused on critical areas of revenue growth, including recent and future product launches, recent acquisitions and expansion into reference lab diagnostic, as well as the annualization of our U.S. field force expansion and direct-to-consumer advertising. Adjusted R&D expenses for 2020 are expected to be between $455 million and $475 million consistent with our commitment to invest in pipeline opportunities, both lifecycle and novel new therapies. Going into 2020, investment will be focused on delivering the next wave of high value innovation, including monoclonal antibody therapies for osteoarthritis pain in cats and dogs and new vaccines for poultry. We're also investing in strategic areas of focus, such as diagnostics, biodevices and precision livestock farming and strategies to maximize the value of the continual of care through integrated offerings. Adjusted interest and other income deductions is expected to be approximately $215 million with the increase over 2019, driven by reduced royalty income, as well as lower interest income. Our adjusted effective tax rate for 2020 is expected to be in the range of 20% to 21%. The increase in 2020 is related to the impact of favorable nonrecurring discrete items that occurred in 2019. Adjusted net income is expected to be in the range of $1.865 billion to $1.915 billion, representing operational growth of 8% to 11%. We remain committed to our value proposition of growing revenue in line with or faster than the market and growing adjusted net income faster than revenue. However, as I highlighted growth in adjusted net income in 2020 will be negatively impacted by the higher effective tax rate, the limited gross margin expansion and strategic investments. For context, the higher effective tax rate in 2020 will negatively impact our adjusted net income growth by approximately 300 basis points. Consistent with 2019, we are anticipating elevated capital expenditures in 2020 to support investments in manufacturing focused on [technical difficulty] capacity increases and facilities to support pipeline opportunities. We're also investing in information technology to support our recent acquisitions, as well as digital capabilities and data analytics. We're also committed to our capital allocation priority of returning excess cash to shareholders that isn't deployed internally or for business development opportunities. To that end, we recently announced 22% increase in our dividend and we have approximately $1.7 billion remaining under our multi-year share repurchase program after repurchasing approximately $625 million in Zoetis shares in 2019. Finally, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $3.90 to $4 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $3.53 to $3.65. While our guidance represents full year expectations, we do anticipate Q1 to be slightly weaker in terms of revenue with limited growth in adjusted net income due to the timing of the Simparica Trio launch and the investment required to support the launch and recent acquisitions. Now to summarize before we move to Q&A. 2019 was another exceptional year in which we delivered 10% operational revenue growth and 14% operational growth and adjusted net income. Our guidance for 2020 underscores our ability to grow revenue organically, well above the market and grow adjusted net income faster than revenue. And our focus remains on delivering long term shareholder value through disciplined internal and external investments and returning excess cash to shareholders. Now I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We’ll take our first question from Louise Chen with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.
Louise Chen: My question for you is, if you could provide more color on the headwinds and tailwinds and the macro outlook for animal health in 2020? Thank you.
Kristin Peck: As we talked about, the overall market for 2020 in animal health is projected to grow at 4% to 5%, probably faster than that will be companion animal as we've seen in previous years. As we think about where Zoetis is coming in, we believe we’ll grow faster than that market, really driven by our innovation. Obviously, we've given guidance around the excitement around Simparica Trio, our paras and our derm portfolio. We see poultry growing faster than the market as well and Zoetis is growing faster than the market as well. We have some launches there, as well as the portfolio we have in poultry to help raise no antibiotics ever. We see cattle returning to growth in 2020, albeit slower than the overall market and we see Zoetis probably growing in line with the market overall and swine, we see returning to growth as well in 2020 and Zoetis is growing in line or faster. So as we see some of the headwinds though remain innovation overall as well as sort of a return to growth for livestock in general.
Operator: And we'll take our next Jon Block wit Stifel. Please go ahead.
Jon Block: You mentioned launching the Trio in Europe later this month. I guess anything you're willing to share on price of Trio, positioning in the market? In other words, what you guys can do to try to get the incremental revenue from the top two oral flea and tick products versus call it just partially cannibalizing Simparica? And then Glenn, one for you, when I look at that 2020 guide, it seems like revenue certainly ahead. The adjusted interest expense was above expectations. I think you alluded to less royalty income, what about just from a cash flow perspective? In other words in the guide, is there any assumed buyback or paydown of debt in there? Thanks for your time guys.
Kristin Peck: I'll take the first and I'll let Glenn take the second question. We are expecting to be launching commercial launch in Europe in a few markets. This month, we will do phase one. So Italy, Spain, and UK, are launching this month in Europe. We are not first to market as many of in Europe. There are other products in the market. So to your point, it is a competitive position. We will be pricing, as we've spoken about before, at a premium to Simparica overall and really, as we look back the competitive side, it actually varies dramatically in Europe by market, with the different competitive products on the market overall. We remain excited for approval in Q1 in the U.S., and plan to launch shortly thereafter as is customer and as we spoken about another product launches, probably six to eight weeks after that. And in the U. S. as we spoken about, we should be first to market. Again, we'll plan to launch at a price premium to Simparica but at a discount probably, overall, if you look at it from the two products there. We’re focused very hard in the U.S. in gaining share. So we haven't gotten specific on overall pricing but it should be at a significant premium to Simparica today. But we haven't fully launched in the U.S., our pricing is not public yet in the U. S. So I'll let Glenn take the second question.
Glenn David: From a revenue perspective, very excited about the expectations for revenue growth this year with growth of 7 to 9.5% and obviously, very excited about Simparica Trio as well. In terms of the bottom line growth of 8% to 11%, a little less of a differential from revenue that we typically expect, a lot of that being driven by the impact of the tax rate change year-over-year. Accounting for that impact, we have about another 300 basis point impact of growth at the bottom line and also, foreign exchange was negatively impacting us in terms of adjusted net income absolute number and that was about 200 basis point negative impact from foreign exchange. Specifically to your questions, there is no assumed payback or pay down of debt. And in terms of share repurchase, the number of shares that we assume in our EPS are the shares ending as of the end of December 2019.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Michael Ryskin: Just sticking on the Trio to round out those set of questions. You've been talking about it for a while, obviously, on the conference calls and early this year at VMX, we saw a pretty significant presence from you on the Trio. Have you seen any response from your competitors ahead of the launch in terms of either stuffing channel or giving any promotions with the Spectra product in Europe or even with standalone products in the U.S., taking any price actions or any combo or bundling actions in the U.S. to try to get ahead of the March launch as that stock up in the first quarter? And then just on the same line follow-up. What's your expectation for Trio impact on gross margins, Kristin just following up on your comments and how it's priced? And obviously, you have the API component of two different drugs in there. So net-net, what's going to be the impact on gross margins in 2020? And then even in the out years as volume ramps from the Trio products?
Kristin Peck: This is the single biggest category in animal health or companion animal parasiticides. So it is a highly competitive space to exactly your point, it’s a $4 billion market in the U.S. alone, its $2.5 billion. So we are expecting a significant competitive response. This is a category that a lot of people will defend. We would expect normal CapEx, obviously, trying to stuff the channels or fill in and fill up the shelves as best they can. We're certainly expecting some of them to look at pricing programs, but we think there's significant excitement around the opportunity for a triple in the U.S. We’ve certainly heard it. We did not, as you saw at VMX, we didn’t have approval on this product. So we were not promoting this product at VMX. But there's a definite understanding that a triple is coming from us. I think customers are anticipating that and are very excited to have something new and innovative to share with their customers. So I think we're expecting whatever you normally see in a competitive response, but this is a major category. So our plans for launch, our revenue guidance we provided, was anticipating a significant competitive response in this area overall. So I'll turn it over to Glenn to take the gross margin implications on Trio.
Glenn David: Yes, in terms of the impact on gross margin. For 2020, we expect it to be mildly beneficial to our overall gross margin. Obviously, as time goes on and we become more efficient in the production or operating at full capacity, we do expect this to be a higher margin product for us, and it will benefit our gross margin over time as we move beyond 2020.
Operator: Our next question is from Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Erin Wright: Can you give us an update on the diagnostic strategy at this point? Do you expect continued inorganic activity in reference labs, both U.S. and globally, or is it more of an organic build at this point? And can you speak to some of the success you've seen already in the bundling across the portfolio between therapeutics and diagnostics? And then separate question on stocking. Were there any stocking dynamics worth noting in the quarter? And should we anticipate distributor stocking in the first or the second quarter for Simparica Trio? I guess I just want to make sure we're thinking about the quarterly progression appropriately there? Thanks.
Kristin Peck: Sure, I'll take trio first. In Europe, we obviously did begin shipping in Europe to customers there.  So you will see some stocking in Q1 there. In Q2, it will depend on exact timing, but there could be some shipments obviously in Q1 until we have an approval. As we said before, we won't be able to get very specific. But we're discussing weeks here and it just happens to be the timing in Q1. So it's hard to give you an exact guidance. But if you look at the $150 million guidance we gave you, it’s assuming we're selling for three quarters of the year, so there could be stocking obviously. But back to the diagnostic strategy overall, we remain very excited at diagnostics. For starter, it's a market growing at around 10% per year, so it's quite attractive. It continues to also drive use of our therapeutics and preventative. So it's exciting. So we look -- as we look into 2020, we're looking for double digit growth overall and Zoetis’ diagnostics portfolio, both in the U.S and abroad. We’ve spoken a lot about our point of care strategy. We're really focused there and increasing placements, as well as driving consumable use. As you look at the reference lab strategy, we have made a number of BD deals over the last three or four months in the U. S specifically. These are small deals as you've seen but we're looking to build a network. This will be in the U.S. a lot of organic builds from there, scaling the sites we have today, looking at some spoke sites as well. But I think you will see some BD as we look to grow into international. So this will continue to be a mix of organic and inorganic but again, very focused on ROI. We don’t see these as significant deals right now. We're looking at continuing to grow this over time, but great excitement. If you look at sort of some of our excitement ending 2019 and moving into 2020, we've been leveraging our FREEDOM FLEX program, which combines and offers opportunities across our core portfolio in diagnostics, and are very excited to add in reference lab into that opportunity as we look into 2020.
Glenn David: And Erin just to add to the comments on the quarterly seasonalization and progression for Trio. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we would expect significantly more sales in Q2 for Trio and really you know that growing throughout the year. So we look at the overall progression of revenue for the company. We would expect Q1 to be slightly lower in terms of overall growth and then because of the investments that we're making in Q1 to support the launch of Trio, as well as some other strategic investments, we’d expect income to be relatively flat or to low single digits.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Kreger with William Blair. Please go ahead.
John Kreger: Kristin, can you just give us an update on the monoclonal products that you're talking about in cats and dogs. Where does that stand from a regulatory standpoint? And do you think they could be notable contributors in '21? Or is that more of kind of the late year launch of that? Thank you.
Kristin Peck: In our Q2 2019 guidance, we indicated we have filed in both the EU and U.S., and we're expecting approval in 2021. It is obviously too early for us to be terribly specific as these regulatory views we wish we could predict with that level of precision. So it's probably a little early to be able to say whether or not we have failed in ‘21 or ’22. But you know these would be the first match reviewed by the FDA. So you know we want to make sure we give them that over time, and we have less understanding of exactly how fast that will be by file. We continue to be very excited, as we spoken about before, pain in cats is you know really there are no products today that adequately serve that market. So there's a lot of excitement as well as for the canine. So when we have more information there, we're happy to provide it but we remain excited.
Operator: Our next question is from Chris Schott with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
Chris schott: Just two here, first on the reference lab and organic build in the U. S. from here. Just give us some sense of how long you envision that taking to fully build out your network and portfolio in terms of when this becomes, I guess a bigger piece of the offering? My second question was just on the gross margin dynamics in 2020. It seems like we have kind of mix going in your favor with the growth in companion. I think the guidance is suggesting flat to slightly declining gross margins? So a bit more color of what's happening there. And longer term, is it fair to still think about gross margin improvements as we see that companion pipeline continuing to ramp over time? Thanks very much.
Kristin Peck: I'll take your first question and Glenn can take the second. If you look at reference lab build in the U. S., we think this is multiple years. We looked at scale in geographic as we've talked about, reference lab given the importance of logistics in reference lab, it is an MSA by MSA market and we're very focused on doing this and making sure we scale the sites that we opened. So we do believe this will take a number of years before we'll have a significant presence in the U. S. I would say the same for international. It'll be a buy and build. So to your point, I don't think this is something you're going to see really be a significant player within the next 12 months. But we're very excited about the long term growth in scaling in the markets we've entered and then adding folks there. But I'll turn it over to Glenn to take the gross margin in 2020 and beyond question.
Chris schott: So in terms of the gross margins so stepping back to 2019, we benefited significantly from foreign exchange in 2019 to the tune of about 120 basis points. As we move into 2020 impact of that turns the other direction. We have approximately about a negative 50 basis point impact from foreign exchange on gross margin in 2020; so that all said, some of the favorability that we're seeing, A, from price but also from mix from a companion animal perspective. The other thing that you need to take into account is some of the acquisitions that we have completed, reference labs in particular and diagnostics, they do come in into slower or lower gross margin; so that all said, some of the mix favorability that we see companion animal. One more time, we do anticipate that we'll continue to see gross margin improvements, driven by the completion of our supply network strategy, as well as some continued improvements in price and to the extent that companion animal continues to grow faster than livestock that will benefit our margins.
Operator: Your next question is from Kathy Miner with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.
Kathy Miner: Just one question. Could you comment on your China business, little more specifically give us color for the fourth quarter and also how do you see the corona virus impacting both business and your outlook for African swine fever? Thank you.
Kristin Peck: Sure, I'll start on corona and then I'll let Glenn get more into specifics of performance and 2019 expectations. As everyone is watching, the corona virus is obviously emerging very quickly in the sense of certainly the news overnight. As we look at our business right now, it's probably too early to tell exactly what the impact will be, but let me talk a little bit about some of the risks that we're watching. First is just an overall economic slowdown, which is already driving some reduced overall consumption in animal proteins. As we’ve seen some of the hardest hit markets are hospitality and travel. So without that, there's a number of people obviously not eating protein. So it should affect consumption a little bit. How long this lap will really impact whether or not that's a significant driver or not. There's obviously some commercial risks, many of our fields are not able to get after veterinarians and many pet owners are not currently bringing their pets to veterinarians, giving some of the quarantine. But if quarantines lift or as that emerges, we'll watch that. We're obviously watching our supply chain. We do have a number of MFA -- APIs or active pharmaceutical ingredients that are produced in China for the world. We're very confident with most of them that we have adequate supply multiple months. So even if the ports did shut down, we should be fine unless that was extended. The ports are still open and they are still shipping. So we don't see right now at the moment any impacts or overall supply chain. We'll continue to monitor this. Obviously, last year the big impact was AFS, which we did see either flattening or returning to growth in China but obviously, that will be subject to the ability to continue to move both feed around China, as well as animal protein. So it's a little earlier to tell but hopefully that gives you a sense of some of the issues that we're tracking to get a sense. But it remains a significant market. I'll let Glenn sort of talk about performance and expectations for China overall.
Glenn David: Yes, so when you look at China overall, I’ll start with full year and then talk a little bit about Q4. China for full year 2019 was about $200 million in revenue, which was essentially flat for the prior year, which is pretty impressive performance considering the impact of African swine fever, which we estimate to be greater than $50 million in 2019, and was really driven by rapid growth in companion animal. Companion animal now represents more than 50% of the overall revenue in China and is growing very rapidly. So the market performed very well even in the challenges of African swine fever. And I think you saw some of that, particularly in Q4 where we saw 10% growth in China in Q4 in operational perspective even with a negative $11 million impact from African swine fever.
Operator: The next question is from David Westenberg with Guggenheim Securities.
David Westenberg: So you're a competitor, one of the largest competitors in diagnostics has historically 3 three or 4 times the amount on R&D versus Abaxis. In order to close the competitive gap, do you think it simply requires scaling or do you think that you need to actually close the R&D gap longer term? And then to sticking with diagnostics with the acquisitions in reference lab, what kind of safeguards in place do you have to make sure that your sales force remains focused on selling your products with such a wide product bag? Thank you.
Kristin Peck: So with your first question, I'm not sure, I know that there's a number of reports out on R&D, versus IDEXX, versus Zoetis. We have significant investments in R&D in our diagnostics portfolio. So I don't think we're looking at any incremental spending to close any perceived innovation or R&D gap there. You remember part of diagnostics has always been a core part of how we even develop the products we develop today, making sure that we can diagnose the diseases that we create treatments for. So we remain very confident in our R&D spend and the percentage dedicated to diagnostics and see significant synergy from an R&D perspective between our core portfolio of medicines, vaccines, et cetera with diagnostics. So no, we don't see that. As we look at the field force, we actually, again, we like to be solution selling as we've spoken about. So we go in and talk about a wellness visit of which diagnostic is a role. If we need to -- if we're looking to place new instruments or sign up somebody on a new reference lab offering, we bring in specialists, diagnostic specialists to do that. And then we have diagnostics, technical specialists who come in and maintain that equipment. So we do not believe it's distracting at all. We do believe once you played that equipment that our core representatives and strategic account managers can really help drive consumable use as they talk about a wellness visit and how they can combine and looking at vaccines, preventative and doing wellness screening in diagnostics. So we think it's actually quite synergistic. And we have experts that come into sort of help, focus sales and replacement of new equipment as well as in reference labs. So no, we don't see that as a big challenge.
Operator: We'll take our next question from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
David Risinger: Thank you very much, and congrats, Kristin, to a very nice start to your new role as CEO. I wanted to just get a little bit better understanding of the finalization of the Simparica Trio approval. So what needs to be done at this point? I know that you're highly confident that it's imminent, but what steps need to take place? And then, I believe that you mentioned that you'll wait six to eight weeks after the approval to launch. And could you just explain that? I would have expected the launch to come much more quickly after the approval, given that it's highly anticipated. Thank you.
Kristin Peck: Sure. I'll let Glenn take some of the specific details there.
Glenn David: So in terms of Simparica Trio approval, as we said, we're in an administrative review period. All the technical sections are complete. So we're just awaiting final response from the regulators at this point in time. In terms of time frame of six to eight weeks from approval to launch, that's pretty typical within the industry. There are a number of things that need to occur. You need to find a label, you need to complete packaging of the product, you need to make sure you're building up the appropriate launch quantities. Obviously, we're doing that every day and we're looking to minimize that time of six to eight week period, but that is very typical within the industry in terms of approval the launch based on the activities that need to occur post-approval.
Operator: The next question is from Gregg Gilbert with SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Gregg Gilbert: Kristin, back to ASF. Kristin, has your thinking changed at all in terms of the overall impact of ASF and when that impact will begin to abate? And then, Glenn, can you talk about how much growth you're factoring for the derm portfolio in 2020 and maybe comment bigger picture on what inning you think we're in, in terms of realizing global peak sales for that portfolio? Thanks.
Kristin Peck: I'll start with ASF. We do think it's the overall impact based on what we know today is leveling out in China. The real question is how fast will they rebuild the herds in China and how will China overall meet its animal consumption demand. So, as we sort of see it as we talked a little bit, we do think in China, specifically, you'll see flat- to low-single digit growth in our pork business there. I think you'll slowly see some of the more innovative technologically advanced industrialized production start with very strong biosecurity. You're starting to see some signs of this, but it's in fits and starts and it's a little hard right now with corona to understand how fast that will really evolve. But I think if you look at the broader impact of African Swine Fever, they are going to need to feed their people even if consumption is a little bit down. So I think you're going to see the impact of African Swine Fever in countries like the Brazil, the U.S. and EU as they look to meet that demand. There has been little volatility, obviously, given corona in pork prices more recently, but overall, they've been trending up. This will encourage producers to raise more pigs, raise heavier pigs. We are seeing significant increases in export at least in the U.S. already and Brazil into China. So I think you'll see that, which is one of the, we believe, the drivers of why we said we think livestock overall across species will return to growth in 2020, because China will either have to feed their population, some will come from internal, but they will need significant imports into China and that will continue to come from Brazil, the U.S. and the EU, both in pork, but we're also seeing potential opportunities in both poultry and beef. I'll let Glenn take the second question.
Glenn David: So in terms of derm growth, so, A, just looking back at 2019, a really strong year for the derm portfolio in 2019. We grew 29% operationally, U.S. growing 25% and international growing 38%. We'd expect to have continued growth in 2020, not to that level as we're working off of a higher base, but the areas that we expect to exceed growth, A, international. We expect international continue to outpace the U.S. in terms of growth, just because currently, the mix of the revenue between U.S. and international is about two-third U.S., one-third international, although the number of medicalized dogs is pretty much equivalent between the two. So we would expect to gain market share in international as vets get more and more comfortable with the products internationally. And the U.S. has had the advantage of direct-to-consumer advertising, which is not available on all international markets. From the U.S. perspective, we continue to see opportunity in terms of continuing to expand the market, continuing to expand the usage into acute patients. And we still expect continue to get price in the U.S. as well. So we see 2020 has been another year of growth for the derm portfolio. But as the portfolio continues to mature, the pace of growth will slow.
Operator: The next question is from Navin Jacob with UBS. Please go ahead.
Prakhar Agarwal: Hi, this is Prakhar Agarwal on behalf of Navin. So, thanks for taking our questions. My first question is on the long-term opportunity for Simparica Trio. In the parasiticide space, the switch from topicals to orals was quite significant at greater than 70%. So, do you think the switch is a good analog for how much share could be switched over from the doublet to the triplet class or are we missing any dynamic? And secondly, on your Alpha Flux vaccine, do you have plans to launch this vaccine in Norway as well? And could you frame the market opportunity for this vaccine. Thank you.
Kristin Peck: Sure, I'll start with the first one, and I'll let Glenn take the second one. So, as you look at the long-term opportunity for Trio, it's obviously significant, as we talked about, it is the single largest category in companion animal and certainly overall. It's a highly competitive category as well. So, we're very excited. We think that we will gain share as we think about the $150 million incremental for 2020. The assumption in that overall is we do not have competition in the U.S. in that year, it is already obviously competitive space in many markets outside the U.S. We think we'll get a movement obviously from -- some from OTC. We think we'll certainly see some cannibalization. We've spoken about from Simparica, but we also think it will take some of the other orals in the market overall. So from capital to oral is necessarily the best overall proxy and part of the long-term opportunity for Trio will also depend on our label versus the label of potential other competitors to come to the market as well as the distance between our launch and their launch. I know the favorite question is what are we expecting at competitor. As you know in our fleet, there is very little information available. One of those is a private company, the other one does not disclose. So, at the moment, we believe we'll be the only product on in the U.S. in 2020 and that is part of the assumption on the $150 million, but the longer we are, the greater the opportunity to gain share overall. We continue to see this as a significant innovation for both the pet owner and the vet and a lot of excitement around it. So, we'll be investing significantly in that. I'll turn it over to Glenn a little bit on Alpha Flux.
Glenn David: So in terms of the fish portfolio for Q4, we saw very strong growth at 17% and Alpha Flux was a key contributor to that growth in the quarter, particularly in Chile. There is already a similar product on the market in Norway. So that would not be an incremental opportunity in terms of launching a new product in Norway. As we look into 2020, we continue to see the fish portfolio growing. There may be some limitation in terms of the number of salmon available to treat based on certain regulations, but we still see fish as a rapidly growing species for us in 2020.
Operator: The next question is from Elliot Wilbur with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Elliot Wilbur: First question for Kristin, just want to ask you about longer-term R&D investment. At the midpoint of the guide for 2020 on a percentage basis, guidance would have you coming in below 7% and that number has trended down. On a relative basis, last couple of years, obviously, you've enjoyed strong growth. But as you think about driving -- or the need to invest to really drive more innovation, is a sub-7% R&D ratio sustainable? Or should we expect that to increase, perhaps as we start to see the top line decelerate a little bit in the next couple of years? Just a quick follow-up for Glenn. You mentioned the lower gross margin profile of the diagnostic businesses, but as we think about modeling segment margins, I would also presume that on an operating income basis, those businesses also have lower margins, but I want to confirm that. Thanks.
Kristin Peck: On long-term R&D investment, we look every year as the portfolio of opportunities and innovation that we have ahead of us and invest based on where we see those opportunities. It does fluctuate a little bit year-to-year. It's been growing, I think, faster than our overall SG&A, not necessarily always at revenue growth. We are -- we've, I think, made very strong investments. As we see opportunities, we're more than happy to increase that R&D investment and have done so certainly quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, but we are confident that the spend around where we are again, you should expect fluctuations year-to-year based on opportunities. Some of these studies can, especially in livestock, when you move them, they can drive significant costs year-to-year, but we are very confident that we have the right level of spend to drive our value proposition, significant top line growth at or faster than the market long-term in what we've provided overall. I'll see if Glenn wants to add anything to that and he can take the second question.
Glenn David: So in terms of the question on operating margins for diagnostics, so gross margins will be lower over the long period of time for diagnostics. However, when you look at operating margin, obviously, right now we're in the build phase. So it's a little lower than our overall business. But as we're progressing over the next number of years, with the ability to leverage our commercial infrastructure, we do see the operating margins for diagnostics coming very close to our core portfolio as well.
Operator: The next question is from Balaji Prasad with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Balaji Prasad: So a couple of questions on the poultry side. One, Kristin, you spoke about your competitors add efficacy and supply challenges in the quarter. What -- can you throw some more light on what were these challenges and how prolong do you think this could be? And for 2020, would you still have been able to grow faster than market if these dislocations did not exist? Secondly, could you also throw some light on the market opportunity for vector vaccines and how should we think about the portfolio on revenue ramp from the segment?
Kristin Peck: Sure. I'll let Glenn take these.
Glenn David: So in terms of the poultry outlook, A, this year, we had very strong performance in poultry. We grew 10% for the year globally in poultry. And we see 2020 as being another very positive year for poultry growing much faster than the overall market and with our portfolio continuing to outpace the market. In terms of the vector vaccine, in 2019, we launched our first vector vaccine that really set the stage for us from an R&D perspective to continue to develop more and more vaccines over the next number of years for those to become a bigger section of our portfolio and we do see poultry continuing to be a rapidly growing market and we'll continue to invest in our R&D for that market.
Operator: The next question is from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Nathan Rich: Just two quick ones on diagnostics. You talked about double-digit revenue growth in 2020, could you just maybe help us think about how much of the contribution you expect from the three reference lab deals that you've done and what you're kind of expecting for organic growth kind of ex those deals? And then, Glenn, I think you mentioned reference lab being a drag on margins -- gross margins in 2020. Could you maybe just give us some sense of magnitude and help us kind of get a better picture of what you're expecting for margins for the underlying business? Thank you.
Kristin Peck: Sure. I'll take the first. Obviously, if you look at diagnostics overall, to be clear, we are expecting double-digit growth in our core point of care Zoetis diagnostics. That's not being driven by reference labs. Reference labs would be incremental to that. It's, again, I want to emphasize, still a pretty small part of our overall portfolio in the U.S., but we are expecting double-digit growth in both the U.S. and in international in the point of care space. But I'll let Glenn talk a little bit more about gross margin overall.
Glenn David: From a gross margin perspective, again, overall on diagnostics, as we are expecting rapid growth in that area, it will be a negative driver of our overall gross margin as those products tend to be of a lower gross margin profile. When you look at the overall EPS impact, particularly to your question on reference labs, reference labs in 2020 is about a negative $0.03 to $0.04 impact on our overall EPS based on the investments we're making to grow that business for the future.
Operator: The next question is from Kevin Ellich with Ace Research. Please go ahead.
Kevin Ellich: So a lot of my questions have been asked, but just wanted to see if you could provide a little bit more in detail on what you're doing in the digital and data analytics and when we could see some material impact from those initiatives. Thanks.
Kristin Peck: Digital and data analytics, obviously, is an important strategy of the Company. It's one of our five priorities as we move into 2020. I would say there's two components of that. One is, leveraging digital and data to drive greater sales of our core business. So, that's really focused around better targeting our customers, providing more personalized and customized solutions for them. So leveraging the data we have to better understand how they operate their business, what products will be most attractive, what offers will be most attractive to them. So, I think that will -- that's already in place and I think we're doing a very strong job both in the U.S. and international of leveraging some of those capabilities to drive our core business. We also see that opportunity in both pet care and livestock to create new revenue-generating solutions. Some of that in the pet care side will be around overall diagnostics opportunities and linking those opportunities to our core portfolio and providing incremental insights to our customers. In livestock, that remains as well around both our genetics portfolio as well as our precision livestock farming, which we see as a significant growth driver for us in the medium- to long-term. I think if you look at both the consumer preferences and where the industry is moving, it's moving more to individualized animal care. So, solutions such as what we have a Smartbow, which is ear tags for dairy cattle and better understanding the health and the productivity aspect of animals, individual animals and helping producers and veterinarians make better decisions in the short term is an opportunity, and as we link that to both our genetics business, which is you can also predict which animals will be born healthier and will have a better productivity. And then we see in the medium term the opportunity to link that as well to our diagnostics and really provide both veterinarians, producers, and consumers with better understanding and better health for animals. So, we think this will help drive our business. As we see some of those that you saw are more short-term opportunities, some are more medium term. And when I think about the connection between all three genetics, precision livestock, data in our core portfolio in diagnostics, that's probably more in the medium to long term.
Operator: Next question is a follow-up from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Michael Ryskin: Just had a quick one that keeps coming up. So I appreciate you squeezing me in. I've had a lot of questions on products coming off IP or potential generic competition or others. You talked a little bit about no expectation for a competitor, Simparica Trio, for example, but I was wondering if you have anything -- any expectations, any thoughts about a competing product in the derm portfolio in the U.S.? And also products like Draxxin, haven't had questions on IP rolling off there for a while. So, I'm just curious if you're seeing anything there or sort of what your expectations for that for 2020?
Kristin Peck: As we look, I'll just start with derm. We obviously have very significant market for dermatology. We have been expecting competition will enter at some point. Based again in our industry, there's not great data, so I can't tell you exactly when competitor will launch. We are obviously planning for our competitor to launch in the next one to three years. Exactly when that will be, will be difficult for us to fully assess, but we do expect a potential small or large molecule entrant. We don't know exactly when that will be, but we have put plans in place to prepare for that overall as a key focus for us. And for Draxxin, we still have patent protection through 2021. This is a significant market. So, we again here expect we will see competition when does hit and when patent exclusivity runs out. That's a significant market. But as we said, what's different about animal health and human health is, even though we'll see obvious competition, we still think in our business that normally has an impact between 20% and 40% both in sort of market share and price over a number of years. So we do expect obviously a challenge in 2021 or 2022 on Draxxin.
Operator: And it appears we have no further questions, I'll return the floor to you, Kristin, for closing remarks.
Kristin Peck: Well, thanks very much for -- I appreciate all the great questions today and if you got any further questions please do ask them. Thanks so much.
Operator: And this will conclude today’s program. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a great day.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-11-07 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Third Quarter 2019 Financial Results Conference Call and Webcast for Zoetis. Hosting the call today is Steve Frank, Vice President of Investor Relations for Zoetis. The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you the viewer and will not be forwarded automatically. In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call via dial-in or on the Investor Relations section at zoetis.com. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for your questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] In the interest of time, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and then queue up again with any follow-ups. Your line will be muted, when you complete your question. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.
Steve Frank: Good morning everyone and welcome to the Zoetis third quarter 2019 earnings call. I'm joined today by Juan Ramon Alaix, our Chief Executive Officer; Glenn David, our Chief Financial Officer and also by Kristin Peck, our CEO-elect. Before we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statements in today's press release and our SEC filings, including but not limited to our Annual Report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q. Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures. For the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and in the Company's 8-K filing dated today, November 7, 2019. We also cite operational results which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. With that, I will turn the call over to Juan Ramon.
Juan Ramon Alaix: Thank you, Steve. Good morning everyone. Today, you will hear commentary on the market dynamics and quarterly result from me and Glenn. I am also pleased to have a Kristin Peck our next CEO joining us to share some remarks with her appointment in the future of Zoetis. As we near the end of the year, let me provide some context around recent market dynamics. The animal health industry in 2019 as we may facing a challenging year for swine and cut off while we have seen a very good performance in companion animal and poultry. We have seen growing an appetite in the companion animal market for a spending on innovation and pet care and we once again expect to grow much faster than the market in companion animals for 2019. We are excited by the new products and lifecycle innovations giving them more advance ways to assist pet owners, weakened skin conditions and parasites. The pathology treatment continues to be a critical need. And Zoetis has been rewarded for the innovation we have developed in this space, we have continued market penetration and our goal expansion of our key dermatology products Apoquel and CYTOPOINT, they are on track to achieve more than $700 million in sales for 2019. In recent years Zoetis has also been a strengthening its position in parasiticides. This year we added two new products to our parasiticide portfolio, Revolution Plus to protect cats against ticks, fleas and internal parasites and ProHeart 12 once yearly injection to prevent heartworm disease in dogs. Additionally, we are planning to launch Simparica Trio in the European countries and Canada in the first quarter. In the U.S. we expect the FDA to complete the review of Simparica Trio at the end of the first quarter. If approved, we will launch shortly after. Based on these assumptions, we project to generate incremental global sales of Simparica Trio in 2020 at around $150 million. In other areas like pain, alternative to existing treatment for dogs and cats we've spent a significant opportunity. And in the case of GILTI tax, it is a largely unmet need today. We are excited by the potential for our researcher programs we have monoclonal antibodies in this area. As I mentioned in the last quarter, we initiated the filing process in the EU and U.S. for a new fee line monoclonal antibody candidate to treat osteoarthritis, pain in cats and we have recently also initiated the filing process in the EU and U.S. for a canine monoclonal antibody candidate to treat osteoarthritis pain in dogs. If approved, we would anticipate this product coming to market in 2021. Meanwhile, African swine fever trade uncertainties and weather conditions affecting mainly U.S. cattle, having a significant negative impact on the livestock market. As a result of this negative impact, we expect the overall animal shelter market to grow rationally between 3% to 4% in 2019 compared to 5.6% in 2018. And as note in our guidance, we expect to outpace the market with operational growth in revenue over 6% to 7% and this excluding the positive impact of Abaxis. Turning now to our third quarter results. We continue our strong performance with 9% operational revenue growth in the third quarter driven by sales of our companion animal and poultry products. Our companion animal portfolio continues leading the way, we had 23% operational growth based on strong sales of our parasiticides, our key dermatology products and diagnostic portfolio. Diagnostic revenue from the Abaxis acquisition accounted for 2% of the overall growth. In terms of the livestock, we saw an operational decline of 4%. Growth in poultry was 5% but it was offset by declines in cattle mainly due to lower feedlot placements in the U.S. and the impact of African Swine fever in China. Our third quarter result demonstrate how our diverse portfolio and focus on meaningful innovations are driving our success. These trends remain the condition of our consistent and long-term performance. In the third quarter, we grew our adjusted net income by 10% operationally. And we continue to benefited from increase in revenue, improved gross margins and moderate growth in operating expenses. We remain confident in our latest innovation, future pipeline and core business before future growth and deliver our 2019 guidance which Glenn will discuss later. As we look ahead, we are making good progress with innovations and investment that will generate our future growth. As I said, we are preparing for the launch of Simparica Trio in European markets and Canada at the beginning of next year with the product currently in production. All regulatory reviews remain underway in Australia, Brazil, and Japan with a further submission expected in China and Mexico. In the U.S., we have been expanding our field force to better support our growing companion animal portfolio including the diagnostic products and in preparation for the launch of Simparica Trio next year once approved. We also continue to enhance our vaccine portfolios for livestock. In October Zoetis received USDA approval for Poulvac, Procerta, HVT-ND, the companies first vector vaccine for poultry. It will help to protect against both Mareks disease and Newcastle disease, highly contagious and infection for poultry. The product complements our market leading innovative vaccine delivery system for poultry producers and it is the first in what is expected to become an important new global vaccine franchise for Zoetis over the next several years, especially in international markets. We are also taking important first steps to address African Swine Fever having reached a non-exclusive license agreement with the U.S. Department of Agriculture in late September. This agreement gives us access to three patents and materials related to African swine fever vaccines strengths that will be incorporated into our research. While it could take several years to complete the development our licensing of our vaccine, our work with the USDA another partner provides a comprehensive approach to addressing these three infectious diseases. In addition to new products approval and lifecycle innovations, Zoetis continues to support future growth through business development activities. Last week we announced the acquisition of Phoenix Lab, Seattle based reference laboratory that is highly valued by veterinarians for quality assurance and customer care. The Zoetis has first entry to the veterinary reference laboratory space and it is expected to further strengthen our overall diagnostic portfolio, building of our 2018 purchase of Abaxis, a leading provider of a point-of-care diagnostic instruments. We view reference labs as another important part of our comprehensive diagnostic offering and we plan to build our presence in reference lab over time to organic expansions and other small acquisitions in this space. Now I would like to say a few words regarding our leadership transition. As we announced in October, I am retiring at the end of the year. This has been an amazing opportunity to be in a company like Zoetis over the last seven years. And I feel very positive about the Zoetis future based on our proven strategy, hard and track record of execution, the diverse and innovative portfolio that underlies our success with customers and the growth investment we are making for the long-term. I am confident our talented colleagues and management team led by our next CEO Kristin Peck will continue to capitalize growth opportunities ahead of Zoetis and create significant value for our company, customers and our shareholders. Kristin has been with the company since the beginning of Zoetis and currently serve as Zoetis Executive Vice President and Group President of U.S. Operations Business Development and Strategy. I worked with Kristin for many years, I note that she is the right leader for Zoetis next phase of our growth and industry leadership. She's a strong advocate for our customer needs, a champion offers Zoetis culture and values professional and collaborative leader for our people and industry. The track record of a strong performance through her tenure at Zoetis as well as her operational experience, innovative strategies and deep customer knowledge positions her well to drive Zoetis continued growth. She will build on our long-term study which she felt to develop alongside with the rest of the Zoetis management team and bringing her own vision leading the next stage of Zoetis journey. I will remain an advisor to Zoetis during the course of 2020 and Kristin and I are already working closely to ensure a smoother transition and maintain the momentum of our business growth. Before Glenn to discuss our third quarter results, I have asked Kristin to say a few words. Kristin?
Kristin Peck: Thank you, Juan Ramon. I'm honored to be named the next CEO of Zoetis and I look forward to leading our Company into its next phase of industry leadership and value creation. I want to thank Juan Ramon for establishing Zoetis as the world's leading animal health company. I have deep respect for Juan Ramon and its track record of creating value for our customers and for delivering strong returns for our shareholders. His innovative mindset has kept Zoetis at the forefront of the industry and Juan Ramon confidence in our Company's solid foundation and prospects for continued growth. So when it has a diverse and innovative portfolio, deep expertise in animal health and a winning culture shared by our talented colleagues around the world. We know how to partner with our customers to address their evolving needs across the continuum of care from prediction and prevention to detection and the treatment of disease. We have a promising pipeline of new products and lifecycle innovations and we are focused on making investments in digital technology, data and analytics that will fuel our future growth. As CEO, I will continue to drive forward with our successful long-term strategy. I will look for opportunities to accelerate our progress in the most meaningful areas for our veterinary and producer customers and I'm committed to building on the strategies, diverse portfolio and financial discipline that have been critical to our success. To that end, I've been working with Juan Ramon, Glenn and the rest of the Zoetis team as well as the Board over the last few weeks to ensure a seamless transition. As we look ahead, I continue to view animal health as a very valuable sector for investors. With steady growth prospects as the fundamental macroeconomic drivers of global population growth of innovation and a growing middle class in emerging markets, we'll drive growth in both companion animal and livestock. The long-term history of animal health and Zoetis is the testament to the resiliency of our business. The drivers in pet care and animal agriculture are fundamental to the world economy. And Core to people's connections with animals for both companionship and nutrition. I'm excited by the new opportunities for raising the standard of care with innovative new medicines, biologics and integrations across the continuum of care. As I prepare for my new role, a key priority for me has been directly connecting with our stakeholders around the world to better understand their perspective and how we can build on our Company's success. I look forward to engaging with many of you as part of this process and sharing more on our outlook for the market and plans for 2020 early next year. And now Glenn will cover the financials.
Glenn David: Thank you, Kristin and good morning. Before discussing our Q3 financial results, I first like to congratulate Juan Ramon on his upcoming retirement and welcome Kristi as the next CEO of Zoetis. In his role as CEO Juan Ramon has led our business to a remarkable transformation from a business unit advisor to an independent and publicly traded industry leader in animal health. Indeed Revenue and adjusted net income growth, well above the market during that period while managing acquisitions and a significant restructuring and from a personal perspective, he supported me to my own transition to CFO during that time as well. I'm very thankful to have worked with him over the past decade and appreciate that we will continue to benefit from his insight and knowledge as he remains an advisor & Director on the Board. I'm also very excited to work with Christian as he transitions to her new role, building upon Zoetis a strong foundation and delivering the next phase of growth. Christian and I have worked together at Zoetis for many years and we share our commitment to customers, colleague and value creation which is driven our company's success. Now let's review the financial results. We delivered another healthy quarter with operational revenue growth of 9% and adjusted net income growth of 10%, these quarterly results which built upon our strong performance for the first half of the year give me confidence in delivering on our full-year improved earnings outlook. For the full-year we are narrowing operational revenue growth at the high end of the range increasing operational growth for adjusted net income and increasing and narrowing adjusted diluted EPS. Reported revenue growth for the third quarter was 7% including a negative 2% impact from foreign exchange. Foreign exchange was primarily driven by the strengthening of the dollar against the Euro, Argentinian peso and the Australian dollar. Operational revenue growth of 9% for the quarter is driven by 1% price and 8% volume. The volume contribution of 8% includes 3% from key dermatology products, 2% from new products, 2% from legacy Abaxis products and 1% from other in-line products. Breaking down our operational revenue growth by species, companion animal grew 23% partially offset by livestock declines of 4%. Companion animal revenue growth was driven by our parasiticides portfolio including new products Revolution Plus and ProHeart 12 key dermatology products. the impact of the Abaxis acquisition and growth in emerging markets such as China. Excluding the impact of the Abaxis acquisition, companion animal products grew 20% operationally. Equine also had strong growth in the quarter benefiting from the acquisition of Platinum Performance, a nutrition focused animal health company. Livestock products declined in the quarter were primarily driven by market weakness in U.S. beef and dairy sectors. The ongoing impact of African Swine Fever and the revenue recovery of the Brazil truck driver strike that increased revenue in Q3 2018. These headwinds were partially offset by growth in poultry. Our key dermatology portfolio demonstrated continued strength this quarter with sales of $217 million representing 27% operational growth. This is our first quarter with revenue, greater than $200 million. Positive performance in this portfolio was driven by the ongoing expansion of the addressable market, increasing market share and continued uptake of both Apoquel and CYTOPOINT until recently launched markets. As Juan Ramon mentioned we are clearly on pace to exceed a combined $700 million in revenue this year. New products, especially Revolution Plus and Stronghold Plus as it's known internationally, ProHeart 12 swine combination vaccines 2% to overall growth in the quarter. This growth is net of cannibalization of the original formulations and highlights the success of our investments and lifecycle innovation. Sales from legacy Abaxis products for $68 million in the quarter represent 10% operational growth over the prior year pro-forma revenue. Other in-line products contributed 1% growth in the quarter including Simparica with $55 million in revenue and 28% operational growth. This growth was partially offset by declines in U.S. cattle and the ongoing impact of African Swine Fever. Now let's discuss the revenue growth by segment for the quarter. U.S. revenue grew 11% with companion animal growing 26% and livestock declining 9%. Excluding the impact of the Abaxis acquisition, U.S. revenue grew 10%. Strong companion animal products performance in the quarter were driven by growth of our parasiticide portfolio, key dermatology products and the impact of the Abaxis acquisition. Excluding the impact of legacy Abaxis products, companion animal growth was 25%. Our parasiticide portfolio including in-line products such as Simparica and ProHeart 6 and new products such as Revolution Plus and ProHeart 12 which launched in the quarter contributed the strong companion animal growth. U.S. dermatology sales were $154 million for the quarter, growing 28%. Growth this quarter was driven by market expansion, increasing market share, returns on direct to consumer investments and price. Positive companion animal performance was partially offset by U.S. livestock declines in the quarter driven by cattle and to a lesser extent swine. Sales of our cattle products were negatively impacted by unfavorable market conditions in the beef and dairy sectors, while feedlot placements in the quarter impacted sales of our products as well as pricing pressure driven by competition. While we continue to see good adoption and growth of the Fostera Gold swine vaccine declines in other product sales while it's the lowest swine revenue this quarter primarily due to the timing of promotional activities. These challenges in cattle and swine were partially offset by continued growth in poultry, primarily due to sales of our portfolio of alternatives to antibiotics in medicated feed additives. In addition, we were able to capitalize on competitive challenges, including lack of efficacy and supply constraints. To summarize, the U.S. business had a very positive quarter with diversity and innovation driving results despite challenging market conditions in the cattle sector. Our International segment also contributed to growth this quarter with operational revenue growth of 5%. Companion animal operational revenue growth was 16% while livestock declined 1% operationally. Excluding the impact of the Abaxis acquisition, international revenue grew 4% operationally, companion animal product growth was driven by key dermatology products, the addition of legacy Abaxis products and growth in emerging markets such as China excluding the impact of the Abaxis acquisition companion animal operational growth was 13%. International livestock declined modestly primarily due to the impact of African Swine Fever as well as an unfavorable comparison to the prior year which included the revenue recovery from the Brazil truck driver strike. Growth in cattle and poultry, partially offset the declines in swine driven by favorable market conditions in key markets including Mexico, the U.K. and Canada while poultry benefited from increased sales in China, Australia and Brazil. Now, I would like to review in more detail a few markets in the quarter. Beginning with China, revenue declined 9% operationally driven by the ongoing impact of African Swine Fever which was partially offset by continued double-digit growth in companion animal. Our livestock portfolio declined 40% operational in China driven by swine declines that were partially offset by growth in poultry and cattle. As we indicated in last quarter, we expect the full-year impact of African Swine Fever to our revenue to be approximately $50 million. While the outbreak has continued to spread to other markets in Southeast Asia, our full-year estimate remains consistent. In the medium to long term, we continue to anticipate that other regions will increase exports of pork and other proteins however, we have not seen increases in productions to any significant extent. Our companion animal products continue to grow significantly in China increasing 43% operationally. Sales from parasiticides, vaccines and Apoquel were the primary drivers of growth aided by field force expansion and effectiveness. Moving on to Brazil, sales grew 1% operationally driven by companion animal growth of 17%, partially offset by our livestock decline of 5%. Companion animal revenue growth in Brazil was driven by our key dermatology portfolio including CYTOPOINT which launched in the second quarter as well as growth in Simparica. Livestock declines in Brazil this quarter were driven by an unfavorable comparison to the prior year when sales were recovered due to the resolution of a national truck drivers' strike that occurred in Q2 of the prior year. In Mexico, sales grew 22% operationally driven by livestock growth of 15% and companion animal growth of 46%. Livestock benefited from sales of our premium products for cattle while strong companion animal performance was driven by growth in legacy Abaxis products, parasiticides and vaccines. Other emerging and developed markets also contributed to international growth this quarter, particularly in companion animal driven by parasiticides and key dermatology products. Overall, our International segment continued to perform well, demonstrating the importance of our global diversity and helping to offset the impact of African Swine Fever. Now moving on to the rest of the P&L. Adjusted gross margin of 70.1% increased approximately 140 basis points in the quarter on a reported basis compared to the prior year. The increase is driven by foreign exchange, product mix and price partially offset by tariffs on certain products and the inclusion of the lower margin legacy Abaxis portfolio. Total adjusted operating expenses including the impact of the Abaxis acquisition through 6% operationally. The increase is primarily related to compensation-related expenses and investments to support future growth of the business. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.5%. The increase from the comparable 2018 period is primarily related to the impact of the global intangible low tax income or GILTI tax which is effective for Zoetis in 2019. Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter grew 10% operationally and adjusted diluted EPS grew 11% operationally, again, outpacing revenue growth. The combination of revenue growth, improving gross margins and disciplined operating expense growth enabled us to deliver strong bottom line results while still investing strategically for long-term sustainable growth. Now moving on to guidance for the full-year. As a result of our strong performance in the first nine months of the year, we are narrowing operational revenue growth at the high end of the range, raising operational growth for adjusted net income and raising and narrowing the range for adjusted diluted EPS. Please note that guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late October. I'll now walk you through each of the individual line items, beginning with revenue. We are now expecting to deliver revenue between $6.2 billion and $6.25 billion as compared to our previous range of $6.175 billion to $6.275 billion. The dollar decrease in revenue guidance at the high-end of the range is related to unfavorable foreign exchange. Operational revenue growth is now expected to be between 9% and 10% as compared to our previous estimate of 8.5% to 10% reflecting the continued momentum of our companion animal portfolio. Our organic operational revenue growth which excludes the impact of Abaxis is now expected to be between 6% and 7%. We are now projecting adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue to be approximately 30% compared to our previous range of 30% to 31%. Adjusted SG&A for the year is expected to be between $1.525 billion and $1.55 billion compared to our previous range of $1.505 billion to $1.545 billion. The increase in narrowing at the high-end of the range reflects our focus on critical investments to support revenue growth including promotional activity on key companion animal products. Adjusted R&D expense for 2019 is now expected to be between $445 million and $455 million for the year compared to our previous estimate of $450 million to $465 million. The decrease was related to the timing of project spend. Our full-year adjusted interest and other income deductions is expected to be approximately $190 million and our full-year adjusted tax rate is expected to be approximately 20% which are both consistent with previous estimates. Adjusted net income is now expected to be in the range of $1.72 billion to $1.745 billion representing an increase of $10 million at the high end of the range. The updated adjusted net income range represents operational growth of 11% to 14% compared to previous range of 9% to 12%. The improved outlook for adjusted net income is primarily driven by gross margin favorability. We are also increasing our adjusted diluted EPS to a range of $3.57 to $3.62 compared to our previous guidance of $3.53 to $3.60. Our range for reported diluted EPS is increasing and narrowing now expected to be between $2.99 to $3.08 based upon operational increases. Our previously estimated range was $2.93 to $3.04. We expect approximately $450 million to $475 million in capital expenditures this year with increased investment in information technology and manufacturing to support our Abaxis acquisition, improve cost efficiencies and increased capacity. We anticipate continuing an elevated level for the next few years as we invest in manufacturing and infrastructure to support future growth and product launches. We also repurchased approximately $450 million of Zoetis shares in the first nine months of the year. We have $1.9 billion remaining under the multi-year share repurchase plan that was approved last year and we remain committed to our capital allocation priorities of internal investment, M&A and returning excess cash to shareholders. Our guidance for reported and adjusted earnings per share reflects the shares repurchased through the end of Q3. While we not provide guidance for 2020 until February, we view next year as a continuation of strategic investment to support recent and future product launches, our recent acquisitions including Phoenix Lab and Platinum Performance and other strategic priorities. Now to summarize before we move to Q&A. We have consistently delivered strong top and bottom line growth in the first nine months of the year despite market challenges in cattle and swine. We are narrowing our outlook the operational revenue growth at the high end of the range and we are increasing and narrowing our outlook for adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS reflecting the strong performance year-to-date. And our investments in R&D, diagnostics integration, manufacturing capabilities and field force expansion will provide a solid platform for continued growth in 2020 and beyond. Now, I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions, operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Kevin Ellich with Craig-Hallum. Please go ahead.
Kevin Ellich: Good morning. Juan Ramon, it's been great working with you and I hope you enjoy your retirement and get the play a lot of golf.
Juan Ramon Alaix: Thank you.
Kevin Ellich: Congratulations. We all know you're going to do a terrific job succeeding Juan Ramon. The questions I have first, I think you guys talked about some Simparica Trio saying that your assumption is if it's approved in the U.S. by the end of Q1, revenue would be about $150 million in 2020 did I get that right?
Glenn David: Yes. The incremental sales that we expect for Trio over our existing portfolio is $150 million.
Kevin Ellich: And what is the underlying assumptions there Glenn in terms of pricing, how much will come from the U.S. versus international and how much cannibalization?
Glenn David: So in terms of the breakout between U.S. international like we've set all along, we expect the majority of the sales for this product to be in the U.S. I really want to go into details on price from a competitive perspective at this point but like we said we do expect it to be priced significant premium to Simparica and the cannibalization impact obviously there'll be some cannibalization to Simparica but we also expect to take significant share from competition.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Louise Chen with Cantor Fitzgerald.
Louise Chen: So Juan Ramon, we will miss you and Kristin and congratulations on the new role. My first question is for you, Kristin, as the new CEO of Zoetis what will you do differently from Juan Ramon? And then also just on 2020, I know you're not giving guidance till February but how should we think about the pushes and pulls as we look into next year? Thank you.
Kristin Peck: Sure. Thanks so much Louise. I'm going to be focused on really continuing the strong path of value creation. If you look at the strategy that we've had over which I feel actually is delivered significant results both for our customers and for our shareholders. It is been a dynamic strategy that has always been predicated on continuous innovation and disruption which I think is really would have helped us stand out. It's also been characterized by a great diversity of our portfolio and my goal is to maintain that strong momentum to stay ahead of competitors. I think if I look into 2020 and 2021 and beyond, I'm really going to be focused on innovation, making sure we continue to bring to market products that really solve both our customers and animals’ challenges. I will continue to relentless focus on our customer making sure that we're finding ways to make their job easier to do and to make them more productive. And I'll be looking for better leverage our digital and data both to make us more efficiently internally as well as to drive better productivity and greater growth in some of our data and digital revenue products both in diagnostics and precision livestock farming. So that will be my focus as we look into 2020 and some of the sources of where I think you'll see our continued growth.
Glenn David: And in terms of the pushes and pulls for 2020, starting with the revenue line, where we continue to see good momentum in our companion animal business and particularly with the expected launch of Simparica Trio subject to approval, we expect to see very strong performance there as well as the continued growth in some of the new products that we launched this year such as ProHeart 12 and Revolution Plus. Also, when you take into account the impact of African Swine Fever that we had this year, we would expect that to stabilize this year and not to be a negative detractor to growth in 2020 so that should benefit us as well. When we look at the expenses, obviously there'll be some investments to support our new product launches. We want to make sure that we get those products off to a strong start and also some investments to support the recent acquisitions that we have in place. So overall, we would expect revenue to grow faster than the market again in 2020 and we would expect that we able to grow our income faster than revenue.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Erin Wright: Great, thanks and Kristin congrats, Juan Ramon as well. It's obviously been very, very nice working with you. I had a quick question on Simparica Trio - $150 million in 2020, it's a little bit higher I guess than what we were contemplating on a net basis, I just want to confirm some of the assumptions that you're making, does it assume that you launch ahead of ZeoMAX and does it assume that you'll be the only player in the U.S. and does it also assume of puppy indication or other label caveats from a safety perspective. A separate question here, but can you also speak to the diagnostic strategy in the reference laboratory market. I guess how quickly can you scale up the U.S. lab footprint and what are some of your plans internationally from a reference lab perspective as well? Thanks.
Juan Ramon Alaix: So, Kristin will answer all this question, so please Kristin.
Kristin Peck: Sure, so starting with Trio. We do not expect to be launching ahead of ZeoMAX and Western vet but we do expect to be launching ahead, a very important Q2, Q3 parasiticides season. So I think we will not be there but I do think if you look at the $150 million to your point, we still expect to deliver a very strong year there. We do expect to get puppy claim that is part of the assumptions that is in there that's obviously subject to back to approval but that is our going in assumption as we look at that. So as I move towards the reference lab, we continue to believe that diagnostics is an important part of our go-forward portfolio. It is critical to that and as a part of their business that will stay there, we think it enhances as Zoetis is currently value proposition and is a great complement to our existing portfolio, it's a large and very fast growing market. As the market has been growing at 10% plus, we strongly believe that we can accommodate a third player. We've also known the customers that we're looking for a third-party alternative and if you look and different MSAs shares of third-parties have actually been significant as our acquisition of Phoenix demonstrates, they had over 50% share in the MSA they operated in. Our plan in this space is to invest both organically and inorganically over the next few years and we remain committed to the space.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Christopher Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Christopher Schott: Great, thanks very much for the question. I guess my first one was on Apoquel and CYTOPOINT ex-U.S., can you just provide any additional color in terms of where penetration rate stand in some of the bigger markets in terms of Europe, Brazil, et cetera and where do you think those penetration rates can go over the next several years? And my second question is, sorry I keep going back to $150 number but I'm still not quite clear, can you help me understand again how much of that 150 is incremental revenue on top of what you're parasiticide business is already doing as compared to erosion from I guess legacy Simparica and some of your heart products et cetera. I'm trying to understand the magnitude of overall growth I should be thinking about for parasiticides next year. Thank you.
Juan Ramon Alaix: Glenn will provide some data related to the penetration range and also details of the 150, how much is [indiscernible] revenues.
Glenn David: So when you look at Apoquel and CYTOPOINT particularly in the U.S., we see that we are plus 60% share in that market. The data internationally is not as clear in terms of, we don't get the same level of data but we know we're not at that penetration rate. Also we've launched Cytopoint later international than we do in the U.S. so we do think we have continued uptake there. So we do see significant opportunities in international if you continue to gain share as we move up to similar levels that we have in the U.S. We also see continued opportunities in the U.S. as we continue to expand that market and raise disease awareness of dermatology and atopic dermatitis. So we see continued opportunity in the U.S. as well. In terms of $150 million revenue for Simparica Trio, I want to be clear that is incremental sales overall what we see for Simparica alone and that does include the cannibalization effect. So we would expect greater sales of Trio then $150 million as a stand-alone product.
Operator: We'll go next to Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Michael Ryskin: And I want to mirror the earlier comments, congrats Juan Ramon. It's been great working with you and Kristin look forward to working with you going forward. Two quick questions from me, one on some of the moving pieces in the quarter and sort of looking forward, I would say one of the bigger surprises this year has been in the entire market not just very specifically but some of the challenges in U.S. livestock, particularly given the negative tone of ASF internationally, there is an expectation that you will see some stabilization in U.S. livestock in the market in cattle and swine. And it's been a little bit slow probably slower expected this year, if you look back in the line months earlier. How do you see some of these dynamics playing out? We talked about ASF internationally but if you think about the cattle herd in the U.S., some of the feedlot pressures that we've seen this year in terms of placements, if you could talk automatically sort of over that six months to 12-months. And then a quick follow-up on the seasonality question, you talked about the Simparica Trio approval likely end of 1Q early 2Q launch, could you talk about the timing that you think about the vet purchasing a lot of the ordering by that's happens relatively early in the year. So how much wiggle room do you have built-in and how quickly can you ramp up manufacturing to make sure that you don't miss a fleas season if there is a month or two movement either way there.
Juan Ramon Alaix: Let me answer the question on Simparica Trio and then Kristin will cover the trends and also the challenge that we have seen in the U.S. livestock and we also talked about the African Swine Fever. We expected approval in late first quarter from FDA and then shortly after we launched the product in the market. We are thinking already they are prepared to step to ensure ample supply of the product as soon as we obtain approval in the U.S. So we don't think that the supply will be efficient in terms of capturing the opportunities of the high season that it's mainly in the Q2 following the Q3. We are confident that we told earlier we are making now it is probably is approved by the FDA, we will be able to generate a significant opportunity for Simparica as we are in 2020. So moving into the U.S. livestock, Kristin?
Kristin Peck: Sure. As you saw our numbers both dairy and beef in the U.S. continue to be weak. As we said in previous conversations in previous quarters, we expect this to continue for the rest of the year. From a dairy perspective and we've seen depressed milk prices versus historical trends which has limited producer profitability income and in the last few months there has been a small improvement in pricing but it's not yet sustained enough we believe for producers to believe recovery M&A and to start investing significantly. On the beef side, we're at the end of what's been a very long expansion period. So we are expecting a little bit of contraction or flattening out over the medium term. As you look at beef, there has also been a lack of innovation that has driven significant pricing and competitive pressures. We had a wet spring which had good past through this year which is kept cattle out longer and as you've seen there's been a significant increase in some of those prices and live cattle prices, which has encouraged them to wait of their animals were heavier and older to put them in the feedlot. So as we look at U.S. cattle, I think we'll continue to see challenges of there as we look into next year. And as we look at ASF as we've spoken about previously, we believe with China specifically, we see about a $50 million impact across the Zoetis primarily based out of China. As we look into next year, we are hoping for that to stabilize and we are hoping to see some recovery moderate but obviously that remains to be seen based on how that goes. But we do see offsets were the Chinese swine. We are expecting imports from EU, Brazil and the U.S. both in swine as well as across other proteins to help compensate that we've seen significant price increases in pork globally. We see Brazil and EU probably best positioned to take some of this, but I think overall, it seems certainly enough in the U.S., the U.S. will also go after trying to get a greater share of. So we remain quite committed but I think what we believe that the impact of ASF should flatten out as we look into next year. So hopefully that explains.
Operator: We will go next to John Kreger with William Blair. Please go ahead.
Jon Kaufman: This is Jon Kaufman on for Kreger. Juan Ramon, we wish you well and Kristin congrats on the new role. One of your competitors has talked a lot recently about the importance of alternative channels. Can you guys talk a little bit about that? How important are the online and the mass market retail channels for you today? How has your strategy evolved here over the past year or so and as you think about the future outlook for the company, how much of the growth, do you think will come from these alternative channels? Thank you.
Juan Ramon Alaix: We have seen Jon the changes on the how vet owners are getting that product from different channels, we have seen that mainly the U.S., but also in some other markets there are changes but really having an impact into the veterinary space but Kristin will provide much more color on how things are changing in the U.S. as these affecting the market, affecting manufacturers, affecting alternative channels, so Kristin do you want to provide some comments please?
Kristin Peck: Sure. I would certainly. If you look at our portfolio is the contrast of other is the majority of what we sell requires a prescription. So our goal is to work with vet to make our product available to pet owners in a way that works best for them. And what we've seen is in the areas such as parasiticides and chronic medications, many pet owners have looked more to buy their products from e-commerce and retail and as such we've evolved our own strategy to work more directly with e-commerce and retail. We implemented as we discussed on previous calls the minimum advertised price or Matt pricing which is an agreement with all e-commerce and retailers to ensure that they cannot advertise our products beyond a certain price. This has allowed us to legitimately sell our product, eliminate some of the great market and provide veterinarians and pet owners the convenience to fill their prescriptions where and how they want. This I think is an evolving thing so just to give you context still 50% of what we sell we'll have to remain no matter what in the clinic. It's definitely expanding quickly but still on a relative basis is still a small part of our business today, but something we're monitoring closely and we're making sure that we continue to develop and enhance our capabilities to best serve this new channel as we move forward.
Operator: We'll go next to Jon Block with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Jon Block: And maybe just a handful of small questions most of is clarification. So first clarification for companion animal, did you guys see both canine and theme line labs both targeting U.S. approval in 2021 one, a clarification for ASF I was a little mixed up there is the thought that the drag for 2020 will be less than the $50 million incremental hit in '19 but you still think there could be additional incremental headwinds for 2020? And then lastly, Glenn, not going into 2020 guidance on you but just only we think about that COGS in sort of hitting that 70% bogey for 2019 which is certainly impressive. I would think you still going to have a favorable mix shift in 2020 is companion grows faster than livestock based on all the commentary but do somebody investments in manufacturing offset that. Thanks guys.
Juan Ramon Alaix: Thank you, John. Let me confirm that we have to file both antibodies for cats and dogs in EU and the U.S. and we expect to launch in 2021 of these two products in the U.S. Moving into the African Swine Fever, the assumption that we are making on the comments that we provided today is we are assuming that there will not be a further spreading of African Swine Fever outside of China. We have seen that cases in the Southeast Asia, Korea, the Philippines to a lesser extent also in Eastern European markets. But we expect that customers now are improving that vital security and they are protecting better against the African Swine Fever. We are not expecting that China to continue growing in terms of cases may be an opportunity to slight increase in production in China and definitely we see the opportunity in other markets to compensate the gap that have in terms of supply of meat into the Chinese population with more production from Brazil, European markets, Spain, Germany and some other markets, Canada and the U.S. and this is something that in our opinion will help also to generate that growth in livestock in 2020. So moving into the third question, in terms of gross profit Glenn, you want to cover that?
Glenn David: Yes, so John your thoughts on gross margin. When you look into 2020 there should definitely be a favorable mix impact as we would still expect companion animal to grow faster than livestock in 2020. Just one thing to note on that Trio being the first year of product launch will not be as favorable to gross margin as the rest of the companion animal portfolio we typically be. Over time we do expect that product to have very favorable margin. But with the first year of launch there is always learnings and efficiencies that will be delivered over time. The other thing to take into account is that FX had a very positive impact in 2019 our overall gross margin. We would not expect it to be positive in 2019 probably be somewhat of a detractor in 2012.
Operator: We'll go next to David Westenberg with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.
David Westenberg: I echo the congratulations. So just in terms of market sizing up, can you help us size the market for the cat opportunity given that there is no existing market? just any sort of framework so that we can think about in terms of there would be population age, et cetera. And then secondly, a competitor called out the ASA-African Swine Fever vaccine market is a multi-billion dollar market. Can you maybe give us a framework on the size of that as well? Do you agree with that assessment? What are the puts and takes there? Thank you.
Juan Ramon Alaix: Okay, so let's me provide some comments on the market size for cat and local antibodies. So first, there is no any specific product today in the market developed specifically for cat. We know that the number of cats, it's lower than the number of dogs and even more the number of medicalized cats it's even lower than the number of medicalized dogs in the U.S. and also worldwide. If I compare the market of dogs in terms of managing their pain it's about $400 million to $500 million worldwide. So with the comments I made in terms of medicalization rates and the number of cats, you should expect that the market potential for cat in pain is lower than these $400 million to $500 million. But the advantage is that we will be entering into a space that there is no any clear product addressing that pain in dogs and that we think that we can generate a significant growth opportunity in these areas. Then how big is the African Swine Fever market? Well, I don't know if the question is related of how much has been the impact on the African Swine Fever and the vaccine. Well, I think it's something that it is reaching because definitely we see a significant opportunity in China, developing this vaccine but also not only in China that we have already the disease but also, they need to protect African Swine Fever in other markets. We are convinced that this can be one of the top vaccine products worldwide, more than FMB or even more than PCV2. So the opportunity for developing a vaccine in this area is significant.
Operator: We'll go next to David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
David Risinger: And me please add my congrats to you both Juan Ramon and Kristin. So my two questions are first, with respect to U.S. tick, could you help us understand what percentage of the U.S. dog market needs tick coverage. Obviously, there are no ticks in the south, I just don't know what percentage of dogs reside in tick infested areas in the country? And then second, could you comment on livestock pipeline launch opportunities in the next year or so? Thank you.
Juan Ramon Alaix: Thank you, David, Kristin?
Kristin Peck: Sure. If you look at, U.S. tick average, very significant tick coverage across the United States. There are different ticks. In the South, you might see more of a Gulf Coast tick which is actually a very difficult tick to treat [indiscernible] tick in the North. So we do believe that most pets in the United States needs a comprehensive tick protection. There may be some geography where there's not a lot but I think there may varies a tick but insect protection is critical we move across the U.S. As we think about our livestock population opportunity, as you saw in the press release, we are quite focused on driving innovation across livestock. We announced a partnership with Colorado State. So look at antibiotic alternative to the livestock space. We're also really focused on immuno therapies in livestock as alternatives to antibiotics and are excited about some projects there as well. We're also looking at precision livestock farming can make producers more productive and to better predict animal looking sick. We are also excited in the area of genetics where we can breed healthier animals that are also more productive. And as we've talked about in previous calls looking through diagnostics to bring more shoot side farm side diagnostics across that.
Operator: We'll go next to Mavin Jacobs with UBS. Please go ahead.
Prakhar Agarwal: This is Prakhar on for Mavin. I had two questions. First on Simparica Trio, one thing we are hoping to get more clarity on is around duration of therapy, so tick free products are more seasonal which is not typically the case with hard one product. So how are you thinking about the duration of therapy for Simparica Trio? Do you expect this to be predominantly used in the tick season or good duration of therapy, be more? And secondly on Abaxis you've talked about expansion into OES markets are the key opportunity so could you provide an update on the expansion plan and have you identified target markets or regions that might be ideal and longer term could Abaxis reach similar size in international markets and the U.S. market. Thank you.
Juan Ramon Alaix: Thank you very much for the two questions. So let me answer the duration of therapy. One thing is that what should be the duration of therapy that we believe that it should be in many of the markets are 12 months. And what is the actual duration of therapy that is probably three or less month. So a significant opportunity in terms of compliance and we may see some high season for ticks and fleas depending on the warmer weather but they need to protect animals goes going across the year and definitely in the case of a high warm, it's a 12-month the need of protecting against these type of disease. And I like Kristin to talk about our budgeted rate expansion plans both U.S. and international.
Kristin Peck: Sure. When we announced back since there, we talked a lot about the fact that we think we can continue to operate the business in the U.S. much better and drive more efficiencies and drive growth but acknowledged that the competition in the U.S. is a little steeper. As we look into international, we strongly believe in international, there are significant growth opportunities. It's more of a blue ocean with a much more fragmented base. The use of diagnostics also varies dramatically by market. We're very focused on and building our own direct demand generation field force which is really being lacking across most companies, the operator international we looked at 2019, as we've talked about for Abaxis as a platform year to really establish ourselves there and we plan to move to direct distribution from some of our existing distributors across most markets as we look into 2020. So we do think there is a significant opportunity in Abaxis to reach us by a similar if not higher share than we have in the U.S. just given it is a less mature market with much more fragmentation but it will require a market by market approach.
Operator: We'll go next to Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Nathan Rich: Thanks for the questions and let me also offer my congratulations. On the triple combo, have you guys gotten feedback from the FDA just on where they are in their review process and kind of what is driving your expectations for maybe a little bit later of an approval than you originally expected. And then can you also talk about the timing for a submission. And when you would expect approval for the triple combo in China and some of the other geographies that you mentioned like Mexico?
Juan Ramon Alaix: Let me make some comments about the process of approval in the U.S. There is something which is part of the normal process of questions and answers. We get there some additional requests for information from FDA, not related to safety or efficacy and we already answered these questions and now we are waiting for the feedback and we expect the final decision on Simparica Trio by late first quarter next year. But there is something that is part of a regulatory discussion with many of the regulatory authorities across the globe. We said before that we were expecting approval and launch in the first quarter. We have already obtained approval in Europe and Canada and we have the first quarter in these markets. And we'll be ready for launching shortly after approval in the U.S. And as I said, we are already taking the steps to have ample supply to meet the market needs in the 2020 always base with the assumption that we provided that today of these 150 additional revenues in Simparica sale. And then you also ask about approval time in China. These unfortunately something that at this point, it's difficult to answer. We are preparing the filing in China and then after the filing probably we will get a little bit more clarity on the timing and we expect that to launching in this market. So first we intend to launch Simparica as a single item in China and then also CYTOPOINT that is another important product that we plan also to launch in China and then later we'll be launching Simparica Trio. So even if it will take maybe some years, we have products that are coming into the market in China that will generate very positive growth momentum in this market. Next question please.
Operator: Our next question is from Kathy Miner with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.
Kathy Miner: First again Juan Ramon and Kristin congratulations to you both. Just a couple of questions, first on the canine pain map that you filed. Can you tell us if that is the compound that you acquired from Nexvet a couple of years ago? Second, I noticed that fish sales were down 9% this quarter and that's somewhat unusual that's been a growing market. Is that something temporary or is there a change in the outlook? And last question when we look at African Swine Fever, I think it took everyone by surprise, are there any other diseases that you're monitoring that could impact your business over the next three to five years? Thank you.
Juan Ramon Alaix: Thank you for the question. So let me start with answering the question about the monoclonal antibody for dogs. So we have multiple programs in our R&D activity. The product that we are now planning to launch it's an internal product for dogs. The one that we are planning to launch for cat is coming from Nexvet. You also asked about the decline in the quarter related to fish. We have been growing very fast in previous years in fish. This year we had some challenge related to the PD vaccine in Norway. We expect that it is a temporary adjustment and we expect fish to continue growing faster than the overall animal health market. The long-term opportunities in fish is related to adding new vaccines to protect all species different than salmon. Today, we have most of our revenues concentrated in salmon in Norway and Chile. But we expect to continue developing new vaccines to protect animals different than the salmon and to review the use of antibiotic which is today the only treatment or the only protection against infections for species like the gases or tilapia or other fish. Definitely, we continue investing in fish and we are confident that fish will be a growing opportunity in the future. Next question please.
Operator: We'll go next to Gregg Gilbert with SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Gregg Gilbert: A couple longer term ones for Kristin and clearly Zoetis is the leader overall industry but is there an area or areas we'd like to see is they want us be more of a leader than it is today. And secondly on the companion side do you think pet owners they are anywhere close the maxing out and what they can afford or where they chose to afford in carrying for their pets, I realize flees, ticks heart worm is not in this category. But thinking the three to five years plus on the line we spent biotech products, et cetera. Maybe this comment on that longer term. Thank you.
Juan Ramon Alaix: So let me answer the first question and then Kristin will cover the second. So when we see that we can improve our market share and becoming the leader and becoming leader and, in this call, we announced that we obtain approval of new vaccine for both which is related to vector technology it's an area that we believe that will be a growing opportunity. So I think we are starting that with one vaccine but the objective is to develop a complete set of vector vaccine to cover multiple diseases in totally and this will help us and also to maximize the opportunities with our leadership in lower vaccination which is the machine that is used in country to protect chicken before hatchery. So we are injecting X and we see an area in where we are less share that the overall share that this area has. The second area in where we think that we have been improving significantly is the launch of Simparica followed by the launch of Revolution Plus, ProHeart 12 it's parasiticides and we expect also with the launch of Simparica Trio to become much stronger leader in parasiticides than today. Kristin?
Kristin Peck: Sure, on you second question. We've seen as increases over the last few years and the spend per pet, I think a lot of that has to do with the demographic shifts in developed markets where people are having fewer children, spending more time with their pets, Millennials in particular are much more engaged with their pets. And we've spoken about the increase in pet spending start when they move from the backyard to your house and then ultimately to your bed. So we don't see any end in this market. It's been a very resilient business even in times of economic challenges people have continue to spend on their pets. So we don't see right now any indicators that that spending per pet will be going down. So I think it remains a strong market as we look to the future and if you look at the urbanization and the emerging middle class and emerging market, we see significant growth there as you add more markets that keep more pets and medicalized like that.
Operator: And we'll go next to Kevin Ellich with Craig-Hallum. Please go ahead.
Kevin Ellich: So one quick one, thinking about African Swine Fever in a different way, down the road when it's time to re-populate the herd, just wondering how much benefit that could bring to Zoetis especially given your presence in genomics and genetics?
Kristin Peck: Sure. If you look at repopulation I mean essentially in China and some of these other geographies will repopulate. We believe when they do more move more to industrialized production and more away from the small backyard farms. We think that does play to the strength of innovative companies like Zoetis so we do see the future of African Swine Fever as it goes down meeting, more technologically based production which we think it will be an increase for us and certainly if we're able to create a vaccine for African Swine Fever that will be even more in picture.
Operator: And there appears to be no further questions, I'll return the floor to Juan Ramon for closing remarks.
Juan Ramon Alaix: Thank you very much and since this will be my last earnings call, I want to thank you all of you for the support you have given to me and Zoetis over the last seven years. It has been an amazing journey and I'm very proud of the value that we have been created. I know that you will enjoy the same ongoing commitment to our valuable provision from Kristin, Glenn and the rest of our leadership team and the data as I think into the next phase of growth. In closing, I remain confident in a brighter future of Zoetis. This company and its people have the capabilities, experience and customer focus to continue delivering a world-class for our customers and our shareholders. Thank you very much.
Operator: And this will conclude today's program. Thank for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-08-06 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Second Quarter 2019 Financial Results Conference Call and Webcast for Zoetis. Hosting the call today is Steve Frank, Vice President of Investor Relations for Zoetis. The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, it will not be forwarded automatically. In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call via dial-in or on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for your questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions]. In the interest of time, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and then queue up again with any follow ups. Your line will be muted when you complete your question. [Operator Instructions].  It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.
Steve Frank: Thank you, Keith. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Zoetis second quarter 2019 earnings call. I am joined today by Juan Ramon Alaix, our Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn David, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements, and that actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statements in today's press release and our SEC filings, including, but not limited to, our Annual Report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q. Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release, and then the company's 8-K filing dated today, August 6, 2019. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange.  With that, I will turn the call over to Juan Ramon.
Juan Ramon Alaix: Thank you, Steve and good morning everyone. Our second quarter results demonstrate that many of the competitive advantages that have made Zoetis the world leader in animal health. We have been able to deliver steady and reliable financial results for our investors since 2013, consistently growing our revenue factor in the market and growing our adjusted net income faster than revenue each year.  It is our track record driven by lead innovation, a diverse and durable portfolio and a clear strategy that begins and ends with our customers, their success and the health of their animals.  Over the last few years, we have consistently brought new innovation to market from our R&D labs, most notably, in dermatology, parasiticides and vaccines, with products like APOQUEL and CYTOPOINT, Simparica, REVOLUTION PLUS and Stronghold Plus and values new vaccines in our Fostera, Suvaxyn, and Vanguard product lines.  We invest significantly in our productive R&D and rely on the support of our commercial manufacturing and supply chain initiatives to maximize the growth of our products and services. We also invest internally and externally to maintain the most diverse and durable portfolio in the animal health industry. This approach has helped us perform well even in the face of shifting weather patterns, changing market conditions, and the impact that emerging businesses have on our customers. Recent external investment in diagnostic nutritionals and digital solutions keep us evolving in line with market trends, while enhancing the integrated solutions we offer to our customers, at the same time, better supporting our medicines and vaccine portfolio. This consistent performance made possible by the outstanding talented and dedicated Zoetis colleagues that execute our plans and growth strategies.  Turning now to our financials, we continued our strong performance through the first half of the year, with 14% operational revenue growth in the second quarter. Diagnostic sales from the Abaxis acquisition accounted for 5 percentage points of that overall growth. Our companion animal portfolio is continuing its positive momentum with 22% of operational revenue growth based on diagnostic sales from the Abaxis acquisition, strong sales of our key dermatology drugs and parasiticides.  As we anticipated, livestock product sales returned to growth in the second quarter up 3% operationally, with increases across all species. Poultry products led the way growing 15% operationally and this was partially offset by more modest growth in the fish, cattle and swine which was impacted by African Swine Fever in China.  As we indicated last quarter, African Swine Fever remains a major factor for the overall industry growth in 2019. An industry forecast expects the animal health industry to grow around 4% compared to 5.6% in 2018. We believe our diverse portfolio across species, geographies and therapeutic areas will help us once again to grow revenues faster than the market in 2019.  In terms of profitability, we grew our adjusted net income by 17% operationally in the second quarter and generated our highest gross margin ever.  Looking at the rest of the year, we are confident in our latest innovation and core business to generate the growth. And we have increased our full year guidance for 2019 based on the positive momentum of our companion animal portfolio, and to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of portfolio exchange rates.  As we look ahead, we are making good progress with innovation and investment that will generate our future growth.  In July, Zoetis received a positive opinion from the European Medicines Agency for our three-way combination parasiticide for dogs. This addition brings Zoetis and veterinarians one step closer to offering pet owners a new choice in the prevention of heartworm disease and lungworm, while also treating fleas and ticks and gastrointestinal worms. We look forward to a final decision from the European Commission later this year.  Regulatory reviews for the three-way combination are also underway in the U.S., Canada, Australia, Brazil and Japan with further submissions expected in China and Mexico this year. If approved, Zoetis anticipates this product coming to market in the first quarter of 2020. Once we have our final label approved, we’ll be able to share more insight on our market expectation for this triple combination product. It is fair to say that we expect this product to be a significant entrant in the more than $4 billion global parasiticide market.  In all parasiticide use, in July, we gained U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of ProHeart 12, the industry’s only one-year injection to prevent heartworm disease in dogs from one year of age and older.  We are steadily building an innovative and fresh portfolio of parasiticides that will give the veterinarians a range of choices for dogs and cats, Simparica, REVOLUTION PLUS, ProHeart 12 and 6 and the anticipated triple combination products once approved will make us even more competitive, enable to challenge today's market leaders in parasiticides. We are sustaining and expanding our portfolio in an area where Zoetis was underrepresented historically.  In the area of monoclonal antibodies, we are the industry leader in innovation with our groundbreaking dermatology product, CYTOPOINT. And we continue to advance our pipeline in other areas like pain. I am pleased to announce that we have filed in the U.S. and EU for a new monoclonal antibody candidate to control pain associated with osteoarthritis in cats and we expect approval in 2021.  To support this new companion animal products coming to our pipeline and to maximize sales of our current portfolio, including diagnostics, we have already added additional sales force resources in international markets and we are beginning to expand our sales force in the U.S.  In the second quarter, on the livestock side, we have expanded our Fostera swine vaccine franchise with approvals of different formulations in new geographies. For example, Fostera Gold PCV MH was approved in Brazil. This vaccine which is now commercially available in the U.S., Canada and several other markets, provides the livestock farmers with greater options and flexibility in protecting pigs from PCV2 and M. hyo. And Fostera PCV, a single dose vaccine that aids in the prevention of PCV2 was approved in China.  We also combined our internal innovation approach with external collaborations. In that regard, we've recently signed an important R&D agreement with the Colorado State University to establish a research lab there. Our teams will explore the livestock immune system and target the discovery of new immunotherapies that could pave the way for alternatives to antibiotics in food production animals. We also continue to support future growth through business developmental activities. In July, we announced plans to acquire Platinum Performance, a privately held nutrition-focused animal health company that is highly regarded in the equine community. Platinum features premium nutritional product formulas and a unique approach to the field of scientific wellness for horses as well as dogs and cats. The expansion in nutritions will further strengthen our portfolio in the equine and pet care markets, and it aligns well with Zoetis, increasing focus on health and wellness as part of the continuum of animal care.  We expect the acquisition to be completed in the third quarter of this year after meeting customary closing conditions. Our plan is to expand the Platinum Performance equine business through our U.S. field force, accelerate the growth in its pet care formulas with veterinarians and pet owners through our digital marketing capabilities and evaluate international expansion opportunities over the long-term.  Finally, in closing, we remain on track for a strong year based on our diverse portfolio. And we are making important progress in key areas such as parasiticides, vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, diagnostics and digital and data analytics, areas where we see both near and long-term growth opportunities.  I will now hand the call over to Glenn. Glenn?
Glenn David: Thank you, Juan Ramon, and good morning. As Juan Ramon said, we delivered another strong quarter growing revenue 14% operationally and adjusted net income 17% operationally.  Based on our positive performance in the first half of 2019, we are increasing our revenue and adjusted diluted EPS outlook for the year. I’ll review updated guidance in more detail after discussing Q2 performance.  Reported revenue growth for the second quarter was 9% including a 5% negative impact from foreign exchange primarily driven by the continued strengthening of the dollar against the euro and Brazilian real. Excluding the impact of the Abaxis acquisition, operational revenue growth for the quarter was 9% with price contributing 4% and volume contributing 5%.  Key dermatology products contributed 2%, other in-line products 2% and new products 1%. All species contributed to growth this quarter with companion animal growth continuing to outpace livestock.  Companion animal operational revenue growth of 22% was driven by legacy Abaxis products, key dermatology product and paracitisides. Excluding the impact of Abaxis acquisition, companion animal grew 14% operationally. Livestock operational revenue growth of 3% is driven by all species including swine despite the impact of African Swine Fever in China.  Poultry was the primary contributor to livestock growth internationally and in the U.S. and international sales of cattle also contributed. Legacy Abaxis products contributed 5% to total Zoetis operational revenue growth in the quarter with sales of $65 million. This represents a decline over the pro forma revenue from the prior year primarily driven by product launches and initial distributor stocking which occurred in the first half of 2018.  We expect improved results in the second half of 2019 with double-digit revenue growth driving full year pro forma growth in diagnostics products. Our focus continues to be on the integration of the legacy Abaxis products into our portfolio allowing us to leverage our innovative offering of diagnostic and therapeutic products and international expansion.  Our key dermatology portfolio continued solid growth this quarter with sales of a $182 million, a 30% operational increase over the prior year. Growth in this portfolio was driven by the ongoing expansion of the addressable market increasing market share, price and additional launches of both APOQUEL and CYTOPOINT into new markets. We expect to exceed $700 million in revenue for this portfolio in 2019.  Other in-line products also contributed strong growth in the quarter including Simparica with $69 million in revenue and 40% operational growth. This growth was partially offset by the ongoing impact of African Swine Fever. New products, including our topical parasiticide for cats REVOLUTION PLUS and Stronghold Plus, our swine combination vaccines and Core EQ Innovator in equine also contributed to drive growth this quarter. Now, let's discuss the revenue growth by segments for the quarter. U.S. revenue grew 15% in the second quarter, companion animal grew 23% while livestock grew 3%. Excluding the impact of the Abaxis acquisition, U.S. revenue grew 9%. Companion animal sales in the quarter were driven by sales of legacy Abaxis products, our key dermatology portfolio, and number of our in-line products, including Simparica, Clavamox, Cerenia and ProHeart 6. Excluding the impact of the Abaxis acquisition, companion animal growth was 13%.  U.S. dermatology sales were $127 million for the quarter growing 27% driven by market expansion, increasing market share and price. Simparica sales in the quarter were $40 million, growing 33% over the prior year. Simparica benefited from promotional investments, leading to increased clinic penetration and market share gains. U.S. livestock sales returned to growth this quarter increasing 3%. Poultry was the primary driver of U.S. livestock growth due to the strong performance of our portfolio of alternatives to antibiotics in medicated feed additives in this fast growing market. Lack of efficacy and supply constraints of competitor products also contributed to growth of our products. Our swine portfolio contributed modestly to growth driven by promotional programs in the quarter. Our cattle products declined modestly this quarter negatively impacted by ongoing dairy market challenges as well as wet weather impacting the movement of beef cattle to feedlots. These market challenges were partially offset by price. Overall, a strong quarter for our U.S. business. Innovation, diversity and consistent field force execution are all helping to deliver positive performance.  Turning now to our international segment. Revenue grew 10% operationally in the second quarter. Companion animal operational revenue growth was 21%, while livestock operational revenue growth was 4%. Excluding the impact of the Abaxis acquisition, international revenue grew 8% operationally. Companion animal product growth was driven by key dermatology products, parasiticides, namely Simparica and Stronghold Plus and the additional legacy Abaxis products. Excluding the impact of the Abaxis acquisition, companion animal growth was 16%.  International livestock also returned to growth this quarter, driven primarily by strong performance of our poultry portfolio, primarily vaccines and medicated feed additives. Our cattle portfolio also contributed to growth resulting from a favorable comparison to the prior year, which was negatively impacted by national trucking industry strike that occurred in Brazil.  Our swine portfolio was flat compared to the prior year with growth in vaccines, including new products, offset by the impacts of African Swine Fever in China. Now, I would like to highlight a few markets in the quarter. Beginning with China, revenue declined 1% operationally, which is strong performance considering the negative impact of African Swine Fever. Our livestock portfolio in China declined 18% operationally. The outbreak of African Swine Fever continues challenging the supply of pork. Latest estimates assume a range of 30% to 70% of the swine herd will be impacted. We now anticipate that full year impact to our swine revenue to be approximately $50 million. We continue to anticipate other regions, primarily Brazil and the EU to increase exports of pork to China. However, the timing and magnitude remains uncertain as it takes time and investment in infrastructure to increase production.  Our companion animal products continued to perform well growing 22% operationally in the quarter. Sales from paracitisides, newly launched APOQUEL and vaccines were the primary drivers of growth.  Moving on to Brazil, sales grew 24% operationally driven by companion animal growth of 36% and livestock growth of 19%.  Companion animal revenue growth in Brazil was driven by paracitisides, primarily Simparica and our key dermatology portfolio. We recently launched CYTOPOINT into this growing companion animal market and are pleased with its performance so far. Livestock growth in Brazil was primarily driven by favorable comparison to the prior year when the national truck driver strike negatively impacted the results. We anticipate an unfavorable impact in Q3 2019 results for Brazil related to the positive impact at the end that the strike had in Q3 2018.  The UK also performed well this quarter with operational revenue growth of 24% with companion animal growing 38% and livestock growing 7%. Companion animal growth was primarily related to our key dermatology portfolio and the addition of legacy Abaxis products. The livestock growth was attributable to increased sales of cattle products.  In Mexico, sales grew 20% operationally driven by companion animal growth of 25% and livestock growth of 18%. This market benefited from key dermatology sales including launch of CYTOPOINT and legacy Abaxis products in companion animal, while livestock growth was related to market conditions driving growth across the product portfolio.  Other emerging and developed markets also continued to perform well this quarter particularly in companion animal and poultry.  Summarizing international performance, we demonstrated continued strength across all species in almost all international markets despite the impact of African Swine Fever. Now moving on to the rest of the P&L, adjusted gross margin of 70.5% increased approximately 180 basis points in the quarter on a reported basis compared to the prior year. The improvement this quarter is primarily related to foreign exchange, price, product mix and unit cost improvements, partially offset by an inclusion of the lower margin legacy Abaxis portfolio.  Total adjusted operating expenses, including the impact of the Abaxis acquisition, grew 12% operationally. The increase is primarily related to the acquisition of Abaxis and increase in certain compensation-related expenses and investments to support future growth of the business.  The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 19%. The decrease in the comparable 2018 period is primarily related to discrete tax benefits recorded in the second quarter, partially offset by the impact of the global intangible low taxed income or GILTI tax which is effective for Zoetis in 2019.  Adjusted net income for the quarter grew 17% operationally through a combination of revenue growth, improving gross margins and a lower effective tax rate. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 18% operationally in the quarter versus the same period in 2018.  Now moving on to guidance for the full year. As a result of our strong growth in revenue and adjusting net income in the first half of the year, we are raising and narrowing our revenue and adjusted diluted EPS guidance. Please note, that guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late July.  I'll now walk you through each of the individual line items beginning with revenue. We're now expecting to deliver revenue between $6.175 billion and $6.275 billion representing 8.5% to 10% operational growth as compared to our previous estimated range of 7.5% to 9.5%. Our organic operational revenue growth, which excludes the impact of Abaxis, is now projected to be between 5.5% and 7%. The increase in revenue guidance is related to the positive performance in our companion animal portfolio, and to a lesser extent, favorable foreign exchange.  We're now projecting adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue to be between 30% and 31% compared to our previous estimate of 31% to 32%. Favorability reflects the improvements in the first half of the year, which are expected to moderate in the second half of the year. We're increasing the low and high end of the range for adjusted SG&A for the year to be between $1.505 billion and $1.545 billion due to increased revenue estimates and promotional investments on key products, primarily in the companion animal portfolio.  As Juan Ramon mentioned, this includes an expansion of our U.S. companion animal field force to support current and future product launches, such as ProHeart 12, our three-way combination parasiticides for dogs and monoclonal antibodies for chronic pain.  We're narrowing the range for R&D expense, now expected to be between $450 million and $465 million. Full year adjusted interest and other income deductions is now expected to be approximately $190 million compared to the previous estimate for $200 million. The additional favorability is primarily driven by the reduction of interest expense, and favorable foreign exchange.  Our expectation for the full year adjusted effective tax rate is approximately 20% compared to our initial guidance of 20% to 21%, primarily driven by the incremental tax benefits from stock-based compensation and other discrete tax benefits recorded in the first half of 2019.  Adjusted net income is now expected to be in the range of $1.7 billion to $1.735 billion, representing an increase of $35 million at the high end of the range reflecting operational increases, as well as favorable foreign exchange.  Based upon our strong performance in revenue and adjusted net income, we're increasing our adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $3.53 to $3.60, compared to our previous guidance, of $3.42 to $3.52. Our range for reported diluted EPS is also increasing, now expected to be in the range of $2.93 to $3.04 based upon operational increases and lower certain significant items.  As I've indicated in the past, we focus on full year performance as quarterly results may fluctuate. To that end, we expect Q3 operational revenue growth to be lower than what we've seen in the first half of the year, due to Abaxis having less of an impact on growth as we lap the acquisition date. Q3 2018 included one month of revenue for international and two months for the U.S., Canada and Latin America.  In addition, we will continue to see market challenges due to African Swine Fever and the weakness in the U.S. dairy and beef sectors. Growth will also be impacted by moderated price increases in the U.S. as well as the recovery of the Brazil truck driver strike and increased revenue in Q3 2018.  Adjusted net income operational growth in Q3 will also reflect higher operating expenses as reflected in the full year guidance to support our current and future products, resulting in moderated income growth. We previously communicated that we expect approximately $100 million in incremental capital expenditure this year to information technology and manufacturing to support our Abaxis acquisition, improve cost efficiencies and increase capacity. We anticipate continuing at this elevated level for the next three years as we invest in manufacturing and infrastructure to support future growth and product launches.  We’ve also repurchased approximately $300 million of Zoetis shares in the first half of the year. We have $2 billion remaining under the multi-year share repurchase plan that was approved last year and remain committed to our capital allocation priorities of internal investments, M&A and returning excess cash to shareholders. Our guidance for reported and adjusted earnings per share reflects the shares repurchased through the end of Q2.  Now to summarize before we move to Q&A, our strong performance in the first half of 2019 continues to underscore the value of our diversity, innovation and durable business model. We’re confident in our revised full year guidance, where we’re increasing operational growth rate for revenue and adjusted net income. And we continue to focus on long-term sustainable growth by investing in our pipeline, including infrastructure to support current and future product launches.  Now, I’ll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Kevin Ellich with Craig-Hallum. Please go ahead.
Kevin Ellich: Juan Ramon wanted to start off with African Swine Fever, I appreciate the update that Glenn gave on the full year impact of $50 million. How much do you think Brazil and the EU and other markets can help to offset the headwinds you’re seeing in China? And then my second question is on Simparica Trio. With the submissions in Canada, Australia, Brazil and Japan, can you give us an update on timing for those markets as well as kind of what you’re feeling about in the EU? Thanks.
Juan Ramon Alaix: Thank you Kevin and let me go through the different questions that you have asked. In terms of the African Swine Fever, we expect minimal impact in terms of additional revenue generated in Europe and other markets this year. As we have explained, it will take some time to build the infrastructure to increase the number of pigs, our potential export to China. We see Europe, Brazil as the main markets for this type of exportation to China but we are not expecting a significant impact of that expansion in 2019. Definitely in 2020, 2021, it will be time for producers to expand their operations and then potentially export to China.  In terms of the submission on Simparica Trio in other markets like Brazil, Canada, Japan, well it's a work in progress. In Canada, we have already filed all the submission. In some other markets, we are now progressing the submission. And we expect also Simparica Trio to be approved in Europe, around September, October. What we got now is favorable opinion from the European Medicines Agency. Now the European Commission is expected to approve the product in September and October. And then we expect that to bring this product into the market in the first half of -- in the first quarter of 2020.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jon Block with Stifel. 
Jon Block : I'm not going to put them all upfront. So first, on the implied OpEx growth in the back half of '19 is about 3.5%. I think that’s what -- you largely lap Abaxis and the increased investments you referenced. So is that a good growth rate to extrapolate going forward? I guess just to push you a little bit on gross margin, your guidance applies a step down in the back part of the year. But why is that the case considering higher margin companions growing faster than livestock? And I think that's unlikely to wind -- unwind, pardon me in the near term. And then quickly, one, Ramon, the filing for pain, and I just want to make sure, I think that was specific to fee line, is that correct? And where would canine be in the process? Thanks, guys.
Juan Ramon Alaix: Jon. So we have filed for cats and we are in the process of filing also for dogs. We expect the product for cats, the monoclonal antibody for cats to be approved earlier than for dogs. And we expect that approval in 2021. And Glenn will cover the questions on OpEx and the growth rate moving forward. 
Glenn David: Yes, so Jon just to start with gross margin and the step down that's implied for the second half of the year. A, first of all, in the first half, there were some items that were particularly favorable in terms of foreign exchange, as well as the 4% price increase that we experienced in the first half. Also, as you look to the second half, you're correct that we would still expect the growth rate for companion animal to be higher in the second half of the year than livestock, the absolute sales though for livestock are higher in the second half of the year, just based on normal seasonality, where in the first half of 2019 we had higher sales of companion animal in terms of absolute sales. So those are the drivers for gross margin.  In terms of the OpEx growth, you are correct that in the second half it would apply a deceleration in operating expense growth because of the impact of Abaxis. I'd also point that we do expect a slight change in seasonalization as well between Q2 and Q4 versus what we might have anticipated last year with a little more expense in Q3. As I sort of implied in the prepared remarks, I would not necessarily take that as guidance for 2020, the second half OpEx rate. Obviously we'll provide that as appropriate once we finish our 2020.
Juan Ramon Alaix: Thank you. Next question, please.
Operator: And we'll go next to Louise Chen with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.
Louise Chen : First question I had was with respect to the Nexvet portfolio. Can you give an update on the development and commercialization timelines for those products? And then second question was on ProHeart 12. Do you still see a place in the market where there’s opportunity despite the launch of the triple combo and why or why not? Thank you. 
Juan Ramon Alaix: Thank you, Louise. The Nexvet portfolio, the monoclonal antibody that we mentioned that we have filed for cats, it’s coming from the Nexvet portfolio, while for dogs we have [multi-dollar] programs and we’ll be really submitting or filing the best of what we think would be meeting the requirements of the market.  And in terms of ProHeart 12, definitely we see opportunities to expand the market with ProHeart 12. Part of the sales will be categorized in ProHeart 6 but also at the same time gaining the share in the heartworm market. And also we need to consider the opportunities of ProHeart 12, also with the future launch of the three-way combination that will be included also in the same indications of ProHeart 12 plus the protection for pigs and fish.  Next question please. 
Operator: Next question is from Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Erin Wright: A couple of questions here. So to support some of the new upcoming product launches you mentioned stepped up hiring activity. I guess where do you currently stand in terms of that effort and how should we think about some of the timing related to that as well as how quickly some of those sales reps can ramp up? And will this hiring continue into 2020?  And then my second question relates to more of the companion animal side. I guess can you speak to the opportunity to leverage the relationships with Chewy and other alternative e-commerce channels, did this meaningfully contribute to growth in the quarter? And more broadly will this become a more significant portion of total sales that go through that channel over time and what sort of pricing mechanisms can you deploy whether it be price forwards or otherwise? Thanks. 
Juan Ramon Alaix: Let me start with the question on Chewy and also some alternative channels. So definitely pet owners are also now buying animal health medicines through these new channels, mainly for medicines for chronic treatment and paracitisides. All products are available in these new channels but always with regarded prescription every time when it’s a prescription product. We definitely see these new channels expand in the market and recent time the opportunity also to increase compliance. So we think that this can be definitely a positive for the animal health industry. And we think that at the same time also we’ll be continuing working with veterinarians to ensure that they remain at the center of any healthcare decisions.  In terms of the field for expansion, I will provide some rational for this expansion and then I will ask Glenn to go into some product details. So just to remember that in recent years we added to our portfolio APOQUEL, CYTOPOINT, Simparica, and all these products are reaching blockbuster sales and without any significant modification in most of the markets in terms of the field force.  Last year with the acquisition of Abaxis we expanded our portfolio to diagnostics. We incorporated the Abaxis field force into U.S. and in 2019 we have been also expanding diagnostic field force in international markets. In 2019 we have continued adding new products in companion animal, REVOLUTION PLUS during the year that, then ProHeart 12 in July and we've expected the launch of the three-way combination in 2020 and in 2021 monoclonal antibodies to manage the payment in cats and in future also in dogs. We have decided that it was needed to expand our field force in the U.S., not only in phase of these new product launches, but also to maximize the current portfolio that now also includes diagnostics. And we expect to adding these additional resources in 2019 and 2020, at the same time, we’re also adding additional expertise, and investment in new distribution channels, and also in direct-to-consumer programs.  Now, I would like now, Glenn, to provide some details of these investments.
Glenn David: Yes, Erin, in terms of the timing for the expansion, really there are two main field force expansions that are undergoing in 2019. One is related to Abaxis and international expansion of diagnostic specialists. And we're largely complete with that hiring as of today. So that investment has already been made. People are in place and we expect to get increased revenue penetration in international markets with that field force now being fully operational.  The other key investments that we’ve discussed with the increase of the companion animal field force in the U.S. We respect those colleagues to be largely hired by the end of 2019. And then to be fully in their new position starting in 2020. So a majority of that investment would also be complete by the end of 2019.
Juan Ramon Alaix: Next question, please. 
Operator: We'll go next to Michael Ryskin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Michael Ryskin : I got a couple really quick ones. One is, you had another quarter of really fantastic price increases, 4%, repeat of 1Q, coming in sort of well above historical trends. I just want to get a sense of this going forward and what's driving it? Is it tied to higher mix of revenues, tied to innovative products like the derm portfolio and Simparica? Or are you taking up price on some of the older generation products as well?  And then also, I was hoping for a little bit more color on Abaxis. You've had some comments down the field force expansion, you talked about how the portfolio is doing. Anything on competitive share shifts or anything new in the pipeline in terms of innovation there? Thanks. 
Juan Ramon Alaix: I will answer Abaxis, and then Glenn will lead to details of the Q2 and also the pricing and also he will provide some comments on the Abaxis performance in Q1, Q2 and what we expect for the future. Let me start saying that we consider 2019 for Abaxis as a year in we are setting ourselves for future growth. We are expanding the field force in international markets. We feel that we have the resources to generate future revenues. We are also integrating the field force in the U.S. with our core field force. And it's something that is already done. And we’re also working to make sure that we have the connectivity with all the equipments with effective management system that we expect to finalize at the end of 2019. We are also -- we have planned that in the first quarter of 2020 we have also integrated all the systems and this will facilitate the integration of the portfolio and offering a much more integrated offer to our customers. So we are convinced that we are now stepping all the elements for our future success and this will be something that will be generating growth in the future as well as the growth in 2019. Glenn, you mind covering the additional comments on Abaxis performance and also the comments on price? 
Glenn David: Sure as I mentioned in the prepared remarks in the first half of the year Abaxis on a pro forma basis did decline versus the same period last year. That was really driven by the fact that Abaxis had two significant product launches last year that resulted in some additional distributor stocking for both the urine sediment analyzer and the Flex4 Rapid Test. That being said in second half of the year we expect to see double-digit growth for the Abaxis portfolio as we’ve seen very positive leading indicators that would support those projections for the second half of the year. We’re seeing less accretion in the U.S. in terms of instrument placements, also stronger instrument sales and we believe that will lead to increased sales of consumables. Also the fact that the international field force is now in place, we’re seeing good momentum to start beginning within our international markets. So we’re expecting double-digit growth in Abaxis revenues for the second half of the year.  In regards to price in the first half versus the full year, so we typically expect to get price increases of around 2% to 3% in any given year. In the first half of this year we’ve seen price increase of 4%, part of that outsized price is really driven by the fact in Q1 and Q2 of 2018 we had some promotional programs in our U.S. companion animal business that we do not repeat in the first half of 2019. That led to additional price.  All that being said we still expect 2019 to be in the range of 2% to 3% but probably towards the higher end to that range. 
Juan Ramon Alaix: Next question please.
Operator: And we’ll go next to John Kreger with William Blair. Please go ahead.
John Kreger : Juan Ramon, another question on African Swine Fever. If you think about all the puts and takes that, that outbreak is causing for the worldwide livestock market, what is your early view on how ‘20 might look relative to that 4% global number that you mentioned for this year? Thank you.
Juan Ramon Alaix: Well we expect 2020 go back to normal growth rates even if the situation in China because of the African Swine Fever will be not resolved. We expect still 2020 China continue suffering because of this outbreak. But we see other markets expanding production. And then in terms of comparison through 2019 we expect higher growth in livestock and also continue with the growth for companion animal. So definitely we expect 2020 back to normal growth rate of 5% to 6%. Next question please?
Operator: Going next to David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst : This is [Thomas Chi] on behalf of Dave. So first question is, can you please discuss the triple combo on NexGard Spectra in Europe including its level of success and the differentiation of Simparica Trio? Second question is if you can comment on other new launch opportunities over the next one to two years? And then finally are there any key U.S. products set the stage for new generic competition over the next one to two years? Thank you.
Juan Ramon Alaix: Well as you said, we expect the new combination product in Europe competing with NexGard Spectra. Mainly the incidents of heartworm in Europe is much lower than in the U.S. So the resistances are completely different and the real opportunity for the three-way combination product is in the U.S. and where we expect now to be first to the market, because NexGard Spectra or other competitors are not announcing a launch soon. So, definitely we see a significant opportunity to gain share in the U.S. Also we expect that our portfolio will be even stronger in Europe and this also will have the opportunity to generate growth. In terms of other opportunities in the pipeline, well, I think that we are very pleased with all the products that we are now announcing, the three-way combo, Europe, the U.S. or in other markets, also Canada, Japan, Brazil. We also expect monoclonal antibodies for cats in Europe and the U.S. coming in 2021. And following that we expect also monoclonal antibodies for dogs and definitely we will continue working on bringing new vaccines into the market. So we are convinced that we have a very robust pipeline that will ensure our future growth in line for us in the market. Next question, please.
Operator: And we'll go next to David Westenberg with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. 
David Westenberg : So I just want to talk about the cat market. There's potential for cat APOQUEL and of course pain in cat. The cat is obviously under medicalized compared to dog market. What does it make major education efforts? Can you maybe make what might that look like when that investment might be taking place and just overall how do you how do you expect to increase that medicalization market in education not just in terms of the products that they're in education? And I’ve got a second question on ProHeart 12. We had great feedback at AVMA. Basically, they talked about compliance one-year injections much better than I actually anticipated with ProHeart reception. Is there any fear in kind of cannibalization with 6? I understand the ProHeart -- just ProHeart and the triple is going to have worms but just kind of think about the dynamics for potential cannibalization there? Thank you very much. 
Juan Ramon Alaix: Thank you for the question Dave. So, definitely the cat market is a market that we need to develop. But pain exists in cats and is something that today there are not valid solutions to manage the pain in cats. We know that there are two elements that we need to consider. First, the number of cats is lower than dogs. And also the number of medicalized cats is lower than the number of medicalized dogs. But having said that, we expect the monoclonal antibodies for cats becoming a blockbuster for Zoetis. It will take maybe some years to fully develop the market. But we are convinced that we will be bringing unmet need and opportunity will be a significant. We expect in terms of the ProHear 12 cannibalization from ProHeart 6, but what we see is that now Zoetis will be offering to veterinarians all range of solutions for pigs, fleas and internal paracitisides and will be for the veterinarians also to decide what is best for their dogs to use ProHeart 12 in combination with Simparica to use the three-way combination product or what they think is the best for protecting the animals. So even if there will be cannibalization, I think here what we need to consider is what will be the opportunity of this complete portfolio in terms of parasiticides. Next question please. 
Operator: We’ll go next to Chris Schott with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
Chris Schott: Just two here. Maybe first just coming back to margin trends and the SG&A investment you’re making. Should we think about OpEx growth below sales growth in 2020 and beyond? Or with some of these initiatives that you’re investing in, could we see a year in 2020 where spend looks a little bit more in line with sales growth as we think about kind of just the progression over the next few years? And my second question was on Simparica Trio, I guess at this point, how much of a lead do you expect you will have in the U.S. market before you see additional competition? And how much of a lead do you think you need to really impact share as we think about the -- probably different players line up in the market? Thanks very much.
Juan Ramon Alaix: I will respond to the Trio question and then Glenn will cover the margin trends and also the expenses that we’ll be seeing in future years. And in terms of Trio as you know Chris in our industry there is not too much visibility in terms of the products that our competitors are making in their pipeline. We know that in the U.S. FDA it’s requiring 100% protection against heartworm. We know that so far it seems that the three-way combination of Zoetis is the only one showing this type of efficacy.  Other competitors, maybe they will be also facing some challenge because they have products protecting against ticks and fleas for two or three months and then heartworm with one month and then combining a product with different timing also can be challenging. The timing of competition is unknown to us but we are confident that being first to market will present an opportunity to gain share in the parasiticides segment. Glenn?
Glenn David: In terms of the investments that we’re making in the field force, first, I just want to say that these are very positive investments that have a very strong return. So we’re investing in field force to support the existing products that are exceeding our expectations and a significant number of new products that are coming out in the future, those are very high return investments. So we would expect those to be margin accretive over time as we move into 2020. 
Juan Ramon Alaix: Next question please. 
Operator: Next is Liav Abraham with Citi. Please go ahead.
Liav Abraham : Just a follow on question on your three-way combination parasiticide. Juan Ramon, any preliminary thoughts on what the launch curve could look like particularly in the U.S. of this product and how quickly uptick could be? And then secondly, interested in some additional comments on the poultry market, you cited that this has contributed to growth in your livestock segment in the quarter. Interested in your longer term outlook for poultry and some of the drivers behind this? Thank you.
Juan Ramon Alaix: Liav, so on the three-way combination product, it's probably a little bit too early to define the uptake efforts. We need to ensure that we have clarity on the labels, and it is something that is still work in progress. One, we have the label. And then we also have the exact timing of the launch. We will provide that maybe how much we expect adoption of this new product into the market and is it going to be launching in January and February or March. So it is something that still we don't have a certainty of the timing of the launch. And also, we need to still get the approval of the final label.  Poultry, it's an area that has been performing too well for Zoetis. We expect that poultry will continue -- for market segment will be continue growing faster than the average of the animal health industry and will be growing in line with this growth. For us, poultry, it's an area in where we are investing also in R&D. And we expect to bring new products into the market starting in 2020. That will be new vaccines with vector-operated technology that initially will be released in the U.S. and then later in European markets and all international countries. And definitely, it will be a surface of four categories in the world.  And as we see the consumption of animal proteins continue growing, consumers will need to move maybe two more chicken, even more beef, and maybe at least in some countries like China, some limitations in terms of pork consumption. But definitely pork is an area of investment. We have very strong portfolio of vaccines. And again, so we will be planning to launch vector vaccines in 2020 or 2021.  And finally, we are also combining our presence with medicated feed additives with vaccines, also with a very strong portfolio in terms of devices. We have the Inovoject, which is something that has highly significant value in the hatchery and other another segments of poultry and we also introduced products for automation in 2018 and 2019.  Next question. 
Operator: Next is Kathy Miner with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.
Kathy Miner : A couple questions. Glenn, could you give us some APOQUEL sales for the U.S. versus OUS this quarter? And on African Swine Fever, could you also tell us what the second quarter impact was? And if there's any update on the vaccines that you're working on for the swine fever? And then finally just a bigger picture question. I wonder if we could get your thoughts on some of the U.S.-China trade discussions. Understand it’s very volatile but what are some of the possible impacts or situations you're looking for that could be impacting Zoetis? Thank you. 
Juan Ramon Alaix: So let's answer the question on APOQUEL. And then we'll move to African Swine Fever and …
Glenn David: Yes, so just for the numbers for APOQUEL. I'll start with total derm just to give you overall total derm breakout between U.S. and international. So total derm globally we had a $182 million, a $127 million within the U.S., $55 million in international. At APOQUEL we had total global sales of a $133 million, in the U.S. $87 million and international $45 million. Obviously there’s some rounding there. 
Juan Ramon Alaix: And the impact of African Swine Fever?
Glenn David: The impact of African Swine Fever in the quarter was a little over $10 million for the quarter. 
Juan Ramon Alaix: Okay so then in terms of the update of the African Swine Fever. We expect that there’ll be some opportunities for other markets as to supply to China. We also expect that -- we’re not expecting a new vaccine for African Swine Fever soon but we are working on developing this vaccine in collaboration with the U.S. and other international centers. And in terms of trade, we see trade impacting agriculture in the U.S. We have seen also that China would not be buying pork from the U.S. But it’s also true that they will be buying from other markets and maybe other markets also will be buying from the U.S. So we are not at this point too much concerned about the impact of the trade in the pork industry. The pork industry has been very limited in terms of exportation to China. I think it’s something that is less than 20% of the total exportation of pork to international markets and to China. So definitely it’s an impact but it’s an impact which is manageable. But we expect and we hope that finally the U.S. and China will sign an agreement that will eliminate all these tensions. Next question please?
Operator: Next is Mavin Jacob with UBS. Please go ahead.
Prakhar Agrawal: This is Prakhar Agrawal on behalf of Mavin Jacob. My first question is on gross margin. So you’d previously guided on gross margin expansion of 200 basis points from 2017 to 2020 and you’re obviously tracking significantly ahead of that guidance already despite of Abaxis. So just wondering if there is an update to that guidance and is it possible to get greater than 70% gross margin over the next three to five years? And secondly on the macro trends in the U.S. cattle. Could you provide more color on some other trends that you’re seeing? You had that continued weakness in dairy and beef cattle. But when do you expect recovery in these segments? Thank you.
Juan Ramon Alaix: So let’s start with the gross margin. Glenn?
Glenn David: In terms of gross margin, the 200 basis points improvement that we referenced from 2017, that was driven by the operational efficiency initiatives and some changes in our supply network that we were initiating. We are on track for that and expect to deliver the 200 basis point. At that time we said there’d be other factors that either positively or negatively impact gross margin over that same period. Those factors being price, mix, foreign exchange. Many of those have moved favorable for us particularly this year and those factors will vary year-over-year. So I would necessarily take some of the benefits that we’ve gotten this year from price mix and foreign exchange necessarily to carry over into the future years.  So we’re well on track for the 200 basis point improvement that we targeted as far as the operational efficiency initiative and some of the other factors have been beneficial for us in 2019. 
Juan Ramon Alaix: When I look at the macro trends in the U.S. for cattle, we're expecting dairy prices to increase in the second half. It will probably take a longer, so we continue seeing weaknesses in the dairy business coming forward. It will be something that over time will be adjusted. Now they will be adjusting production and then in the next cycle prices will be increasing and then the opportunity for again the expansion.  In terms of beef in the U.S., there are two elements that have been impacting the performance. And first has been the weather, very cold winter. And then second, very wet spring. And this has been delaying the movement of animals from pasture to the feedlot. And there are moving animals which are heavier, heavier animals also are stronger in terms of protection against diseases. And we see that with the cattle market in their efforts been slower than expected. We expect some recovery in the second half. Although we expect that in the U.S., the cattle will be showing a very modest growth. And Zoetis will be growing in line with this growth. Next question?
Operator: Today's last question is a follow up from Kevin Ellich with Craig Hallum. Please go ahead. 
Kevin Ellich: Juan Ramon, wanted to get your thoughts on the alternative protein market, the plant-based market. Do you think that'll have any impact on the livestock production market over the next three, five, 10 years?
Juan Ramon Alaix: I don’t' believe that this will have an impact. The growth of population, the increase on the middle class, it’s increasing so much at the demand that it will be needed many different sources of feeding the population to meet that demand. And this will be as we have seen in other cases an alternative for people that prefer not to eat animal proteins, but still the demand for the consumption of poultry, chicken, beef, eggs, dairy will remain very strong. And I will also add fish to this list. So I don't expect that the animal health industry will be impacted because of this alternative. But this will -- definitely will offer to consumers options for their diet, which in my opinion is always that positive. 
Juan Ramon Alaix: So thank you very much for joining us today. Well as I said, we had very strong quarter. We have also increased our guidance, which is showing the confidence that we have in the performance of our portfolio. And additionally, we also share with you the good news of our pipeline and how this pipeline will be reaching to market in the next coming years. Thank you very much for your attention. 
Operator: And this does conclude the Zoetis second quarter 2019 earnings call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-05-02 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the First Quarter 2019 Financial Results Conference Call and Webcast for Zoetis. Hosting the call today is Steve Frank, Vice President of Investor Relations for Zoetis. The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, it will not be forwarded automatically. In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call via dial-in or on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for your questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.
Steve Frank: Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Zoetis first quarter 2019 earnings call. I’m joined today by Juan Ramon Alaix, our Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn David, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements, that actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statements in today's press release and our SEC filings, including, but not limited to our Annual Report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q. Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and in the company's 8-K filing dated today, May 2, 2019. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. With that, I will turn the call over to Juan Ramon.
Juan Ramon Alaix: Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. I will start today by describing some of the dynamics in the animal health industry that are on Investors minds. First, is a positive strength for spending an innovation in companion animal medicines and treatments. Pet owners spending in the U.S. continued to rise in terms of our revenue per visit and number of patient medicines. And we also see positive trends for our pet care in the rest of the world. Pet owners are willing to spend their income on medicines, vaccines, and other treatment to ensure a longer and better quality of life for their pets. We believe Zoetis is well-positioned to continue success in the companion animal space as our portfolio of dermatology products, parasiticides, and vaccines continue to drive our growth. Second, we see economic pressure, and other challenges continue to impact dairy and cattle producers in the U.S. We still, however, expect to see the U.S. cattle and dairy market growing for a full-year, driven by stronger domestic demand for beef and increasingly optimistic outlook for beef and dairy export and a modest improvement in milk prices. Finally, African Swine Fever has made headlines about significant concerns for the pork market. It is impacting producer in China with some reports saying that as many as 150 million to 200 million pigs or up to 30% of their annual food supply will be lost due to the outbreak. For context, that is more than the U.S. annual core production. This situation has far-reaching implications for the global pork supply chain. The reduction in supply in China is making the pigs more valuable, creating opportunities for greater export from other countries, and increasing consumption of other products. The situation will evolve through the year, clearly monitoring any effect on the overall market and our business, which show an impact in the first quarter. This type of outbreaks, unfortunately are part of doing business in animal health. This year, we are facing issues with African swine fever. A few years ago, we built with PEDV with avian flu, and before with Bruton disease. These challenges are why Zoetis has built a diverse portfolio of best-in-class products across all relevant species and geographies. A more aggressive opportunities and manage through economic cycles, these things outbreak and integral weather conditions. We congregated in February that we expected the overall industry to grow approximately 5% for the year, excluding the impact of foreign currency. Now, because of African swine fever, we think the animal health industry will have a lower growth rate in 2019 and will continue to assess the broader impact of African swine fever as the year progresses. Despite some of these temporary challenges, we are maintaining our guidance for operational revenue growth. Excluding Abaxis, 4.5% to 6.5% for the full-year, which we expect to refractor than the growth of the animal health market. Turning now to our first quarter results. We are off to a solid start for the year with 11% operational revenue growth being driven by our companion animal business. Revenue from the Abaxis acquisition accounted for 5 percentage points of the overall 11% growth. Our sales in companion animal products are once again leading the way with 27% operational growth based on the addition of sales from Abaxis, as well as our parasiticides and key dermatology portfolio. Our livestock products sales declined [3%] operationally due to challenge in certain cattle and swine markets. For the first quarter, we grew our adjusted net income by 18% operationally, and adjusted diluted EPS by 19% as we benefitted from a strong revenue growth and a significant increase in gross margin, due to pricing, our favorable product mix and cost improvements. Glenn will provide more details on our first quarter performance in his remarks. Our results once again confirm the importance and value for growth and innovative portfolio in the animal health industry, and we remain confident in our performance and outlook for the full-year. Looking ahead, we continue to invest in advancing our pipeline, ensuring careful market launches of new products and furthering the integration of Abaxis this year. Since our last quarterly earnings announcement, we have seen key companion animal products, including Cytopoint and Simparica for dogs, and Revolution Plus for cats continue to gain approvals in markets outside the U.S. Our Core EQ Innovator, the first and only combination vaccine to offer protection against five core equine diseases, was also approved in Canada. Last week, Zoetis received approval for Apoquel in China, one of Zoetis’ largest companion animal markets and we expect to launch the product there within the next three months.  On the livestock side, we launched Clarifide Plus for Jersey cattle in the U.S., this is the first genomic test for this breed that provides a direct indication about the genetic risk factors for seven of the most common and costly adult cow diseases. In terms of our R&D pipeline, we still anticipate launching this year a new injectable parasiticide formulation to protect dogs against heartworm for up to 12 months pending FDA approval. Our new three-way combination parasiticides, composed of Simparica and two other active ingredients still in regulatory review in the U.S. and with European Medicines Agency. Reviews are also underway in Canada and Brazil with further vision expected in Japan, China, and Australia this year. If approved, we anticipate this product will come into market in 2020. We also continue working on new monoclonal antibodies to manage pain in dogs and cats and dermatology for cats. Those programs are progressing and we’ll keep investors informed of future finding in this area. We feel very positive about the benefits, this treatment can provide to greater compliance, convenience, and efficacy for different species. In the case of other research or livestock, I would point to our programs in vector vaccine technology for our poultry. Research into promising new classes of antibiotics and our growing investment in diagnostics, genetics, devices, digital and data analytics technology that can be used in applications like precision livestock farming. Additionally, we have vaccine programs to address current and future emerging diseases, which has been a growth driver for our industry in the past. We also maintain a comprehensive portfolio of approximately 300 product lines for Zoetis and we invest significantly each year on life cycle innovation that keep those products competitive and growing.  Finally, we are making good progress on the integration of Abaxis. We remain positive on the point-of-care diagnostic market. Given this strong global growth prospect as well as the critical growth, these diagnostics play in the vet clinic. We are excited about the strength of the Abaxis portfolio and the way our field force is representing it to customers around the world. Our U.S. imports has been working to drive greater growth through new lead generation for diagnostics. In international markets, we have nearly completed staffing and training of our expanding diagnostic team, implemented a new customer service model across these markets and view this as a greenfield opportunity for future growth. We are pleased with our progress to-date and we continue to view 2019 as an important year for the integration and platform setting, enhancing certain product and customer experiences and developing more progress essentially for customer solutions that leverage our new diagnostic assets. Including our first quarter results, once again, demonstrate the stability and the diversed strength of our portfolio in a dynamic animal health industry. We are executing on our strategies for growth across the continuum of care with new products and solutions that help our customers, predict, prevent, detect and treat diseases in animals while navigating the evolving trends in animal health. And we are investing and making important progress in key areas such as dermatology, but I think besides diagnostic, digital and data analytics, where we see both near and long-term growth opportunities. Thank you for joining us today, and I will now hand the call over to Glenn. Glenn?
Glenn David: Thank you, Juan Ramon and good morning. As Juan Ramon noted, 2019 is off to a solid start. Operational revenue growth was 11% and operational adjusted net income growth was 18%. Reported revenue growth for the first quarter was 7% with a 4% unfavorable impact in foreign exchange, driven primarily by currency depreciation of the Euro and Brazilian Real.  Excluding the impact of the Abaxis acquisition, operational growth for the quarter was 6%. Included in the 6% growth is, 4% price, and 2% volume. Volume growth includes contributions from key dermatology of 2% and new products of 1%, which were partially offset by declines in other in-line products of 1%. Companion animal demonstrated continued strength this quarter with legacy Abaxis products, parasiticides and key dermatology products leading the growth with positive contributions from all key markets. Meanwhile, livestock declined in the quarter based upon declines in sales of Medicaid feed additives and challenges like the African swine fever outbreak in China. Our overall results in the first quarter continued to demonstrate the value of the diversified portfolio with double-digit operational growth despite the declines in swine and cattle. Legacy Abaxis products contributed 5% to total Zoetis' operational revenue growth in the quarter with sales of $61 million. As a reminder, the acquisition of Abaxis was completed in the third quarter of 2018, so sales from legacy Abaxis products are incremental in the first half of 2019. The revenue this quarter represented a decline over the pro forma revenue from the prior year. This decline is primarily driven by new product launches and initial distributor stocking in the first quarter last year. We continue to expect full-year growth in diagnostics products as we focus on improving customer experience, connectivity to practice management software and international expansion. Our key dermatology portfolio comprised of APOQUEL and CYTOPOINT, also continued to contribute to growth this quarter with sales of $155 million, a 30% operational increase over the prior year. New products, including Revolution Plus and Stronghold Plus as it's called internationally. PCV combo vaccines in swine and Core EQ Innovator in equine were also growth drivers in the quarter. Revolution Plus, a topical parasiticide for cats builds upon the sarolaner compound that is found in Simparica. The product launched in the US this quarter and in 2017 internationally and is off to a great start supporting strong growth in the Revolution-Stronghold line in the first quarter. The decline in other in-line product volume was related to the timing of cattle product purchases in the U.S., African swine fever in China, the divestiture of certain agribusiness products in Japan, which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the implementation of stricter commercial and pricing policies in Brazil. The agribusiness is historically seasonal with a disproportionate sales in the first quarter. These declines were partially offset by the continued strength of Simparica now captured in the in-line product category, which generated $48 million in global sales this quarter, representing operational growth of 61% over last year. Now, let's discuss the revenue growth by segment for Q1. U.S. revenue grew 13% in the first quarter. Companion animal grew 30% and was partially offset by a 7% decline in livestock. Excluding the impact of Abaxis acquisition, U.S. revenue grew 8%. Companion animal sales in the quarter were driven by sales of legacy Abaxis products, in-line products, including our key dermatology portfolio and Simparica and new products, including Revolutions Plus. Excluding the impact of the Abaxis acquisition, companion animal growth was 20%. U.S. dermatology sales were $104 million for the quarter, growing 26%, driven by market share gains, price, and investments in direct-to-consumer advertising, which continue to expand the market. Simparica sales in the quarter was $25 million, growing 40% over the prior year.  U.S. livestock declined 7% driven by cattle and swine. Cattle was impacted by the timing of Medicaid feed additive purchases and they are continuing to face headwinds while producer profitability remained low. Swine was impacted by the discontinuation of a promotional program for our premium products and the timing of medicated feed additive purchases. The declines in cattle and swine were partially offset by another strong quarter for poultry, driven by growth of alternatives to antibiotics in medicated feed additives. Despite the decline this quarter, we continue to anticipate U.S. livestock will grow for the full-year. Turning now to our International segment. Revenue grew 7% operationally in the first quarter. Companion animal operational growth was 23%, while livestock declined 1% operationally. Excluding the impact of the Abaxis acquisition, International revenue grew 5%. Companion animal product growth was driven by continued expansion and uptake of key dermatology products, the addition of legacy Abaxis products, strong Simparica sales, and growth in China. Excluding the impact of the Abaxis acquisition, companion animal growth was 18%. Livestock declines were driven by the impact of African swine fever in China and the divestiture of certain agribusiness products in Japan, which were partially offset by growth in poultry, fish, and sheep. The complete quarterly results of our top 11 international markets are provided in the tables included in our earnings release, but I would like to highlight a few items for the quarter. The UK had operational revenue growth of 16% in the quarter with companion animal growing 21% and livestock growing 11%. Companion animal growth was primarily related to legacy Abaxis products and increased sales of key dermatology products and Simparica. Livestock benefited from increased market share in agricultural vaccine in the quarter. In Australia, sales grew 10% operationally driven by companion animal growth of 15%, and livestock growth of 6%. This market benefited from key dermatology, legacy Abaxis products and Simparica and companion animal, while livestock growth was related to key brand performance in cattle. In Brazil, sales grew 1% operationally, driven by companion animal growth of 43%, partially offset by livestock declines of 13%. Companion animal revenue growth in Brazil was driven by parasiticides, primarily Simparica and continued strength of Apoquel. Livestock declines in cattle for Brazil related to the strengthening of our commercial and pricing policies, which impacted short-term results. We anticipate these policy updates will strengthen our long-term opportunity in this market. Overall market dynamics remain positive as does our full-year outlook. Moving on to China, we had a challenging quarter with revenue declining 2% operationally. Livestock declined 28%, driven by challenges in swine. African swine fever is having a greater than expected impact as the outbreak has worsened in China, reducing the size of the swine herd. We continue to expect other regions, primarily the EU, Brazil and the U.S., to increase exports of pork to China to meet domestic consumer demand. We also anticipate growth in other proteins, although to a lesser degree. Companion animal remain strong, partially offsetting the livestock decline with operational growth of 38% driven by continued growth of vaccines, parasiticides and an expansion of the field force in China, allowing us to capitalize on this fast-growing market. As Juan Ramon mentioned, we're also very excited about the launch of Apoquel into this important market. Other emerging and developed markets also continued to perform well this quarter, particularly in companion animal. Summarizing international performance, continued growth of key dermatology products, the addition of legacy Abaxis products, and diversity across our portfolio, all contributed to a solid quarter despite challenges in livestock. Now, moving on to the rest of the P&L. Adjusted gross margin of 70.2% increased approximately 270 basis points in the quarter on a reported basis, compared to the prior year. The improvement this quarter is primarily related to price, favorable product mix, foreign exchange and unit cost improvements, partially offset by the inclusion of the lower margin legacy Abaxis portfolio. We do anticipate a more normalized gross margin in the second quarter as both price and mix impact will moderate. Total adjusted operating expenses, including the impact of the Abaxis acquisition grew 8% operationally. The increase is primarily related to the acquisition of Abaxis and an increase of certain compensation-related expenses. We are anticipating higher expenses in the second quarter, primarily related to the timing of promotional investments for our key products, the timing of R&D project spend, and the Abaxis integration. We are continuing with direct-to-consumer advertising and promotional campaigns in the U.S. that support our key dermatology and parasiticide products with our highest expenses occurring in Q2 and Q3. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 18.8%. The increase from the comparable 2018 period is predominantly related to the impact of the global intangible low taxed income or GILTI tax, which is a provision of the U.S. tax reform, that’s effective for Zoetis in 2019. Our expectation for the full-year adjusted effective tax rate is consistent with initial guidance, which is between 20% and 21%. The favorability in the first quarter is primarily driven by the tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Adjusted net income for the quarter grew 18% operationally through a combination of strong revenue growth, favorability in gross margin, and moderated growth in operating expenses. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 19% operationally in the quarter versus the same period of 2018. Now, moving on to guidance for the full-year. Beginning with revenue, we are decreasing both the low end and high end of the range by $75 million to reflect the impact of foreign exchange. As I noted on the fourth quarter call, U.S. dollar strengthening was something we will be monitoring, and additional USD strengthening has occurred since we set guidance.  We’re now projecting revenue between $6.1 billion and $6.225 billion, while maintaining operational revenue growth of 7.5% to 9.5% over 2018. Our organic operational revenue growth, which excludes the impact of the Abaxis acquisition, is projected to be between 4.5% and 6.5%, consistent with the guidance provided in February. Adjusted cost of sales as a percent of revenue is still expected to be in the range of 31% to 32%. As I noted earlier, there were some favorable drivers in the first quarter that we expect to moderate through the remainder of the year. We are decreasing the low and high-ends of the range for adjusted SG&A for the year to be between $1.45 billion and $1.5 billion, due to the impact of foreign exchange. Moving on to R&D. We expect 2019 expenses to be between $445 million and $465 million, consistent with the guidance provided in February. Full year adjusted interest and other income deductions is now expected to be approximately $200 million compared to the previous estimate of $220 million. The favorability is largely driven by a reduction in interest expense. Our adjusted effective tax rate for 2019 is expected to be within the range of 20% to 21%, consistent with previous guidance, and we are still projecting adjusted net income in the range of $1.65 billion to $1.7 billion, maintaining 8% to 11% operational growth. With a more limited foreign exchange impact on the bottom line, as well as the benefits of the actions we've taken to reduce interest expense, we continue to expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $3.42 to $3.52, consistent with previous guidance. Our range for reported diluted EPS of $2.79 -- $2.93, however, is a reduction of both the low and high-ends of the range based upon increased certain significant items, primarily due to a change in estimate related to inventory costing impacting the first quarter. Finally, I'd like to remind you that our quarterly results may fluctuate and our focus continues to be on the full-year. As I've already noted, we anticipate lower gross margin and higher operating expense in the second quarter, which will impact adjusted EPS. The full-year impact of the Abaxis acquisition will also continue to have a disproportionate impact on the P&L until we pass the acquisition date in the middle of the third quarter. Finally, foreign exchange will continue to negatively impact the P&L in the second quarter with an impact of approximately 300 basis points to revenue growth. Now, to summarize before we move to Q&A. Our first quarter results continue to demonstrate the value of our geographic and product diversity with operational revenue growth of 11% and operational adjusted net income growth of 18%. We continue to see strength in our companion animal portfolio to drive the year's results and expect growth in livestock for the full-year. And we remain committed to delivering on our full-year operational growth rate for revenue and adjusted net income, demonstrating the durability and consistency of our business. Now, I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Erin Wright: Hi, thank you. Can you discuss a little bit how the Abaxis integration is progressing here relative to your internal expectations? It was a little lighter than what we thought in our Abaxis model and is that just the distributor dynamic, and I noticed that the GAAP acquisition related cost takes a little bit higher, is that all attributable to Abaxis and where we stand with it as the key implementation? And then the second question is on international livestock, just given some of the dynamics around African swine fever and what you called out in Brazil, can you speak to how we should think about that quarterly progression over the course of the year? Thanks.
Juan Ramon Alaix: Thank you, Erin. Let me answer the question on Abaxis, and let me first say that we are pleased with the progress that we're making with the integration of Abaxis. The team in the U.S. is already working well, maybe not fully integrating the two portfolios because we mentioned that these have full integration, we need also to work with the integration of SAP. And related to the implementation of SAP for Abaxis, we have decided to move the implementation from August-September to February, because we want our IT team to focus on working on the connectivity of all equipment of Abaxis. We think that this connectivity that we expect to penalize by the end of the year will help us really to have that much more support to diagnostics and offer full integration or full connectivity of the diagnostic equipment to the practice management system. We’re also pleased with the progress that we are making in International markets. We have now almost completed all the hiring process for reps and also for technical support. We have also said the customer service that would help in really to provide the support to diagnostic customers. So, in general, we are progressing very well. We continue – very excited about the quality of the portfolio of Abaxis, and we are very confident that Abaxis will represent a significant growth opportunity, especially from 2020. Now we see 2020 – 2019 as a year where we are integrating, we are fixing some of the things that we have to identify from the previews Abaxis model, and we are very confident that the projections that we have for this portfolio will be very positive. In terms of the international livestock, let me provide a comment on Brazil and then I will ask Glenn to go into more details on what we expect for the rest of the year in the total livestock performance. In Brazil, we see that the market that continue growing very fast. It's a very strong growth for Zoetis. So, the growth in companion animal is above market growth, so we are growing very fast. In cattle, we decided to change some of our commercial policies, including prices, and we saw as expected some negative reaction from distribution. This had an impact in the first quarter for Brazil, especially in cattle, but we are convinced that these changes will help us in generating better future growth and improve the profitability of our cattle operations in Brazil. So, we remain very convinced that Brazil will be a growth driver for Zoetis, and we are investing to support this growth on that. Glenn, do you mind to provide more details on the International livestock?
Glenn David: Absolutely. Erin, just also to your question on Abaxis and the Q1 performance you referenced, distributor stocking. So far, we talked about the performance in Q1 2019 to Q1 2018. In Q1 2018, there was stocking with the introduction of the new products in terms your settlement analyzer and Apoquel rapid test, that did pose a challenging comp between Q1 2019 and Q1 2018. In terms of the international livestock performance, as Juan Ramon said, for livestock internationally we declined about 1% this quarter, driven by the factors that we discussed in terms of African swine fever, as well as the impact in Brazil. We would expect to return to growth in Q2, and that growth to accelerate in Q3 and Q4.
Juan Ramon Alaix: Thank you, Glenn. Next question, please.
Operator: We'll go next to Louise Chen with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.
Louise Chen: Hi. Thanks for taking my question here. So, I wanted to ask you about your temporary weakness in livestock and when do you expect that to subside this year and then return to growth, and how much of that is macro versus company specific? And then maybe just if you could talk a little bit more about this MSA buyer pattern? Thank you.
Juan Ramon Alaix: Well, as we said that in the first quarter, we faced two impacts in terms of the temporary weakness in livestock. One was the cattle business in the U.S. was affected by different factors. And talking about the market, the market declined. We saw that the movement of animals was below expectations. In many cases, driven by weather conditions, but we are optimistic about the cattle business in the U.S. moving forward, the demand for beef is positive, and also the exports are increasing. Additionally, we expect also in the second half of the year a small increase on the price of the milk also that will help the total cattle business in the U.S. As many times we mentioned, I think it is difficult to analyze our business in a quarterly basis. There are fluctuations based on buying patterns and promotional activities weather conditions that maybe it's important to understand the business on a yearly basis. We remain confident that the livestock market will be growing at the end of the year. What we are expecting is that the poultry will be growing in line or slightly ahead of the market. In terms of swine, we expect going lower than the market, and mainly because of the African swine fever. But we expect having a temporary impact, but maybe from a third or fourth quarter and definitely in 2020, we expect a significant recovery because many markets outside of China will expand the production that will generate a significant growth. And finally, with the cattle, we also expect that for the year overall growing – we expect growing in the U.S., we expect also growing international markets, but growing below expected market growth.
Glenn David: And in terms of the timing of the MSA purchases in the U.S., that's really related to the timing of our annual price increases. So, in 2019, we align the timing of our MSA price increases to be in sync with the rest of our portfolio, which is in January, that led to some additional sales in Q4 of 2018 that then destocked in Q1 of 2019. So that is not an impact that we would expect to see as we move forward through the rest of the year.
Juan Ramon Alaix: Next question, please.
Operator: We'll go next to Kevin Ellich with Craig-Hallum. Please go ahead.
Kevin Ellich: Good morning. Hi, Juan Ramon. Just have a couple of questions here. Companion animal continues to be really strong. You're seeing really good growth out of obviously the dermatology portfolio, but also Revolution Plus for cats compared to the dogs, could you talk about what areas you're focused with the product development, maybe more on the feline side in the areas that are being medicalized. Also timing for the monoclonal antibody products. And then Glenn, on the SG&A and operating expenses, clearly there were some favorability this quarter. And you talked about increased spending, DTC campaign in Q2. Could you give us a little bit more color on that? Thank you.
Juan Ramon Alaix: Kevin, we see the current portfolio still showing opportunities for growth. We see opportunities for growing the parasiticides now with Revolution Plus. We still see that Simparica continues gaining momentum in the U.S. and also international markets. Apoquel and CYTOPOINT are growing and we expect to continue growing. We expect to continue growing in the U.S. and also expect to continue growing in international markets. And now, we have the addition of Apoquel in China, that also will support this growth. We are also very confident that this growth is steady for the long-term, because as we said, the current portfolio continue growing, but we expect also to introduce Simparica or a combination of products – three-way products in 2020, that also we expect that to continue generating growth. In the future, we are not at this point providing any details of when we expect that monoclonal antibodies to be in the market. But definitely we see opportunities in reline with pain. We see opportunities also in feline with dermatology, again with monoclonal antibodies, and always with monoclonal antibodies in dogs for pain. And we are very confident that the R&D machine will continue bringing innovation to the market in companion animals, but also in livestock. We have products for both companion animal and livestock that will support growth in 2020, 2021, also 2022. So, we are very confident that we have a pipeline that will maintain growth that will be in line or faster than the market. And Glenn will respond the question on G&A.
Glenn David: Kevin, in terms of the operating expenses. So, just for the quarter, our operating expenses grew about 8%. If you back out Abaxis, operating expenses grew around 3%, compared to our revenue growth of 6%. So, pretty much in line with our overall expectations over an extended period of time. That being said, we did have some favorability in R&D expenses in terms of the timing as well. So, as we move through into Q2 and Q3, we'd expect elevated expenses in Q2 and Q3 as that is the time frame in which our DTC promotions, particularly in the U.S. around our dermatology portfolio and Simparica to kick in at a higher level. And we'd also expect some elevated expenses in terms of our R&D as well.
Juan Ramon Alaix: Next question, please.
Operator: We'll go next to Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Michael Ryskin: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. A couple – I want to dig deeper on some of the moving pieces in the quarter both on the livestock markets in the U.S. and internationally. If I sort of go through some of the items you called out African swine fever, the spend, divestment, looking at your revenues by geography, I think I can estimate that ASF may have had a $5 million to $10 million hit in the quarter. The Japan divestment is somewhere in the same ballpark as well. So, I want to get a sense of if that's the right way to think about it? And then is that the similar run rate you would expect for ASF going forward? And then the other one would on the U.S. livestock business. You talked a little bit about the distributor relationship in the stocking in 4Q, but just trying to get a sense of the magnitude of that impact in the first quarter versus the rest of the feedlot pressures as well, so we could plan the phase through the course of the year? Thanks.
Juan Ramon Alaix: Thank you, Mike. I will make a general comment on the African swine fever. Then Glenn will go to the details of your questions. So, first, the African swine fever definitely is having a significant impact in China, and we also have an impact in our results. We mentioned that probably up to 30% of pigs would be lost on 150 million to 200 million. And as a reference, in the U.S., production is 120 million per year. But it's also true that in China, the market share of multinational company is only 10%, 90% is products sold by local companies. We definitely see a significant issue in China, mainly for the business in China cattle, so we see that the other countries, the U.S., Brazil, European markets will increase significantly the production of pork to meet all the demands of the Chinese consumers that are definitely for a significant period of time. There will be seen a shortfall for producing in China. And it seems outside of China, we have a significant market share in swine. In the medium and long-term, we see that as an opportunity to generate growth in swine and also maybe an impact in poultry and to a minor extent also to beef. Because in the end, the consumption of animal products in China will remain and export markets will supply products to meet that demand in the markets. And then Glenn will go through the details of the impact on African swine fever in the quarter and also the Japan agro business and also the U.S. impact of the value.
Glenn David: So, Mike, specific to your questions, for ASF and Japan, you mentioned the range of $5 million to $10 million. So, what I'd say, ASF is probably at the high end of the range for the quarter and Japan is probably at the low end of that range for the quarter. In terms of U.S. livestock, obviously we did have the impact in Q1. It's a little above that $5 million to $10 million range that you referenced with the bigger portion of that being cattle.
Juan Ramon Alaix: Thank you, Glenn. Next question, please.
Operator: The next question is from Jon Block with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Jon Block: Pardon me. Thanks guys, good morning. I've got two long ones. Maybe I'll try to break it up if it's okay with you. The first one is triple or Simparica Trio, any updates on how the filing or interaction with the agency is proceeding? and I'm just curious in your ability to fulfill demand in the early days, obviously with Apoquel there were challenges post launch although, I know some of that was sort of the reliance on a third-party manufacturer. So, any color would be helpful. And then I'll ask a quicker follow up. Thanks.
Juan Ramon Alaix: Thank you, Jon. And we have provision with the discussions with the FDA. We have completed out all the sections of the filing and it's just now the normal process of question and answers. We are confident that this year it's strong and it will be approved by the FDA, but always something that is not depending on us but on the regulators. But one of the challenges that we discussed in the past is that we needed to demonstrate 100% efficacy on how we have to provide these data. And we are confident that – probably that will be approved and ready to be launched in 2020. And definitely we try to learn from previous challenge or issues or mistakes, and definitely in the case of the three-way products, we secured enough active ingredients to be ready for launch the product, as soon as the product is approved. So, we are not expecting any challenge in terms of supplying the market or the demand. Next question.
Operator: We'll go next to David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
David Risinger: Thank you very much. So, I have three questions, please. First, with respect to U.S. companion growth this quarter, could you just give us the figure, the percentage ex-Abaxis? Second, how should we model livestock sequentially in the second quarter? I just don't have a good feel for how we should think – thinking about the livestock business sequentially in 2Q in the U.S. and ex-U.S. And then, one little tidbit, with respect to the revenue guidance reduction of 1%, was that solely related to FX or was there also some modest impact elsewhere? Thank you.
Juan Ramon Alaix: Thank you, Dave. And Glenn will cover these three questions.
Glenn David: Sure. So, just in those questions. In terms of our revenue growth excluding Abaxis focused on companion animal, so globally our companion animal business grew 27%. Without Abaxis we still grew extremely strong at 19% globally. In the U.S., the number was – with Abaxis we grew 30%, excluding Abaxis we grew 20%, and internationally companion animal grew 23%. Without Abaxis, we grew 18%. So, really strong organic growth within our U.S. companion business. As we mentioned earlier, in terms of the livestock growth sequentially, when you look at it globally, we did decline 3% this quarter in terms of livestock business on an operational basis. We do expect to return to growth in Q2, and we expect that growth to accelerate throughout the year. In terms of the guidance, we reduced the guidance for both the low and high end of the range by $75 million, that was purely due to FX. There were significant movements at the time from when we set guidance. When we set guidance back in February, we were using rates as of late January, and when we set guidance now, we're using rates as of the end of – towards the end of April, and that had a significant movement, so the movement was purely due to FX.
Juan Ramon Alaix: Thank you. Next question please.
Operator: And we'll take the next question from John Kreger with William Blair. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi. This is [indiscernible] on for John Kreger. So, just a quick question surrounding the dermatology portfolio. When you just think about like the penetration rates specifically in the U.S. right now, where do you guys kind of think that is? And then when you think about the international growth in the dermatology portfolio for the rest in 2019 and beyond, where do you guys foresee that going? And then just when you think about them individually, so Apoquel and CYTOPOINT, have they trended – have they trended well, compared to your expectations and are you seeing that's having like a strong preference for one or the other products? Thanks.
Juan Ramon Alaix: In terms of penetration for dermatology portfolio, I think it's – it's about – in terms of patient, about 59% and it's something that probably – 63%, sorry, it's the total patient share, which is based on and we still see opportunities first to continue expanding the market and we will be starting now in the second quarter campaign – detectable tumor campaign. We set two objectives, one it's expanded market. And also, second is set to continue building brand equity for Apoquel. We see also that these investments are also having a positive impact on CYTOPOINT. We expect dermatology portfolio to continue growing. We expect also to grow faster in international markets than in the U.S., but in the U.S., we still see a positive momentum, and how much is the preferential CYTOPOINT or Apoquel? In that respect, I think we leave veterinarians to decide what is the best for their patients, the pets. And we are not trying that to promote Apoquel in favor of CYTOPOINT, and CYTOPOINT in favor of Apoquel. We are covering all the spectrum of needs in terms of treating dermatology issues, itching in dogs, and that we see that there is [indiscernible] cannibalization, but also CYTOPOINT has been growing the market and helping us increase this franchise. Next question please.
Operator: We'll go next to with Kathy Miner with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.
Kathy Miner: Thank you. Good morning. I've two questions. First, could you just provide a little more clarification on your comments about the impacts of the African swine fever on Zoetis, and I appreciate that over time there is going to be a greater demand for the proteins or will see other regions pick-up some of the supply? Can you just help us understand why that's medium to long-term and why shouldn't we see some of those dynamics sooner, particularly as supply needs to pick-up in some other countries? And my second question is on Apoquel. First, could you give us the breakdown between CYTOPOINT and Apoquel sales of 155 million you gave us before? And also, in Apoquel in China, could you give us a sense of the market size, is it similar to the EU5 or U.S. and is CYTOPOINT also under review in China? Thank you.
Juan Ramon Alaix: Thank you for all the questions, Kathy. So, let's go back to the African swine fever and the potential impact. We mentioned that we expect that up to 30% of pigs can be blocked because of the African swine fever in China. So, if we translate this 30% to our revenues in – so we can also estimate that it will be about 30% of our revenues. Although we expect a little bit lower impact because of maybe sophisticated farms are less affected by the African swine fever, then the production of small farms. We expect that that it will be an immediate impact in terms of the value of the pigs. As a reference, in the last quarter, in the fourth quarter of 2018, producers in the U.S., they were losing $20 per pig, now they making $30 profit per pig. So, the value of the pigs has increasing significantly, and then their willingness to spend and to keep these pigs healthy and productive also will increase. So, we expect that that will be a positive impact, an immediate positive impact. Then, we expect also that the farmers or producers in U.S., Brazil, European Union will increase production. The cycle of the production is six months. But probably we will need to wait six months to see some impact because it will increase the production. And even that if it takes six months from birth to slaughter, I think we can start using products at earlier stage of the animal. So, we expect in the third and the fourth quarters of this year having a positive impact in the swine business in Brazil, U.S., and U.S. market. And moving into the details of Apoquel breakout, Glenn, do you mind answering that? And also, probably those projections in China and providing some context.
Glenn David: Sure. So, in terms of the total derm revenue, we had $155 million in total sales for the quarter with growth of 30%. To the earlier question, in terms of penetration, U.S. had $104 million in sales and international had around $52 million. So, as the similar amount of medicalized dogs in the U.S. is international, we would expect more rapid growth from international greater penetration over time internationally. The breakout of $155 million between Apoquel and CYTOPOINT. We had $119 million of sales of Apoquel with 22% operational growth, and we had $36 million of sales in CYTOPOINT with 65% operational growth. In terms of Apoquel in China, we’re very excited about the launch of Apoquel in China, China is one of our largest and fastest growing companion animal markets. Just to put in context though, the overall potential market size. So, in 2018, Apoquel globally in all of our international markets, including the U.S., have less than $160 million in sales with our top market internationally generating sales of just below $30 million. So that should give some overall context in terms of the potential of Apoquel in any given international large companion animal market.
Juan Ramon Alaix: Thank you. Next question please.
Operator: And we'll go next to Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Chris Schott: Great. Thanks very much. Just two questions, maybe first on Simparica Trio. Just a little bit more color about how were thinking about the launch of these new triples, how quickly they'll be adopted. Should we be thinking about these as products that could have significant year one uptake or is this a more gradual kind of three to five-year process as these roll out? The second question, I know it's been touched on a little bit, but your companion business, particularly in the U.S. companion business were particularly strong in the quarter and above recent trend, just elaborate a little bit more on what you're seeing here, and if there's anything with either one-time related or either kind of year-over-year timing related in terms of the strength we saw this quarter. Just trying to get a sense of how much of this is just really healthy organic kind of underlying growth versus timing issues? Thanks so much.
JUAN RAMON ALAIX: First, starting with the combination of product for parasiticides. Well, their options, I think we expect their options would be fast and also will depend. If we are number three, number two or number one in the market, but definitely we see a need for the market to combine internal and parasiticides mainly in dogs. And we are confident that we have significant opportunity to generate growth in 2020, 2021 and also 2022, because we think that that is – this probably will have a long run, and definitely the opportunity is really to generate our growth in companion animal. And Glenn will talk about the U.S. companion animal growth in the quarter and the trends for the future.
Glenn David: Yes. So, what I would say Chris is, the overall global compatible growth was very strong. When you take out the impact of Abaxis, we grew 19%, 20% in the U.S., 18% internationally. So, both segments growing very rapidly in companion animal, and those are driven just by strong underlying dynamics and trends, particularly around the derm portfolio around Simparica and also really strong performance of Revolution Plus. Q1 of 2019 was the launch of Revolution Plus in the U.S., it's off to a very successful start. There is some stocking in Q1 of 2019, particularly in the U.S., but still the start that we're seeing in Revolution Plus is very, very encouraging.
Juan Ramon Alaix: Thank you, Glenn. Net question please.
Operator: And we'll go next to Greg Fraser with SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Greg Fraser: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. This is Greg Fraser on for Gregg Gilbert. As [indiscernible] that as livestock business was impacted by destocking related consolidation in the distributor space, that's something that you've observed, I wasn't sure of your comment on distributor purchasing patterns, which related to what they described, and just a quick follow-up on the livestock commentary, are you anticipating growth for international for the full year? Thank you.
Juan Ramon Alaix: Probably we still have some challenge with distribution in Brazil, but not in the U.S. In Brazil, I mentioned that we have these changes in the commercial policies that reviews sales to distribution during the quarter. But as I mentioned, we expect that this will support more quality growth in the future, but no changes in the distribution in the U.S. So, Glenn, do you want to add comments here?
Glenn David: No, just to your question on livestock growth for the full year. We still are expecting livestock to grow globally in the U.S. and internationally.
Juan Ramon Alaix: Thank you. Next question please.
Operator: We will take today's final question from Navin Jacob with UBS. Please go ahead.
Prakhar Agrawal: Hi. This is Prakhar Agrawal on behalf of many Navin Jacob. Two questions, please. First, on poultry, your growth in poultry products was quite strong. So, could you give more color on what is driving that in terms of the near-term trends and anything specific from your product portfolio? And secondly, one of your competitors recently made an acquisition that included some oncology products, so is Zoetis making an R&D investment in oncology and do you think this market is commercially attractive? Thank you.
Juan Ramon Alaix: I will ask Glenn to answer the question on poultry and then I will cover the oncology part of the question.
Glenn David: So, from a poultry perspective, we continue to perform very well in poultry. Overall, very solid growth, higher than the rest of our portfolio livestock, and really that's driven by our portfolio of alternative to antibiotics in poultry that we continue to perform very well within the MSA sector. So that's something that's been consistent for us over the last number of quarters and trend that we expect to continue.
Juan Ramon Alaix: And on oncology, we have already a product in oncology. She is working well, which is a [indiscernible]. We launched this product some years ago. We continue assessing the oncology market, then definitely we have some programs – internal programs related to monoclonal antibody and some of the products such that still oncology is very limited by market although maybe in the future it will be a potential attractive market. But today, it's a quietly with that opportunity. And I think, that concludes the questions, and thank you very much for joining us today. And as we said, we remain very confident about the outlook for 2019 and we are maintaining our operational growth, and we are also maintaining our target in terms of adjusted net income. Thank you very much for your attendance.
Operator: And this will conclude today's program. Thank for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2018 Q4  (2019-02-14 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Fourth Quarter and Full-year 2018 Financial Results Conference Call and Webcast for Zoetis. Hosting the call today is Steve Frank, Vice President of Investor Relations for Zoetis. The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, it will not be forwarded automatically. In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call via dial-in or on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for your questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.
Steve Frank: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Zoetis fourth quarter and full-year 2018 earnings call. I am joined today by Juan Ramón Alaix, our Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn David, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements, that actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statements in today's press release and our SEC filings, including but not limited to our Annual Report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q. Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and in the Company's 8-K filing dated today, February 14, 2019. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. With that, I will turn the call over to Juan Ramón.
Juan Ramón Alaix: Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. Our 2018 results once again confirm the strength of our business and our leadership in the animal health industry. We delivered another year of strong performance and executed on investment plans to continue to strengthen our portfolio across the continuum of care. Our successful innovations, the high quality of our manufacturing, our best-in-class field force and the diversity of our portfolio has been driving our steady revenue growth over the years. Since we became a public company in 2013, we have consistently grown revenue faster than the market and this revenue performance has been achieved, while significantly improving our profitability, with our adjusted EBIT margin, increasing from 24% in 2013 to 35% in 2018. In 2018, we delivered our sixth consecutive year of operational revenue growth, 10% overall, with organic operational growth of 8%, which excludes the revenue related to our Abaxis acquisition. In terms of organic revenue drivers, we achieved our strongest growth in our dermatology portfolio, vaccines and parasiticides. Meanwhile, our anti-infective and medicated feed additives show modest growth and this was because of regulatory changes around the use of antibiotics in animal products. For the second year in a row, our broad base of about 300 product lines generated operational revenue growth across all our core species and major markets. We expect our 2018 organic growth to once again outperform the market and deliver our value proposition of growing in line with or faster than the animal health market. We also increased profitability faster than revenue growth for the full-year, growing adjusted net income by 31% on operational basis, consistent with our value proposition. This improvement was driven by higher revenue, improved cost structure and tax reform. In 2018, we achieved other important milestones that will support our future growth and success. Apoquel, our largest product by revenue, achieved $464 million in sales in 2018, an increase of 28% from 2017. We added two new blockbusters to our portfolio in 2018, bringing our total number of products with more than $100 million in annual sales to 12. Our oral parasiticide Simparica and our monoclonal antibody or dermatology Cytopoint, each exceeded $100 million in sales for the first time, with $158 million and $129 million in annual sales, respectively. We also introduced critical new lifecycle innovations that keep our portfolio updated and competitive and support the durability of our major global franchises. For example, Fostera Gold PCV MH, our latest swine vaccine was introduced in the U.S. and Canada to provide greater options and flexibility in protecting pigs from diseases. We also built on the sarolaner compound in Simparica to develop Revolution Plus, a topical parasiticide for cats that was recently approved in the U.S., Japan and Canada, combines two ingredients, sarolaner and selamectin, and it’s already marketed in the European Union as Stronghold Plus. All these new products and lifecycle innovations demonstrate the actual return on our investments in R&D. We also took important steps to expand our manufacturing capacity. In the U.S., we enlarged our production facility for poultry vaccines in Charles City, Iowa and our expansion in Kalamazoo, Michigan is progressing ahead of schedule. With the first commercial batches of oral solid dose medicines expected to be delivered to customers by the middle of 2019. Outside the U.S., we expect to complete the construction of our vaccine manufacturing facility in Suzhou, China by the end of 2019. And we acquired a facility in Tallaght, Ireland, to help increase the supply of our market leading bovine sealants that help protect cows from mastitis infections. During the year, we made our largest acquisition to date purchasing Abaxis for $2 billion in the fast growing point-of-care diagnostics space. We see diagnostics as an important area to growing our portfolio and with a tremendous growth opportunity ahead, especially in international markets. We also acquired Smartbow, where it's sensor technology and monitoring systems, which will be essential to our expansion in precision livestock farming, and other digital and data analytic solutions that are emerging in animal health. And we returned excess capital to our shareholders. In December, we announced a $2 billion multi-year share repurchase program and the increase of our quarterly dividend by 30%. Looking ahead in 2019, we will continue investing to generate short and long-term growth. We'll support our key dermatology and parasiticide products with direct-to-consumer advertising and promotional campaigns, through advanced penetration and launches in new markets. In the U.S., we'll be launching two new products in our companion animal business. Revolution Plus, the topical parasiticide for cats that I mentioned before, has launched this quarter, and pending FDA approval this year, we would expect to launch a new injectable formulation to protect dogs against heartworms for up to 12 months. In terms of R&D, our pipeline remains very strong and we expect to see more progress in 2019. Potential filings for new products and continued market expansions of major products like Cytopoint, Simparica, and Apoquel, which is expected to launch in China this year. In 2019, we'll continue our work on new monoclonal antibodies to manage pain in dogs and cats, as well as for dermatology in cats. We are making good progress with our research products and we feel very positive about the potential these type of treatments offer for greater compliance, convenience and efficacy for different species. This remain an area to watch as we invest further internally and we build on our partnership with Regeneron in this space. As I have mentioned in previous communications, the application for our new three-way combination parasiticides, composed of Simparica and two other active ingredients, has been filed in the U.S. and with European Medicines Agency, and if approved, we still anticipate coming to market in 2020. Additionally, we'll be investing more in research for diagnostics, devices, digital and data analytics technologies that can be integrated with our core portfolio of medicines and vaccines. Diagnostics for livestock has a promising long-term opportunity, and areas such as sensor technology, monitoring systems and other digital application for animal health will be receiving more investment. In terms of our deeper commitment to diagnostics, we look forward to a full-year of selling a more robust portfolio of point-of-care diagnostic instruments, consumables and test kits. We are seeing a great progress with integration of the legacy Abaxis that's imposed in the U.S. And outside the U.S., we are building the infrastructure, sales and technical teams needed to support our diagnostic portfolio. Moving to market creation for 2019. We expect the overall industry to grow approximately 5%, excluding the impact of foreign currency. The swine market, companion animal market and poultry are all expected to be somewhat in line with the market growth. The cattle market growth is expected to be more limited based on the challenging market conditions for beef and dairy customers. For Zoetis, we expect to grow faster in the market for companion animal and swine based on our new products and to grow in line with the poultry and cattle market. We announced our full-year 2019 guidance today and we are expecting organic operational revenue growth of 4.5% to 6.5%, excluding a three percentage point contribution from Abaxis. Operational growth for adjusted net income is expected to be in the range of 8% to 11%. In 2019, we are committed to invest in net profits to generate short and long-term growth while returning excess capital to shareholders. In conclusion, our strong performance in 2018 is based on our diverse portfolio, our leadership innovation and customer experience across the entire cycle of care. In 2018, we have invested to support the growth of our core business as well as evolve in spaces like diagnostics, devices, digital and data analytics. We expect to build on this strategic approach to our growth in 2019 while delivering on the full-year guidance. With that, let me hand things over to Glenn, who will provide more details on our 2018 fourth quarter results and full-year 2019 guidance.
Glenn David: Thank you, Juan Ramón, and good morning, everyone. As Juan Ramón noted, we had another exceptional year in 2018 with strong performance in both revenue and adjusted net income. Revenue exceeded our guidance and adjusted net income was in line with the high-end of our range. We expect our 2018 organic growth to again outperform the market once industry figures are finalized, delivering on our value proposition of organically growing revenue in line with or faster than the market and growing adjusted net income faster than revenue. Revenue for the full-year 2018 was $5.8 billion with both reported and operational revenue growth for the year at 10%. Excluding the impact of the Abaxis acquisition, operational growth for 2018 was 8%. Of this 8%, 3% comes from price and 5% from volume. Included in the volume growth are contributions from our key dermatology portfolio of 2%, new products, including Simparica of 2% and in line products of 1%. Adjusted net income for the full-year was $1.5 billion, representing reported growth of 29% and operational growth of 31%, driven by revenue growth, gross margin improvement and a lower effective tax rate. In 2018, we grew our business operationally, across all core species, therapeutic areas and major markets. Our key dermatology portfolio and Simparica continued to grow and gained additional market share, both in the U.S. and international. For the full-year, we recognized combined revenue of $593 million for Apoquel and Cytopoint. This portfolio continued to grow rapidly in 2018 and is well positioned for future growth heading into 2019. For livestock, our diverse portfolio of products drove growth across both developed and emerging markets capitalizing on industry trends of higher protein consumption and improved productivity. Turning to the fourth quarter, reported revenue growth was 7%, which includes a negative 4% impact from foreign exchange. Currency depreciation in Brazil continued to be the largest driver of the unfavorable foreign exchange impact in the quarter. Operational revenue growth in the quarter was 11%. Excluding the impact of Abaxis acquisition, operational revenue growth was 7%. Of this 7%, 3% comes from price and 4% from volume. Included in the volume growth are contributions from our key dermatology portfolio of 2% and new products including Simparica of 2%. Q4 represents the first full quarter of Abaxis-related revenue being included in Zoetis results. We recognized $65 million from legacy Abaxis products contributing 4% growth to overall Zoetis in Q4. These results included destocking of wholesaler inventories in U.S. as we normalized wholesaler inventory levels to be consistent with the rest of our business. New products, including Simparica, Stronghold Plus and PCV combo vaccine were also growth drivers in the quarter. Simparica generated $32 million in global sales this quarter representing operational growth of 90% over last year. Equine's CORE EQ Innovator, the first and only vaccine to contain all five core equine disease antigen also launched in 2018 and it helped to drive operational revenue growth of 12% in equine for the quarter. Our key dermatology portfolio, comprised of Apoquel and Cytopoint, also continued strong performance this quarter with sales of $156 million, a 25% increase over the prior year. Adjusted net income for the quarter grew 21% operationally driven by revenue growth, discrete other income items and a lower effective tax rate. Now let's discuss Zoetis segment revenues for Q4. Beginning with the U.S., revenue grew 14% in the fourth quarter, including 6% growth due to legacy Abaxis products. Including the impact of the Abaxis acquisition, companion animal grew 26%, while livestock grew 3%. Companion animal sales in the quarter were driven by sales of legacy Abaxis products, our key dermatology portfolio and new products, including Simparica. Certain in-line products decline due to competitive pressure partially offset these increases. Excluding the impact from the Abaxis acquisition, companion animal growth was 14%. Key dermatology sales were $110 million for the quarter with both Apoquel and Cytopoint exhibiting significant growth over the prior year. Simparica also had another positive quarter with U.S. sales in the quarter, nearly doubling over the last year. Revenue growth continued due to increased clinic penetration and market share resulting from our field force selling efforts. Partially offsetting growth in our companion animal business were declines in RIMADYL and CLAVAMOX due to anticipated competition. The U.S. livestock business delivered growth across all species in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, this growth comes off a strong fourth quarter in 2017. In the cattle business, we continued to see challenges in both the beef and dairy segments. However, growth was primarily due to higher sales of premium products as well as competitive supply constraints in the quarter. In poultry, the Zoetis portfolio of alternatives to antibiotics in medicated feed additives, continued to be a solid contributor to growth as we saw additional market expansion of no antibiotics ever production. Overall, the U.S. demonstrated another strong quarter with growth across all species. Turning now to our International segment. Revenue grew 5% operationally in the fourth quarter, including 1% growth due to Abaxis legacy products. Including the impact of the Abaxis acquisition, companion animal operational growth was 14% and operational growth in livestock was 2%. As a reminder, international markets faced a headwind of four fewer calendar days this quarter resulting from the change in our accounting calendar implemented this year. Full-year operational revenue growth of 9% was not impacted by calendar days and provides a more accurate indicator of international performance. Companion animal product growth was driven by the addition of legacy Abaxis products, new products such as Simparica and Stronghold Plus, our key dermatology products and increased medicalization rates in key international markets. Livestock growth was driven by poultry, swine and fish, while cattle was relatively flat in the quarter. The complete quarter and annual results of our top 11 international markets are provided in the table included in our earnings release, but I would like to highlight a few items for the quarter. In Brazil, sales grew 8% operationally with companion animal growing 22% and livestock growing 4%. Companion animal revenue in Brazil benefited from growth in vaccines due to improved supply and key products primarily Simparica and Apoquel. Livestock benefited from damp weather condition, which increased the use of cattle parasiticides as well as expanded usage plan on vaccines, which helped drive premium pricing. Moving onto China, we had another great quarter growing revenue 16% operationally, largely due to continued growth of companion animal products, primarily vaccines and parasiticides. Canada grew 10% operationally with balanced growth between companion animal and livestock. Companion animal growth was driven by the inclusion of Abaxis legacy products as well as growth in Apoquel. Livestock benefited from sales of new products and swine and strong performance of key brands and cattle. Other emerging markets also performed well in the quarter. Summarizing International performance. The addition of Abaxis legacy product, continued growth of new products and diversity across our portfolio, all contributed to another solid quarter for our International segment, despite the impact of fewer calendar days. Now moving onto the rest of the P&L. Adjusted gross margin of 66.4% decreased approximately 250 basis points in the quarter on a reported basis versus the prior year. The decline this quarter is primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, a full quarter of Abaxis related revenue included in our results and increased inventory charges. The declines are partially offset by strong revenue growth and continued cost improvements and efficiencies in our manufacturing network. The Q4 margin is not indicative of the gross margin we anticipate going forward. Total adjusted operating expenses, including the impact of the Abaxis acquisition, grew 15% operationally. The increase is primarily related to the acquisition of Abaxis and additional spend in R&D, including investments in monoclonal antibody for chronic pain and other pipeline programs. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 17.3%. This tax rate is significantly lower than the rate from the comparable 2017 period due to the favorable impact of U.S., tax reform and discrete items recognized during the quarter. Adjusted net income for the quarter grew 21% operationally through a combination of strong revenue growth, favorability in other income and a lower effective tax rate. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 25% operationally in the quarter versus the same period of 2017. Our income growth and balance sheet discipline have enabled us to continue increasing operating cash flow. Inventory improvements are one area I'm particularly pleased with, having decreased months on hand since 2016 by more than two months. The current level of less than nine months on hand is consistent with industry standards and we expect we will continue around this level going forward. The significant improvement in inventory has released approximately $300 million of cash from our balance sheet since 2016. Now moving to guidance for 2019. We are committed to our value proposition of growing revenue in line with or faster than the market and growing adjusted net income faster than revenue. Before I get into the specific numbers, please note that you can find our guidance table included in the press release as well as the investor slides. Also note that all foreign exchange impact is based upon exchange rates as of late January. In 2019, we are projecting revenue between $6.175 billion and $6.3 billion, reflecting operational revenue growth of 7.5% to 9.5% over 2018. Foreign exchange is expected to reduce revenue growth by approximately 1.5%. Our organic operational revenue growth, which excludes the impact of the Abaxis acquisition, is projected to be between 4.5% to 6.5%. In addition to Abaxis legacy products, our key dermatology portfolio and new products will be strong contributors to growth in 2019. From a species perspective, we expect companion animal to grow to faster rate than livestock, driven by the Abaxis acquisition, continued growth in our key dermatology and parasiticide portfolios, increased medicalization rates in emerging markets and market dynamics, including growth in per pet spending. From a geographic perspective, U.S. and International markets will contribute balanced growth. Adjusted cost of sales as a percent of revenue is expected to be in the range of 31% to 32%. The expected improvement over 2018 is driven by price increases and manufacturing cost reductions, partially offset by the impact of the Abaxis acquisition and currency movements. We expect adjusted SG&A for the year to be between $1.47 billion and $1.52 billion. We anticipate foreign exchange to reduce growth by approximately 1% on a reported basis. Operational growth in SG&A reflects a full-year impact of the Abaxis acquisition as well as investments in our diagnostics international field force and technical service teams. We'll also continue to fund strategic investments that has demonstrated a strong return including direct-to-consumer advertising for Apoquel and Simparica. Moving on to R&D. We expect 2019 expenses to be between $445 million and $465 million. Consistent with 2018, we have committed to an increase over 2018 in R&D spending to ensure we're well positioned to capture future short, medium and long-term growth opportunities in critical spaces. These spaces includes a new combination of parasiticides, monoclonal antibody therapies for pain in cats and dogs and new vaccines for poultry. We'll also continue to invest in the next wave of diagnostic innovations, building on our existing Zoetis and newly acquired diagnostic platforms to ensure we're delivering best-in-class point-of-care diagnostic solution. The increase in adjusted net interest expense and other income deductions is related to our 2018 debt offering primarily used to fund the Abaxis acquisition. Our adjusted effective tax rate for 2019 is expected to be within the range of 20% to 21%. The increase over 2018 is related to the impact of favorable discrete non-recurring items in 2018 and the impact of the GILTI tax which is effective for us in 2019. We project adjusted net income in the range of $1.65 billion to $1.7 billion representing 8% to 11% operational growth. While we do not provide specific guidance on cash flow, we anticipate that in 2019, operating cash flow will decline compared to 2018. As mentioned previously, we have significantly decreased our inventory months on hand to be in line with industry norms, which has provided a significant cash flow benefit in the last two years. In 2019, we expect to continue in our current levels of months on hand, and as a result, we will not have the benefit of a working capital release in our cash flow. In 2019, we also expect an incremental increase of approximately $100 million in capital expenditures for information technology and manufacturing to support our recent acquisition, improved cost efficiencies and increased capacity. In terms of our capital allocation priorities, we continue to focus first on internal, commercial, manufacturing and R&D investments, then business development opportunities, and finally returning excess capital to shareholders. We recently announced an increase to our dividend for Q1 2019 of 30% in line with our 2018 earnings growth and we also announced a new $2 billion multi-year share repurchase program resulting our consistent performance, financial discipline and the strength of our business model. Finally, we expect adjusted diluted EPS will be in the range of $3.42 to $3.52. Our range for reported diluted EPS of $2.83 to $2.99 includes purchase accounting, Abaxis acquisition related costs and certain significant items. I'd also like to remind you that while we take a long-term view of our business and prefer to focus on annual rather quarterly results, there are some considerations, I want to point out for 2019 within the quarter. The full-year impact of the Abaxis acquisition will have a disproportionate impact on growth across the P&L in the first half of 2019 and partially in Q3. In addition, foreign exchange will negatively impact growth in the first half of the year by approximately 400 basis points in Q1 and 300 basis points in Q2 in revenue. Now to summarize, before we move to Q&A. 2018 was another strong year delivering topline operational growth of 10% and bottom line growth of 31%, demonstrating once again that Zoetis is committed to delivering on its value proposition. We also remain committed to creating shareholder value, returning more than $900 million to shareholders in 2018, through dividends and share repurchases. We expect to continue delivering on our value proposition in 2019, driven by solid growth in our core business and increased contribution from the legacy Abaxis portfolio of diagnostics products. Finally in 2019, we will continue to invest internally and externally to grow profitably in the short, medium and long-term. Now, I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We’ll take today's first question from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Michael Ryskin: Thanks guys. Appreciate taking the call. Congrats on the quarter. A couple of quick questions. First one, you talked about 5% market growth for the overall industry in 2019. I just wanted to go into that a little bit deeper, because in the past, we've seen something more in the 5% to 6% range. So I'm wondering what you're seeing there, if you could give a little more color on the dairy markets, cattle markets in the U.S., some of the swine issues we're hearing about internationally? And what I'm getting at with this is, what should be our expectation for the in-line portfolio in 2019? You know, if you exclude Abaxis, if you exclude the dermatology portfolio, Simparica, what's the base portfolio doing in terms of volume and price? And then I've got a quick follow-up questions on the margin expansion for 2019.
Juan Ramón Alaix: Okay. Thank you, Mike. I will try to cover some of the questions, and also, I will ask Glenn to provide some additional details on how we can see the growth, the in-line growth in 2019. So I agree that in previous communication, I mentioned that we expect in the market, a growth of 5% to 6%. Then we have seen that the cattle market, especially in the U.S., both beef and dairy has been showing some weakness and we expect that rather than 5% to 6%, now, we are projecting the total market growth of 5%. We still expect that the cattle business worldwide will be showing growth, but definitely growth that will be below this 5%. The rest of the species, as I mentioned in my comments, companion animal, and also swine and poultry will be growing in line or slightly above the market and the only species that we see some market growth below the market will be cattle. Then, moving into the details of the organic growth, as part of our guidance, it's 4.5 to 6.5. And then if Glenn can provide a little bit more details of how much will be price growth and also volume growth and new products?
Glenn David: Sure. So in terms of just the overall breakdown, it's really consistent with our long-term expectations. So price, we would to expect to generate around 2% price this year, we're particularly strong with price at 3% for 2018. Going into 2019, probably more in line with our long-term proposition of around 2%. New products, again consistent, probably 1% to 2% and then the remainder comes from the in-line portfolio. We do consider derm part of the in-line portfolio as it has matured and has been on the market for a number of years at this point. Also in terms of your question on margin expansion, when you look at where we closed 2018, cost of goods sold, as a percent of revenue, was a little over 32%. Our guidance for 2019 is 31% to 32%. And we made significant progress in cost of goods in 2018, improving our cost of goods, as a percent of revenue by over 100 basis points. So that leaves about another 100 basis points to deliver our commitment of improving cost of goods sold as a percent of revenue by 200 basis points by 2020. You'll probably see that spread between 2019 and 2020 that attainment.
Juan Ramón Alaix: Thank you. Next question please.
Operator: And we'll go next to Kevin Ellich with Craig-Hallum. Please go ahead.
Kevin Ellich: Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. So I just wanted to start off on the cost structure. I mean, it looks like some expenses this quarter came a little bit higher than we expected. And then Glenn you made comments about where you think things will line up in 2019 with increased investments in R&D. Can you just talk about some of the moving parts and given how good the year was for you in 2018? Did you pull-forward any expenses or how should we be thinking about that?
Glenn David: So Kevin, in terms of cost of goods, I'll start again. We had significant improvement this year of 100 basis points improvement in cost of goods. For Q4, we did see elevated cost of goods and that was really related to the impact of FX, also Abaxis and higher inventory write-offs in the quarter. Really the Q4 should not be viewed as a run rate for 2019. We have good visibility into our cost of goods, and we're confident in the guidance of 31% to 32% for 2019. As we look into 2019, from an expense perspective, consistent with what we've said, we are making investments in R&D and R&D is growing more in line or closer to revenue. As we do have many projects that we're very excited about in our pipeline that we want to make sure that we fully fund. SG&A, when you look at the operational growth is growing below revenue even with the investments that we're making in Abaxis.
Juan Ramón Alaix: Thank you. Next question please.
Operator: We'll go next to Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Erin Wright: Great, thanks. Can you speak to the underlying performance at Abaxis and how the integration is progressing in the longer term cross-selling opportunity with diagnostic portfolio? And then my second question is on Simparica Trio. Do you think there is a possibility that you're first to market there in that category? And how should we think about your competitive positioning there? And do you still feel confident in the 2020 timeline and do you anticipate one or two review cycles from FDA. Thanks.
Juan Ramón Alaix: Thank you very much, Erin. I will probably start with the comments on the Abaxis integration. Glenn, will also provide some details of Abaxis performance, and then I will also talk about the Simparica Trio. In terms of Abaxis integration, things are progressing in line or even in some cases faster than initially planned. In the U.S., both teams, Abaxis legacy team in the field force and also our teams are already working together. And as we communicated initially, the Zoetis team is already identifying the opportunities and also helping the other team also to identify customers to complete the sales. They will be also engaging, ensuring that we increase the use of consumables and this will be an opportunity for future growth. We are working definitely that in the future we will be, not only the teams that are working together, but also the portfolio will be fully integrated, and this also, it's depending in some of the work that we are doing in terms of the SAP implementation for Abaxis operations that we plan to do it in 2019. In international markets, we're also progressing pretty well. We have almost completed the hiring process of field force and also technical support, but still some positions that will be completed in the next coming months. But this team is already working together with the field force team of Zoetis, generating the demand. In most of the markets, the supply to customers will be still done through third-party distributors. And in 2020, we'll be deciding if we keep distribution or we go direct in some of the markets. But definitely, all the integration opportunities or integration plans are progressing pretty well. We are also working on continue identifying opportunities in terms of R&D and the scenario that also we are integrating the teams of – sitting in Kalamazoo, also in Denmark and Union City. Altogether are defining the future portfolio of Zoetis in both companion animal and livestock. Glenn, do you want to give details of Abaxis performance?
Glenn David: In terms of performance for the quarter for Abaxis, as we mentioned, we had $65 million in sales for the quarter. I want to remind you that Abaxis was on a different accounting calendar. But however, if you do normalize the accounting calendar, that would translate to approximately 8% growth. Again, within the quarter, we did have some destocking to bring Abaxis more in line with our overall levels of inventory with wholesalers. If you adjust for that destocking, the growth for the quarter is double-digit. Also for the year, again if you try to look at it on an apples-to-apples basis, the growth is double-digits for the year with and without the destocking.
Juan Ramón Alaix: Thank you, Glenn. And then moving to triple combo. So let me maybe provide a little bit of a context. So when we launched Simparica as a single agent, we were two or three years behind competitors, Nexgard and Bravecto. Now with the triple combo, it will be first – second to market. But what we did is significantly reduced this gap of two or three years and then we expect that if FDA approval is coming in line with our filings and expectation is to introduce this product in 2020. So given we are second to market, we will be only second with few more different with competitor. We see a significant improvement compared to the situation that we had with Simparica. And with Simparica, we have been able to continue growing that patient share. In 2018, we increased patient share from 13.1 at the beginning of the year to 15.6 at the end of the year. So we are confident that with the efficacy and also the safety profile of Simparica and the future efficacy and safety profile of triple combo, we'll have the opportunity to have significant market share. Next question please.
Operator: And we'll go next to Louise Chen with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.
Louise Chen: Hi, thanks for taking my question. So my question here is, can you talk more about your pipeline as it pertains to the mAbs, livestock diagnostic and aquaculture? When will some of these new products hit the market? Do they have the potential to be blockbusters or an aggregate to be blockbusters? And then just a quick follow-up on the triple combo, is that expected to be a blockbuster product for you as well? Thank you.
Juan Ramón Alaix: I'll start with the easiest question. Thank you, Louise. It's definitely, triple combo is expected to be a blockbuster. Definitely Simparica is already a blockbuster, but we expect also that the triple combo will reach this status. In terms of the rest of the pipeline, definitely there are products for livestock. These products – there are a lot of product that maybe in aggregate basis will represent a significant growth opportunity. But I will not describe these products as probably in livestock as a blockbuster potential. But definitely, it will help us, first to protect the current portfolio, and second, to bring innovation in livestock into the market. In terms of monoclonal antibodies for chronic pain, we expect that this will have the opportunity of being a blockbuster and we are convinced that the monoclonal antibodies for dogs and cats will represent significant opportunity for treating dogs and cats in a different way that is today with NSAID, especially for cats, that there is nothing especially developed for these animals in terms of pain. But we also are excited about the opportunity of developing monoclonal antibody for dermatology in cats. Again, it's an opportunity that we expect that will be coming in the next year and this will strengthen our derm portfolio, also moving another species with monoclonal antibody. Next question please.
Operator: We'll go next to John Kreger with William Blair. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Kaufman: Hi, good morning. This is Jon Kaufman on for John Kreger. So a couple of questions on cattle here, you mentioned premium product sales in the U.S. Is that a trend that you foresee continuing in spite of market weakness? And then internationally, where are we in the cycle and some of the key markets? Looking out beyond 2019, can international growth more than offset U.S. weakness? And what are your expectations for long-term growth in this market? Thank you.
Juan Ramón Alaix: Definitely, the U.S. market for cattle has been driven by our premium products. But some of our products, they face competition during the year, especially when the situation of the animal was of lower risk profile. But we also have seen that in risk situation, our premium products are the best products that we need to protect or to treat animals. So we are confident that our premium products also will remain generating growth in the future. In the U.S., definitely we see the cattle business growing below market and maybe also growing below what we expected some months ago. Because we also projected dairy recovery in the second half of 2018, then we think that it will take even longer to see a recovery on the dairy business. In the case of beef, I think, it will be always cycles, animals moving into the big lot sooner or later, but we don't see a significant change on beef. We're still projecting that beef will be slightly increased in the number of animals only by 1%. But we think that beef will be probably in line with what we expected some months ago. We expect that the overall cattle business of Zoetis will be growing in 2019 and maybe growing faster in international markets than in the U.S. And as we said many times, the diversity of our portfolio in species and geographies is helping us to manage these cycles. These are cycles that we have been facing forever. And one of the things that, not only our industry, but also Zoetis has been very consistent even in the phase of change cycles, regulatory situations, very consistently delivering growth inline with the market or even higher in the last six years of Zoetis as a public independent company. Next question please.
Operator: We'll go next to Jon Block with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Block: Great. Thanks guys. Good morning. Maybe a couple of questions and I'll try to rope into one long one. So Glenn, 150 FX basis point headwind, I thought you messaged maybe 200 basis points to 300 basis points recently at JPMorgan. So I just want to see if I'm correct, and what if anything has changed there? And then on that same question, does the midpoint of the 2019 EPS of $3.47 imply any sort of a share repo? I think just trying to flow through your numbers. I get towards the lower end of the EPS, if I use the 4Q share count. And then just to pivot over to Abaxis, when you guys bought Abaxis, Juan Ramón, they had a bunch of new products in their pipeline and your own sentiment, blood gas, rapid assay, so just any more color you can give us, in your control now for four or five months, how is the uptake been on some of these new products within that portfolio? Thanks for your time guys.
Glenn David: So Jon, so I'll address the FX question. So you're correct, when we're at JPMorgan, we did see a bigger impact of foreign exchange based on the rates that were applicable at that time. In terms of the guidance that we have today, we based the guidance based on FX rates as of the end of January. And as I mentioned based on that, there is 150 basis point impact to revenue. However, if you look the last few weeks, the dollar has continued to strengthen and based on the rates that we see actually as of yesterday, our revenues would be negatively impacted by about another $50 million and EPS by a few pennies. So this is currently not reflected in our guidance and something that we'll continue to monitor. The other question you had was, in terms of the midpoint and share repo, when we set our guidance range, we really only assume that will offset dilution from compensation in terms of setting our guidance, but nothing additional.
Juan Ramón Alaix: Jon, then on the Abaxis question, so the focus that we have been there in the last [indiscernible] has been to ensure that all the portfolio, existing portfolio were really meeting the needs and the quality that is expected from our customers. And one of the efforts that we have been doing significantly is to make sure that our equipments are connected to the practice management system and that's really helping veterinarians to have a full integration of information from different equipments in the clinic. We have also been working on defining the priorities in terms of R&D focus and we are progressing well. In terms of, you were asking also about new products, well, definitely FLEX4 is working very well. We also are planning to introduce FLEX4 in the international market within Canada and some other markets. And we will provide a little bit more details on the future launches as we are making progress in terms of defining all the priorities and all the products that will be coming in the next coming year. So next question.
Operator: We'll go next to David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
David Risinger: Thanks very much. Well, first of all, congrats on the performance. I have two high level questions. The first is with respect to Abaxis, we spoke with a consultant who suggested that it will be difficult for Abaxis to displace IDEXX at many U.S. customers. Could you speak to that, your ability to knock IDEXX out of U.S. customers and drive placements of Abaxis going forward? And then with respect to the FDA's assessment of heartworm drug efficacy and potential resistance concerns, could you just speak to where the FDA is in that process and whether the heartworm coverage that you're able to demonstrate to the FDA for TRIO will be at the 100% level or whatever level the FDA will require? Thank you.
Juan Ramón Alaix: Thank you, Dave. Well, starting with the question on heartworm, definitely we have presented to the FDA all the support of 100% efficacy in terms of protection against heartworm. So what is the process of the FDA is something that probably we cannot comment. But we are confident that we have submitted all the data to support our efficacy and safety profile. We will continue working with the FDA. It's a process. It's the process of submitting the different dossiers information and also responding to questions. We are confident that the process will be able to introduce the product in 2020. About the question on, can we gain share in the U.S.? Well, the answer is, yes. And we are convinced now that Zoetis is competing with any competitor in the market on equal or even stronger conditions. In the past, Abaxis was limited in terms of access to customers and I mentioned that maybe they were meeting or visiting customers once per quarter compared to the other competitors having even more frequency than once a month. Now we have the opportunity to really be in front of our customers even more than once a month for few customers. And also very important, we have the opportunity also to combine all the diagnostics portfolio with our strong portfolio of vaccines, parasiticides, derm and so on and so forth. And also create a value proposition to the customers that it was not available at the time of Abaxis. So I understand that it maybe people that need to be convinced, but I hope and we are working hard to make them wrong in terms of the assessment that we cannot compete against IDEXX. Next question please.
Operator: We'll go next to Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Christopher Schott: Great. Thanks very much for the questions. I guess, first one was on Apoquel. I'm just trying to get a sense of where we are in the growth cycle here. So specifically how much more growth potential do you see for the product in the U.S. market? And when we think about the ex-U.S. opportunity, can you just give us little bit more color about how uptick has trended relative to the U.S. in the markets you've launched and what are the biggest ex-U.S. opportunities that you're watching? My second question was on margin expansion over time. So beyond 2019, I know you've highlighted 2019 to be of an investment year with Abaxis coming on Board and the R&D investments. But when we look beyond 2019, can we think about OpEx growth returning back down to low single-digit levels or should we think about Zoetis in a period of kind of multi-year period of OpEx investment as you have become as growth drivers [indiscernible] just beyond 2019 as we think about the longer-term model? Thanks very much.
Juan Ramón Alaix: Thank you, Chris. Well, on Apoquel, I'm going to comment for the U.S. and also comment for international. In the U.S., we started the year with a patient share of 59% and we ended 63%. We still think that there are opportunities for growing patient share. Second, we still see opportunities for expanding the market. I will continue expanding the market or hoping to expand the market with DTC campaigns, that will be the third year that we are investing to create this market demand. And third, we still see opportunities for pricing. So these three elements are probably supporting the growth in the U.S. for Apoquel. Definitely, lower growth than what we have seen in previous year. So the growth has been in the market now for four years, it would be five years in 2019. So we should expect that there will be some reduction on the growth in the U.S. In international market, well, the situation is slightly different, and I'm not talking about only Apoquel, I'm talking the full derm portfolio, including Cytopoint. Cytopoint has been introduced in the market recently in some of the international markets. We expect growth in the introduction of Cytopoint. We still expect growth for Apoquel definitely in terms of patient share, it's below the patient share that we have achieved in the U.S. and we expect that over time reaching similar level of patient share. Although the number of medicalized drugs outside of the U.S. is lower than in the U.S. And finally, we expect in 2019, to introduce the product in China. And again, China has been a market that has been surprisingly positive in terms of growth in companion animal. Now, if I remember well and Glenn you can correct me if I'm not, now China in terms of companion animal is the second largest after the U.S. and maybe some other market, but second or third. It's in companion animal growing very fast and we expect also that Apoquel will be successfully introduced in this market. Talking about margin expansion, you wanted to cover this question.
Glenn David: Of course, Chris, there are number of opportunities for us in terms of margin expansion beyond 2019, just starting with cost of goods and beyond 2020 and delivering on the proposition of delivering a 200 basis point improvement in 2017. As we look past that, we should be able to continue to get improvements in our cost of goods as a percent of revenue. Really, the cost of goods efficiency coming from a lot of the capital investments that we're making today, which we expect to payoff in longer-term in terms of improved cost of goods and we'll continue to also get margin expansion from price. Looking at the OpEx line, from a G&A perspective, we do expect general administrative expenses to grow more in line with inflation as we already have the infrastructure established in most of our markets. Selling will probably be more between the overall inflation rate and the growth in revenue, and depending on the level of revenue growth that we have and new product introductions that we'll need to support. And then from an R&D perspective that will really depend on the opportunities that we have, but that will probably grow more in line with revenue than others.
Juan Ramón Alaix: Thank you, Glenn. And then maybe adding that to the question on Apoquel or derm, I did mention that one-day we should be also facing competition. It's an area that Zoetis has created. It's not the first time that we are creating the market. We did it for pain and now with derm. But we are convinced that we have developed a significant portfolio in derm, portfolio, which is showing high level of efficacy, excellent safety profile and we'll be also adding in the future monoclonal antibodies for dermatology issues for cat. So we are confident that we have the opportunity of continue growing. Always we need to consider future competition in this respect. Next question please.
Operator: And we'll take today's final question from Kathy Miner with Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Kathleen Miner: Great, thank you for taking the question. One, just a brief follow-up on the dermatology area, and I apologize if I missed it, but did you give an update for your expectations for 2019 for dermatology, particularly as you've met or exceeded the $500 million-plus for 2018? And the second question just on M&A, does your 2019 guidance assume any small bolt-on acquisitions? And given that Abaxis is now on board, what would be the key areas we should watch for that? There might be some interest in adding? Thank you.
Juan Ramón Alaix: Thank you, Kathy. And well, in terms of the sales, big sales for our derm portfolio, so in 2018, we almost reached $600 million, it was $593 million. We are projecting growth in 2019, but definitely we are not now updating in terms of big sales. We know that in the future, we'll have competition in this space, so it's a little bit complicated now, what is the full potential. We are convinced that we still have opportunities to continue growing. And as I mentioned before, we also expect to add new products to our portfolio, monoclonal antibodies for cats and maybe also working to ensure that we also apply lifecycle innovation to Apoquel to protect this franchise. And this can be in terms of formulations, in terms of expansion to other species, so it's something that will continue working on lifecycle innovation. And then you also ask if we are including any acquisitions for in 2019 guidance and the answer is no, so it's just our current portfolio including Abaxis portfolio and what we described now as organic growth including Abaxis, and that we will continue assessing opportunities in the market. We are convinced that we have the infrastructure, we have the expertise to integrate and also we have the reach to the customers and we will continue assessing opportunities available in the market and if these opportunities are meeting the criteria of strategic value creation and supported by financials. We think that we have the cash flexibility to go and acquire other companies.
Juan Ramón Alaix: And I think with that, we conclude this session. So thank you very much for attending the earnings call. Thank you for your questions. And with that, we close this call. Thank you.
Operator: And this will conclude today's program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.

Steve, you may begin.
Steve Frank - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Zoetis Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. I am joined today by Juan Ramón Alaix, our Chief Executive Officer, and Glenn David, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statements, today's press release and our SEC filings including, but not limited to, our Annual Report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q.

We also cite operational results which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. With that, I will turn the call over to Juan Ramón.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. In 2018, we have been making significant effort to support future growth with investment in the business. We are allocating more resources to critical R&D projects, updating and expanding many of our manufacturing capabilities and investing in key areas such as diagnostics with the recent acquisition of Abaxis. We are making good progress integrating Abaxis. Our sales teams have been cross-trained on Zoetis' and Abaxis' product lines in the U.S. and Canada, and they're already collaborating on customer accounts. Outside of the U.S. we are focused on building a more robust diagnostic team and using the existing Zoetis infrastructure to expand our diagnostics sales. The initial feedback on the acquisition has been very good. Our field force has been very positive about the potential of this combination and the more comprehensive solutions they can now bring to our veterinary customers. Early customer response has been very encouraging. Our core business and investment strategy has Zoetis well-positioned for the future with a diverse portfolio addressing needs across the continuum of care and a promising pipeline of new products and lifecycle innovations. As I mentioned last quarter, we have taken a phased filing approach for a new three-way combination parasiticide, and we continue making that progress. The product will be known by the trade name Simparica Trio, and it will combine sarolaner and two other active ingredients to focus on ectoparasites such as fleas, ticks and mites as well as internal parasites and the prevention of heartworm disease. Our phased regulatory filings are progressing in the U.S. The safety, efficacy and chemistry manufacturing and control technical sections are under FDA review. In addition, we have submitted the dossier with the European Medicines Agency and subject to regulatory reviews and approval, we would anticipate Simparica Trio coming to market in 2020. We are also progressing well with our monoclonal antibodies program, targeting pain treatment for dogs and cats. This will strengthen our leadership position for pain in dogs and allow us to expand into cats. I will provide further updates as we move through the regulatory process. Our R&D team also continues to enhance our internal portfolio with lifecycle innovations and additional product indication such as the recent expansion of Cytopoint to cover allergic as well as atopic dermatitis in the U.S., also introducing of leading product brands into new geographies and new combinations. Now turning to a few highlights of our third quarter results. Zoetis continued delivering strong revenue growth with 12% operational growth this quarter. Our diverse portfolio remains the foundation of Zoetis' steady and reliable performance with growth across our major species, markets and therapeutic areas. Our companion animal products performed very well in the third quarter based on continued growth in our key dermatology brands, new parasiticides and, for the first time, the addition of Abaxis diagnostic portfolio. We see further growth opportunities for our key dermatology products in 2019. In the U.S., we expect that portfolio to continue growing although at a lower rate than 2018. We expect to continue expanding the addressable market in the U.S. and building awareness of dermatologic conditions through ongoing direct-to-consumer campaigns. Internationally, we expect higher growth than in the U.S. driven by the expansion of the dermatology market, increasing the patient share and the potential introduction of Apoquel in China, pending final regulatory approval. Meanwhile, in livestock products, our swine, poultry and fish portfolios each delivered double-digit growth, with more modest growth in our cattle business. We expect all our species categories to show growth for the full year 2018 and also for 2019. For 2019, analysts expect the companion animal and poultry markets to outperform the overall industry growth of approximately 5%, excluding the currency impact. Swine is expected to be in line with the market growth, and cattle market growth is expected to be more limited. Turning to profitability, in the third quarter we achieved 32% operational growth in adjusted net income, thanks to our increased revenue, improved cost structure, and tax reform. In closing, in 2018 we are confident in achieving our improved annual guidance, continuing to grow revenue faster than market, and growing adjusted net income faster than revenue. And with that, let me hand things over to Glenn, who will provide more details on our third quarter results and guidance.
Glenn C. David - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you, Juan Ramón, and good morning everyone. Let me start by highlighting our continued strong performance in both revenue and adjusted net income in the third quarter. As Juan Ramón mentioned, we delivered operational revenue growth of 12%, driven by the performance of our dermatology portfolio, new products and the addition of Abaxis' diagnostics portfolio. Our organic operational revenue growth for the third quarter was 9%, which excludes Abaxis. Operational adjusted net income growth was 32%. We are confident in delivering our improved financial guidance for 2018 where we are narrowing our revenue guidance at the high end of the range and increasing our adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS guidance. While I will not provide formal guidance on 2019 until early next year, I believe our diverse portfolio, core capabilities and investment strategy will enable us to continue delivering on our value proposition of organically growing revenue in line with or faster than the market and growing adjusted net income faster than revenue. Now, let's talk about the drivers of our Q3 performance, which continued the momentum from the first half of the year. Reported revenue growth was 10% in the third quarter, which includes a negative 2% impact from foreign exchange. Currency depreciation in Brazil was the largest driver of the unfavourability in the quarter. We generated 12% operational revenue growth balanced across our segments with the U.S. growing 11% and International growing 12% operationally. Looking at growth by species, Companion Animal grew 19% operationally and Livestock grew 6% operationally. Included in our operational revenue growth of 12% is 3% from Abaxis. Of the 9% organic operational revenue growth, price contributed 4% and volume contributed 5%. New products drove 2% line, with the remaining 3% driven by our key dermatology portfolio. Price contributions of 4% in the quarter are higher than usual and relate to the timing of promotional activities in the third quarter compared to the same period in the prior year. Price contributed 2% over the first nine months of the year, which is more consistent with our expectations. Adjusted net income grew 32% operationally, driven by revenue growth, gross margin improvements and a lower effective tax rate. As I already mentioned, our key dermatology portfolio comprised of Apoquel and Cytopoint continued to be a significant driver of growth this quarter with sales of $172 million, a 39% increase over the prior year. In the first nine months of the year, we have recognized revenue of $436 million in our key dermatology portfolio with both Apoquel and Cytopoint contributing to the continued success. Consistent with our expectations for these products, Q2 and Q3 are the peak seasons for dermatitis, so we do anticipate moderated performance in Q4, particularly in the U.S. We continue to expect sales for this portfolio to exceed $500 million in 2018, and as Juan Ramón discussed, we see continued growth as we move into 2019. New products also continued to drive growth for Zoetis with Simparica as the primary driver. Simparica generated $43 million of sales this quarter, representing operational growth of 80% over the same period last year. We expect some moderation in Q4 as we move out of the flea and tick season in the U.S. Overall, we continue to be very pleased with the performance of this product in the highly competitive parasiticide market, and we expect continued growth both domestically and internationally. Now before moving into the segment results, I would like to provide more visibility into the Abaxis numbers. Included in Zoetis' reported results this quarter are sales of $42 million from legacy Abaxis products since our July 31 acquisition. These sales represent two months of sales in the U.S., Canada and Latin America and one month of sales for all other international markets based on our international reporting calendar. Please note that Q3 revenue for Abaxis also includes a destocking of wholesaler inventories that we expect to continue in Q4 as we normalize wholesaler inventories consistent with Zoetis levels. With the acquisition of Abaxis, we are adding a new major product category in our financial statements and our 10-Q filings within the revenue by major product category section called Animal Health Diagnostics. This product category will include the animal health products acquired from Abaxis as well as our legacy diagnostics products previously classified within other non-pharmaceuticals. The human health diagnostic products acquired from Abaxis will be classified within a new category called Contract Manufacturing & Human Health Diagnostics. Now let's discuss Zoetis' segment revenues for Q3. Beginning with the U.S., revenue grew 11% in the third quarter, including Abaxis which contributed 4%. Including the impact of Abaxis, Companion Animal grew 20% while Livestock grew 1%. Companion Animal sales in the quarter were driven by our key dermatology portfolio, new products, as well as the addition of Abaxis. Certain in-line product decline due to competitive pressure partially offset these increases. Excluding the impact of Abaxis, Companion Animal growth was 12%. U.S. dermatology sales were $121 million for the quarter with both Apoquel and Cytopoint exhibiting significant growth over the same quarter in the prior year. Simparica also had another positive quarter with U.S. sales in the quarter growing 53% over the same period last year. Revenue growth was due to increased in-clinic penetration and market share and returns on our direct-to-consumer investments. Partially offsetting growth in our Companion Animal business were declines in Revolution and Clavamox due to competition. The U.S. Livestock business continued with strong growth in poultry and swine in the third quarter, partially offset by a decline in cattle. In poultry, the Zoetis portfolio of alternatives to antibiotics and medicated feed additives continues to be the primary driver of growth. Favorable market conditions in the layer market also contributed to growth in vaccines. Swine also had consistent growth in the third quarter, primarily in EXCEDE related to promotional effort. We also continued to increase market share of Fostera Gold PCV MH which launched in the first quarter this year. In the cattle business, we saw challenges in both the beef and dairy segments related to competition and unfavorable market dynamics. We do expect the cattle market to recover sometime in 2019, however, the impact of weather, herd movements and producer profitability all play a role in the timing. Overall, the U.S. continues to be a significant growth driver for Zoetis, particularly due to our product diversity and strategic investments, despite some temporary unfavorable market conditions in the cattle business. Turning now to our International segment, revenue grew 12% operationally in the third quarter with operational growth in Companion Animal of 18% and operational growth in Livestock of 10%. Companion Animal product growth was largely driven by our key dermatology products Apoquel and Cytopoint, new products such as Simparica and Stronghold Plus, increased medicalization rates in key international markets and the addition of Abaxis. Livestock products benefited from favorable market conditions, including increasing demand for animal protein, new products and the impact of our field force. Our fish business also performed very well this quarter, with operational growth of 21%. This strong growth was driven by increased market share of our pancreatic disease or PD vaccine as well as customer adoption of our SRS vaccine in Chile. Highlighting some key markets for the quarter, in Brazil sales grew 31% operationally with Companion Animal growing 48% and Livestock growing 26%. Companion Animal revenue in Brazil benefited from strong growth in parasiticides with Simparic as the primary driver and a positive return on the direct to consumer investment. Livestock benefited from the recovery of sales that were delayed at the end of Q2 due to the national truck drivers' strike. Strong underlying demand, favorable export conditions and local promotional activities also contributed to growth in the quarter. In the UK, sales grew 30% operationally. Both Companion Animal and Livestock contributed to this performance, with new products primarily driving growth on the Companion Animal side and fish driving increases in Livestock. Key dermatology products and new parasiticides both performed well in the quarter, resulting from field force focus and marketing promotions, which increased pet owner awareness of the brand. In fish, vaccines were the primary driver of growth, due to increased market share in our PD vaccine as well as our multivalent vaccine, ALPHA JECT micro 6. Moving on to China, we had another great quarter, growing revenue 15% operationally, largely due to the timing of distributor purchases of our swine product. Companion Animal products also continued demonstrating growth, primarily in parasiticides and vaccines. Australia grew 9% operationally, primarily driven by Companion Animal and sheep. In Companion Animal, Simparica and Apoquel increased sales due to the return on our direct-to-consumer investments, as well as strength of our in-line portfolio and promotional efforts in the quarter. Sheep products also benefited from continued strength in local market conditions. Other emerging markets, particularly Vietnam, Argentina, Turkey and India, performed well. Vietnam performed well on Livestock, particularly in swine, due to increased market prices for pork. Argentina and Turkey had broad-based growth across Companion Animal and Livestock, while growth in India was largely due to strength in poultry. Summarizing International performance, we saw new products, favorable market conditions and diversity across our portfolio all contributing to another very strong quarter for our International segment. Now, moving on to the rest of the P&L, I want to cover a few key line items and then discuss guidance for 2018. Adjusted gross margin of 68.7% increased approximately 80 basis points in the quarter on a reported basis. This improvement reflects favorable pricing and the benefit of continued cost improvements and efficiencies in our manufacturing network, which were partially offset by the impact of Abaxis. Total adjusted operating expenses including Abaxis grew 11% operationally versus the same period last year. Adjusted SG&A operational growth was 10%, primarily due to the addition of Abaxis and increased compensation-related costs. Adjusted R&D operational growth of 13% reflects increased investments in areas such as monoclonal antibodies for chronic pain and other pipeline programs, as well as Abaxis. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 19.2%. The tax rate in the quarter is significantly lower than the rate from the comparable 2017 period due to the favorable impact of U.S. tax reform and discrete items recognized during the quarter. Adjusted net income for the quarter grew 32% operationally through a combination of strong revenue growth, improvements in gross margin, and a lower effective tax rate. These increases are partially diluted by the impact of Abaxis, which we expect to become mildly accretive in 2019 on an adjusted basis. As previously communicated, we are creating strong operating leverage, while investing in strategic areas of future growth for Zoetis including acquisitions such as Abaxis. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 34% operationally in the quarter versus the same period in 2017. Now, moving to guidance for the full year 2018, our consistent revenue growth, gross margin improvement and returns on strategic investments are allowing us to narrow our revenue guidance towards the high end of the range and raise and narrow our outlook on adjusted diluted EPS. Starting with revenue, we are narrowing the range of our revenue guidance and expect to deliver between $5.75 billion and $5.8 billion in revenue, representing operational revenue growth of 8% to 9%. Excluding Abaxis' partial-year revenue which consists of five months of domestic activity and four months of International, the organic operational revenue growth range is 6% to 7%. Consistent with what I communicated the last quarter, our full year guidance includes headwinds in Q4 that I want to remind you of as you think about the remainder of the year. Our business in Q4 2017 was very strong, so the growth off this higher base will moderate. U.S. livestock is one area where we experienced an exceptionally strong Q4. In addition, the fourth quarter of this year will also include four fewer international calendar days compared to last year, resulting from the change in our accounting calendar implemented this year. Please note that from an EPS growth perspective, Q4 will be impacted by the timing of cost of sales which were higher in the first half of 2017 when compared to the second half of 2017 as well as the timing of operating expenses. For SG&A and R&D, we're narrowing guidance towards the high end of both ranges, consistent with our revenue performance and to support investments for future growth. Our guidance for the adjusted effective tax rate has been lowered to approximately 19% from our previous guidance of approximately 20%. This is primarily due to the impact of favorable discrete non-recurring items resulting from the implementation of U.S. tax reform. We continue to anticipate our effective tax rate going forward to be higher due to certain provisions of U.S. tax reform which will go into effect in 2019. For adjusted diluted EPS, we are raising and narrowing the guidance and now expect to deliver between $3.08 and $3.13. Our range for reported diluted EPS of $2.81 to $2.90 includes preliminary estimates for certain significant items and purchase accounting for the Abaxis acquisition as well as gaining on the sale of our plant health business, which was completed in our international Q4 period. Finally, we repurchased nearly $550 million of Zoetis shares in the first nine months of the year. We have approximately $450 million remaining under the current multiyear share repurchase plan and remain committed to our capital allocation priorities of internal investment, M&A and returning excess cash to shareholders. Our guidance for reported and adjusted earnings per share reflects the shares repurchased through the end of Q3. Now, to summarize before we move to Q&A, we have delivered consistent operational top and bottom line growth in the first nine months of the year, with contributions across all core species, therapeutic areas and geographies. We are narrowing our range of revenue guidance to the high end of the range and increasing and narrowing our guidance for adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS. Our diversity, strategic internal and external investments, and ability to innovate, will continue to provide a platform for revenue growth that is in line with or faster than the market. Now I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?
Operator: We'll take our first question from Jon Block with Stifel. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks, guys. Congrats on the quarter. I might try to jam three questions into one. So the first, on the big three therapeutics, I have that up over 40% year-over-year. At a high level, how should we think about the rate of growth from these three blockbusters in 2019 and 2020? I think you said very healthy but maybe at a diminished rate. So, anything more that you can provide there. Second would be just early feedback from the Abaxis acquisition. How should we think about sales force retention? And then have you kicked off any bundling in terms of price? And lastly, Glenn, just the price of 4% in the quarter, I just want to be clear there, we should think of that more as onetime due to the year ago comp? Thanks, guys.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you, Jon. Glenn will answer the first question. I will cover the Abaxis question and then Glenn also will provide the comments on the 4% price increase in the quarter.
Glenn C. David - Zoetis, Inc.: So, Jon, when you look at the big three, and I assume you're mentioning Apoquel, Cytopoint and Simparica, we've had very strong growth in the quarter and year-to-date. As we look forward into 2019 and 2020, we do still see opportunities for growth for all those products. So, particularly, with our dermatology portfolio we see continued growth in U.S. albeit at a slower rate as we have significant penetration in terms of patient share there. We're up to 63% already. We do see further opportunity continue to grow the market there as well. We should also see a very strong opportunity internationally where the penetration isn't quite at that level yet, so we do see continued growth internationally in Apoquel and Cytopoint as well. In Simparica we continue to see very strong performance, continued adoption, and we think that growth will continue into the 2019 and 2020 as well, but again probably at a slower rate and also the impact of competition and new products that may come into that category may also impact growth going forward.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Okay. Thank you, Glenn. In terms of the Abaxis integration, well, the retention of the field force I think is not – I can describe as 100% retention. And not only it's about retention, it's about the feedback that we are getting from the field force from Abaxis, which is extremely positive. They are expressing the excitement of the opportunity now to be supported by a larger company, by much more presence in our field. And the combination of the two portfolios is something that can create significant opportunities. I think it's too early to discuss about bundling. Definitely we see the opportunity of combining the diagnostic portfolio of Abaxis, the diagnostic portfolio of Zoetis, and also the rest of the portfolio of medicines, and it's something that it's a work in progress. We see that diagnostic medicines, vaccines, are very much integrated in the clinics, so we expect that this will present a significant opportunity in the future.
Glenn C. David - Zoetis, Inc.: And, Jon, in terms of the price for the quarter, so like you say, the 4% is more of a onetime impact for the quarter. The year-to-date number of 2% is much more in line with what we typically expect to be able to generate from price.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Next question, please.
Operator: And we'll take the next question from Alex Arfaei from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Great. Thank you very much for taking the question and congratulations on all the progress. First, just a follow-up on atopic dermatitis, I think one of your competitors reported data with their IL-31 recently. I'm referring to Kindred. Just wondering if you had any thoughts there whether it's on that product or just, in general how you see the competitive landscape evolving here. I'm sure your success hasn't gone unnoticed. Second, could you please break out Apoquel, Cytopoint, and Simparica by U.S. and ex-U.S.? And finally, if I may, Juan Ramón, I missed your comments about 2019 expectations for livestock species. Could you please clarify that? And any additional color would be appreciated. Thank you.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you, Alex. Good morning. So, let me discuss about the potential competition of our dermatology portfolio. Definitely this is something that we already communicated in previous calls that over time we expect competitors coming into this attractive market. It's a market that has been basically created by Zoetis. In the same way that many years ago, we also created the pain market for dogs, and even after many years and many new entrants, still Rimadyl remains the leading brand in terms of pain for dogs. So, we are expecting competition but we also expect that we have a very strong position with the combination of Apoquel and Cytopoint and products that has been responding extremely well to the needs of veterinarians and also the needs of dogs, and we are very confident that these products will continue growing. And new competition also will expand the market and we also benefit of this market expansion from a leadership position. Glenn will discuss about the breakdown between dermatology products, Simparica, U.S., International and also I will be covering the expectations for Livestock in 2019.
Glenn C. David - Zoetis, Inc.: So, just to break out the numbers. So, for derm for Q3, we had total sales of $172 million. $121 million of that came from the U.S., with $51 coming from International. Breaking out Apoquel, we had total sales of $134 million, the U.S. at $88 million, International at $45 million. You can then do the math for Cytopoint, the difference between the two. For Simparica, we had total sales of $43 million in the quarter, with the U.S. at $26 million and International at $17 million.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: So, the comments I provided for 2019 in terms of livestock were related to the market and not specific to our projection for 2019 Livestock Zoetis. What I said is that the market expect that poultry will be growing faster than this 5% which is expected growth for the overall animal health industry. Swine will be in line with the market and cattle will be much more modest growth. And this is something that, at this point, we are not yet providing the specifics of our growth in 2019, but we expect that we'll be more or less in line with the market expectations. Next question?
Operator: The next question comes from Louise Chen with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.
Louise Chen - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. So, my first question here was just back onto the cattle here. Can you just give more specifics as to what is going to actually drive the recovery in cattle in 2019? And then the second question is just on opportunities for growth and operating margin expansion in 2019 and beyond, if you still see anything beyond what you've already said and if so, where these could come from. Thank you.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you, Louise. We expect, as I said, in 2019 modest growth in cattle for the animal health industry. We see that prices for dairy are improving. We expect that this improve to be seen in the second half of 2018. It's taking longer. But now there are indications that these prices are recovering in the U.S. and also recovering in International market. So, we are more optimistic about dairy in 2019. In 2019, we also expect small growth, very little growth in terms of number of heads in the beef section of cattle. And combining all these elements, we expect some recovery of cattle in 2019. But as I said, cattle is expected to grow at modest growth.
Glenn C. David - Zoetis, Inc.: And, Louse, in terms of margin expansion, first I'll just continue to say that we're really not managing to any particular margin, but really we are managing for long-term cash flow growth and value. But when you look forward in terms of 2019 and 2020, we've previously articulated that we expect to get gross margin expansion of about 200 basis points by 2020 with 2017 being the starting point for that. So, our cost of goods as a percent of sales at that point was about 33%. We've guided 2018 to be approximately 32%, and we do expect continued improvement in both 2019 and 2020. As we move forward, we also do expect to be able to get some leverage from operating expenses. But in 2019, in particular, as we continue to integrate Abaxis and build to make sure that we're supporting that business, that expansion may not be as strong as it may be moving forward in 2020 and beyond. But between the combination of the gross margin expansion and being able to grow expenses at a slower rate than revenue, we do expect to be able to get margin expansion moving forward.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you, Glenn. Next question, please.
Operator: Our next question's from Kevin Ellich with Craig-Hallum. Please go ahead.
Kevin Ellich - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess could we start off with capital allocation? You guys have – now that you're done with the Abaxis acquisition, wondering what else we should be thinking about in terms of how you plan to use the capital aside from the share repurchases. And then can you also comment on the pipeline, Juan Ramón? Appreciate the comments on Simparica Trio and when you expect it. What about Europe? Are we going to see it approved in Europe before the U.S.? And then congrats on winning the Deming Cup for Operational Excellence Thanks.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you, Kevin. In terms of our capital allocation, we are not changing the previous capital allocation communication. So, definitely, we see and we continue seeing opportunities in terms of investing internally. We are increasing our allocation to R&D. We communicated that also we are expanding and increasing the capabilities in manufacturing. And we see opportunities in commercial, and in 2018, 2019, the opportunities there definitely will be in diagnostics and will be an expansion of our presence in International markets. So, we'll continue investing internally. And the result of this investment has been extremely positive and we'll continue making sure that we have the resources to generate long-term growth. In terms of BD, the second priority in terms of capital allocation, we just completed the acquisition of Abaxis. We also had some other minor acquisitions, Smartbow, that it also a company that will be providing sensors and also the opportunity for more data analytics, digital in the dairy farms. And it's an area that we are also very interested ensuring that we are developing the internal capabilities in terms of digital data analytics there to provide this value to our customers. And we'll continue with returning the excess capital to our shareholders. It will be through dividends. It will be through buying shares back. Nothing has changed, and definitely we still see opportunities of, as I said, continue investing internally, identifying external opportunities and returning this excess capital. In terms of the pipeline, well, Simparica Trio has been filed in both the U.S. and also Europe. When this will be coming to the market, it's to be seen because it's depending on the regulators. But definitely, we expect that Simparica Trio will be in the market sometime in 2020. Who will be first, it's to be seen. There are some other products that also we'll see even earlier than 2019. For example, we are also expecting that in the U.S. we'll have lifecycle innovation with Revolution Plus and combining Revolution Plus active ingredient with a combination of other agents that we will expand the protection not only to fleas and ticks but making it stronger for ticks. And this is something that we expect this Revolution Plus coming into the market in 2019. And we'll continue also bringing in some other products in 2019 in the U.S. and also international markets, especially lifecycle innovation. I also mentioned that we are expecting the approval of Apoquel in China. Again, it's subject to regulatory approvals, but it can be sometime in 2019 and this will also help us to continue growing Apoquel or the dermatologico for Zoetis. And China now is one of our top markets for companion animal within Zoetis. So, it's probably a good opportunity that we see the introduction of Apoquel in this market. Next question?
Operator: Our next question is from Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Erin Wright - Credit Suisse: Great. Thanks. A couple of questions here, you mentioned some de-stocking as it relates to Abaxis, but can you provide any sort of metrics on the integration process there and traction you're seeing in terms of in-customer instrument placement trends or consumables growth, and as we think about modeling out the diagnostics segment that you'll be breaking out, should we consider that a double-digit grower when studying your own diagnostics portfolio? And then the second part of my question is how you think about a potentially kind of evolving supply chain in pet medications and do you think that it is rapidly evolving or evolving to some extent that consumers have more choice and veterinarians have more choice? And what do you think about broader implications, newer concepts such as Vets First Choice and your ability to realize price thereon? Thanks.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Okay. Thank you, Erin. So, in terms of Abaxis performance (42:06) I think it's – well, the integration of the closing of Abaxis has been at the mid of this quarter. I think it's probably a little bit too early to provide the full details of the different elements of the diagnostics implementation in the clinics. This is something that we'll discuss what will be the level of information that we'll be providing in the future. And maybe we can have this discussion in the fourth quarter when we have the full quarter already reporting and having all the elements that are under control by Zoetis. Glenn will be talking about the de-stocking question that you raised.
Glenn C. David - Zoetis, Inc.: Yes. So, just to give a little more color into the Abaxis numbers. So, we referenced that we had $42 million of sales in Q3. Just a reminder, that includes two months of U.S. and one month International, so it's a partial quarter. Of that $42 million is also $7 million related to human health diagnostics, so the animal health diagnostics piece of that $42 million was $35 million. To get to your question on growth for the quarter a little bit, Erin, if you take some of the pro forma information and then put that together with what I just referenced in terms of the $35 million, again it's not 100% audited or accurate because we're piecing together different pieces of information. But you would get to mid-single digit growth for the quarter for the legacy Abaxis business. Now, that does also include the de-stocking that I referenced which we do expect to continue into Q4. But if you were to adjust for that de-stocking, we get to double-digit growth in the Abaxis portfolio which we do expect to continue moving forward at double-digit growth rate.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: And Erin, what we expect from animal health diagnostics growth trend long-term is that we'll be growing faster than the animal health core business medicines, and I think it has been, in the past, growing at 7%, 8%. We also expect that in the future we'll be growing higher than the 5%. And where we see significant opportunities for growth is in International markets. And we are now expanding our presence and we are convinced that we have a significant opportunity to penetrate in this market. You also asked about the U.S., changes in the distribution retail channel, talking about Vets First Choice or internet pharmacy (44:42), well, definitely, it's a lot of changes in this segment, companion animal in the U.S. We see some of these changes also having the positive impact of expanding the market, having much more access there for pet owners, at the same time the opportunity also to increase compliance. But at the same time, we are convinced that veterinarians will remain at the center of healthcare decision especially in areas that will require prescription and intervention of veterinarians with injectables or vaccination or acute treatment in the Companion Animal. And we'll continue supporting the veterinarians really to deliver value to our pet owners. Next question?
Operator: Our next question is from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Michael Ryskin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thanks. Congrats on the quarter, guys. I have a couple questions I'm going to roll into one but it's going to be focused on some of the innovation of the portfolio. You talked about the additional indications for Cytopoint, the allergic dermatitis. Can you give any sense of how much that expands the potential for that product, near-term in both as we go into 2019 and 2020? And then regarding some of the other innovation, the lifecycle extensions in Draxxin and Vanguard, some of the work you mentioned, the focus on the pain monoclonal antibody. Just to get a sense of how big of a contributor this could be in 2019, 2020 as some of these new products come in. And then along that line, one last one is we saw some news reports that the USDA was potentially granting you a license for an African swine fever vaccine that's in an open comment period. Can you talk about the potential for that market? Obviously, there's a lot of talk in the swine markets about the disease outbreaks there, so, any sense of timing or potential impact? Thanks.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you, Mike. So, let me cover the question on additional label indications for Cytopoint. So, in allergies there are four main reasons for this condition. So, one is related to fleas, the other one is food, and the third one is the environment. Anything which is not in these three areas is described as atopic. Now, Cytopoint also have the indication of allergy, not only atopic indication, and this will help us really to promote what all the indications of Cytopoint. We are not expecting significant revenues because of that, but definitely it's an area that in our opinion veterinarians has been using Cytopoint based on their own understanding of the needs. But the fact that we'll be now promoting a broader label, we will always help, but we don't expect a significant incremental revenue. We expect that the market in the U.S. still has a potential for expansion and also we expect that our patient share also can increase with the right interactions with the veterinarians and the right communication with the pet owner. And this is applicable to the U.S. and also International. In terms of pipeline contribution in the near-term – well in the near term, we discussed about near-term 2019, so the pipeline will be mainly related to lifecycle innovation. We'll always be introducing some new vaccines, new product, but we expect significant introduction of new products in 2020. And we'll have the opportunity to discuss in February the details of our guidance for 2019 and also how we see 2019 in terms of the different sources of growth, our current portfolio, new product introduction and also price. You also asked about the African swine fever and the collaboration with the USDA. This is something that will take several years to see a vaccine in the market to protect pigs against the African swine fever. But definitely, it's an area that has significant impact and we have seen the impact now in China and also in some other markets. It's affecting the production of pork. But what I think is even more important that what is the short-term opportunity for developing a vaccine to protect pigs against the African swine fever is the confirmation that Zoetis is the banner of choice with the USDA and many other institutions when we need to bring new vaccines into the market. And this is, in my opinion, what is important at this moment in the collaboration that we are establishing between us and the USDA. Next question?
Operator: The next question is from John Kreger with William Blair. Please go ahead.
Jon Kaufman - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. This is Jon Kaufman on for John Kreger. So, a question on the monoclonal antibody products, is there anything more you can tell us? What stage of the development process are they in and when do you expect them to come to market? Thank you.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Well, I think it's too early to indicate when the product will be in the market. So, what I can tell you is that we are making a very good progress. So, we have several products for both dogs and cats. We are very optimistic about these products reaching the market. And as I said, I will provide to you more updates as we start the process of filing the dossier into the FDA and also the European agencies. And then when we have that information, then I will be providing more details of when we plan to have the product into the market. Next question?
Operator: The next question is from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Chris Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Thanks very much for the questions, just one coming back to some of the earlier comments on OpEx going forward and expense growth. You've obviously stepped up spend this year supporting the pipeline and the new launches, sounds like 2019 might be another year of investment with Abaxis. I guess my question is once we get beyond that spend, should we think about OpEx growth slowing back down to more inflation-type growth that we've seen historically for the company? Or are we in a sustained period here where we should think about OpEx growth kind of above inflation, maybe closer to topline just given the variety of new products that you seem to have targeted for the next few years? My second question was just on the Simparica Trio and maybe just taking a step back. Maybe just put in context how much larger of an opportunity do you see for that product relative to Simparica today as we just think about that 2020 and beyond opportunity. Thank you.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you, Chris. Well, I would probably share my general comments about OpEx, and then also Glenn will provide more details. So, we have seen 2018, maybe also 2019 as a years in where we are building some additional capabilities in our commercial infrastructure, has been also two years where we see additional opportunities to invest in R&D, and this is driving that higher growth in terms of operating expenses than in previous years. In the long-term, I think we'll remain in line with previous communications that operating expenses will be growing in line with inflation. But it's also true that we have seen significant changes in our business, the inclusion or addition of Abaxis. We also included some other areas where we need some additional capabilities. And there are now new opportunities that we have seen also in digital and also in terms of data analytics. All these it's, well, creating the need of further investment but as I said, it's something that we see as temporary, and then over time, moving into the long-term growth in line with inflation. Glenn, do you want to add some additional comments here?
Glenn C. David - Zoetis, Inc.: Yeah. The only thing I'd add particularly for 2019 as you look at it, I mean, one of the key drivers of the expense growth for 2019 will be the fact that we'll have a full 12 months of the Abaxis portfolio and expenses supporting that portfolio in 2019 versus only a partial year this year. And we'll also still be in the build phase for some of the diagnostics field force that we're building in both the U.S. and International. As Juan Ramón said, once we move forward into 2020, we would expect particularly the G&A line to then trend much more in line with inflation, and selling in particular, we would expect expenses to be slower than revenue growth from a selling perspective as well. R&D, we'll continue to look at the opportunity and to the extent that there are opportunities to drive future short-, medium- and long-term growth, we'll make the right investments from an R&D perspective.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: So, in terms of Simparica Trio and the incremental opportunity compared to Simparica, we are very pleased with the performance of Simparica. So, we are now on the nine month close to $150 million, $144 million (sic) [$125 million]. But still we are significantly underrepresented in the oral parasiticide market and where NexGard or Bravecto are generating much more significant sales. And one of the reasons were that we were several years behind competitors in terms of introducing these products. We are confident that with the Simparica Trio we'll be bringing a product that would be highly competitive and also we'll have the opportunity to capture part of the revenues which are today on internal parasiticides and also heartworm provided by other products. So, the opportunity in Simparica Trio, it's to capture higher share in terms of the overall market of oral parasiticides and expanding to internal parasiticides. So, we'll provide in the future when we have probably closer to the launch what can be the expectations of Simparica Trio. Next question?
Operator: The next question is from Kathy Miner with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.
Kathy M. Miner - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good morning. Just two quick questions on Companion Animal. First is, in the past you've estimated the U.S. market penetration of your derm products is around 59%. Is that good or has that increased? And the second question is also on companion animals, derm and Simparica trends have been very strong, but how should we be thinking about the underlying, the base business? Is that flattish or growing slightly going forward? Thank you.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: So, thank you, Kathy. So, you're correct, so the 59% share, it was related to patient share for Apoquel, Cytopoint. This was in previous quarters. Now we have increased to 63% in the U.S., and we are significantly lower in International markets. And again, so, International markets is where we see the opportunity of first expanding the dermatology market and also increasing our penetration with the market share. You also asked about the base business excluding I guess Apoquel, Cytopoint, Simparica, I guess this is the question. Maybe, Glenn, you can answer that.
Glenn C. David - Zoetis, Inc.: Yes. So, when you look at the base business in the U.S., if you exclude the derm products, volume growth is declining. That is partially offset by some positive increase in price. But overall, volume growth is declining, and that is driven by some competitive pressures that we're seeing on some of our more established products such as Revolution and Clavamox as they face competition, A, from other new products but also from generic competition. But the impact that we're seeing there is very much in line with what we expect from a long-term perspective once we lose exclusivity in terms of the 20% to 40% over an extended period of time.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Next question, please.
Operator: The next question is from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yes, thanks very much, and congrats on the performance. I have a couple questions related to the Trio opportunity. The first is have you filed all of the components of the application with the FDA? Second, I believe that, Juan Ramón, you said 2020, which I believe is a delay from the prior comments of second half of 2019 approval and launch. Could you comment on that? And third, do you have 100% heartworm protection in the product? Thank you.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you, Dave. Let me confirm that Simparica Trio has been filed with all the different sections in the FDA. And I thought that in previous communications we were saying that we are expecting the Simparica Trio to be in the market in 2020, and we can maybe check if there was any confusion here, but I want to confirm that we expect this product in 2020. And let me – I think we are very confident that the product, Simparica Trio, will have full protection for heartworm. But let me confirm with our scientists what will be the level of protection in terms of percentage. But we are very confident that the efficacy of the product for internal and external will be excellent. So, this is one of the reasons why we are confident that the product will have a significant opportunity once it's launched into the U.S. and also in International markets. Let me say that in International markets, maybe the opportunity is lower than the U.S. because heartworm outside of the U.S. is less prevalent. So, the biggest opportunity for Simparica Trio will be in the U.S. Next question?
Operator: And it does appear we have no further questions. I'll return the floor to Juan Ramón Alaix for closing comments.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you for your attention. We are very pleased with the results of the third quarter, and as I said, extremely confident in our guidance for total year 2018 that has been growing over time, and now we have provided an increase in terms of adjusted net income for the total year . Thank you for your attention.
Operator: And this will conclude today's program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.

Operator: Good day, and welcome to the second quarter of 2018 financial results conference call and webcast for Zoetis. Hosting the call today is Steve Frank, Vice President of Investor Relations for Zoetis. The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, and will not be forwarded automatically. In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call via dial-in or on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the floor will be open for your questions following the presentation. It's now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.
Steve Frank - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Zoetis second quarter 2018 earnings call. I'm joined today by Juan Ramón Alaix, our Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn David, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statements in today's press release and our SEC filings including, but not limited to, our Annual Report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q. Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and in the company's 8-K filing dated today, August 2, 2018. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. With that, I will turn the call over to Juan Ramón.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. Let me share three brief headlines for our call today. First, we continued to perform very well through the first half of 2018 with a strong second quarter results. Based on the latest external estimate, we have continued to gain market share through the last 12 months ending in March 2018. Second, we are very excited about the Abaxis acquisition that closed this week, well ahead of our expectations. And this should allow us to move quickly into the integration phase. And finally, we remain very confident in our ability to achieve our full year guidance. When you look at our historical performance and the recent revenue growth, much of our success comes from our diverse portfolio, a portfolio that has been compiled through the long-term investments in R&D and the careful selection of external partnerships and acquisitions. We are very confident in the long-term return of this investment. And in 2018, we have had an increase in R&D expense as we continue to accelerate certain projects in key growth areas such as monoclonal antibodies that will address pain associated with osteoarthritis and other indications. We're also progressing with the development of combination products based on the sarolaner compound, which is used in new products like Simparica, an oral parasiticide for dogs, and Stronghold Plus, a topical combination parasiticide for cats. We have filed for approval a new three-way combination parasiticide, which if approved will be known by trade name Simparica Trio. It will combine sarolaner with two other active ingredients to focus on ectoparasiticides such as fleas, ticks and mites as well as internal parasites and the prevention of heartworm disease. We remain very confident in the technical package that we have completed for this product. We are taking a phased filing approach in various markets around the world and subject to regulatory reviews and approvals, we would anticipate it coming to the market in 2020. We are also proud of recent launches of new swine vaccines, which includes Fostera Gold in the U.S. as well as PRRS, PCV2, PCV and M Hyo combination vaccine that are performing well in other markets. All demonstrate our continued expertise in vaccines and have us well-positioned for continued growth. External partnerships and acquisitions are also important for innovation and providing us new capabilities to predict, prevent, detect, and treat disease in animals. We have always seen diagnostics as an important high growth space for Zoetis, an important piece of comprehensive solutions we can bring to veterinarians. We wanted to find the right opportunity and partner. And this week, we completed our acquisition of Abaxis, a leading provider of veterinary point-of-care diagnostic instruments for approximately $2 billion. With our growing scale and direct customer relationships in approximately 45 countries, we can help accelerate the growth of Abaxis portfolio in the U.S. and International markets. We can also combine the expertise in diagnostics with our diverse portfolio and provide customers with integrated solutions that can work across the continuum of care. We are now moving ahead with the integration plans. While there will be cost efficiencies, the real value of this transaction is in the revenue growth opportunities, especially, International. Another area of external investment has been in monoclonal antibodies. In addition, to our internal expertise, this June we announced a five-year agreement with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals to collaborate on additional research in antibody therapies. As part of this agreement, Zoetis will be using Regeneron technology to develop monoclonal antibodies for use in companion animals and livestock animals. Regeneron will also work with Zoetis to evaluate select Regeneron antibodies in diseases of dogs and cats. Together we'll generate data that could be used in later human trials and for proof of concept in veterinary species. This collaboration demonstrates our access to multiple sources of innovation and reinforces our reputation as the animal health partner of choice in R&D. Finally, we are also expanding into sensors, digital platform and data analytics tools that help our customers predict and detect diseases in their animals. We recently acquired a small company based in Austria called Smartbow. They are an innovative partner. We have been working with them for more than a year on precision dairy farming technology. Smartbow has developed a cow monitoring system that helps dairy farmers use active electronic ear tags to collect data and analytics from individual animals. This includes monitoring for reproductive data, animal locations, detecting signs of stress, behavior change and disease and paving the way for early intervention and treatment. Moving on the second quarter results. We achieved 9% operational growth in revenue, driven by the performance of new parasiticides and new vaccines, our dermatology portfolio as well as contributions from the rest of our in-line portfolio. Our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint, generated $143 million in sales in the second quarter. This included our first ever quarter of $100 million in the U.S. where we continued to use direct-to-consumer advertising to bring both, disease and brand awareness. We have continued to grow patient share in both the U.S. and International segments. And over the last 12 months we have generated more than $500 million in sales for our key dermatology portfolio. Our new parasiticide products, Simparica and Stronghold Plus, saw solid growth in the second quarter, with more than $50 million in sales for Simparica, putting it well on its way to blockbuster status this year. We continue to use our digital marketing and direct-to-consumer campaigns to support these products, and we are seeing good results in the U.S. and in other markets like Brazil. As we said last quarter, we expect to grow our cattle, poultry, swine, and fish products in line or faster than the overall market, and we expect to see positive growth in the livestock market in 2018. We have also sustained profitable performance in the second quarter. We grew our adjusted net income by 37% operationally, based on revenue growth, improvements to our gross margin, and continued benefits from U.S. tax reform. In closing, I'm confident that we are taking the right actions and making the right investments to deliver on our objectives for 2018 and ensure our future growth. With that, let me hand things over to Glenn, who will provide more details on our second quarter results, the Abaxis acquisition, and full-year 2018 guidance.
Glenn C. David - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you, Juan Ramón, and good morning everyone. We've had an exciting and busy second quarter, but first I would like to lay out what I will cover today. I will discuss the Zoetis Q2 results, which do not include Abaxis performance. I will mention the most recent Abaxis quarterly revenue results separately just for your reference and context going forward. And I will then review changes to our 2018 guidance, which do reflect the acquisition of Abaxis this week as well as changes to foreign exchange rates. Beginning with Q2 performance, we had another strong quarter with 9% operational revenue growth, balanced across our U.S. and International business segments, and we continued to grow adjusted net income at a rate significantly faster than revenue. Our performance was positive across all key markets and all core species. Total company reported revenue growth was 12% in the second quarter, including a favorable 3% impact from foreign exchange. Revenue growth in the quarter was driven by strong companion animal performance across both our International and U.S. segments. Our in-line portfolio, including key dermatology products, continued to demonstrate solid growth, with new products also contributing strong growth across both companion animal and livestock. Operational revenue growth of 9% was driven by 1% price and 8% volume. Of the 8% volume, 5% was from our in-line products, of which 2% came from our dermatology products and 3% from the rest of the in-line portfolio. The remaining 3% growth came from new products. Adjusted net income grew 37% operationally, driven by revenue growth, gross margin improvements, and a lower effective tax rate. As Juan Ramón mentioned, our key dermatology portfolio, comprised of Apoquel and Cytopoint, had their best quarter yet with sales of $143 million. We are well on our way to achieving more than $500 million combined sales target we previously communicated for these products in 2018. We're also very pleased with the uptake of Cytopoint and expect it to achieve blockbuster status this year, which is greater than $100 million of sales. We also recognized record sales from Simparica in the quarter, generating $51 million worldwide. We continue to be very pleased with both the U. S. and international performance of this product. Now before moving into Zoetis segment results, I would like to recognize a strong first fiscal quarter for Abaxis, which as I mentioned, is not included in Zoetis Q2 results. As a reminder, fiscal Q1 for Abaxis represents the months April to June for both U.S. and International. Abaxis Q1 revenue was $68 million and represents 17% growth over the same period in the prior year. These results were provided to us by the Abaxis team, are unaudited, and were recognized under Abaxis accounting policies while they were an independent public company. Now let's discuss segment revenues for Q2. International revenue grew 10% operationally in the second quarter, with positive contributions across all key markets, with companion animal operational growth of 17% and livestock operational growth of 6%. Companion animal product growth was largely driven by our key dermatology products Apoquel and Cytopoint, new products such as Simparica and Stronghold Plus, and increased medicalization rates in key international markets such as China and Brazil. Livestock products benefited from growing demand for animal protein, new product introductions, and the success of our field force. Highlighting some key markets for the quarter, in China we grew 23% operationally, largely due to strength in companion animals, which increasingly represents a larger portion of our business there. A growing companion animal population and medicalization of pets contributed to this growth, with Q2 benefiting from increased usage of our parasiticide Revolution and vaccines. In Brazil, sales were flat operationally. However, this is primarily a result of a national truck driver strike that occurred at the end of the international quarter, impacting recognition of livestock revenue within the quarter. We expect to recover these sales in Q3, as shipping resumed early in the quarter. We anticipate stronger than normal results in Q3. Excluding the impact of the strike, both livestock and companion animal products performed very well in Brazil in Q2. For cattle in Brazil, investments in our field force, including local commercial campaign efforts, have led to increased penetration and coverage in key regions within the market. We also continue to see favorable export conditions that will contribute to our growth. Companion animal revenue in Brazil benefited from the continued growth of Simparic due to a strong return on the direct-to-consumer investments. Australia grew 16% operationally, primarily driven by cattle, companion animal, and sheep. In cattle, our vaccine business grew due to strong beef prices and the rebuilding of the herd in the market. Companion animal benefited from growth in Apoquel due to the return on our direct-to-consumer investments as well as strength of our in-line portfolio. Sheep products benefited from continued strength in local market conditions. The UK contributed 23% operational growth with companion animal and cattle driving the largest increases. New products in companion animal generated strong growth with wholesale purchasing patterns in the prior year also contributing to growth for both companion animal and cattle. Mexico grew 22% operationally, delivering growth in excess of 20% for the third consecutive quarter. And the growth was generated across all species. New products, including the recent launch of Simparica and strong demand generation by the field force is driving the positive performance. Other emerging markets, particularly India, Poland and Turkey, performed well. India and Turkey had increased livestock product sales due to field force penetration and key account management. While Poland benefited from growth across both companion animal and livestock. Overall, a very strong quarter for our International segment with growth across all key markets. New products, favorable market conditions and a return on strategic investments in our portfolio and field force are all helping to consistently drive positive results. Turning to the U.S., revenue grew 9% in the second quarter, companion animal grew 15%, while livestock grew 1%. Companion animal sales in the quarter were driven by our dermatology portfolio and new products, primarily Simparica. These gains were partially offset by decreases in certain in-line products due to competitive pressure. U.S. key dermatology sales reached a new milestone of $100 million for the quarter with both Apoquel and Cytopoint exhibiting strong growth over the same quarter in the prior year. Both products also increased sales over Q1, consistent with expectations and the warmer summer months. I mentioned Simparica also had a strong quarter with the U.S. being a large contributor to the growth this quarter with more than 200% growth. As communicated in the first quarter, we had anticipated Simparica returning to growth this quarter due to the timing of customer purchases in Q1 and Q2 of last year. Year-to-date growth of 46% also demonstrates our ability to gain clinic penetration and market share and realize the benefits of our DTC investments, which we are maintaining in 2018. Partially offsetting growth in our companion animal business was the continued impact of anticipated competition for Clavamox and Revolution. With Clavamox also impacted by the timing of promotional activities in the prior year. The U.S. livestock business continued its strong growth in poultry and swine in the second quarter, partially offset by a decline in cattle. In poultry, there's the latest portfolio of alternatives to antibiotics and medicated feed additives continues to be the primary driver of growth. Swine continued growing in the second quarter, primarily from extended usage of Fostera Gold PCV MH, which we launched in the first quarter of this year. We expect to see continued adoption among our customers through the second of this year as it is the first and only vaccine to include two genotypes of PCV2, both 2a and 2b. In the beef cattle business, sales of cattle products declined due to increased competition of certain medicated feed additives. As anticipated, the dairy cattle business continued to experience pressure with lower dairy prices and limited producer profitability. This led to a decline in sales of our MFAs and intramammaries. Now moving on to the rest of the P&L, I will cover a few key line items and then discuss guidance for 2018. Adjusted gross margin of 68.7% increased approximately 300 basis points in the quarter on a reported basis and reflects favorable pricing, mix, reduced inventory waste and a benefit of continued cost improvements and efficiencies in our manufacturing network. Operating expenses in total grew 7% operationally versus the same period last year. The growth in operating expenses this quarter is primarily impacted by R&D growth of 16% and reflects increased investments in areas such as monoclonal antibodies, for chronic pain, and other pipeline programs. We also realized higher spend in SG&A primarily due to increased compensation related costs. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.1%. The tax rate in the quarter is significantly lower than the rate from a comparable 2017 period due to the favorable impact of U.S. tax reform. Adjusted net income for the quarter grew 37% operationally through a combination of strong revenue growth, cost improvements to manufacturing and a lower effective tax rate. As previously communicated, we were able to create strong operating leverage while investing in strategic areas of future growth for Zoetis. Now moving to guidance for the full year 2018. We continue to perform in line with our expectations. However, we are making certain adjustments to reflect the unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates that have occurred since our last update as well as to include the partial year impact of the Abaxis acquisition based upon our preliminary estimates. Starting with revenue, foreign exchange rates negatively impacted revenue versus prior guidance by approximately $125 million. With the addition of Abaxis as well as other operational drivers we are maintaining the high end of the range at $5.8 billion and increasing the lower end of the range to $5.7 billion. We still expect to achieve operational growth of 5% to 7% excluding any impact from Abaxis. Including Abaxis partial year revenue, which consist of five months of domestics activity and four months of International, our operational revenue growth increases to a range of 7% to 9%. Implicit in our updated full year guidance are certain impacts in Q4 that I want to remind you as you think about the remainder of the year. Our business in Q4 2017 was very strong, so growth off its higher base will moderate. U. S. livestock is one area where we experienced an exceptionally strong Q4. In addition, the fourth quarter of this year will also include four fewer International selling days compared to last year, resulting from the change in our accounting calendar implemented this year. Please note that from an EPS growth perspective, the second half of 2018 will be impacted by the timing of cost of sales, which were higher in the first half of 2017 when compared to the second half of 2017. For SG&A and R&D, we're increasing both the low and high ends of the range primarily due to the impact of the Abaxis acquisition. Adjusted interest expense is increasing to approximately $200 million to reflect the financing of the Abaxis acquisition. Our guidance for the adjusted effective tax rate has been lowered to approximately 20% from our previous range of 21% to 22%, primarily due to the impact of favorable discrete, non-recurring items, resulting from the implementation of U.S. tax reform. For adjusted diluted EPS even with the negative foreign exchange impact of $0.07 and the slightly diluted impact of the Abaxis acquisition this year, we're maintaining the high end of the range at $3.10 and increasing the low end of the range to $3. Please note that our range for reported diluted EPS includes preliminary estimates for certain significant items and purchase accounting for the Abaxis acquisition. Finally, we repurchased nearly $400 million of our shares in the first half of the year and our guidance grew reported and adjusted earnings per share, reflects the shares repurchased through the end of Q2. Now to summarize before we move to Q&A. We've delivered consistent operational revenue growth in the first half of the year with balanced contributions across all key markets and all four species. We are well positioned to meet our guidance for the year and anticipate continued positive trends in our key products and markets. Our diversity, geographical presence and ability to innovate, will continue to provide a platform for growth that is in line with or faster than the market. The Abaxis integration is well underway and will allow us to unlock the value of the revenue growth opportunities in the diagnostic market and further support our customers across the full continuum of care. We will also continue to invest both internally and externally to support sound investments in our business and return excess capital to shareholders. Now I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?
Operator: We will take our first question from Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi, thanks. On U.S. livestock, can you speak to the quarterly progression and your visibility there on in the second half? I guess, particularly across the cattle segment in particular, and how confident you are in sort of a better trend there? And then also maybe some of the seasonal aspect on the U.S. companion animal business? And how we should be thinking about the quarterly progression there as well? Thanks.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you, Erin. And, well, we see the U.S. livestock has not changed compared to previous projections. Despite of the trade situation, we expect that the U.S. livestock will be showing positive growth in 2018. We also mentioned at the beginning of the year that on this market growth, we expect cattle and poultry product is already growing in line with the market, and swine growing faster than the market and our forecast remain the same. The only change compared to what we estimated at the beginning of the year was the dairy segment, where the performance is below expectations for the market, and we also expected a recovery in the second half. And now our estimate is it will be taking longer and will not be until 2019. Just to summarize our performance in the first half. So livestock grew in the U.S. by 2%. And for total Zoetis the growth was 5%. And this confirms again that our geographical diversity is helping us to manage our economic cycles, regulatory changes or now even trade war. The fundamentals of livestock remain the same and the consumption of animal proteins to continue growing, and the needed to keep animals healthy and productive is the same as we have been communicating before. So with all these, we expect that at end of the year, livestock in the U.S. and also the livestock worldwide will be growing and we'll be growing in line or faster than the market. Maybe also Glenn can add to my comments on the second half of the year.
Glenn C. David - Zoetis, Inc.: Erin, just one thing to consider as you look at the quarterly progression of livestock in the second half, just a reminder that in Q4 of 2017 in the U.S. in particular, we had a particularly strong U.S. livestock performance in growth across all of its species. So that will be a challenge to growth in Q4 in particular.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you, Glenn. Next question please.
Operator: And we'll go next to Kevin Ellich with Craig-Hallum. Please go ahead.
Kevin Ellich - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC: Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Two questions for me, Juan Ramón and Glenn. First off, clearly you guys have laid out a roadmap and strategy for your monoclonal antibodies with Nexvet, Cytopoint and now the collaboration with Regeneron. Could you talk more about, I guess how that's going to develop beyond osteoarthritis and pain? What are other indications you could look for both in companion and maybe even livestock? And then for the second half of the year, organic growth has been really strong the first half. What factors have you considered in the guidance for the back half besides the tough comps? Have you input anything there for the potential impacts on the tariffs and other livestock headwinds that you just talked about? Thanks.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you, Kevin. I will cover the monoclonal antibody question and then Glenn will respond on the organic growth in the second quarter. Definitely, monoclonal antibodies is an area of significant investment for Zoetis. We have seen first opportunities for Cytopoint and this has been something that is developing extremely well. So the reaction of the market has been exceeding the initial expectations. And we also saw opportunities on developing products, as you said, for osteoarthritis, pain, and also very important attacks (32:39). These programs are progressing very well. We are combining many different programs that came from Nexvet, but also internal programs as they were part of our R&D activity. And beyond pain, we also see opportunities in renal, we see opportunities on oncology, and we are also developing programs for livestock. These programs are not as advanced as companion animal, but we remain confident that also monoclonal antibodies will provide opportunities in livestock, especially in feed enhancement. That is an area that also we'll be replacing existing technologies with new technologies that will be more acceptable for consumers for retailers. Glenn?
Glenn C. David - Zoetis, Inc.: And, Kevin, in terms of your question in terms of the applied slower organic growth in the second half of the year, it is really mainly driven by the tough comps that we have, particularly in Q4, and again related to U.S. livestock. Just a couple of other things to point out, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we do have four fewer calendar days in the International business in Q4 of 2018 versus Q4 2017, which also provides a tougher comp. And then there are just, as you look at some of our growth portfolio, particularly derm, the growth comes off of a higher base as we mature through the year. So those are some of the factors that would indicate slightly slower growth in the second half of the year versus the first half.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Next question, please.
Operator: We'll take the next question from John Kreger with William Blair. Please go ahead.
Jon Kaufman - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi, good morning. This is Jon Kaufman on for Kreger. So a question on poultry for you. One of the major producers recently remarked that chicken demand was a little bit sluggish, and that's end market chicken demand. I believe they cited other meats being cheaper than normal as the cause. Do you see any impact to your poultry business in the near and medium term as a result of these dynamics?
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: We have seen that – for us, the poultry business has been performing very well in this first half. We continue creating growth in the second half. So as we explained many times, maybe some market they will be facing some challenge. But the consumption of chicken is growing, and we have seen growth in many international markets. Maybe the only area where we saw some negative evolution was Brazil, and this was a result of also the strike, where the transportation strike was limiting the transportation of food to some of the poultry farms, and this created somewhat challenging situation for producers. But Brazil is where we had probably the lesser penetration in terms of poultry. Overall, we remained positive about poultry. And in poultry, we have not only vaccines and pharmaceuticals, but we're also providing devices for vaccination, in-ovo vaccination. And also we have to be adding also automation with (36:08). So overall we remain positive about poultry. Next question please.
Operator: And we'll go next to Louise Chen with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.
Louise Chen - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to clarify some of the points of your guidance raise. We've been getting questions on that this morning. So first thing is just on the Abaxis portion. Can you clarify if that was actually accretive or dilutive from a model line perspective, and how that's changed or has that stayed the same to what you've previously said? And then maybe a little bit more color on the tax element of the change in the guidance? And then was this upside for organic growth in the second half of 2018? Thanks.
Glenn C. David - Zoetis, Inc.: So in terms of Abaxis and its impact to EPS, so similar to what we've indicated prior, in 2018 we do expect Abaxis to be slightly dilutive to earnings when you include the funding of the acquisition. We do expect that our first full year of operations when we're able to generate both the revenue upside and some of the expense savings that we expect to generate that it will be slightly accretive to earnings. So we do expect it to be accretive to earnings in 2019. But in 2018, it is slightly dilutive. In terms of the tax change and the guidance, we have previously guided to an adjusted effective tax rate of 21% to 22%. Because of some favorable discrete items that we've experienced year to date and some of that we may experience in the following quarters as well, we've updated that guidance to approximately 20%. But again, those are just certain discrete items that don't necessarily carry forward into 2019 and beyond. In terms of the organic growth for the second half of the year, again similar, I think, to some of the comments that we've made. We do have certain challenges, particularly in Q4 of 2017 (sic) [2018] from a prior-year comp perspective that will negatively impact our growth. And also we do have a four fewer calendar days in the International segment in Q4.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Next question please.
Operator: The next question comes from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Michael Ryskin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi. This is Mike Ryskin on for Derik. Congrats on another strong quarter guys. A couple of quick questions. One on the Simparica Trio that you announced, just a little bit more clarity into the timing and the expectations forward and the market, any expectation for U.S. versus Europe? And I recognize, a lot of that's up to the regulatory agencies. And then on the 2020 timing is it more about – should we think about it the same way as we do all the flea and tick drugs where you want to launch 1Q to sort of be fully ramped by the mid-year summer and therefore that's why you're a little cautious with the regulatory pathways? And then on the SG&A really quick, you've highlighted earlier throughout the year that the increased OpEx both SG&A and R&D sort of just reinvest back in the business? And then with the updated guidance today, I just want to be clear. Is the guide update for SG&A and R&D entirely just rolling Abaxis into the model, or is there any incremental spend? And you talk about the spend you're doing in the diagnostics sales force that you talked about earlier?
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you, Mike. On Simparica Trio, as you said, it depends on regulatory approvals. But as I said, we feel confident that the registration packets of these products is strong and we'll be able really to gain approval to launch the product in 2020. Definitely we'll be launching the product in the first quarter. But we don't know at this point it will be in the first quarter or midyear. So definitely we'll be working to accelerate as much as possible all the approval. But it depends on third-parties approval and we don't know exactly when we'll be able to bring this product into the market. And Glenn will cover the question on OpEx.
Glenn C. David - Zoetis, Inc.: So, Mike, in terms of SG&A and R&D, as you did mention a big part of the raise in the guidance there is related to Abaxis. But there are other operational factors driving some incremental R&D and SG&A. We mentioned the acquisition of Smartbow, while not material from upfront investment perspective. There are certain ongoing costs to developing those products and they hit both the SG&A and the R&D line. So that's another key area of growth in SG&A and R&D.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: And, Mike, I don't think I responded about the timing for the U.S. and Europe. In both big market we expect approval in 2020. So, next question please.
Operator: We'll go next to David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yes. Thanks very much. I joined the call late, so I apologize if any of these questions were asked. But could you please comment on the key considerations for the third quarter, sequentially, relative to the second quarter of 2018 that you just reported? And then, if you could provide any updates on the triple combo? Once again I joined late, so if you're already addressed you could ignore that? Thank you.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you, Dave. And that's all right. I just answered the question on the Simparica Trio. I mentioned that we expect this product to reach the market in 2020 in both U.S. and International. International will be European Union. And Glenn, do you want to answer the question on the sequential?
Glenn C. David - Zoetis, Inc.: Sure. In terms of any sequential guidance. So, obviously, we don't necessarily guide to any particular quarter. But in terms of any major changes to growth, it really is the Q4 2018 drivers that we referenced are the things to note. In our Q3, no major changes versus the first half of the year.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Next question, please.
Operator: The next question is from Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Just I have a couple longer term questions. One, it seems inevitable that there will be more competition in atopic dermatitis space. My question is whether you think those new (42:44) launches can come on fast enough and be large enough and profitable enough so that you can continue companion growth in revenue and profits continuously over the next three to five years? And secondly, I realize it's very early on Abaxis. But I was hoping you could talk, at least preliminarily, about the longer term opportunity to leverage that new capability across the food animal setting? Thanks.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you, Gregg. Well, we mentioned usually that we expect competition for our derm portfolio. We expect competition in the future for Apoquel and also for Cytopoint. We have now very strong position in the market. We also have a product that has demonstrated very strong, safety and efficacy profile. And we are very confident that we will be able to continue defending our franchise successfully in the future. Definitely we have been growing very fast. We expect that at some point we will be reaching a level of penetration that will be difficult to continue growing. But we still have a lot of opportunities in International markets where we far off reaching this level of penetration in terms of patients. And in some countries like China the product is not available and we expect Apoquel reaching China and also generating very positive growth. So in summary we are confident that we have very strong position, we have great two products, and definitely we expect that we will be able to protect and defend this franchise that has been created by Zoetis. In terms of Abaxis, we see both short-term and long-term opportunities. We mentioned that the short-term will be for International markets where the level of use of diagnostic tools is extremely lower than in the U.S. And now with our presence and the combination of our portfolio with diagnostics and adding the field force that we have in International market we expect to generate short-term growth. In longer term definitely we see two opportunities. One is to continue bring innovation and we are confident that with Abaxis together with SMB and also our internal groups, we'll be able to continue bring the innovation in companion animals, but also very important now with Abaxis, we have the opportunity to reassign resources to develop a portfolio for livestock. And in livestock we see a significant opportunity in where there is no any existing diagnostic company having any penetration in this market. This market is served mainly from reference lab, farmers or veterinarians in livestock sending samples to reference labs, getting the information back in one to three days. We see the opportunities of bringing point-of-care diagnostic tools into the farms and creating an information that will be very important to protect the animals and also may be with the opportunity also to expand the use and the compliance in livestock. Next question, please?
Operator: We'll go next to Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Divya Harikesh - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good morning, this is Divya Harikesh on behalf of Jami Rubin. I have two questions. One with the Abaxis deal now closed, can you provide more color on the cost efficiencies and where we can expect that to come from? You have mentioned that you continue to expect the 200 basis points improvement in gross margins, but can you help us think about how we should think about the operating margins with respect to your accretion in 2019 and longer term as well? The second question following-up on an earlier question on the dermatology franchise, given the momentum – and you said that the U.S. will reach a level of penetration soon – can you help frame expectations of what do you think that franchise could look like in terms of peak sales or at what level of sales do you think that they would get to maturity? Thank you so much.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: So, thank you. And maybe a clarification on the level of penetration in the U.S. In the U.S. in the second quarter, we have reached 61% patient share, so we still see opportunities to continue to growing in this franchise. What I'm saying is that, well, we will be reaching in the future a level of penetration that that will be difficult to continue growing but not at this point. At this point, we still see two opportunities in the U.S. One is increasing the awareness and increasing the demand for treating dermatology issues and also increasing the penetration on patient share. Then moving to the cost efficiency in Abaxis, Glenn, do you want to cover this question?
Glenn C. David - Zoetis, Inc.: Yeah. So, in terms of the impact of Abaxis on our margins moving forward, so from a gross margin perspective, cost of goods for Abaxis are a little higher than what we have for the remaining portfolio of Zoetis. So it will be somewhat of a negative impact but we still do expect to achieve the 200 basis points of improvement from 2017 to 2020 within our gross margins. When you think about more to an operating margin level because of our ability to leverage our existing infrastructure, we do believe that over the next coming years we'll achieve the same operating margins that we would have without Abaxis. So we expect to be able to continue to grow our operating margin but, again, the focus continues to be on growing cash and profitable income growth.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: And maybe one comment on the cost efficiencies in Abaxis. So the Abaxis acquisition is not driven by cost efficiency. We will be generating short-term cost efficiencies but the cost efficiency will be fully realized in the 2019. You also ask about this 200 basis points of improvement in cost. Maybe, Glenn, you can cover that. Many of these costs has been already generated in 2018, so it's not that we are still targeting 200 basis points of improvement from now, so some of this has been also coming in this quarter.
Glenn C. David - Zoetis, Inc.: So, the 200 basis point improvement, as we mentioned, was off the 2017 base where our cost of goods was approximately 33% at that period of time. We've guided for 2018 approximately 32%, so we'd expect about 100 basis point improvement year-over-year, which would then lead to about another 100 basis point improvement by the year 2020. So we're well on our way to achieving that goal and expect to be able to deliver that.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you. Next question, please.
Operator: We'll go next to David Westenberg with C.L. King. Please go ahead.
David Westenberg - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Some quick ones on Abaxis. Do you anticipate any product repositioning with Abaxis, particularly in context with how you're going to sell the products SMB products and CARYSTA? And then as a follow-up to that, just on – the 10-Q hasn't dropped yet, so just where in the product segmentation are you going to be putting Abaxis? Thank you very much.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Well, now we have a combined portfolio with Abaxis/SMB, but we don't think that at this point there are products which are in conflict or in competition. They are products that can be managed very well. And now we have the opportunity to combine the field force of Abaxis that has been increasing in 2018. And with our field force and the plan now – from now to the next coming months is to ensure that both field forces are fully aligned and both field forces they have their level of technical information that will be supporting this new portfolio. So we are very confident that we'll be defending Abaxis in international markets as well as in the U.S. with now stronger presence in the market.
Glenn C. David - Zoetis, Inc.: And in terms of Abaxis reporting, Abaxis is going to be fully integrated into our operating structure, so therefore it will not be reported as a standalone segment. We will, however, provide transparency to the revenue performance of the diagnostics business moving forward. Just one point, you mentioned this quarter's 10-Q. since we did not own the business in Q2, we'll not be reporting on Abaxis revenues within the 10-Q.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Next question, please.
Operator: The next question is from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Great, thank you and good morning. Could you please comment on the recent announcement from the FDA about a new five-year blueprint regarding antimicrobial stewardship? How is this incrementally different relative to the prior initiatives and directives and what the impact could be for you? And I apologize if I missed this but could you provide Apoquel and Cytopoint sales by U.S. and ex-U.S. as well as for Simparica? Thank you.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you for the questions, Alex. I think that the FDA five-year blueprint, in our opinion, is consistent with previous approaches in terms of anti-infectives or antibiotics. We don't think that this will have a significant negative impact to Zoetis. We already mentioned that in antibiotics we expect that they will be growing maybe half of the growth rate of the animal health industry. This is part of our model. This is part of our prediction. We continue also working on having a portfolio that is much more balanced and less dependent on antibiotics. If you compare the portfolio of antibiotics or the weight of our revenues in 2013 through the weight of antibiotics in 2018, this has been decreased significantly. But we are still very confident that we have a very strong portfolio of antibiotics – injectables and antibiotics that can be used by veterinarians in a way that is protecting animals and not creating additional resistance in human health. So we are confident that we'll be able really to maintain our position and support our portfolio of antibiotics. You also asked about the breakdown between dermatology sales U.S.-International as well as Simparica. Glenn?
Glenn C. David - Zoetis, Inc.: In terms of total derm sales for the quarter, we had $143 million in total. Of that, $100 million was the U.S., $42 million was International, so obviously some rounding there. In terms of Apoquel for the quarter, we had total sales of $110 million, with $73 million being the U.S. and $37 million being International. And with that, you could calculate Cytopoint. From a Simparica perspective, we had total sales of $51 million, with $30 million being U.S. and $21 million International.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Next question, please.
Operator: The next question is from Kathy Miner with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.
Kathy M. Miner - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you, good morning. I have two questions. First, on your first quarter call you provided a nice update on the potential impact of tariffs or lack thereof on your U.S. pork business – swine business. Could you give us an update as things have progressed since then, and maybe also comment whether the increased tariffs in Mexico are having any impact to your outlook? And the second question is on aquaculture. I don't think we've talked about that today. Just give us an update. I know the second half of the year is usually stronger. Do you expect that to continue, and what kind of growth can we look for later this year and into 2019? Thank you.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you, Kathy. The impact from tariffs is something that is evolving every day, because it can be a – maybe some additional tariff applied to China. But our estimate for 2018 is that there definitely will be some small impact on swine because of the exportations to China. But to put things into perspective, so the total swine in the U.S. represent about 3% of our total revenues. 80% of the production in the U.S. is for local consumption and 20% is for export. On this 20%, 10% to 12% is exportations to China. So even if there may be some impact, the total revenues exported to China or as royalty, represent less than 0.1%. So definitely it's an area that we are concerned because it's affecting our customers in the U.S. But at the same time, as I mentioned, before our global presence it's also protecting us for this type of economic cycles or regulatory situations or even trade wars. And we know that the consumption would remain strong, and we have a significant presence of swine activity in many other parts of the world. You had also asked about Pharmaq performance in the second quarter. Glenn, do you want to comment on that?
Glenn C. David - Zoetis, Inc.: Yes, so Pharmaq had sales of $24 million in Q2, which was growth of about 13% operationally, which is really driven by the increased adoption of our LiVac SRS vaccine in Chile. As we did indicate previously, 2018 we don't expect to achieve the same level of growth as we saw in 2017, as in 2017 we saw very rapid adoption of the PD vaccine in Norway, as we displaced a competitor following a legal victory. That being said there, we still expect Pharmaq to grow at a faster pace than the overall Zoetis business in 2018.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Next question, please.
Operator: The next question is from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great, thanks very much for the questions. Just a couple on Abaxis and the International opportunity. I think you mentioned that as a shorter-term growth opportunity, but when we think about the ramp of that business and taking advantage of your larger footprint, is that something where we just expect a significant step up in 2019, or is that a multiyear process? And when you think longer term about the Abaxis mix, I think Zoetis right now is about 50% U.S., 50% ex-U.S. by revenue. Is it reasonable to think about Abaxis getting into that type of split over time? And then my final question was just a quick update on capital deployment priorities post the transaction. Thank you.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you, Chris. Well, first, we're penetrating International markets with the new portfolio of diagnostic equipment; we are now building the presence in this International market. When I say building the presence, we need to have the technical people that will be in charge of selling and also installing and the plan is use our existing field force to complement this effort. This was already planned even before the acquisition of Abaxis, because when we acquired SMB, we saw the opportunity of building this infrastructure to support the future portfolio. Now with Abaxis, we are accelerating even more these plans to have the presence that we think is needed to support the growth in International markets. But it's something that we've planned to generate – well, most of this impact will be coming in 2019 and the following years. You were asking about the long-term. It could be reaching 50%-50%. I think it's too early to say. And we still need to have a better understanding of what will be the level adoption of equipment in International markets. Again, so International markets is a combination of developed market with developing markets. And – well, definitely it will be part of our analysis – full analysis and also we'll be really targeting to maximize opportunities. But at this point, it's difficult to predict it will be 50%-50%. In terms of capital allocation, Glenn will cover, but there is no change and we remain committed with the principles that we communicated before. Glenn?
Glenn C. David - Zoetis, Inc.: Yes, Chris, as Juan Ramón indicated, there really is no change to our capital allocation and priorities moving forward. When you look at the current level of operating cash flow that we have and the strength of our balance sheet, we're able to fund almost the full consideration and still stay within our targeted gross debt to adjusted EBITDA range of 2.5 to 3. So that still leaves us the financial flexibility to fund future strategic investments and also return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. So really no change to our capital allocation priorities post-Abaxis.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Next question, please.
Operator: We'll go next to Kevin Ellich with Craig-Hallum. Please go ahead.
Kevin Ellich - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC: Actually all my follow up questions have been answered. Thanks.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you. Next please.
Operator: And it appears we have no further questions. I'll return the floor to Juan Ramón for any closing comments.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you for joining us today and thank you for your questions. And as a conclusion, we remain very positive about our performance and not the performance in the quarter but also our future performance. And we are very much on track to deliver our objectives for 2018 and we continue investing in ensuring that we'll be generating a future growth through our core portfolio but now also through the extended portfolio with diagnostics and other areas in where we are also investing. So thank you very much for your attention today.
Operator: This will conclude today's program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.

Operator: Good day, and welcome to the First Quarter 2018 Financial Results Conference Call and Webcast for Zoetis. Hosting the call today is Steve Frank, Vice President of Investor Relations for Zoetis. The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, and will not be forwarded automatically. In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call via dial-in or on the Investor Relations section of Zoetis. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the floor will be open for your questions following the presentation. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.
Steve Frank - Zoetis, Inc.: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Zoetis first quarter 2018 earnings call. I am joined today by Juan Ramón Alaix, our Chief Executive Officer and Glenn David, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website, and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements, and that actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statements in today's press release and our SEC filings, including, but not limited to, our Annual Report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q. Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release, and the company's 8-K filing dated today, May 2, 2018. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. With that, I will turn the call over to Juan Ramón.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. Let me start by saying that the fundamental drivers of the animal health industry remain strong. The adoption of pets and focus on their health and their wellness are leading to a steady increase in medicalization rates, as well as more interest in specialty care products. A growing world population continues to require more efficient production of meat, eggs, fish and dairy products. Our livestock customers may face economic cycles, weather conditions, as well as fluctuations in their input cost and prices. These type of cycles will always exist, but the underlying need for healthy animals to produce safe and affordable food is essential. As a leader in animal health, Zoetis has stayed well positioned to support our customers. We have been able to discover, develop and deliver valuable products and services to them, based on our best-in-class combination of direct sales, R&D and manufacturing capabilities. This has been our formula for success, and it remains that way in 2018. In the first quarter, we continued generating profitable revenue growth, thanks to the quality and the diversity of our portfolio; also the innovations we bring to the market and the value we deliver to our customers. We achieved 7% operational growth in revenue, driven by the performance of our dermatology portfolio, as well as new products including vaccines. We generated growth in the U.S. and across our major international markets, based on the sustained effort of our field force and targeted investments for the launch of new products and the support of our in-line portfolio. We also grew our adjusted net income by 34% operationally, based on revenue growth, improvement to our gross margin and the benefits from the recently enacted U.S. tax reform. In terms of more revenue return, our Companion Animal products grew 11% operationally, and we expect another year of above-market growth in this part of our business. We see further opportunities for gaining share and expanding the market for our innovative dermatology products. We are extending our derm portfolio into new markets internationally, and putting our sales and marketing efforts behind them. In the U.S. and in other select markets, we are continuing digital and direct-to-consumer campaign to expand awareness around atopic dermatitis and also to increase the overall category spend on canine itch. Our new parasiticide products based on the sarolaner molecule, Simparica, a chewable tablet for dogs, and Stronghold Plus, a topical formulation for cats, are also contributing to growth in Companion Animal products in the first quarter, along with our new canine influenza bivalent vaccine. All of this was developed internally at Zoetis and illustrates a positive return on our R&D investment. On the Livestock side of our business, we generated 6% operational growth, led by stronger performance in our poultry products and growth in cattle and swine products as well. The conditions in the livestock market are stable and we expect to grow our cattle, poultry, swine and fish products in line with or faster than the overall market. There are excellent growth opportunities in animal health across the cycle of healthcare, from prediction and prevention to protection and treatment. And we are using our stronger financial position to support investment for growth. The investment in R&D is a top priority for Zoetis, and we see opportunities to enhance our product line with new lifecycle innovation and to make new breakthrough discoveries. In the first quarter, for example, we expanded our Fostera swine vaccine franchise with the approval in the U.S. of Fostera Gold PCV and Hyo. This is the first ever vaccine to contain both genotypes of PCV2 – 2a and 2b and a study show it provide cross protection against the leading 2d genotype. It also provide the long duration for commercial PCV2 combination vaccines at 23 weeks. As I said, we'll maintain DTC advertising and other digital marketing campaigns similar to last year, and we have started increasing our field force support in diagnostics in key markets. We are also executing our plans in manufacturing investments, which I have discussed recently. In fact, last week we held a groundbreaking ceremony in Suzhou, China for a new facility that will enable us to expand our vaccine manufacturing and R&D in that country. As always, we'll identify and scrutinize external acquisitions and partnerships in areas where we have our gaps or where we can achieve more value from an existing business or asset. In closing, we remain confident in the strength of our company and the opportunities to offer customers more integrated solutions across the entire cycle of healthcare. With this approach and our proven business model, we can generate long term growth for Zoetis and value for our shareholders. With that, let me hand things over to Glenn, who will provide more details on our first quarter results and full year 2018 guidance.
Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you, Juan Ramón, and good morning, everyone. As Juan Ramón indicated, we performed well again in the first quarter, delivering operational revenue growth above historical trends for the market and we grew adjusted net income at a faster rate than revenue. Total company revenue in the first quarter grew 7% operationally excluding a favorable 4% impact from foreign exchange. Revenue growth in the quarter was driven by our in line portfolio which includes our key dermatology products. We also saw growth in new products, price and a strong Livestock performance across both our international and U.S. segments. The breakdown of our 7% growth was 2% from price and 5% from volume. Of the 5% volume, 2% was from new products and 3% was from in line products including 2% from our key dermatology products. We experienced balanced growth again this quarter as virtually all therapeutic areas, key markets and core species contributed to revenue growth. Adjusted net income grew 34% operationally, driven by revenue growth, gross margin improvement and a lower effective tax rate. Our key dermatology portfolio, comprised of APOQUEL and CYTOPOINT, once again surpassed the $100 million mark in revenue with sales in the quarter reaching $122 million. As we indicated on our earnings call last quarter, we expect to achieve more than $500 million in combined sales from APOQUEL and CYTOPOINT for the full year 2018. Now let's discuss segment revenue. International revenue grew 11% operationally in the first quarter with Companion Animal operational growth of 19%, and Livestock operational growth of 7%. Companion Animal growth was largely driven by our key dermatology products APOQUEL and CYTOPOINT, new products such as Simparica and Stronghold Plus and increased medicalization rates in key emerging markets such as China and Brazil. Livestock benefited from growing demand for animal protein, new product introductions and the success of our field force. Turning to some notable market performances in the quarter. In China, we grew 14% operationally, largely due to strength in Companion Animal, which increasingly represents a larger portion of our business there. An increasing companion animal population and medicalization of pets contributed to this growth. And our Fel-O-Vax vaccine continues to perform well as the only registered vaccine available for cats on the market. In Brazil, sales grew 7% operationally with contributions from both the Companion Animal and Livestock businesses. Higher Companion Animal revenue in Brazil benefited from the continued growth of Simparic due to a strong return on the direct to consumer investment, co-promotion with key in line products such as Revolution and higher vet clinic penetration. In cattle, investments in our field force have led to increased penetration and coverage in key regions within the market and we continue to see favorable export market conditions. In swine, increased sales of Vivax, or Improvac as it's known elsewhere, were driven by higher usage and greater penetration with larger customers. These increases were tempered by a decline in poultry. Other markets also contributed to growth. Japan experienced operational revenue growth of 17% in the quarter with positive performance across all species. Growth came from APOQUEL as a result of the timing of distributor purchases last year and the additional market penetration we achieved in the first quarter. Australia grew 14% operationally with strength across all species, particularly poultry and cattle. In poultry, the growth was driven by an installation of hatchery devices related to KL Products, which was acquired in 2015. In cattle, our vaccine business grew due to strong beef prices and the rebuilding of the herd and the market. Other emerging markets, particularly Russia and Poland, performed well. Russia had increased sales of medicated feed additives in poultry. And in Poland, we had the benefit of milk price stabilization and a cattle sector recovery based on producer consolidation. To summarize, a very strong quarter for our international segment with growth across a diversified portfolio. Favorable market conditions, a return on strategic investments in our portfolio and field force and a focus on execution are all helping to consistently drive commercial results. Turning to the U.S., revenue grew 5% in the first quarter with all species contributing to growth. Companion Animal grew 6% while Livestock grew 4%. Companion Animal sales in the quarter were driven primarily by our dermatology portfolio and a number of recently launched products. These gains were partially offset by decreases in certain in line products and Simparica. U.S. dermatology sales were $83 million for the quarter with both APOQUEL and CYTOPOINT exhibiting strong growth over the same quarter in the prior year. As anticipated, Q1 revenue was in line with Q4 and we expect higher sales in Q2 and Q3 with the warmer weather driving seasonal activity. Simparica declined over the same quarter of 2017 due to the timing of customer purchases in Q1 and Q2 of last year. We expect this product to grow in Q2 as we continue to gain clinic penetration and market share and realize the benefit of our direct to consumer investments which we are maintaining in 2018. Additional contributions to Companion Animal growth came from new product launches including our VANGUARD canine bivalent flu vaccine and DIROBAN for the treatment of heartworm. Partially offsetting growth in our Companion Animal business was the continued impact of expected competition on REVOLUTION, RIMADYL and CLAVAMOX. Our U.S. Livestock business continued to grow in the first quarter, building off a strong fourth quarter with sales increasing 4%, thanks to the positive performance across all species. Colder and more volatile weather conditions across parts of the continental U.S. led to a greater risk of disease outbreak and incidence and this supported the sales of premium products. Our beef cattle business also benefited from higher numbers of animals moving through feedlots than in the comparable period in 2017. The positive performance in beef was partially offset by dairy where reduction in herds due to lower dairy prices led to declines in sales of our anti-infectives and intramammaries. In poultry, the Zoetis portfolio of alternatives to antibiotics in medicated feed additives continues to be the primary driver of growth. Swine returned to growth in the first quarter. We are starting to see the benefits of our investments in our Fostera vaccine line including the launch of Fostera Gold PCV M. hyo and we expect further contribution in future quarters. Now moving on to the rest of the P&L. I will cover a few key line items and then discuss guidance for 2018. Adjusted gross margin of 67.5% increased approximately 300 basis points in the quarter on a reported basis and reflects the benefit of continued cost improvements and efficiencies in our manufacturing network. Operating expenses in total grew 6% operationally versus the same period last year. This reflects an increased investment in R&D in areas such as diagnostics and monoclonal antibodies for chronic pain. We also realized higher spend in SG&A, primarily due to increased compensation related costs. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 18.2%. The tax rate in the quarter is significantly lower than the rate from the comparable 2017 period due to the favorable impact of recently enacted U.S. tax reform and the benefit of certain discrete items such as the vesting of employee equity awards. We do, however, anticipate a higher effective tax rate for the remainder of the year in line with our guidance. Adjusted net income for the quarter grew 34% operationally through a combination of strong revenue growth, cost improvements in manufacturing and a lower effective tax rate. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 36% operationally in the quarter versus the same period in 2017. Now moving to guidance for full year 2018. The year is off to a solid start, as expected. We are therefore reaffirming our 2018 guidance provided during our February earnings call. Please note that this is shown representing foreign exchange rates as of mid-April. For the year, we continue to expect to achieve operational revenue growth of 5% to 7% and operational growth in adjusted net income of 20% to 26%. In the fourth quarter, we will have comparisons to a strong U.S. Livestock performance and less calendar days due to a change in our accounting calendar. Finally, we repurchased nearly $200 million of our shares in the first quarter and our guidance for reported and adjusted earnings per share reflects the shares repurchased through Q1. Just to summarize, before we go to Q&A. We're off to a good start with balanced growth across our portfolio including markets, therapeutic areas and species. We're seeing a balance contribution to growth across our in line portfolio, price and new products from our pipeline of novel innovation and lifecycle management. Our diversity, geographic presence and ability to innovate will continue to provide a platform for growth that is in line with or faster than the market. And we will continue to invest both internally and externally to support sound investments in our business and return excess capital to shareholders. With that, I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our first question from John Kreger with William Blair. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks very much. Juan Ramón, can you talk a little bit about all the discussion about tariffs in recent months? Have you seen that impact your Livestock business at all? And maybe related to that, if we see changes in NAFTA, do you see any exposure to your U.S. Livestock business? Thanks.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you, John. We have not seen any impact on price in our Livestock business. Definitely, yeah, that is something that can have an impact on some of the U.S. producers. Same time, because of our international presence and because the consumption of animal proteins will remain the same, we expect that anything which is not produced in the U.S. because of the implementation of a tariff will be supplied by other markets where we also have activity. But maybe talking to two areas that represent the biggest concerns, one is China and the tariff on the importation of pork. Our swine business in the U.S. represent 3% of our total revenue. 80% of the production in the U.S. is for local consumption and about 20% is for export. But in the case of exports, China only represent about 10% of these 20% of exports. So for our total revenues, this is something that would not have any impact. Definitely, we want to support our U.S. customers and I think it's something that we'll continue working to ensure that they manage any impact. What percent of bigger impact is the NAFTA discussions. Definitely the export to Canada, the export to Mexico are significant and hopefully the U.S. government will achieve a good agreement with these two countries and they will continue supporting agriculture and livestock in the U.S. So next question, please.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Kevin Ellich with Craig-Hallum. Please go ahead.
Kevin Ellich - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC: Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess Juan Ramón and Glenn, could you give us a little bit more detail on your capital allocation priorities and capital structure? You increased the dividend 20%. You bought back more stock this quarter than you had in the past. I guess, how do you prioritize things and what's your outlook for strategic M&A? Thanks.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you, Kevin. And our capital allocation priorities remain the same. So we'll continue investing internally. We have been showing that these investments are having a high return. This year we are increasing our capital expenditure in manufacturing to ensure that we have the capacity and the capabilities that will be needed to support future growth. We'll continue investing in DTC to support key programs and we are expanding our field force to support diagnostic portfolio in the future. We'll continue also assessing external opportunities at divisions. We'll remain focused on anything that will meet the criterias of a strategic asset, and also value creation, and it is something that we are regulating the cash really to contemplate this type of acquisition, but at the same time will remain very disciplined on ensuring that the return generated is through any type of external position. And we'll continue paying dividends and also buying share backs in line with what we have been communicated in previous discussions.
Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.: Yeah, and the only thing I'll add, Kevin, as Juan Ramón said, our priorities haven't changed. However, we continue to have additional capacity and flexibility to execute on those priorities. And as we mentioned, our cash flow generation continues to increase also with tax reform. We have more flexibility and access to that cash and as you indicated in terms of your question around dividends versus share repurchase, we continue to prefer share repurchase as it does give us flexibility to execute on our other capital allocation priorities.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Next question, please.
Operator: And we'll go next to Louise Chen with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.
Louise Chen - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I'll try to ask Kevin's question a little bit differently. Maybe in terms of the acceleration in your cash flow generation, could you just give us a little more color, metric behind how we should think about that? Maybe the magnitude of increase? And then also the earnings potential of that cash, that's not really reflected in your earnings per share as it is today. So how should we think about how that magnitude could improve over the next several years? Thanks.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Okay. So then, since you are asking a similar question, I will ask Glenn this time to answer to provide a different type of comments.
Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.: In terms of the magnitude of the cash generation and how we expect that to increase particularly for 2018, I think as we look at that, while we don't provide specific guidance on cash generation, for 2018, you could pretty much expect it to increase at the pace of our adjusted net income. So again we'll see continued expense in cash generation, continued flexibility to execute on our capital allocation priorities. Right? Our current guidance for 2018 includes the investments that we have internally. We've also referenced that we expect capital investments to be up in 2018 and then we'll continue to look for business development opportunities that have both the strategic and right financial rationale. To the extent that those materialize, we'll adjust our share repurchases either up or down depending on the magnitude of business development.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Next question, please.
Operator: And we'll go next to Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Unknown Speaker: Hi. This is actually (27:37) on for Erin today. Thanks for taking our question. We would like to ask a question about, how do you think about the quarterly progression of growth in product metrics and where do you think there are potential elements of conservatism in your guide relative to sort of the profit metrics? Thanks.
Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.: So as we indicated, we don't provide necessarily quarterly guidance. A couple things though that we will point out related to the quarter, as we referenced on the call, a change in our accounting calendar. That does provide a slight benefit to growth in revenue, particularly in Q1 and Q3 to the tune of about a half point to a point of growth. That reverses in Q4 where we'll see negative impact to growth from a number of calendar days by about 1% to 2%. The other thing, just to point out from a growth perspective, obviously we face tough comparison in Q4, particularly based on the strength of the U.S. Livestock performance in Q4 2017.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Next question, please.
Operator: We'll go next to Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Michael Ryskin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thanks. This is Mike Ryskin on for Derik. You talked about the competition in the U.S. on the in line products, the REVOLUTION, RIMADYL and then you also mentioned the strength in price for the portfolio overall. In the areas where you're seeing competition, is it more – specifically with those products, is it more in terms of volume? Or are you having a cut price there to sort of adjust for the market? And can you talk about what your expectations are for those products going forward, what levers you can pull to sort of strengthen that? And then also, if actually I can squeeze one more in, on the diagnostics products, you mentioned it's been a few months since you launched that and you talked on it briefly in the prepared remarks. Can you talk about, give us an update on the build-out there with the sales force? Thanks.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you for the questions, Mike. So we reported this quarter in Companion Animal U.S. 6% growth. When we say that we expect that, you say, growth in Companion Animal U.S. will be higher for the total year, we saw some impacts in the first quarter that Glenn will describe, but as I said many times, one of the advantages of Zoetis is the diversity of our portfolio and this diversity in terms of species, in terms of therapeutic areas, geographies. It's helping us to be consistent in terms of generating revenue growth. But maybe Glenn will talk about the impact or some of the problems in line portfolio in the U.S. volume, price and what are expectations that we have moving forward.
Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.: Yeah, in terms of the impact of competition in the U.S., there were three products that especially faced the competition. It was CLAVAMOX, RIMADYL and REVOLUTION. CLAVAMOX, competition was really coming from generic sellers, primarily volume, but some price expense as well. And with CLAVAMOX, we have launched CLAVAMOX Chewables which we do expect will minimize this impact as we move forward. RIMADYL was really impacted by Galliprant and continued penetration of Galliprant and it's really a factor of the comparison year-over-year as the growth in the competition expanded throughout last year. So, we're in the toughest quarter in terms of comparison growth year-over-year. And then REVOLUTION, really Bravecto for cats was the biggest challenge from a competition perspective. And again, more volume competition there.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: And maybe adding that also the parasiticide portfolio including REVOLUTION was affected by a cold March. This is something that we have seen also affecting the overall parasiticide portfolio not only for Zoetis, but also from our competitor. So you also asked about diagnostics. Well, in diagnostics, we continue investing internally to develop our portfolio and we are making progress in this area. We already have products that we are offering to veterinarians, mainly Companion Animal, and what we started it's building our field support and the field support in (32:03) is field forces in all locations (32:06) that will be supporting our current and future portfolio. We started in the U.S. We are now also expanding in key international markets and we'll continue until we complete what we think will be the needs of field support for our diagnostic portfolio. Next question, please.
Operator: We'll go next to David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks very much. I have two questions, please. First with respect to U.S. Companion Animal, the growth of 6% was marginally below what we had expected, but I wanted to ask about the outlook. I know that the comps may be getting a little bit tougher over the course of the year. I just don't have a sense for how to think about U.S. Companion Animal growth prospects in coming quarters. And then second, you're obviously reinvesting in R&D, which has paid off in the past, and the R&D year-over-year growth is accelerating as you invest in, I guess, more expensive R&D projects and you're now past your cost efficiency initiatives in R&D. Could you just talk about the outlook for year-over-year spending growth in R&D as well? Thanks very much.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you, Dave. And we expect higher growth for Companion Animal in the U.S. for the total year. And we expect that the higher growth will be coming from, well, the strong season on parasiticides that is now starting. Also the investment in DTC that has started in the month of April, so no impact in the first quarter. We'll be increasing our campaigns for DTC for increasing awareness on dermatology conditions and also we'll be also investing in DTC for Simparica. So all this should generate expansion of the market in dermatology and also continue grow in terms of a market share for Simparica. So we are optimistic about generating a higher growth in Companion Animal in the U.S. for a total 2018. In terms of the R&D investment, we are increasing our allocation for R&D. We have a strategic program that we are supporting. We also added some additional products with the acquisition of Nexvet that now we are supporting. We are also increasing our allocation for diagnostic R&D as well as increasing also investment in fish. So all this it's really increasing the level of allocation that we are – we are reallocating (35:05) that to R&D, and we are very confident that we'll maintain the same level of total activity that we show in the past. Glenn, if you want to add some additional comments either on the U.S. or R&D, please...
Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.: Yeah. Just to add to the U. S. Companion Animal growth comment. Just one thing to consider particularly for the quarter, the quarter was negatively impacted by Simparica growth in the quarter and that was really driven by a tough comparator to Q1 of 2017. So if you go back to 2017, we had strong sales in Q1 and then a sharp decline in sales in Q2. We're not going to see that same pattern in 2018. So while Simparica was a decliner in growth in Q1, we expect that to drive growth in Q2 to Q4 as well, which will then help accelerate growth in Companion Animal throughout the year.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you, Glenn. Next question, please.
Operator: And we'll go next to Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. I'm sorry if I missed this, Glenn, but could you give us the U.S. rest of world breakdown for APOQUEL, CYTOPOINT, and my more strategic question is about the fish business. Obviously a nice grower but small numbers overall. I'm curious conceptually how large can that business become for you relative to the other categories and species over the very long term? And clearly there's an organic story with R&D spend that, is this an area ripe for acquisitions as well? Again just looking at how large could this business be relative to others longer term. Thanks.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you, Gregg. Glenn you want to provide the details of the derm portfolio?
Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.: Yeah. In terms of the derm portfolio, so for the quarter, we had $122 million in sales and derm growing nicely, over 50% growth. Of that, $83 million was U.S., $39 million was international. The break out of $122 million between APOQUEL and CYTOPOINT, there was $99 million in APOQUEL, $22 million in CYTOPOINT and obviously there's just a little bit rounding in the numbers between the two.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: And I will provide some comments about fish. It is difficult to estimate what will be the long-term opportunities for fish. Today most of the revenues generated in fish are coming from salmon, and in our case we are focused on salmon. We have 70% market share in salmon for vaccines. But the growth that will be generated in the future will be also for expanding the portfolio of vaccines for other fish species, mainly fresh fish, in where today the mortality rates are very high and most of the products that are used are antibiotics which are dropped into the water. So we expect that in the same way that many years ago the salmon industry moved from antibiotics to vaccines and today we are not using almost antibiotics in the production of fish. We expect the same for other species in the future. We see fish in some way similar to protein many years ago. In where there was very small revenue generated in poultry and now poultry, well, it's $16 billion revenues. So in the total animal health – no sorry – $5 billion. $6 billion (38:50), $5 billion total revenues for poultry. So we expect that maybe not reaching this level of revenues for fish, but over time moving from an industry that today is about $600 million, $700 million to an industry that will generate more than $1 billion in terms of revenue, and we think that the greatest asset, already the expertise and also the infrastructure to generate the future products that will be delivered to the fish producers. So next question, please?
Operator: And we'll go next to Jon Block with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. I'm actually going to try to squeeze two or three into one. And just to roll through, maybe first, last quarter you had conviction that dairy would pick up in the back half of 2018. Just curious if that's still intact as pricing seemingly remains difficult. I guess part B would be fish up modestly year-over-year, but a big step down from the run rate that we did see in the back half of 2017. So how do we think about the contribution from PHARMAQ this year? And then lastly, sorry, but just Simparica, is there an update in the goal? And by that I mean out of the gate I think you guys pointed to a $100 million annual product. We've seen APOQUEL and CYTOPOINT have the positive revisions. What's the latest on Simparica? Is there a sort of an update positive or negative to the initial $100 million? Thanks, guys.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you, Jon. Let me start with the question on dairy and look for 2018. In general, Livestock, it's stable in terms of the previous conversations that we had in February. Maybe realistic (40:37) exception, it's dairy, in where we have seen that prices have been declining and we expect that in 2018 dairy farmers will face the challenge of profitability because of these prices. We expect that as in many other occasions there are cycles that always are happening and the next cycle they will be adjusting the volume and the supply and then prices will recover and we expect that in 2019, so the dairy industry will be back to profits. But even if the dairy, it's more negative, we'll see in some cases more positive in other species in Livestock that will compensate. So we remain confident that the total livestock will be in line with the projections that we made at the beginning of the year. In terms of fish, this quarter the fish portfolio was flat. We are comparing with a quarter in where our vaccine for SRS in Chile was priced at much higher level. We adjusted the prices in following process and we are comparing something which is probably in terms of our volume. We have continue increasing the penetration. Price is having a negative impact in the total revenue growth, but we expect that the growth for our fish will be growing in line of what's on the market but will be faster than the overall growth for animal health. And maybe Glenn, you want to talk about Simparica?
Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.: Yeah. The only other thing I'll mention on fish in terms of sequential quarters versus Q4 is the PD season, as we've indicated, really is in the second half of the year. So that's part of the step down between Q4 and Q1 performance as well. In terms of Simparica, we have indicated that we expect that product to be a blockbuster with sales of greater than $100 million and that still is our expectation for Simparica.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Next question, please.
Operator: And we'll go next to Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Thanks very much. Just two questions here. First on the incremental investments you're making in R&D, how much of that is focused on lifecycle management versus breakthrough investments? And when we think about areas that you're focused on on the breakthrough side, what are you most excited about as you think about the R&D portfolio? My second question was just a quick one on tax. You obviously had a lower rate in the quarter. I know you expect that to rebound the rest of the year. But we have seen a number of companies lower their tax expectations as they've had more time to digest the new rules. So as you think about Zoetis beyond 2018, could we see improvement to the tax rate as the business trends over time? Or is 21%, 22% rate a good one to think about going forward? Thank you.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you, Chris. And we are investing in lifecycle or new product innovation about the same. So we are very much balance how much these investments in our current portfolio compare to the products that will be new into the market and creating some additional growth. And in terms of what are we most excited about R&D. Definitely, we are very excited about monoclonal antibody. We have now one monoclonal antibody which is working extremely well and generating a very positive growth and missing the demand of our customers which is CYTOPOINT which is complementing APOQUEL. But we see monoclonal antibody as platform for many other indications including pain for dogs and cats and we see that, especially for cats, it's a significant unmet need. There's nothing specific for cats today. We state that monoclonal antibodies will cover this need and will generate very positive feedback from the market. We are also excited and will continue investing in sarolaner which is the molecule of Simparica and combining this with other active ingredients to extend the protection of dogs and cats to other parasiticides including internal and external. And we continue also excited about finding ways of integrating more the different aspects of healthcare, not just vaccination or treatment but also prediction with the genetic market, genetic information, and also detection with our diagnostic investment to build our portfolio also to cover from prediction, detection, prevention and treatment. And all across that ensuring that we use digital data analytics to really increase the value of our R&D investment. So definitely we are working on all these aspects and we think that they are great opportunities in both the Companion Animal and Livestock. And we see that integrating all these elements of healthcare will also have an impact on R&D but also an impact in our value that we'll be delivering to our customers. And let me ask Glenn to talk about tax rate for 2018 and 2019.
Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.: Yeah. In terms of the tax rate, the guidance that we had provided in February, we had spent a lot of time trying to understand the new law and providing that guidance. And we really haven't learned anything new to date that changes our expectations for the approximate 21% to 22% that we have for 2018. Over time, we'll continue to look for ways to grind down the rate but we don't see it changing substantially from the 21% to 22%.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you, Glenn. Next question, please.
Operator: And we'll go next to Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you. Just trying to – going back to the U.S. Companion Animal business that was up 6%, can you tell us, Glenn, what is a normalized growth rate if you exclude APOQUEL and CYTOPOINT? Those have been such strong drivers of growth to that business and I know there were a lot of moving pieces with Simparica this quarter. But is that business growing excluding APOQUEL and CYTOPOINT? And then secondly, what sort of competitive intelligence have you guys done around future competition, specifically for APOQUEL? Elanco certainly has the JAK inhibitor technology. What have you seen out there, and when do you expect competition to materialize for either of those two products? Thanks very much.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you, Jami and I will answer first about the competition that we may expect for APOQUEL, CYTOPOINT and then Glenn will talk about the U.S. growth and also in line and also the rest of the portfolio. So as you know there is very little information about R&D in our industry. Most of our competitors are part of big pharma companies and they don't have the need of disclosing the details about R&D like in human health to support the future growth. It's something that is much more complicated. We should expect that in the future we'll have competition for APOQUEL and CYTOPOINT. There are some indications that the company was offering the monoclonal antibody that maybe have some activity in allergy, but it is information that they provided. They're still far from reaching the market because it was very early stage of development so it will take several years to reach and market. Apart from that, maybe some competitors are also working on developing this type of portfolio. We are very confident that first we have very strong asset protection for APOQUEL, that that will go through 2029 and for CYTOPOINT it will be even longer. And we have two products that has been demonstrated efficacy and also safety and that has been extremely well accepted by the market. So definitely competition one day will come but we're still very confident that we have very strong portfolio and very strong way to support our portfolio. And Glenn will talk about the U.S. Companion Animal growth and the breakdown between key problems and in line portfolio.
Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.: For U.S. Companion Animal growth, when you back out the impact of derm, you especially get to flat growth for the rest of the portfolio. And that was driven by a number of factors. A, we talked about the competition that we experienced on the three products that we described. We also had the negative impact of some of the quarterly variation with Simparica that we do expect to reverse as we move throughout the year. Offsetting that was growth in some other new product as well that contributed nicely and growth from some other in line portfolio as well. So overall, we were flat when you take out the impact of dermatology.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Next question, please.
Operator: We'll go next to Doug Tsao with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Douglas D. Tsao - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the taking questions. Just curious when you think about the Companion business, if you could provide some perspective on just sort of the consolidation we've seen on the customer side in terms of the vet clinics. And does that have any impact positive or negative in terms of your business there, in the Companion business in the U.S.?
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Well, the consolidation on vet clinics, it's something that is happening and we expect that that will continue in the future. We have now Banfield and VCA, they're consolidating and representing, it's about 2,000 clinics in total. And it's a significant customer. We have excellent relationship with both VCA and also with Banfield. There are other group that are now consolidating and we'll see that many individual clinics will be also forming and buying groups or other sorts of networks. This definitely will have pressure in terms of pricing. But at the same time, we are very confident that the portfolio that we have which includes products which are highly differentiated also will help us to manage this situation or to manage volume and price discussions. And this is also something that we are incorporating in our projections. It's something that will happen in the U.S. We'll see also some type of buying groups in countries like the UK or France. It's part of what we should be expect in the future, but at the same time, with this consolidation, it's also increasing the opportunity to integrate more many of the things that we can offer to these clinics. So next question, please.
Operator: And we'll go next to Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hey, good morning, folks. Thank you for taking the questions. Can we get your Simparica sales by U.S. and ex U.S. please? You provided some helpful comments about the U.S. performance. Would appreciate your thoughts about expectations for ex U.S. And then Glenn, stepping back and looking at your margins, you've obviously made great progress. Just wondering what kind of operating margin is possible for your business in an optimal scenario. I appreciate the earlier comments about gross margin getting better with mix and efficiency but as competition increases invariably in dermatology, as you recently just pointed out, I would imagine that you also need to – there's going to be some need for SG&A spend. So if you were to look at your business optimally on an operating margin, help us figure out how much more room you have left there. Thank you very much.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: I will start with a comment on Simparica. Glenn will provide more detail. But we have seen that the interaction of Simparica in international markets continue growing and continue growing there very nicely. And we see that the opportunities of growth in international markets are in line or even higher than our expectation and we are both very confident that Simparica will reach a significant part of the revenues in the future in international markets. But maybe, Glenn, you can go into more detail.
Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.: Yeah. Just to add to that point, so Simparica internationally grew 100%, over 100% in the quarter, so very strong growth internationally. To break out, there was $31 million in sales for Simparica for the quarter; $18 million of that was in the U.S., $13 million was international. In terms of operating margin, so as we've said in the past, we're not focused purely on generating higher operating margins. We're (55:30) both driving profitable revenue growth and improving on our overall cash flow. And that's going to continue to be our focus moving forward. That being said, we believe our long term value proposition is very much in place in terms of our ability to grow revenue at a faster pace than OpEx and therefore drive adjusted net income growth at a faster pace than revenue. You reference in terms of competition and global scale, we believe in the majority of the markets that we operate, we currently have the scale and infrastructure to support the anticipated revenue growth that we have moving forward. To the extent that there are some changes needed, they'll probably be more in the incremental house (56:05) to support additional revenue growth and would not change our cost structure materially.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Next question, please.
Operator: We'll go next to Kathy Miner with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.
Kathy M. Miner - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good morning. Two questions. First on canine pain. Given that we've seen Galliprant making some inroads, does Zoetis have an interest in small molecule canine pain meds or is your focus on monoclonals? And can you give us any update on the timing of the next monoclonals that you have in development? And the second question is on antibiotic-free proteins. Do you see the demand for antibiotic free proteins in the U.S. increasing or do you think it's stabilized? And what are the types of products or services that Zoetis is providing to offset some of the loss of the antibiotic sales? Thank you.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you for the questions, Kathy, and let me start saying that, well, we are focused on for pain for dogs mostly on monoclonal antibodies. We think that the current treatment that exists in the market related to NSAIDs or other type of solutions are well covered, but we see the opportunity of bringing monoclonal antibodies that will provide excellent efficacy to treat the symptoms of pain and also excellent safety profile. We have seen that, well, Galliprant had a good increase in 2017. Maybe they are reaching some level of plateau in terms of growth. And we are convinced that the portfolio we have today with RIMADYL, RIMADYL, it's a product that has been in the market for many years. It's extremely well accepted there based on brand equity, and we'll continue supporting RIMADYL in terms of oral formulations and developing these injectable formulation with monoclonal antibodies. In terms of demand for non-antibiotic or antibiotic-free proteins, we have seen that in poultry. It has been increasing there, the production of antibiotic-free, and the advantage of (58:39) is that we can also offer alternative to antibiotics and protein have been growing very nicely with this alternative and we have not seen the negative impact of the reduction of antibiotics in poultry. In other species, it's much more complicated to move to antibiotic-free production because they're much more exposed to external pathogens and with this exposure, so the infections are much more complicated to achieve with biosecurity and other healthcare protocols. In any case, we'll continue working internally to identify alternative to antibiotics that will protect the animals. One of these alternatives is where we are investing and will continue investing is vaccination. But we know that despite of all healthcare protocols and vaccinations there, animals get sick and when they get sick, they need to use antibiotics. Otherwise the impact in animals, in the productivity, but also the potential impact to humans will be extremely negative. So we'll work on alternative, but I don't – we don't see that antibiotics can be replaced in some of the species like beef or even pork. Next question, please.
Operator: We'll go next to Liav Abraham with Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Liav Abraham - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just a quick follow-up question on the pipeline. Thank you for some of the color you provided. Can you call out any specific pipeline catalysts over the next couple of years, let's say? Just want to get a sense of when some of the opportunities that you've talked about qualitatively can come to fruition and translate into revenues. Thank you.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: More than providing specific timing for the launch of the product, but in some cases, as you know, first, we don't want to provide information to our competitor. That will be a negative to us, and we want to make sure that when we launch a product that we maximize revenues and profits as fast as we can. And providing details probably will reduce the opportunity to maximize our new product launches. But definitely we'll see that we'll be launching in the next coming years combination of sarolaner with other active ingredients to cover internal and external parasiticides, as I mentioned. You will see that we are introducing also monoclonal antibodies for pain in dogs and cats. We'll continue bringing new innovation in terms of vaccines. In 2018 we introduce an expansion of our Fostera line with the first vaccination for PCV2, combining 2a and 2b, and also providing cross protection against 2d. So we are very pleased with the way that we are investing in our portfolio. And there will be many other things that we'll continue discussing in the future. But we prefer at this point not to provide too many details of specific programs or time, because I said this is something that we are – we want to protect our future launches and not to provide too much information to our competitors. Next question, please.
Operator: And we'll go next to David Westenberg with C.L. King. Please go ahead.
David Westenberg - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: All right. Thank you for squeezing me in. So the merger or the upcoming merger of Henry Schein and Vets First Choice, a lot of that's on the paradigm they believe they can increase compliance. Now, for Zoetis, what opportunity do you see in encouraged compliance in your own kind of products? Is there a real potential to kind of grow the market in the companion animal market? And as a follow-up to that and the merger, what are the opportunities that you see to work with a Henry Schein, Vets First Choice combined company?
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Well, we have excellent collaboration with both and we expect that this collaboration will be maintained in the future with the combination of Henry Schein and Vets First Choice. We see also that this JV will increase compliance, mainly on the chronic treatment and this an area that we will have a benefit for pet owners, a benefit for veterinarians and also benefits for manufacturers. We think that this type of JV also will increase the support to veterinarians and it's an area that we are 100% aligned in terms of keeping veterinarians at the center of any healthcare decision. And we think that this type of JV will expand also the presence in international markets. Vets First Choice is mainly focused on the U.S. today, but with their JV they maybe expand to other markets and definitely we expect to have a good collaboration with them. Next question, please.
Operator: And we'll go next to Kevin Ellich with Craig-Hallum. Please go ahead.
Kevin Ellich - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC: My question's been asked and answered. Thanks.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: And we will go next to Derik De Bruin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Michael Ryskin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thanks. Just one quick small one to squeeze in. I know it's not core business but the contract manufacturing slipped a decent amount in the quarter and by our estimates was a 25 bps to 50 bps headwind to the top line. Can you talk about that business? It's a little lumpy but is this something that you expect to continue going forward or was this just in timing of orders?
Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.: Yeah. That one really is just timing of orders. That business, it varies by quarter so I wouldn't read anything into the first quarter performance.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: And this a business which is, as you said, is not core. It's helping us to increase the volume in some of our facilities and the absorption of overhead. But definitely is not an area that we are promoting or we are trying to increase the business through these third-party contact with in manufacturing. So our next question, please.
Operator: And it appears we have no further questions. I'll return the floor to you, Juan Ramón, for any closing remarks.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you very much for joining us today. And as we said in our comments, our results in the quarter were very strong. We are very confident on the projections for the year and we'll continue having interactions with you to provide future results. So thank you very much.
Operator: And this will conclude today's program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.

===== 2017 Q4  (2018-02-15 08:30:00) =====

We also cite operational results which exclude the impact of foreign exchange.
 With that, I will turn the call over to Juan Ramón. 
Juan Ramón Alaix: Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. 
 Two weeks ago, we celebrated our fifth anniversary as a public company. And since our IPO in 2015, we have been able to improve the ways we innovate and serve our customers, grow as a profitable stand-alone business and build a track record of delivering results. Over the last 5 years, we have maintained a high level of R&D productivity and developed new and enhanced products that address the more relevant needs of our customers. New innovative products like Apoquel, Cytopoint and Simparica as well as lifecycle innovation for our existing portfolio has supported our leadership in the animal health industry.
 On an operational basis, Zoetis' revenue has grown an average of approximately 7% over the last 5 years compared with the 5% to 6% for the animal health industry. And our adjusted net income for the same period has grown operationally an average of approximately 21%. Over the last 5 years, we have been able to deliver on our commitment of growing our revenue in line or faster than the market and growing our adjusted net income faster than sales while also targeting value-added investment opportunities and returning excess capital to our shareholders. And for the next 5 years, we remain committed to achieving these elements of our value proposition for shareholders. 
 In 2017, Zoetis became the first animal health company to deliver more than $5 billion in revenue as we continue to demonstrate the strength of our business model and the growth opportunities in animal health. We achieved operational revenue growth for 2017 of 8% based on the diversity of our total portfolio and balanced performance across the U.S. and major international markets. And once again, we grew our adjusted net income 5% sales at 21% operationally as we continue to realize the benefits of our operational efficiency initiatives and deliver our long-term value proposition.
 The strength of our diverse portfolio of approximately 300 product lines helped to absorb economic challenge in certain market and to offset all issues like the implementation of the Veterinary Feed Directive, or VFD, in the U.S. Our companion animal business led the way again in 2017. It grew 14% operationally based on the continued penetration of Apoquel and ramp-up of Cytopoint and other new products like Simparica, which has gained share in the large and highly competitive parasiticide market.
 We believe 2018 will be another year of above-market growth for our companion animal business. We see further opportunities for gaining share and expanding the market for dermatology products with our innovative treatment options. We expect to achieve more than $500 million in combined sales from Apoquel and Cytopoint in 2018.
 We'll also continue to support these products, as well as our oral parasiticide, Simparica with direct-to-consumer campaigns in the U.S. and other markets. Simparica has been able to gain market share in the U.S. in 2017, and we expect further growth there and internationally in 2018. 
 Meanwhile, we delivered 5% operational growth in our livestock business there for the year. International markets grew faster than the U.S. where we felt the impact of the VFD implementation in our cattle and swine anti-infective products. For 2018, we see more favorable market conditions for livestock, particularly in the U.S. Glenn will discuss the details of our fourth quarter results and guidance in a minute. But I would like to say that we feel very confident about our prospect for 2018. 
 In addition to revenue growth, we have also been focused on improving our operational efficiency and margins. And in 2017, we achieved an adjusted EBIT margin of 34.1%. This was an improvement of 900 basis points in the last 3 years. With our improved cost structure, margin expansion and revenue growth, we have been able to almost double our operating cash flow for the year in 2017 compared to the previous year. That improved cash flow, along with the long-term benefit of the recent U.S. tax reform, is providing us the flexibility to invest for long-term growth.
 In terms of long-term growth, we'll continue investing significantly in R&D for our core species and geographies, look to strengthen our cattle, fishing areas, livestock monoclonal antibodies, vector vaccines, genetics, diagnostics, devices and automation and define new technologies in areas like data analytics and sensors. We'll continue supporting our key products like Apoquel and Simparica with direct-to-consumer advertising and other marketing campaigns. We'll also increase our field force in diagnostics to better support the interaction of new products in the future growth expected in this area. We'll be allocating capital to support many of the manufacturing and supply improvements I have discussed recently in places like China, Ireland and the United States. And as always, we'll continue to look at external partnership and business development that could accelerate our ability to grow in our core business and in complementary spaces like genetics and data analytics. All these investments will support our goal of more integrated solution, which cover the entire life cycle of animal care that our customers need. 
 In conclusion, as we mark our fifth anniversary as an independent company, I'm grateful for the colleagues at Zoetis who have delivered our strong performance and will support our future of profitable growth. We continue to drive innovation, believe in customer excellence, simplify our operations and increase our cash flow. And as we look to the future, we'll remain committed to strengthening our interconnected capabilities in direct sales, R&D, manufacturing and look for additional investment opportunities to enhance our growth.
 With that, let me hand things over to Glenn, who will provide more details on our fourth quarter results and full year guidance for 2018. 
Glenn David: Thank you, Juan Ramón, and good morning, everyone. 
 Before I get into the details on our fourth quarter performance and guidance for 2018, I will provide a few comments on the results for full year 2017. This year, we delivered operational revenue growth above the market, grew adjusted net income faster than revenue and almost doubled our operating cash flow. Reported revenue for full year 2017 was $5.3 billion with operational revenue growth of 8%. Of this 8%, 3.5% came from our dermatology portfolio, 3.5% came from Simparica and other new products and the remainder of growth came from price and volume. Our product rationalization initiative had an unfavorable impact of 1% on volume for the year.
 Adjusted net income for full year 2017 was $1.2 billion and grew 21% operationally. Adjusted net income continues to grow faster than revenue driven by the continued impact of our operational efficiency initiative and a lower adjusted effective tax rate. Our performance this year, again, reaffirms our ability to execute on the financial targets that we said in May of 2015 when we provided long-term guidance through to 2017.
 With the results that we are reporting today, both our top and bottom line in 2017, beat the goal outlined nearly 3 years ago. For the full year, we've performed well across all the species and key markets where we compete. The diversity and durability of our existing portfolio, our market-leading commercial and manufacturing capabilities and the innovations we bring to the marketplace have allowed us to outpace the animal health industry market growth for the last 5 years.
 Our income growth and our increased discipline on the balance sheet have enabled us to almost double our operating cash flow in 2017. This was the result of lower cash outlays for termination benefits and stand-up costs, increased profitability and inventory improvements. In 2017, we reduced our months on hand of inventory by more than a month. We have more work to do in this area but are pleased with the progress in 2017.
 Turning now to quarterly results. Q4 2017 was an exceptional quarter, with top line growth coming from new products in our companion animal portfolio and strong livestock performance in our U.S. and International businesses. Our product rationalization initiative had no material impact on our growth this quarter and will not have an impact on our revenue growth going forward. Total company revenue in the fourth quarter grew 13% operationally, excluding the favorable 1% impact from foreign exchange. Our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint, once again surpassed the $100 million marketing revenue with sales in the quarter reaching $125 million and $428 million for the full year 2017. Sales of Simparica were $18 million in the quarter, growing 102% over the same period in the prior year. Fish products also contributed to growth with sales of $39 million, growing 44% operationally versus the same quarter last year. Our recently introduced PD vaccine in Norway was the primary driver of growth as it continues to gain share and help increase the penetration of other related vaccines in our portfolio.
 Now let's discuss segment revenue. Our International revenue grew 13% operationally in the fourth quarter, with companion animal operational growth of 18% and livestock growth of 11%. The International segment continues to drive growth across multiple dimensions with growth coming from our dermatology portfolio; new products, such as Simparica, our PCV combo vaccine and our PD vaccine; and volume and price from our in-line portfolio.
 Turning to some key market highlights in the quarter. In Brazil, we grew 13% operationally, driven by the strength of both our livestock and companion animal businesses. In cattle, investments in our field force have led to increased penetration and coverage in key regions within the market while favorable export market conditions also continued to contribute to growth. In swine, increased sales of IMPROVAC, or Vivax as it's called in Brazil, were driven by higher usage and greater penetration with larger customers. The higher companion animal revenue in Brazil benefited from the continued growth of Simparic through the increased promotional activity and higher veterinary clinic penetration.
 In Japan, we experienced operational revenue growth of 27% in the quarter. Growth came from Apoquel as a result of the timing of distributor purchases last year and the additional market penetration we achieved as well as the launch of premium injectable products for livestock.
 France grew 23% operationally over the same period last year due to a timing impact related to our price changes and new products to both -- across both companion animal and livestock.
 China grew 13% operationally on a continuing strength of the companion animal business, driven by increasing medicalization of pets. Our swine business once again showed modest growth this quarter due to softening pork prices, which we have expected and discussed on recent earnings calls. Our optimistic outlook and long-term view of the market remain unchanged as we continue to invest in our local operations there. 
 To summarize, a very strong quarter for our International segment with growth across the diversified portfolio, including all of our core species and key markets, favorable market conditions, strategic investments in our portfolio and a focus on execution, are all helping to drive consistent commercial results.
 Turning to the U.S. Revenue grew 13% in the fourth quarter. Companion animal grew 15% while livestock grew 11%. Companion animal sales in the quarter were driven primarily by key dermatology products, Simparica and a number of other recently launched products. U.S. dermatology sales for Apoquel and Cytopoint were $86 million for the quarter and exhibited substantial growth over the same quarter in the prior year. While we did see a small decline on a sequential quarter basis, Q1 and Q4 are impacted by seasonality with the warmer spring and summer months experiencing peak activity. Simparica grew over the same quarter last year as DTC investment and field force efforts led to higher clinic penetration in both key corporate accounts and smaller clinics. Additional contributions to companion animal growth came from a number of line extensions to our Vanguard vaccine franchise, DIROBAN, a recently launched product for the treatment of heartworm and CLAVAMOX chewable, a trusted antibiotic in a new easy-to-administer tablet. 
 Our U.S. livestock business saw a return to growth in the fourth quarter, with sales increasing 11%, thanks to the performance of our cattle and poultry businesses. During the fourth quarter, growth in cattle products was driven by increased sales of premium products, which was supported by a greater risk of disease outbreak and incidents due to the weather as well as the timing of promotional activities in 2016. Our beef cattle business also benefited from higher numbers of animals moving through feedlots than in the comparable 2016 period. Our livestock business continued to be impacted by the Veterinary Feed Directive, or VFD, with another $10 million hit to revenue in the quarter. For the full year 2017, the VFD had about a $40 million impact on revenue. In poultry, there's a weather's portfolio of alternatives to antibiotics and medicated feed additives continue to be the primary driver of growth as certain producers expand their "No Antibiotics Ever" labels. The weather works with customers to provide the necessary product and technical assistance that can help them switch over whenever they choose.
 Now moving on to the rest of the P&L. I will quickly cover a few key line items and then move on to our guidance for 2018. Adjusted gross margin of 68.9% increased 450 basis points in the quarter on a reported basis and reflects the benefit of cost improvements in our manufacturing network as well as the reduction of inventory waste charges versus the same quarter last year. Operating expenses in total grew at 2% operationally versus the same period last year, which was significantly lower than the operational revenue growth of 13% as we benefited from the final stages of our operational efficiency initiatives. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was approximately 27.6%. This is higher than the rate in the comparable 2016 period due to the favorable impact of certain one-time discrete items that we experienced in the same quarter last year. Our reported effective tax rate of 43.5% reflects the provisional net tax charge of $212 million in the fourth quarter, which is the result of the recently enacted tax legislation in the U.S. Adjusted net income for the quarter grew 37% operationally through a combination of strong revenue growth and margin expansion and cost improvements in manufacturing and leveraging our global scale and infrastructure. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 39% operationally in the quarter versus the same period in 2016.
 Turning now to guidance for the full year 2018. A table of our guidance is included in both our press release and the presentation slides provided for this earnings call. Please note that our guidance for 2018 reflects foreign exchange rates as of early February.
 Building off a strong 2017, we see another year of operational revenue growth above the long-term trend we see in the industry overall. Our projected reported revenue range for 2018 is $5.675 billion to $5.8 billion. This represents operational revenue growth of between 5% and 7% over our full year results in 2017. Foreign exchange is expected to add an additional 2% for this revenue growth.
 We continue to expect more balanced performance across companion animal and livestock in 2018. Livestock growth is expected to reflect improved conditions in the U.S. and a relatively similar performance in 2017 in our International segment. While companion animal continue to grow faster than livestock, its growth rate will moderate as our dermatology portfolio and other new products grow off a larger base in 2018.
 Our adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue is expected to be approximately 32% in 2018, an improvement of around 100 basis points over 2017 and driven by manufacturing cost reductions, price increases and favorable product mix. We expect SG&A for the year to be between $1.37 billion and $1.42 billion. Similar to revenue, foreign exchange is expected to increase these expenses approximately 2% on a reported basis. We will continue to fund our DTC programs for Apoquel and Simparica in the U.S. These programs have been successful, and we expect they will continue to help our sales teams drive market expansion in dermatology and market share in parasiticide.
 As our diagnostics pipeline continues to advance, we are beginning to fund additional investments in commercial capabilities in both the U.S. and International to be prepared to offer our customers these products with the level of service and support we offer them on our other portfolios.
 We expect R&D expenses to be between $400 million and $420 million, a step-up in the level of spending we have had in prior year. Over the course of 2017, we made a number of decisions to either expand investments or accelerate investments where we saw the opportunity to do so in areas such as monoclonal antibodies and key emerging markets.
 The increase in adjusted interest expense and other income deductions reflects the incremental interest expense associated with our recent debt offering. 
 For the full year 2018, the company expects its adjusted effective tax rate to be in the range of 21% to 22%. The decrease versus prior year is primarily the result of the tax changes enacted in the U.S. in December. The target range for adjusted net income for the full year 2018 is between $1.45 billion and $1.52 billion, representing an operational growth rate of 20% to 26%. Growth here includes the favorable impact of continued operating margin expansion and a lower adjusted effective tax rate. Our guidance for adjusted diluted EPS is between $2.96 and $3.10 for the full year.
 Turning to capital allocation. Our priorities remain the same, investment in our own business and internal R&D programs, then external business development opportunity and finally, returning excess capital to the shareholders. With the impact of the recent tax law changes, we'll have greater flexibility to execute on these priorities. I would also point out that given the level of investments we have discussed in manufacturing facility, you should expense capital expenditures in 2018 to be approximately $100 million higher than the $224 million we reported in 2017. In terms of returning excess capital to shareholders, we increased our dividend by 20% for Q1 2018 and had share repurchases of $500 million in 2017. It's worth mentioning that we still have $1 billion left on our current share repurchase program.
 To wrap up, we had strong performance in 2017 and see those fundamental business and market drivers continuing into 2018. We have the capital and cash flow generation to invest in growth opportunities across the animal health industry. And we have the talent and capabilities to maintain our market leadership in this attractive market and create more value for our customers and shareholders.
 With that, I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator? 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Louise Chen with Cantor. 
Louise Chen: My question is just on R&D. We always get a lot of questions on this since you don't disclose a lot of detail. I'm just wondering, where are your greatest unmet needs in animal health? How are you addressing these? And will we hear more about these products in 2018? And also can you provide any measures by which you can measure your R&D productivity? 
Juan Ramón Alaix: Thank you, Louise, for the question. We still see unmet needs in our animal health industry. One of the unmet needs there is related to pain in dogs and cats and bring some of them in the solutions for the current treatments. And this is why we are focused on a number of [ current treatments ] that we'll be providing alternative to the current treatments for dogs and cats. We also see opportunities of combination of oral parasiticide for internal and external parasiticides. And definitely, we see the opportunity of enhancing productivity in livestock with the new technologies that will replace existing ones. So there are areas that definitely we have internal problems. And we mentioned many times, our competitors because they are part of pharma companies, we are not disclosing any details. For us, providing this information will create a negative impact in our ability to compete successfully in the future. In terms of how we measure productivity, I like Glenn that will provide some details. 
Glenn David: So in terms of measuring the productivity for R&D, a, as we prioritize the projects across the portfolio, we use [ EMPV ] and EROI to make sure that we're appropriately prioritizing across the portfolio. We'll also look retrospectively from a return on invested capital perspective to see the return that we get from our investments. And based on the productivity we've had over the last number of years, we've been very pleased with our return on our R&D spend. 
Operator: And we'll go to -- next question to Kevin Ellich with Craig-Hallum. 
Kevin Ellich: So very, very strong results this quarter, guys. And it's great to see the rapid growth in companion animal as well, the recovery at livestock that you expect. Glenn, you made a comment about more balanced growth between livestock and companion animal in 2018 and even moderating growth in dermatology. Can you just give us a little bit more detail behind what you expect in companion animal? Should we be thinking about 10% companion animal growth versus 8% livestock? Or any help on that front? 
Glenn David: Yes. In terms of the growth that we expect for 2018, I'm not going to give specific numbers, obviously, between livestock and companion. But I think when you look at 2017 for the full year, we had 5% growth in livestock and 14% growth in companion, so there was a big differential in the growth. As we move into 2018, with a very strong performance that we had in our companion animal portfolio in 2017, we've established a new base to grow off of, particularly in our derm portfolio as well as Simparica. So while we still expect those products to grow in 2018, the overall contribution that we'll have for the total companion animal growth will be smaller just as they're off of a much larger base. So that's going to cause our companion animal growth to decelerate as we move into 2018. 
Operator: And we'll take the next question from Erin Wright with Crédit Suisse. 
Erin Wilson: In terms of the development pipeline, a follow-up here. I guess can you speak to some of the focus areas outside of traditional therapeutics? So for instance there, you launched a new diagnostic offering at VMX, you also have SMB opportunities and you mentioned some sales force investments there. Is that going to be a focus area for you in terms of new product launches near term? Will it be a more organic or inorganic initiative? And then, just could you speak to some of the -- you mentioned data and analytics but some of the other areas or ancillary areas outside of traditional therapeutics where you see growth opportunity? 
Juan Ramón Alaix: Thank you, Erin on that. We see Zoetis as a much more integrated offer to our customers, including the products in medicines, the change there, but also diagnostics, genetics. What we have to describe as a -- the health care cycle of intention also prediction, prevention and treatment. And definitely, we'll continue focus on our core business. In the core business we'll continue generating the majority of our revenues and profit. But we see opportunities to accelerate our growth by investing in some of these complementary spaces. Definitely, in genetics, diagnostics, data analytics are part of these efforts. We have now in diagnostics arranged on the pipeline that definitely we'll be focused on delivering in the next coming years. We also presented in the last congress of VMX, a new Carysta, high-volume chemistry that -- it's part of our efforts really to become a key player in diagnostics. But in a way, that will be integrated -- or we'll be integrating more all these portfolio in our offer to our customers. As well, we will be investing in data analytics essentials that will complement our offer to our customers. 
Operator: The next question comes from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. 
Michael Ryskin: A couple of questions on the quarter and then just a longer-term follow-up. Really strong results in U.S. livestock this quarter. I know it's a bit of surprise relative to what we are looking for. And particularly, U.S. cattle had a great number. You mentioned some of the disease conditions, but you also talked about feedlots and cattle herd size. I recognize that the weather and the [ days, months ] is more transient, but the feedlot data you should have pretty good visibility in. And I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit how the outlook there is sort of the first part of 2018. Is the feedlot strength sustainable? Is that something that you think it will continue for several quarters? And then broader on the '18 guide, you talked about a pretty sizable gross margin improvement, 120 bps year-over-year. Is the longer-term targets are still what you talked about, 200 bps by 2020? Or is there upside opportunity there, given how much improvement you're looking for this year? 
Juan Ramón Alaix: Thank you, Mike. I will respond about the U.S. livestock results. And then Glenn will provide the details of our gross margin improvement and also targets for the future. Well, in the U.S., definitely, we had a strong fourth quarter in the U.S. And this was just the result of several factors, including the weather conditions and movement of animals. Also the fact that we decided not to implement promotional activities in the third quarter and then views the -- for some more movement of sales from the third quarter to the fourth quarter of 2017. But the results are in some way, what we were expecting there and we also communicated in the previous quarter. So we saw that in the first part of the year, we have some limited growth in the U.S. cattle, but we were also expecting that at the end of the year, we will be reporting a revenue growth in the U.S. cattle. And this quarter is just confirming our projections for the year. This has been movement of animals, as I had mentioned, to the feedlots. And we are pleased with the performance of the entire portfolio in our cattle business in the U.S. Moving forward, for 2018, we see positive elements in our beef segment in the U.S. We see that the number of animals that we -- are continue growing, probably at a lower rate than what we have seen in previous year, but still growing. Placements are expected also to continue being positive. And we expect also that the weather conditions in 2018 will be more favorable for animal health than in '17. So overall, we see that the beef segment will grow and [ as prices ] will be growing in line with the market. We also see that unleashing the first half, half, the dairy segment will be facing some challenge because of the price of the milk is lower than in previous quarter, and then maybe they will have an impact on the first half of the year. We expect that the second half will be a more positive. But overall, the cattle will be showing a positive growth in 2018. And as I said, we expect that to grow in line with the market. Then Glenn, please, do you mind to cover the question from gross margin? 
Glenn David: Yes. Mike, in terms of the gross margin, when you look at the 2018 guidance of approximately 32%, that's more in line with the second half of 2017, which is more reflective of our underlying cost structure as we've discussed on some of the previous calls. In terms of the 200-basis-point improvement by 2020, we remain committed to that improvement. And as we've said all along, that improvement is driven by the supply network strategy efforts, to the extent that there's additional opportunity based on price, based on volume, based on mix, which can grow on either direction, that can either have an incremental impact or an incremental improvement over the margin over that time or take away a little bit. But the 200 basis points was always based on the supply network strategy, and to the extent that we have favorable movement in price and mix, that would add additional margin improvement. 
Operator: We'll go next to Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets. 
Alex Arfaei: Congratulations on the product performance and all the progress during the past 5 years, it's really remarkable. On the U.S. livestock business. Clearly, much better than expected. The difference is particularly striking, given what we are hearing from some of your competitors, particularly Elanco. So I'm just wondering, if you could highlight what are some of the differences that's driving better performance for your portfolio versus what we are seeing from some of your competitors? And then on the companion animal business, could you comment on the base business, excluding dermatology and Simparica? Is that stable? Or is it under pressure as some of those franchises mature? 
Juan Ramón Alaix: Thank you, Alex. And well, I -- probably I should focus on the drivers of our growth and it's basically because of our portfolio. We have a portfolio, which is extremely well-balanced on many different therapeutic carriers, talking about livestock. And these are also helping us -- as I said many times, the diversity is helping us really to manage different cycles, different opportunities, different challenge and really deliver results, which are very consistent and, in some cases, we're growing as faster than our competitors. And we don't see that the livestock business in the U.S. is showing any negative fundamentals. As I said, for '18, we expect the cattle business, beef and dairy combined, showing positive growth. We also expect that the swine and poultry will continue growing. In the case of swine, we expect that Zoetis will be growing faster on the market because we are introducing new products. And also we have seen that some of the challenges that we faced in '17 related to the PCV2 vaccine now are over. And at the same time, we are introducing new PCV2 vaccines covering more strength, but also will help us structurally with the growth in 2018. Poultry, also we expect a positive growth in the U.S. and will be growing in line with the market. So overall, very pleased with our performance and also positive about the prospects for livestock in the U.S. In terms of -- you also asked about companion animal and what has been the drivers of growth in '17 and also how we see the growth moving forward. Maybe, Glenn, you can provide the details of new products, price and also volume of growth for the price of the portfolio. 
Glenn David: In terms of companion animals in 2017, obviously, a lot of the growth was driven by our new products, and we had new products in a number of categories. So the ones that get the most attention, obviously, are Apoquel and Cytopoint and Simparica. But we also have significant growth coming from our vaccines as well. And these products were the focus of our field force in 2017. In terms of the rest of the portfolio, what you then called the in-line portfolio, performance in those categories was relatively flat as we did experience some pressures from generic competition in line with what our expectations would have been, particularly in the U.S. And that was offset by some strong performance, though, in our emerging markets that continue to grow as increasing medicalization rates in markets, such as China and Brazil continue to benefit us. So overall, relatively flat performance of our in-line portfolio, but a really strong performance from our new products as that was the focus of our field force with the tremendous products that we had to launch and continue growth in. 
Operator: We'll go next to Jon Block with Stifel. 
Jonathan Block: Two questions. Glenn, I've OpEx as a percent of revenue, that improved by the 270 basis points in '17. It was just huge. And the guide for '18, I believe, implies about a 70 bp improvement, OpEx as a percent of revenue with a rate of revenue growth, that really isn't too dissimilar in '18 versus '17. So I want to be clear, the 70 bps is nothing to sneeze at, but maybe if you can talk to the increased investments that you guys are pursuing and when those will yield the return or they just a function of sort of moving further away from the operational efficiency program. And then just to pivot, Juan Ramón, I really don't expect specifics, but any thoughts if you believe you will have it, call, a new blockbuster companion animal product in '19 and maybe that's from the triple or something out of the pain portfolio from Nexvet. Any details you guys can give there. 
Glenn David: Jon, in terms of the OpEx improvement that we experienced in '17 versus what the expectation may be for 2018, it was really the latter of your comments. 2017, we continued to benefit from the remainder of our operational efficiency initiative and we were able to grow revenue significantly faster than OpEx in 2017. Now as we move into 2018, we still expect to grow revenue faster than OpEx but not to the same magnitude as we don't have the same level of improvement coming from our operational efficiency initiative. The other thing I'll point out for 2018 is there are investments that we're making in SG&A to support the continued development of our diagnostic portfolio and to make sure that we have the right commercial support behind those products as they become ready for launch. 
Juan Ramón Alaix: And answering about the potential opportunity of launching a future blockbuster. Definitely, we'll continue seeing opportunities of launching our products that generate significant growth. And I discussed about monoclonal antibodies for pain. I also talked about combination of products in parasiticide segment for internal and external enhancement of our productivity for livestock. At this point, commenting when these products will be launched, I think it's too premature. But we think that we can continue generating growth, which is in line [indiscernible] the market with existing portfolio and also the addition of a -- maybe a blockbuster, but also multiple products that will support our revenue growth. In our industry, as I mentioned many times, we are not dependent on bringing these blockbusters to generate consistent growth because we don't have the same impact that we see in pharma sales because of generic deceleration. So we are pleased with our pipeline. We are pleased with the return of our investment in R&D. And we'll continue our focus on generating internal value growth. And at the same time, as I see an opportunity that -- external opportunity that will enhance our opportunity to grow. 
Operator: The next question is from John Kreger with William Blair. 
John Kreger: Can you just expand a bit more on the diagnostic strategy? Not talked about it this much in the past. Should we think about that as more focused in companion animal or livestock and more sort of centralized or sort of point-of-care type of products? 
Juan Ramón Alaix: Thank you, John. Let me say that we see diagnostics as an area that is growing faster than the average of animal health. And we see diagnostics also as a very complementary to our offer to customers and also an opportunity to leverage our existing relationship and infrastructure in many markets. The focus today is developing our internal pipeline, to bring these products into the market. We see that it's a significant competition in companion animal, especially in the U.S., much more opportunities to offer penetration in International market in companion animals. And because also our expertise and our presence in livestock, we see this area as a significant potential opportunity for Zoetis. And this should be in areas like rapid test point of care but also equipment. So this is where we are focused today in Zoetis. These type of point-of-care diagnostic tools that will help veterinarians in companion animal and livestock to make decisions at the point of care. 
Operator: The next question is from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. 
David Risinger: I have two questions. The first is, could you provide a little bit more color on the ramp of new products, and specifically new companion animal products ex U.S. in 2018? And then second, with respect to cash flow for 2018, could you please discuss the outlook for operating cash flow and free cash flow in 2018 relative to 2017? 
Juan Ramón Alaix: I will provide some comments on the companion animal products outside of the U.S. Glenn also will maybe expanding in some of the details for International markets and definitely, will be commenting on the operating free cash flow. That's the question that you raised and also the outlook for 2018. We have seen in International markets a very high growth in companion animal. International markets are combination of the new product launches, Apoquel, to a lesser extent, Cytopoint, Simparica. But also the growth that we have seen in some of the major markets in companion animal in where the rates of medicalization has been growing very fast. And we have seen in countries like Brazil, China, significant growth. And in countries like China, we started new product launches. So we still see the opportunity of growth in the future once we introduce Apoquel, Cytopoint and Simparica in the Chinese market. We still see significant opportunities for growth in International markets because the level of penetration of Apoquel, Cytopoint and Simparica compared to the U.S. is much lower. So we expect in 2018 that we'll be -- continue enjoying growth in international markets in companion animal. Maybe, Glenn, you can maybe expand some details on this question and also on the free cash flow one. 
Glenn David: In terms of our free cash flow and the cash flow that we expect for 2018. So our operating cash flow, we expect to grow pretty much in line with our growth in adjusted net income. As I also mentioned in my prepared remarks, with the increased expenditures we have for CapEx, free cash flow will grow slightly lower than what we expect to grow for operating cash flow. 
Operator: The next will be Kathy Miner with Cowen. 
Kathleen Miner: Just wanted to follow up on the dermatology area a little bit more. Juan Ramón, I think you -- it sounds like you increased your guidance for the Cytopoint and Apoquel franchise to $500 million in 2018. Can you tell us if this is being driven more by Apoquel and/or Cytopoint? And what the penetration is in dogs now for the -- for dermatology conditions? 
Juan Ramón Alaix: Thank you, Kathy. And I think definitely, we have seen that the option of Apoquel and Cytopoint has been growing in 2017 very fast. And that's why we are now projecting for 2018 already to generate $500 million of -- in sales or more. Both products are -- performance is still well. And now I think it's something that we feel that pet owners when they go to clinics and they have dermatology issues, they are leaving the clinics with either Apoquel or Cytopoint. Definitely, the direct-to-consumer advertising has been helping to accelerate their option and also to expand the market. In terms of penetration, definitely, the penetration in the U.S. and in international market is different. In the U.S., we reported last quarter that we have a penetration of -- in terms of patients of about 59%. We have seen in the fourth quarter this penetration is stable. And it's something that, in some ways, was suspected because it's a quarter in where most of the use in -- it's in acute while -- I am sorry, chronic while we have seen increase in the penetration because of the use of acute and seasonal. Seasonal and acute is mainly in the second and third quarter, and we expect in 2018 continue growing in these acute and seasonal and also helping also to -- with the increase of awareness in terms of dermatology issues with our continued DTC campaign in 2018. We have not seen too much cannibalization of Apoquel because of Cytopoint. It's about 26%, which is what we were expecting. But I think it's something that we are offering -- both solutions to the veterinarians, and we are very pleased with the performance of these 2 products. 
Operator: We'll go next to Liav Abraham with Citigroup. 
Liav Abraham: Just a quick question on the tax rate. You've guided to a tax rate of 21% to 22% for 2018. Can you comment on your outlook for tax beyond 2018 and the opportunity for this to be reduced further over time? 
Juan Ramón Alaix: Thank you, Liav. And we'll be -- Glenn, answering this question. 
Glenn David: In terms of the tax rate. As you mentioned, for 2018, we've guided to 21% to 22%. We haven't provided guidance for beyond 2018. There are additional cost of that kicking beyond 2018 for us then -- as coming into effect for 2019. We need to fully understand the impact of that. But again, the guidance for 2018, based on current understanding, we're comfortable with the 21% to 22% for 2018. 
Juan Ramón Alaix: Thank you, Glenn. And maybe some clarification on the dermatology penetration. I mentioned data for the U.S., International markets there, definitely, we have a lower patient share. And we still see a lot of the room for growing in terms of patient share and also in terms of expanding the market. 
Operator: We'll go next to Chris Schott with JPMorgan. 
Christopher Schott: Just two quick ones here. First, anything -- I know you don't give quarterly guidance, but anything we should be keeping in mind as we think about quarterly progression of both top line and earnings if we think about 2018 relative to '17? And a second was just maybe following up on those comments on Apoquel and Cytopoint. Just a little bit more color, just how much more room for growth is there in this franchise beyond '18? And I guess, what I'm really trying to get is there any more color of how -- what -- or could -- what could peak sales look like for this franchise? I guess, as you start getting through '18 this $500-million-plus number. Is there still significant room for growth? Or are we starting to a point where we're seeing peak sales for these assets? 
Juan Ramón Alaix: Thank you, Chris. And let me cover the question on dermatology portfolio, and then Glenn will discuss about the quarterly projections for 2018. We still see growth not only in 2018 but in future years for dermatology portfolio. And maybe the growth in the market that the products has been introduced [indiscernible] like in the U.S. This growth will be moderated in the future. But there's still -- in many international markets, we are just introducing Cytopoint. Apoquel, definitely have a -- still a lot of opportunity to continue growing. I mentioned China as a country where we don't have yet Apoquel, and we expect also China generating growth in the future. So we don't see that 2018 will be our peak sales in terms of Apoquel. Cytopoint, on the contrary, will continue growing. Definitely, the growth will be moderated, but we expect also continue growing. And definitely, we'll see growth coming from volume but also growth are coming from prices. 
Glenn David: In terms of the 2018 quarterly production, as you mentioned, we don't give 2018 guidance by quarter. But just a couple of things to think about. And we do expect more balanced growth in 2018 than we saw in 2017 and a more steady performance in terms of cost of goods as a percent of revenue than we saw in 2017, in particular. The other thing I'll point out is, we are moving from a 4-4-5 accounting calendar to a month-end accounting calendar, and that will have some small impact per quarter. The greatest impact that you'll see will probably be in Q4, where it could negatively impact our growth in Q4 2018 by almost 2%. So those are the only things that I would point out. 
Operator: The next question is from Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank. 
Gregory Gilbert: Curious whether you saw any headwinds or benefits tied to the consolidation of vet clinics in the U.S. I realized there wouldn't be material effect for the whole year, for the whole company, but curious on that team as it continues to build. And my other question is about the environment overall in some of your competition. And one of the elephants in the room this year is Lilly will explore options for Elanco. And I know Juan Ramón, you've commented in the past that mergers among the larger players in the industry would be difficult from an antitrust perspective. But how would you view a spinoff of Elanco if that's what they decide to do? I'm curious on your thoughts there sort of operationally and otherwise as it relates to any effects, good or bad for Zoetis. 
Juan Ramón Alaix: Thank you, Gregg. And definitely, we have seen a consolidation of vet clinics in the U.S. Also, we have seen not too much consolidation of clinics outside of the U.S. but there may be buy-in groups that also are having an impact. So far, we are managing very well the relationship with these clinics. In some cases, we have been able, really, to reach exclusive agreements for Simparica on one of these larger groups that -- it's something that we see as a very positive. We understand that, in some cases, we may tap some pressure in terms of prices, which is part of also our projections in our model. But at the same time, where we see the opportunity also of expanding the health care because of better services to veterinarians. So we see also that in the case of Zoetis, we have a portfolio of specialty care. That is also providing significant benefits to this change of clinics and definitely, we are managing extremely well. It was a very positive collaboration with [ man field ] in the future -- in the past. We also have good collaboration with the VCA, and we expect that the combination of the 2 groups also will continue positive for Zoetis. In terms of the decisions of Elanco. I think it's something that -- I prefer not to comment on other companies' strategic reviews. We went through our process 5 years ago. It was the right decision for Pfizer and also for, as what you said, very pleased with our performance. And definitely, we have seen the benefits of being at Zoetis, having a single focus on animal health and a singular focus on providing value to our customers and to our shareholders. 
Operator: And we'll go next to Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. 
Candace Richardson: This is Candace Richardson on for Jami Rubin. I have two quick questions. Tempered growth in the U.S. companion this quarter appears to be related to tougher comps from certain products that launched last year. When should we expect this to annualize? And then secondly, your recent dividend increase of nearly 20% is among the highest in the industry. We're wondering if there's a specific payout ratio you're looking to achieve. And given that you're the only stand-alone public animal health company, what comps do you look at when you evaluate your dividend policy? 
Juan Ramón Alaix: Thank you for your question. Please, Glenn, do you mind answering the question? 
Glenn David: Yes. So in terms of U.S. companion animal growth for 2017. For the full year, we had 13% operational growth in U.S. companion animal. In the quarter, we had 15% growth. So we saw another continued quarter of very strong growth in U.S. companion animals. So not necessarily tempered growth for Q4. In terms of our dividend policy. We generally grow our dividend at or pace faster than our growth in adjusted net income. And that is our commitment moving forward is that we'll continue to grow our dividend at or faster than income and have a focus on dividend growth. We're also focused on share repurchase as another way to return excess capital to our shareholders. And we currently prefer share repurchase as a -- gives us a little more flexibility to manage the other priorities we have for capital allocation, being our internal investments as well as business development. 
Operator: We'll go next to Douglas Tsao with Barclays. 
Douglas Tsao: Just focusing on the companion business. You referenced some greater amount of competition for the in-line products. Just curious if that is a trend that you expect to continue. And then just when you think about the growth for the dermatology franchise going forward, should we -- it'd be safe to assume that a lot of the growth going forward will come from the ex U.S. And if you think about that peak potential, I know people sort of hinted at this question, but do you think that the ex U.S. opportunity could be ultimately as big as what we've seen in the United States? 
Juan Ramón Alaix: Thank you, Doug. We don't see that the competition has been increasing in companion animal for our in-line portfolio. Definitely, we have seen the impact of generics in line with previous years and also in line with our predictions. Definitely, vaccines, which have been growing very fast in our opinion, growing faster than the market for companion animals. So in general, we understand that there has been new problems in the pain market in 2017 that has an impact on RIMADYL. But this is not something we see as greater competition in our in-line. Maybe our in-line portfolio has been affected because of so many products, new products that have been launched in period year. And as you can imagine, the level of attention of our field force during this period has been intentionally in these new products. But we are very pleased also with the performance of our in-line. And definitely, we see that this in-line will be performing according to our projections. In terms of the dermatology portfolio opportunity outside of the U.S., so there is probably a couple of years or 18 months difference in terms of the interaction of Apoquel in international markets. Cytopoint, that it was introduced in U.S. at the end of '16 or mid-'16, has been introduced at the end of '17 in Europe, still not introduced in many international markets. I mentioned that even Apoquel is not yet approved in China, and we expect approval in the future. So definitely, it's a significant opportunity of growing our dermatology portfolio outside of the U.S. But still, we see opportunities of continue growing in the U.S. And definitely, we'll be supporting this growth with a DTC campaign in 2018 in our U.S. markets. 
Operator: And we'll go next to Brett Wong with Piper Jaffray. 
Brett Wong: You talked a bit about your positive expectations for U.S. livestock. But can you comment on kind of the International livestock business, specifically in your key markets, like cattle Brazil, hogs in China, et cetera? And if you expect the strength that you saw in 2017 to continue in '18? 
Juan Ramón Alaix: We see livestock in international markets also continue positive. China show companion animal, 20% growth in '17. This was the combination of companion animal and livestock. There are always, as we mentioned many times, in current cycle prices of pork in China and some of our markets there, they kind of affect temporary some of the growth drivers. But one of the advantages of Zoetis that we explained many times is the diversity of our business in all the geographies. In terms of Brazil, we don't see any change in the fundamentals of our business in Brazil. The cattle business is doing very well, swine doing very well. We have some challenge in 2017 in our poultry business in Brazil. But overall, we see also projections for livestock International as a positive for 2018. And again, so -- we may see some quarterly fluctuations in some of the markets. But these are not indicative of the fundamentals of the markets, that should be a rise on a longer period of time. And we don't see any significant or any headwind in terms of the projections for 2018 in international markets for livestock. 
Operator: We'll go next to David Westenberg with CL King. 
David Westenberg: So my question is, some of our research is suggesting that veterinarians do tend to like order in bulk and from one vendor for additional discounts. So with the derm portfolio now approaching $500 million in sales, what's the opportunity to add to the product bag of the veterinarian. There's Simparica and vaccines and -- what's the cross-selling opportunity on derm becomes a $500 million drug? 
Glenn David: So -- this is Glenn. We do think there are definitely opportunities to leverage our portfolio and in many of our markets, we have programs that do provide additional incentives with the more products that you buy from Zoetis. So we're definitely able to leverage the scale that we have with Apoquel, with Cytopoint, with Simparica with many other vaccines to provide additional discounts for buying our total portfolio versus just buying one of our individual products. 
Juan Ramón Alaix: And when we are talking about the total portfolio, so we include products looks like rapid test and diagnostics or, in the future, equipments. So that's why we see the advantage of integrating a larger portfolio and offer this portfolio to our customers. 
Operator: And it appears we have no further questions. I'll return the floor to you, Juan Ramón, for closing remarks. 
Juan Ramón Alaix: Well, thank you very much for joining us. And thank you for your questions and looking forward to have another discussion for the first quarter of 2018. Thank you very much. 
Operator: And this will conclude today's program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.

Before we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website, and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements, and that actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statements in today's press release and our SEC filings, including but not limited to our Annual Report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q. Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release, and in the company's 8-K filing dated today, November 2, 2017. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. With that, I will turn the call over to Juan Ramón.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. Our performance through the first nine months has been consistent with the guidance we provided at the beginning of the year. Companion animal has continued to drive our revenue growth in 2017, based on an innovative dermatology portfolio, our new oral parasiticide, Simparica, and other new products and lifecycle innovations. We have also accelerated our revenues and adjusted earnings and improved our margins in the third quarter, as our cost improvement have become more fully reflected in our results. We expect these to continue for the rest of the year, as reflected in our updated guidance. We are also delivering our strong performance, despite the negative impact of the implementation in the U.S. of the Veterinary Feed Directive. This has had a higher and lower impact on the U.S. cattle and swine businesses than we initially expected. Once again, the diversity of our portfolio is helping us to deliver consistent result and grow further in the market, despite these and other challenges, such as economic crisis, political instability, and regulatory changes. Our results are enhancing our financial strength. And we continue investing our capital and resources internal and external opportunities. We are executing our plans for future growth, and we are confident in our raised guidance for full year 2017. In the third quarter, our revenue grew 8% operationally. And we are at 7% operational growth for the first nine months of the year. The main driver for our third quarter revenue growth remains companion animal products, which grew an impressive 19% operationally and 13% through the first nine month. This was driven largely by sales of our industry leading dermatology portfolio consisting of Apoquel and Cytopoint, our new oral parasiticide, Simparica, and several other new companion animal products. In the U.S., companion animal products grew 21%, and in international markets, they grew 15% operationally. We continue to expand our business in dermatology. Our latest data in the U.S. shows that 59% of dogs with dermatology conditions are treated with Apoquel or Cytopoint, up from 55% in the second quarter. Cytopoint has now been fully launched in the fourth quarter in European Union, and we expect to generate further Cytopoint growth in these countries. As a result of the success in the U.S. and continued expansion in other international market, our global dermatology portfolio achieved $124 million in sales in the third quarter, up from $102 million in the second quarter. Through the first nine months of the year, our dermatology revenue is at $303 million. And now, we expect peak sales of more than $500 million. Simparica sales also increased in the third quarter. And we continue to track well with our expectations for the year in this large, but highly competitive market. We obtained approvals in new markets like Japan and Taiwan. And expect to launch in the first quarter of 2018. We remain confident in the blockbuster potential of this product. The direct-to-consumer advertising campaigns for Apoquel and Simparica, which began in the second quarter in the U.S. have had a positive impact on sales and are in line with our expectations. We have been able to support disease awareness for atopic dermatitis, and have established more brand recognition and product differentiation for Simparica, as a superior flea and tick protection. Meanwhile, our livestock portfolio grew 2% operationally, with increases in fish, poultry, and swine products, offset by a decline in cattle products. In fish products, we increased our third quarter sales 52% operationally, roughly equal to our total sales for the first half of this year. This strong performance was driven by the launch of a new vaccine in Norway to prevent pancreatic disease in salmon. And we have also worked with customers in Chile and seen a resumption of strong sales there for our SRS vaccine for salmon. We feel very positive about these new two products for farm fish, and we continue to lead the vaccine market for supporting the salmon production. Our expansion into vaccines for other fish species in other global markets will help drive future growth for our fish business. In the case of poultry products, we grew 7% operationally. We continue to generate strong growth in the U.S., where our expertise and broad product portfolio are helping customers address evolving consumer and retailer preferences. Using our Poulvac vaccine and medicated feed additive such as Zoamix, Robenz or Deccox is helping certain producers, who are choosing to shift to no-antibiotic-ever production. In the third quarter, our swine products grew 1% operationally, led by strong international sales of our Suvaxyn PCV combo product and by sales of Improvac in Brazil. The growth was offset by decline in the U.S. pork business, but our updated PCV M-Hyo vaccine in the U.S. continues to demonstrate good customer adoption. We believe our U.S. pork business is positioned to return it to at/or above market growth in 2018. Overall, our U.S. swine business and U.S. cattle business, were both impacted by ongoing implementation of the Veterinary Feed Directive, or VFD, which caused changes to some producer's protocol for use of medicated feed additive. In the cattle market, our sales declined 2% operationally. This decline was driven by the U.S., mainly due to the VFD implementation, as well as the impact of promotional activities last year and healthier animals. We continue to see positive growth in other major beef markets like Brazil, Argentina, and Australia. We also still see positive signs related to the export from the U.S. and increasing herd size in 2017 and into 2018. We expect our U.S. cattle business will return to growth in the fourth quarter. As for earnings in the third quarter, we posted 25% operational growth in adjusted net income, significantly faster than revenue growth of 8%. And year to-date, we have generated 16% operational growth in adjusted net income. Our value proposition for shareholders has always been based on growing adjusted net income faster than sales, while making the right investment in our commercial, R&D, and manufacturing capabilities to ensure long-term profitable revenue growth. In terms of innovation in the third quarter, the European Commission granted us approval for a new addition to the Suvaxyn/Fostera family of vaccines for swine. This new product is a modified live vaccine that protect pigs against their porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome, one of the most common diseases affecting swine herds. Also in the third quarter, Zoetis extended its poultry portfolio with the approval of the new Poulvac vaccine in Korea to prevent certain local strains of infectious diseases. We are also continuing with our supply network strategy to support our new products and long-term growth. Manufacturing is critical to our past and future success. Over the last few years, we have eliminated a number of low volume products from our portfolio and reduced our manufacturing footprint to improve our overall efficiency. While we still have the imminent sale of our Guarulhos plant in Brazil to complete, we also have several opportunities to invest and position our manufacturing network to best support our portfolio; secure manufacturing control over high value products and improve their cost. For example, we plan to build a new manufacturing facility in China. This site will expand our capacity to develop and manufacture vaccine for swine, cattle, and farm fish for the Chinese market. It would also serve as a central research center in China. We anticipate breaking ground in spring of 2018. In October, we also acquired the remaining 55% ownership stake in the Jilin Zoetis Guoyuan joint venture from our partners in China. And now we have sole ownership of the JV, which was founded in 2011 to produce swine vaccines. In Ireland, we recently acquired the former MSD manufacturing site in Rathdrum. This facility will give us better control of active pharmaceutical ingredients, which are used in many of our key products. It will also make us less dependent on third parties and improve our long-term cost for these durable assets. We have also announced plans to expand manufacturing capacity at our facility in Kalamazoo, Michigan to support more products like Simparica, and we expect to complete those renovations by early 2019. And in Charles City, Iowa, we are finalizing plans to expand our site and increase capacity for new poultry vaccines in the coming years. All represent important uses of our capital to build and ensure our capacity for growth. In summary, we continue to use our direct sales presence, our diverse and innovative portfolio of our products and high quality manufacturing network to achieve our financial goals in the first nine months of the year. As we move into the fourth quarter, we are raising our full-year 2017 guidance for revenue and net income based on our continued confidence in our performance. With that, let me hand things over to Glenn, who will provide more details on our third quarter results and full-year guidance.
Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you, Juan Ramón, and good morning, everyone. We delivered another solid quarter with top line growth coming from our dermatology portfolio and new companion animal products, and with strong performance from our international livestock portfolio in key markets, including Brazil, Australia, Japan, and Mexico. Total company revenue grew 8% operationally, excluding a favorable 1% impact from foreign exchange. Of that 8%, 4% came from dermatology products, 4% came from Simparica and other new products, and the remaining portfolio was relatively flat. Unlike recent quarters, our product rationalization has limited impact on our growth this quarter, and we expect the same for the fourth quarter. Now, a few revenue highlight. Our dermatology portfolio once again surpassed the $100 million mark with $124 million in sales in the quarter. As we've indicated in the past, Q2 and Q3 are the peak seasons for dermatitis in the U.S. Sales of Simparica were $25 million in the quarter, growing 280% over the prior year and 21% sequentially. In terms of the bottom line, we delivered 25% operational growth in both adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS. We were able to achieve this significant level of growth due to the full year impact of cost reductions from our operational efficiency initiative, as well as leveraging our infrastructure. Our performance in this quarter is another example of our ability to execute on our value proposition of growing adjusted earnings faster than sales over the long-term. Now on to segment revenue. Our International segment generated operational revenue growth of 11%, while the U.S. grew 6%. Our International segment displayed balanced growth across both species and markets. This growth is a testament to our diversity, not only from a product portfolio perspective, but geographically as well. Turning to some key markets in the quarter. Starting with Australia; favorable market conditions for livestock drove growth of 19% operationally. Higher sheep prices combined with greater market penetration of our vaccine contributed to growth. And the beef cattle herd in Australia continued its expansion following several years of drought. In companion animal, our growth was driven by Apoquel. In Brazil, we grew 14% operationally in the quarter, behind the strength of both our livestock and companion animal businesses. In livestock, investments we have made to expand our field force, in addition to favorable market conditions continue to contribute to growth in cattle product. In swine, increased sales of Improvac were driven by higher usage and greater penetration with larger customers. Meanwhile, higher companion animal revenue in Brazil benefited from the continued growth of Simparica, as it's known in Brazil. Switching to China. We delivered another strong quarter, growing 22% operationally with growth coming from our companion animal vaccines business. Underlying demand for our vaccines remain strong due to improving medicalization rates and a growing population, and growth in the quarter was aided by supply resumption of one of our vaccines. Revenue in Japan declined 3% operationally in the quarter, due to a difficult comparison with the third quarter of 2016, when we experienced a significant initial stocking of Apoquel with wholesalers. Inventory levels have stabilized and we see a healthy rate of sales for Apoquel in Japan, driven by strong demand. PHARMAQ, which is reflected in other developed and other emerging markets, experienced significant growth in the quarter. This was driven by our recently introduced vaccine for pancreatic disease in Norway, as well as in-line product growth across various markets, including Chile. Norway and Chile are the two largest farmed salmon markets in the world, which combined, account for approximately 80% of global farmed salmon production. To summarize, a very strong quarter for our International segment with growth across the diversified portfolio, including all of our core species and key markets. This performance was driven by a combination of favorable market conditions, strategic investments, and our ability to consistently drive commercial results. Turning to the U.S.; revenue grew 6% in the third quarter. Companion animal grew 21% in the quarter, while livestock declined by 6%. Companion animal product sales in the quarter were driven primarily by our dermatology portfolio, Simparica, and a number of other recently launched products. U.S. dermatology sales were $89 million for the quarter with Cytopoint sales reaching $20 million in the U.S., exhibiting nice growth over both the prior year, as well as on a sequential basis. In addition, as Juan Ramón previously mentioned, we continue to see increasing penetration in total patient share reaching almost 60% in the quarter. This performance also resulted in 80% revenue share of the market. With the premium nature of our dermatology products, we are significantly expanding the size of the market, as we continue to grow patient share. Simparica grew significantly over the same quarter last year as our direct-to-consumer investment, field force focus, and other promotions led to higher clinic penetration. Additional contributions to companion animal growth came from new product launches, including Diroban, a recently approved product for the treatment of heartworm, and a number of line extension for our Vanguard vaccine franchise. Moving to U.S. livestock, sales declined 6% in the quarter, due to the performance of our cattle and swine businesses that more than offset robust growth in our poultry business. Declining sales in our cattle business have been impacted by a number of factors, including the impact of promotional activities in the prior year, lower disease risk, and incidence, as well as the continued implementation of the Veterinary Feed Directive and its impact on Aureomycin sales. On a year-to-date basis, the impact of the VFD on our cattle and swine business has been approximately $30 million. Our swine business declined again this quarter in the U.S., primarily due to competition in PCV/M. Hyo vaccine market, as well as the continued implementation of VFD. On the positive side, our updated PCV/M. Hyo vaccine continues to gain traction with small and medium sized producers. Hence, in U.S. poultry, the Zoetis portfolio of alternatives to antibiotic medicated feed additive continues to be the primary driver of growth, as certain producers expand their No Antibiotics Ever label. Our portfolio is well positioned to address these evolving industry practices. Now, turning to the rest of the P&L. Adjusted gross margin of 67.9% increased approximately 40 basis points on a reported basis versus prior year, and on a sequential quarter basis improved 230 basis points in the second quarter of this year. Our cost in this quarter, reflect the impact of cost improvements in our manufacturing network, as the higher cost inventory from 2016 has largely worked its way through our P&L, as expected. Adjusted SG&A declined by 2% in the quarter, as we continue to see the full impact of the expense reductions from our operational efficiency initiatives. Adjusted R&D expense increased 6% for the quarter, due primarily to the timing of project spending and incremental R&D associated with recent acquisitions. Operating expenses, in total, were flat versus the same period last year and they reflect significant decreased spending in G&A. Those savings are being reallocated to value generating investments in commercial operations and innovation, including direct-to-consumer advertising, field force expansion, and increased R&D. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was approximately 29%. It has significantly improved from the prior year, due to the impact of the favorable jurisdictional mix of earnings. The year-over-year improvement in our adjusted effective tax rate was a driver of operational adjusted net income growth and contributed 5% in operational growth to the overall 25% for the quarter. Moving to guidance, for full year 2017, our consistent top line performance through the year, success of productive investment, as well as effective discipline on costs are allowing us to improve our outlook for both revenue and adjusted diluted EPS. For the year, we are raising and narrowing our revenue guidance, and we now expect to deliver between $5.225 billion and $5.275 billion at revenue. The increase to our revenue expectation for the year is due to continued strength in our international business and the acceleration of our normal annual price increase in U.S. livestock to harmonize the timing of our price increases across our business. Our guidance for adjusted cost of sales for the full year continues to be approximately 33%, as we expect the continuation of the improvement we saw in Q3. For SG&A, we're increasing the range to reflect variable costs associated with our higher outlook at revenue. We've increased the lower end of adjusted R&D spend, as we continue to invest in future growth. Our guidance for the adjusted estimated tax rate of approximately 29% is consistent with our prior view and does not take into account any potential changes being discussed in Washington. With more than half of our adjusted pre-tax income in the U.S., a lowering of the U.S. corporate tax rate would have a meaningful benefit to us. As a result of the changes above, we have increased below and high-end for operational adjusted net income and now expect growth of 18% to 21%, corresponding with adjusted EPS expectations of $2.34 per share to $2.39 per share. In the third quarter, we also repurchased another $125 million in shares. And our guidance for reported and adjusted earnings per share reflects the share repurchases completed through Q3. In September, we announced a senior debt offering of $1.25 billion. The financing was completed as favorable long-term rate with a blended coupon of 3.38%. $750 million of these proceeds were used in October to retire debt that was scheduled to mature in the first quarter of 2018. The additional debt added to our balance sheet will align our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio within our preferred range of between 2.5 times and 3.0 times, as well as add incremental interest expense for the remainder of the year, which we have incorporated into guidance. Again, looking forward to 2018, we will have growth in our interest expense, based both on the higher debt balances, as well as the longer-term nature of the new debt. So just to summarize before we go to Q&A, we are undertaking a number of activities that serve as an indication of our commitment to sustainable and profitable growth. In manufacturing, we are investing in additional capacity for new products, building sites in important emerging markets and bringing strategic products under our full control, while improving cost. In R&D, we continue to invest in a range of innovation, from new novel compound and extending the life of existing brand to groundbreaking platform technologies, such as monoclonal antibodies. In our commercial operation, we've invested in direct-to-consumer advertising to raise awareness and grow the market for important new products, as well as expanded our field force presence in fast growing markets like China and Brazil. We continue to look for new external business development opportunities and invest in the recently acquired businesses, including Nexvet for unmet needs in chronic pain and PHARMAQ for farm fish, which experienced significant growth in the quarter. With that, I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our first question from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Michael Ryskin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi, thanks. This is Mike Ryskin on for Derik actually. Thanks for all the color on the quarter in terms of the moving parts for the companion animal portfolio and livestock as well. I was just wondering you mentioned that you expect U.S. cattle to return to growth in the fourth quarter. In terms of the impact you saw in the current quarter, could you breakdown how much of it was the lower incidence of disease risk versus the MFA headwinds? And then a quick follow-up in terms of volume and price contribution overall in the quarter. It sounds like you didn't see any price benefit. Is there an expectation that you will return to sort of 100 bps to 200 bps in 4Q and going forward, and what were the drivers of that? Thanks again.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: So, thank you, Mike. So definitely, we expect the U.S. cattle return to growth in the fourth quarter. You ask what were the drivers of the impact on the third quarter. Definitely, some of the impacts have been related to the Veterinary Feed Directive that had more permanent and higher impact that we initially estimated. So this has been year-to-date, as Glenn mentioned, something like $30 million. The other impact that was specific to the quarter, was some promotional activities that we did in the third quarter of last year that we didn't repeat this year. And this had a negative impact in this quarter. And finally, we have seen that the animals because of the weather condition has been showing healthier conditions, and this has been mainly affected the use of some premium antibiotics. We expect this type of things being corrected in the fourth quarter, and then, as I said in the fourth quarter showing a positive growth in U.S. cattle. Then the second question was about price volume, and Glenn will respond to that.
Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.: Yes. So Mike, in terms of price and volume, for the overall business we saw about 8% volume growth and relatively flat price. And that flat price is really driven by two things. A, we saw positive price movements in international as we were able to take advantage of inflationary markets. And then, we did slightly decline in the U.S. in price in the quarter, really just driven by certain promotions that we had in the quarter. Over the long-term, we still expect to return to positive price increasing for the business.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Next question, please.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Kevin Ellich with Craig-Hallum. Please go ahead.
Kevin Ellich - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC: Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions, and congrats on a nice quarter. Juan Ramón, I guess starting off with the aquaculture business, really strong growth driven by Norway. Can you talk about that new product that you launched, and is that also available in Chile and how big do you think aquaculture can be over time for you guys?
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Well, the product that we launched in Norway is specific to Norway. It's pancreatic disease that there is a vaccine or it's a condition that is quite prevalent in some part of Norway. And we were not participating in this business. Now, we have a vaccine and this vaccine is performing extremely well, and also having a positive impact in the rest of the portfolio. We are not expecting that pancreatic disease affecting Chile, but in Chile for instance we have the SRS disease, which is not affecting Norway. So we – as in many other parts of our business some of the diseases are very specific to countries or regions that's why we need to also – to respond to these diseases. We have different products depending on countries of origin. This year, we initially forecasted $125 million in revenues for the farm fish because we had some challenge in the second quarter in Chile also related to this SRS vaccine. We had some negative impact in the quarter that has been solved in the third quarter, and we expect continue growing on the SRS in Chile. But because of the impact of the second quarter, we have adjusted our projection for the year, about $110 million, $115 million. Long term, I think we expect that this business will be growing faster than the average of the animal health industry, animal health industry growing at 5% to 6%. We expect the farm fish growing faster, especially the area of vaccines in where we are leading, and we expect that we will continue bringing innovation to the market. Next question, please.
Operator: We'll take the next question from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets.
Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good morning. Thank you very much for taking the questions. First, I just want to clarify, I understood the comments on U.S. livestock correctly. So you not only expect to return to growth in 4Q, but you expect in line with the market growth in 2018, and could you tell us what your expectations for the market is? And then, just a broader question, Glenn, I think you said 4% of the growth is coming from derm, 4% of the growth is coming from Simparica, and the rest of business was flat. That clearly doesn't – that clearly implies that you need new products for growth. And the issues on the U.S. livestock aside, I just want to get a better sense as to how you think you're competitively positioned, and particularly the derm space, I'm sure this growth hasn't gone unnoticed by your competitors. So, as these launches moderate, A, how do you think, you will compete relative to the competitors? And yeah, I'll stop there. Thank you very much.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you, Alex. I will respond to the U.S. livestock question first, and then we'll discuss about the competitive landscape in dermatology. So first, as I said that we expect the fourth quarter, the U.S. cattle business returning to growth. In the U.S., the poultry business is doing very well. Pork has been challenging during the year. In both cases, cattle and pork or swine, we expect growth in 2018. I mentioned that in the swine or pork business, we expect to grow at or above market growth. In the case of cattle, what we see is that there are positive factors; export remains strong. We expect also that the number of animals will continue growing in 2018. The market is a little bit more positive now about the expansion of herd than some month ago. And the other element that we expect also will have a positive impact in our revenues will be the products affected by the Veterinary Feed Directive, has been rebased. And in terms of growth, we don't expect any significant impact in 2018. So all these elements make us confident that the livestock in general for the U.S. will be showing positive numbers. One of the things that is always important to remember is that, we have a portfolio, which is highly diverse in terms of geographies. And we know that in some cases we'll be facing challenge – one market that will be compensated with maybe acceleration of revenues in other market, which is what is happening in 2017. And we continue to expect that this will be an element that will provide more sustainable and predictable growth in our business. The second question was about competitive landscape in dermatology. Today, we are only competing with steroids, we are competing with some other products that are creating probably not significant revenues in this market. We expect that in the future, some of our competitors will bring products into the market. This is an area that we show that it's a significant opportunity. Now, we are projecting more than $500 million combining Apoquel/Cytopoint. So, it's something that definitely we can expect in the future. But just as a reference, so for us developing Apoquel took about eight years, Cytopoint seven years. So, even if competitors now are reacting based on the success that we are delivering, definitely yeah, I think we feel comfortable that in the coming years, we'll maintain our very strong position in the market. Next question, please.
Operator: We'll go next to Louise Chen with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.
Louise Chen - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Hi. Thanks for taking my question here. So, now that you've optimized your operating platform, how do we or how should we think about your cash flow generation going forward, and how do you prioritize this cash? And then, the second thing here is just that you had a very robust gross margin this quarter, how sustainable is that going forward? Thank you.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: I will ask Glenn to cover these two questions. Thank you, Louise.
Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.: So, from a cash flow generation perspective, I think when you look at 2017, we've guided that we see our operating cash flow pretty closely approximating adjusted net income and that implies significant growth in cash flow this year, as we get out of lot of the cost related to our operational efficiency initiative, the implementation of SAP and other cost. And we continue to expect to drive cash flow growth at a faster pace than adjusted net income, as we do have opportunities in working capital, particularly in inventory that we'll continue to leverage. In terms of the gross margin, so we saw nice improvement in gross margin in Q3. And just as a reminder, in the first half of the year, we had gross margin of about 65%. As we moved into Q3, our gross margin is 67.9%. As we got away from the cost of the previous years' inventory and how we worked that through our P&L, and this was exactly as we expected and it does give us greater confidence in our full-year guidance of cost of goods at approximately 33%. And in terms of how that moves forward, while we're not giving specific guidance for 2018 at this point, we still are committed to the 200 basis point improvement in gross margin by 2020, and we do expect to see some of that come forward in 2018.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Next question please.
Operator: Next question comes from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: (41:34-41:44).
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: We couldn't hear you. Are you still there? So, next question please.
Operator: We'll take the next question from Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse: Thanks. A follow-up on the gross margin trend in terms of species mix and profitability. What were sort of the major components driving that gross margin trend in the quarter? And curious why, I guess, it wasn't even higher given the disproportionate exposure to presumably a higher margin business, and I think you mentioned promotional activity around that, but how much was that a contributing factor and will that continue? And then, the second part on the VFD. I guess, how do you expect to offset this, I guess near-term? As we head into 2018, do you anticipate incremental headwinds from the VFD in medicinal feed additives in the U.S. alone in 2018. And is this greater than what you've kind of experienced, I guess in 2017, and what have you sort of gleaned from (42:47) or can compare it to what has transpired in Europe in terms of those regulations? Thanks.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you, Erin. Glenn, do you want to answer the gross margin question, please.
Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.: So, in terms of gross margin for the quarter, Erin, and what are the components that drive it, and why it couldn't necessarily be even more favorable. There are number of factors in terms of gross margin. So, A, there is the product component that you referenced. But there is also the market mix component. And when you look at the quarter in particular, we saw stronger growth in our international market versus U.S. and as our international markets generally have lower gross margin than the U.S. in total that did impact the quarter.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: And in terms of the VFD, we think that the impact has been mostly affecting 2017, and it's pretty much now the impact or the volume of products affected by these new directive been rebased. We expect that some minor impact in 2018, but not having a significant impact in our revenue growth. Next question please.
Operator: We'll go next to John Kreger with William Blair. Please go ahead.
John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi, thanks very much. Could you give us an update on generics on your business. So, both in terms of what brands are seeing the most erosion from generic pressures, and then, conversely how is your generic business doing? Thanks.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you, John. So, in terms of generic, we have not seen an acceleration of penetration in this year, so it's in line with our expectations. We continue supporting our products that are affected by generic competition with lifecycle innovation, and an example has been the introduction of the chewable formulation for Clavamox. Clavamox is doing very well, and we are delivering the results in line with our projections. In the case of Rimadyl, it's a combination of not only generic, but the introduction of our new products. But still, what we have seen in terms of a generic penetration for Rimadyl it's in line with the trends that we already projected or already discussed in previous meetings. We still think that the impact over time, it's about 20% to 40% and will remain what we still project for this type of generic competition. Next question, please.
Operator: We'll go next to Jon Block with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks. Good morning. I'll ask two questions upfront. First one, Glenn, just to push you a little bit on the gross margin, is there any sort of (45:41) the cadence of gross margin? In other words, per your full year guidance, it looks like you should be exiting this year or 4Q 2017 at around 65% or even 69%. You do call out a lot of investment and manufacturing in the coming quarters, so just wondering if that weighs a bit in 2018. I know you said higher next year, but I just want to be as clear as possible, without be a little bit higher of the full year 2017 number? And then just maybe, Juan Ramón, the peak sales of $500 million plus for the derm portfolio, those numbers have been tremendous, but maybe a time line for this to be achieved? In other words, this quarter you can annualize it out to $0.5 billion-ish. I know you benefited from seasonality in the DTC, but is the thought that you can get to that sort of peak number within the next 12 to 24 months? Thanks, guys.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you, Jon, and let me answer the dermatology portfolio projection, and then Glenn will cover the gross margin question. So, we think that these peak sales of more than $500 million. We expect to generate that in the next two or three years. So, it's not talking about peak sales on five years, no, in this case, two or three years and is what we expected to achieve this more than $500 million in sales for Apoquel and Cytopoint combined. Glenn?
Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.: So Jon, just to go a little deeper into the gross margin, so your question on Q4, I mean if you look at the year-to-date gross margin, we're sitting at approximately 66%. Our guidance would imply approximately 67%, right, which would imply a better Q4. Some of the drivers of that, as Juan Ramón mentioned, we do expect the U.S. cattle to return to growth and some of the premium anti-infectives there as well generate a higher margin and that is one impact that will give us better margin as we look into Q4. In terms of 2018 and my comments there, that was referring to full year 2017 expectations on cost of goods and an improvement over that as we move in 2018.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Next question, please.
Operator: We'll take the next question from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yes, thanks very much. So, I have two questions please. The first is, with respect to your companion animal product launch ramps, could you provide some color on where those stand ex-U.S.? And basically where you are in ramping up new companion animal products ex-U.S.? And then second, looking ahead to future innovation in R&D, will it continue to be more heavily weighted towards companion animal or should we think about the pace of livestock, new product launches accelerating? Thank you.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you Dave. Glenn, will provide details of sales U.S. and ex-U.S., and then I will respond to your question on the R&D.
Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.: So, in terms of the new companion animal products U.S. and ex-U.S. the ramp is definitely ahead of the curve, in terms of the U.S., just based on the timing of launches and the availability of the products. So, for example we just recently launched Cytopoint outside of the U.S. in Europe. So, in terms of the breakout between – so for total derm, we had sales of $124 million with $89 million in the U.S. and $35 million international; for Simparica, we had sales of $25 million, $17 million of that is in the U.S. and $8 million is in international.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you, Glenn. In terms of where we invest in R&D, I think we have a good distribution of investment between livestock and companion animal. We have been successful in new products in companion animal, but this is not an implication that in the future we'll not be bringing products in poultry, swine or cattle, and also now including fish. One of the example, is that we expected to introduce a new poultry vaccines in the vector technology in the U.S. in 2018. And also, we expect to have new PCV vaccines for swine in the U.S. also in 2018. So, we continue investing in all the different areas of our portfolio, and we are not just targeting companion animal. On the contrary, we are trying really to diversify our investment and maintain the diversity in our portfolio. Next question, please.
Operator: We'll go next to Kathy Miner with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.
Kathy M. Miner - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good morning, Juan Ramón. Given the recent comments from a large competitor, if Elanco, Merial and Merck Animal Health all became independent companies, what would be the impact on Zoetis, and how would you size up each of these as a potential competitor? Thank you.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: First, the decisions of other companies, definitely we cannot make any comment. But definitely having competitors that will be competing with us as a public companies, I don't see that as a negative. On the contrary, you will see that our financials are very good – are very good now, if we compare to other companies in animal health. And in my opinion, you will see that our margins are significantly higher than any other competitor. So, having this public information in my opinion will be only positive to us. Next question, please.
Operator: We'll take the next question from Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Esther Rajavelu - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. This is Esther Rajavelu on for Gregg Gilbert. Thank you for taking my question. On the companion portfolio, can you please discuss the trends you're seeing on the use of Cytopoint versus Apoquel? How are vets choosing between the two, and any pet owner feedback you may have on one product versus the other?
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Well, we provide information about the two products to the veterinarians, it's up to them to decide, which one is meeting best the needs of their patients; Apoquel it's oral, Cytopoint, it's injectable. In some cases, while injectable is a preferred option for treating these type of medical condition. In the case of Cytopoint/Apoquel decisions, I think it's up to veterinarians, and in some cases that they are even combining the two products, depending on why they feel it's the best for their patients. And in terms of Cytopoint, the feedback has been extremely positive. So, we know that with Apoquel, it's now very well established in the market. Cytopoint, it was more recent, but I think feedback that we are getting from veterinarians is extremely positive; in terms of efficacy, but also in terms of side effects. So in both cases, excellent feedback from the market. Next question, please.
Operator: And it appears we have no further questions at this time. I'll return the floor to Juan Ramón for any closing remarks.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you very much for joining us. And again, so we have delivered very strong results in this quarter. We are very confident on the fourth quarter, and that's why we are also raising our guidance for 2017. So, thank you very much.
Operator: Okay. Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude today's program. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.

Operator: Welcome to the second quarter 2017 financial results conference call and webcast for Zoetis. Hosting the call today is Steve Frank, Vice President of Investor Relations for Zoetis. The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, and will not be forwarded automatically. In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call via dial-in, or on the Investor Relations section of Zoetis.com. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the floor will be open for your questions following the presentation. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.
Steve Frank - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to Zoetis' second quarter 2017 earnings call. I am joined today by Juan Ramón Alaix, our Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn David, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website, and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements, and that actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statements in today's press release and our SEC filings, including but not limited to our Annual Report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q. Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures which were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release, and in the company's 8-K filing dated today, August 8, 2017. We also cite operational results which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. With that, I will turn the call over to Juan Ramón.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. As in previous quarters, the innovation we bring to the market and the diversity of our portfolio across the geographies, the species, and the therapeutic areas are all supporting in the consistency of our financial results. Our innovations include the recent introduction of new products like Cytopoint, Simparica, and Stronghold Plus, and lifecycle innovations that are developed across our approximately 300 product lines. Our diverse portfolio helps us overcome economic cycles and deal with all the political situations and weather conditions that affect the markets, the species, or the product categories. We are seeing this diversity once again in the second quarter. And along with the excellent execution of our Zoetis team and our singular focus on animal health, all these factors helped deliver excellent results. In the second quarter, our revenue grew 6% operationally, and excluding the impact of product rationalizations that we have discussed before, our operational growth would have been 7%. We expect this will be the last quarter that we see any significant impact from the product rationalization, as those efforts and comparisons are largely complete. The main driver of our second quarter revenue growth remains companion animal products, which grew 10% operationally, driven largely by sales of our industry-leading dermatology portfolio consisting of Apoquel and Cytopoint and our new oral parasiticide, Simparica. In the U.S., companion animal products grew 7%, and in international markets, they grew 15% operationally. We continue to see further penetration of new products in key countries outside of the U.S. such as Japan, Brazil, and Canada. We have been supporting growth for Simparica and Apoquel with direct-to-consumer advertising that we have started in the second quarter in the U.S. We have made similar efforts in Brazil. Initial reports on DTC in the U.S. are positive, and we look forward to analyzing more data as we evaluate the full-year impact. Our total dermatology portfolio has shown significant growth, achieving our first-ever quarter of more than $100 million in sales. We continue to build disease awareness through our DTC campaign and expect to expand the market. Our latest data shows that 55% of dogs with dermatology problems in the U.S. are treated with Apoquel or Cytopoint, up from 52% in the first quarter. Cytopoint has gotten good traction in the U.S. this year. And in EU countries we are conducting an early experience program and expect to fully launch in September. We believe the early adoption and stable reaction in the U.S. is a good indication of the success we can achieve in the European markets. Although Simparica sales were lower than in the first quarter, we continue to track well with our expectation for the year in this highly competitive market. In the U.S., we have seen net sales from clinics to pet owners growing market share since the beginning of the year. Meanwhile, our livestock portfolio grew 3% operationally, with increases in cattle and poultry products being partially offset by a decline in fish products. Our swine product sales in the quarter were flat. In the cattle market, we posted 4% operational growth. Export demand for U.S. beef has been increasing due the lower average retail prices. And we continue to see positive signs in other major beef-producing markets, like Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Australia, and Canada. In the case of poultry products, we grew 4% operationally. We are seeing strong growth in the U.S., driven mostly for our broad portfolio and expertise to help customers address a range of consumer and retailer preferences. Combining our vaccines with product such as Zoamix, Robenz, and Deccox, we are helping certain producers shift to No Antibiotics Ever production. In swine products, although we have taken actions to strengthen our vaccine portfolio in the U.S., we are still showing a decline in U.S. sales. In international, however, our swine business is growing very strongly, led by China, the world's largest pork market. In fish products in the second quarter, we have seen a decline of 5% operationally, mainly due to a slower uptake of our SRS vaccine in Chile. Nevertheless, we still expect double-digit growth for fish products this year, and we remain confident in the long-term prospects for this business. We posted 11% operational growth in adjusted net income, once again faster than revenue growth of 6% and in line with our value proposition to shareholders to grow adjusted net income faster than revenue. And the full implementation of our efficiency initiative is enabling us to invest in additional promotional activities like DTC, while showing only a modest 1% operational growth in operating expenses. With our increasing cash flow, we continue to look at other investments we can make to support our future growth. One key area is ensuring reliable, high-quality supply to drive our growth. As part of our supply network strategy, we expect to complete the sales of our Guarulhos plant in Brazil in the fourth quarter. At the same time, we are planning to expand our vaccine plant and invest in manufacturing capacity for other innovative products. We'll share more details as plans move farther along. While new products like Simparica and Cytopoint may get well-deserved headlines, we also focus on lifecycle innovation to keep established brands delivering value to customers over decades. For example, Zoetis received approval in May from the FDA for Clavamox Chewable for dogs. This leading anti-infective was first approved in the U.S. in 1984, and it provides a broad spectrum of treatment for various infections in dogs and cats. Clavamox Chewables join the original tablet and liquid drop formulations, which we'll continue to market. And our internal innovation is complemented by M&A opportunities. Last week, we completed the acquisition of Nexvet Biopharma, an innovator in monoclonal antibody therapies for companion animals in management of chronic pain and other therapeutic area. This acquisition demonstrates how we use external innovation in key technologies and therapeutic areas to support future growth. Nexvet strengthens our R&D pipeline in monoclonal antibodies to help us to sustain our leadership in chronic pain management for companion animals, an area valued at an estimated $400 million a year, and which is poised for innovation with new monoclonal antibody therapies. We are moving ahead with the work of integrating Nexvet into our existing research and manufacturing operations in order to advance with their promising product candidates. With the first half of the year now behind us, we are tracking to our expectations. We are pleased with the strong start to the year, and we are increasing our full-year 2017 guidance for revenue and net income, based on foreign currency changes and our continued confidence. With that, let me hand things over to Glenn, who will provide more details on our second quarter results and full-year guidance. Glenn?
Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you, Juan Ramón, and good morning, everyone. We had another solid quarter based on the strong growth of our dermatology portfolio and other recently launched companion animal products, as well as growth in our global livestock portfolio, which was balanced across our U.S. and international business segments. Total company revenue grew 6% operationally, which excludes the negative 1% impact from foreign exchange. Breaking down that 6% growth, 6% came from dermatology and other new products, and 1% came from our inline portfolio, with the product rationalization having a negative 1% impact on operational growth. As Juan Ramón mentioned, our dermatology portfolio reached a considerable milestone with sales in the quarter of $102 million. As we have said in the past, Q2 and Q3 are the peak seasons for dermatitis in the U.S., with a softer Q1 and Q4. As expected, Simparica sales were lower sequentially at $20 million. This was driven primarily by the U.S. and the timing of distributor purchases in Q1, in anticipation of the flea and tick season. Internationally, we saw strong growth sequentially in Simparica, with additional penetration in most major markets. In terms of the bottom line, we delivered 11% operational growth in adjusted net income, and 12% operational growth in adjusted diluted EPS. Overall, we had another quarter of solid top line performance, and we again grew our bottom line faster than our sales. We continue to deliver steady, long-term growth in an attractive and stable industry. Our ability to bring innovative and differentiated products to market, combined with our diverse portfolio and leading commercial capabilities, gives us a stable foundation for future long-term growth. Now let's discuss segment revenues. Our International segment generated operational revenue growth of 7%, while the U.S. grew 5%. In the International segment, product rationalization had a negative 1% impact on growth. So let me highlight a few markets. China has delivered another strong quarter, growing 14% operationally, with growth coming from both our livestock and companion animal businesses. In livestock in China, we benefited from solid market dynamics in swine, including favorable pork prices through the first half of the year. We expect some softening in this trend during the second half of the year. However, the continued modernization of production will drive greater long-term growth based on the use of vaccines and medicines to ensure a safe, high-quality food supply. In companion animal, our recently expanded field force continues to partner with local veterinarians to improve medicalization rates and increase routine care for pets in China. In Brazil, we grew 8% operationally in the quarter behind the strength of our cattle and companion animal businesses. Investments in field force expansion and favorable market condition contributed to growth in cattle, despite recent industry and government headlines. And companion animal growth in Brazil was driven by new product introductions, including Simparica and Apoquel. Japan also made a significant contribution in the quarter, growing 17% operationally over the same quarter last year. Apoquel sales begin to normalize with distributors and better reflect the strong underlying demand in the local market. As a reminder, there was significant distributor stocking in Q3 of 2016, when we initially launched Apoquel. Key markets in Europe performed well in the quarter, as the U.K., Germany, France, Spain, and Italy all exhibited operational growth. The U.K. and Germany led the way at 12% and 8% operational growth respectively. Growth in the U.K. was driven primarily by Apoquel, while Germany's performance was due to strength in both Apoquel and Simparica. To summarize, very strong growth in our International business coming from a number of sources, including strong market trends, strategic investments, and our success in bringing new value-added products to market. Turning to the U.S., revenue grew 5% in the second quarter, companion animal grew 7%, and livestock grew 3%. Companion animal sales in the quarter were driven primarily by our dermatology portfolio, Simparica, and a number of other new product launches. U.S. dermatology sales were $74 million for the quarter, with Cytopoint sales reaching $15 million, exhibiting nice sequential growth as clinic penetration and dosing accelerate. As Juan Ramón said, patient share also continues to grow for Apoquel and Cytopoint. As I mentioned earlier, Simparica sales were lower this quarter than last, but still in line with expectations. Our increased selling and promotional activity will lay the groundwork for continued revenue growth in this highly competitive market. We will continue to evaluate the performance of our direct-to-consumer promotional campaign for Apoquel and Simparica, with early indications suggesting that we are on track to meet our business objectives. Additional contributions to companion animal growth came from new products including Diroban, which recently received approval for the treatment of dogs with heartworm. With the introduction of Diroban, Zoetis now offers veterinarians a full canine heartworm product portfolio, including prevention, detection, and treatment. Moving to U.S. livestock, sales grew 3% in the quarter, due primarily to our cattle and poultry businesses. Our cattle business returned to growth this quarter due to the success of products such as Actogain and Synovex, while sales of our premium injectable antibiotics continue to be impacted by healthier animals moving into the feedlots. As certain poultry producers expand their no-antibiotics-ever labels, our portfolio of medicated feed additives for these criteria are doing well and contributed to poultry growth in the U.S. We work closely with our customers to provide the necessary products and technical assistance to help them switch over when they choose. Our swine business declined again this quarter in the U.S., primarily due to competition for our Fostera PCV/M. hyo vaccine. Our updated vaccine product is seeing modest uptake with medium and smaller producers, and we will continue to work with customers to gain acceptance. Finally, both our cattle and swine businesses were impacted by the implementation of the Veterinary Feed Directive, or VFD, which negatively impacted our medicated feed additive performance, as producers are adjusting to the new regulation in how to adopt their protocols. Now turning to the rest of the P&L. Adjusted gross margin of 65.6% decreased approximately 230 basis points year over year on a reported basis and, on a sequential quarter basis, improved 120 basis points from the first quarter of this year. As I had mentioned during last quarter's earnings call, in 2017, we have made additional cost improvements in our manufacturing network. As a result, in the first quarter of 2017, we recognized higher costs associated with previously produced inventory, which depressed our gross margin. This change also had a negative impact on our second quarter margin, which we had previously indicated. The second quarter results for adjusted gross margin, while showing improvement over the first quarter, are slightly below our initial expectations. We have been working to improve our inventory management, including reductions in the level of inventory write-offs we incur. While we still expect to improve in this area for 2017, the magnitude of improvement is less than we had expected and will continue to be an area of focus in the future. Gross margin was also impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange in the quarter. Adjusted SG&A grew by 1% in the quarter, with higher investment in our DTC advertising campaign offsetting the expense reductions in other areas. Adjusted R&D declined 1% operationally for the quarter due to the timing of project spending and fixed expense reductions from our operational efficiency initiative. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was approximately 29%. The tax rate in the quarter is significantly improved from the prior year, primarily due to the impact of operational changes implemented in the third quarter of last year. Taking all these factors into consideration, we generated 11% operational growth in adjusted net income for the quarter. Moving to guidance for full year 2017. This year, we continue to perform in line with our expectations, with certain upsides and downsides, particularly with tax and cost of goods sold. For the year, we still except to achieve operational revenue growth of 5.5% to 7.5% and an adjusted EBIT margin of 34% to 35%. Since our last update in May, changes in FX rates in several markets are favorable to revenue, and we are increasing both the lower end and higher end of the range as a result. We have also narrowed the range for revenue towards the high end of our guidance by $25 million to reflect our performance to date and our confidence in the remainder of the year. Our guidance for the range of cost of goods sold for the year has moved from 32% to 33% of revenue to approximately 33%. As we progress into the second half of the year, our results will more fully reflect the impact of our manufacturing cost improvements. Our updated view, however, also reflects the higher expense for inventory charges that I discussed earlier, as well as unfavorable mix and foreign exchange. For SG&A, we're increasing the low end of our range and maintaining the high end, consistent with the change in our revenue guidance. We have increased both the low end and high end of our R&D expense range to reflect additional investments, primarily as a result of the Nexvet acquisition and the impact of foreign exchange. Our guidance for an adjusted effective tax rate has been lowered to approximately 29% from our pervious guidance of 30%. The favorable change is primarily due to jurisdictional mix and certain discrete item that have been realized in the first half of the year and does not take into account any potential tax changes being discussed in Washington. With more than half of our adjusted pre-tax income in the U.S., a lowering of the U.S. corporate tax rate would have a meaningful benefit to us. As a result of the aforementioned changes, we've increased the low and high end of the range for adjusted net income for the year. In the second quarter, we also repurchased another $125 million in shares, and our guidance for reported and adjusted earnings per share reflects the share repurchases completed through Q2. We expect our operating cash flow to grow through the year, allowing us to fund incremental investment in our business, including the including the $85 million used to purchase Nexvet last week. Just to summarize before we go to Q&A, we have delivered consistent operational revenue growth of 6% in the first half of the year. We expect positive trends in the uptake of new products and growth in international livestock to continue. Our earnings growth will accelerate meaningfully in the second half of the year, and cash flow generation will continue to improve, giving us greater flexibility to invest in our business. With that, I'll hand things over to the operator to open the lines for your questions. Operator?
Operator: We'll take our first question from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi, good morning.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Good morning.
Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.: Good morning.
Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hello? Oh, great. So just a couple of questions. So the first on – now that you've closed Nexvet, could you give a little bit more timing on the pipeline? How can we think about some of the products coming through? I believe they've got one canine and one feline drug coming in the research development pipeline right now. Could you just give us some tiny update there? And also, on the gross margin, could you sort of back out what the different headwinds were this quarter and sort of what the underlying growth rate was? Thanks.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you, Derik. And I will take the first question, and then Glenn will answer the question on the gross margin. So, Nexvet, we completed the acquisition last week, on Monday last week. Our team, R&D team, it's now interacting with the R&D team of Nexvet, getting a getting full understanding of all the programs. When we have completed this analysis, then we will define when we expect to launch the product for both dogs and cats in both the U.S. and the European end markets. So it's a little bit too early now. But, again, so one thing that we need to remember is that we are in a market in where our competitors are not providing any detail in terms of R&D products, and providing too many details, and especially in an area that we think that can be also of high interest, will have a negative impact in our programs and maybe in the opportunity to generate future revenue growth.
Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.: And in terms of gross margin, the cost of goods sold, so for Q1, our cost of goods sold was about 35.6% of revenue. In Q2 that improved to 34.4%. The key drivers of that were the costing methodology and the fact that we did recognize a disproportionate amount of the higher costs associated with previously produced inventory in the first half of the year. When you look at our guidance for the full year of approximately 33%, that definitely implies a significant improvement in the second half of the year after we're outside the costs associated with that previously produced inventory. Next question?
Operator: We'll take our next question from John Kreger with William Blair. Please go ahead.
John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks very much. Can you talk a bit more about your swine product performance? It seems like the vaccines have been under pressure for the last two or three quarter. Should we expect that to persist in the second half, or do you expect that to turn? Thank you.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you, John. Well, we mentioned that we have been working on our vaccine portfolio in both U.S. and international markets. We have seen good growth in international markets, but in the U.S. despite of – our portfolio now being much more competitive, we have not yet gained share as we expected. We remain confident that we have now a very strong portfolio. And very important, we also have products in our pipeline that will be reaching the market in 2018 that will bring this segment also to growth in the U.S. In the second half in the U.S. – that is also a question that you raised, I think – we'll be improving, but probably not improving as fast as we expected initially. On the other hand, in international, we expect continued growth and positive evolution of our portfolio in swine. Next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jon Block with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks, guys. Good morning. Two questions, and I'll try to ask them both upfront. First off, the PHARMAQ number was a bit light and, Juan Ramón, curious if you think it's market or market share, and is there a revised figure for the year, which I believe stood at $125 million? And then sort of for the guidance and just looking forward, Glenn. The gross margin will obviously be better in 2H relative to 1H. So do we take that 2H 2017 and sort of use it as our runway for 2018? And then, finally, I know you don't guide quarterly, but just how do we think about the cadence behind revenue growth? Believe we should think about it greater – the revenue growth – greater in 4Q relative to 3Q just from a comp and days adjustment perspective. Thanks, guys.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you, Jon. And – well, the PHARMAQ was the main driver of our light performance in the quarter. SRS vaccine, that – it was a significant growth driver, and it's a vaccine for salmon in Chile – it's still showing significant result in terms efficacy and safety, and it's helping fish farmers in Chile to reduce their use of antibiotics. In the second quarter, we saw a reduction of the use of the vaccine, mainly because of pricing discussions. At the end of quarter, we reached price agreement with fish customers in Chile, and we have seen already in the first two months of the third quarter, the vaccine showing very good revenues and very good growth. We remain very confident that this segment will deliver long-term growth. In the quarter, as I mentioned in my comments, we expect double-digit growth, but you mentioned the $125 million will be below this amount. But, nevertheless, we expect that in the future years, the correction will be in line with our expectations.
Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.: And, Jon, in terms of gross margin in the first half/second half, so as indicated with the guidance that we provided, we do expect a significant improvement in gross margin in the second half. Regarding the impact of that, and how you look at that for 2018, there are a numbers of factors that will impact the gross margin for 2018, including mix, foreign exchange, as well as the goals that we have in place from an inventory reduction perspective, which mainly just make some decisions that would have some impact on our ability to utilize overhead. While that would be the right impact from a cash flow perspective, it may have some negative impact from a P&L perspective. So there are a number of factors that'll impact gross margin for 2018, and when we provide guidance for 2018, you'll get better clarity on that. In terms of the guidance for the second half of the year from a revenue perspective, days has a minimal impact in the second half. We do have one more day in Q4, but other than that there's really nothing that would lead to a significant changes in growth between Q3 and Q4. Next question?
Operator: The next question comes from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you. Just following up on the question related to gross margins, are you still comfortable with your 200 basis point improvement after the 2017 initiative by 2020? Is that still on track? And also with respect to U.S. livestock, can you update us on the impact of meat prices this quarter and your expectations for the rest of the year? Thanks very much.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you for the question. So we are still seeing the opportunity of improving by 200 basis points in gross margin by 2020, and plans are moving ahead as expected. In terms of comments on the cattle business in the U.S., well, there are some positive factors that are really helping the cattle business in the U.S. One is the number of cows. It's expected to grow in 2017 and 2018. We also expect that the number of placements in feedlots will be higher than in 2016. And we also saw that the feedlot producers are generating profits in 2017, and we expect also the same in the second half. The price of the beef, it's also helping exporters to increase exportations to markets like Japan, markets like Mexico, and many other markets in where the beef it's – in the U.S. it's being exported. Also the prices of milk are positive. It is not related to beef, but we have seen an increase on the price of milk. It's still below prices that we saw in 2016, but this is also helping to rise the market. And at the same time, we have seen some headwinds in the U.S. market for our cattle. One was the mild weather in the first quarter that reduced the risk profile of animals and also had a negative impact in our premium antibiotics. The implementation of the Veterinarian (sic) [Veterinary] Feed Directive also had an impact in the first quarter, and we expect also having an impact in the remaining of the year. And finally, we have seen in the first half of the year that animals moving to the feedlots were heavier, again with a lower risk profile. In the second half, we expect that these animals will be medium size; that also will increase the opportunity for the cattle business. But in general we have seen that the prices in the different parts of the chain of production has been more positive than in 2016. Next question?
Operator: The next question comes from Louise Chen with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.
Louise Chen - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. First question I have is, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about some of your near- and long-term growth drivers, that being PHARMAQ, the Nexvet acquisition, and also the triple combo product, and how we should think about the peak sales potential for these products, and when we'll see some sort of meaningful accretion to earnings from these different products? And then the second question I have was just on diagnostics. Do you want a bigger footprint in diagnostics, and will you have to make additional investments to get there? Thank you.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Well, definitely we described that we expect 2017 companion animal being the main driver of growth, and the same for 2018. And this will be coming from still growth of Apoquel, growth of Cytopoint and Simparica. For Apoquel, Cytopoint, we mentioned that $400 million to $500 million is what we expect in terms of peak sales. For Simparica, as a single agent, it was to generate more than $100 million, and when we introduce this three-combo product, then we'll update on our expectations. So we have not yet provided details of what we expect for Simparica platform, that will include the single agent plus also Stronghold Plus, later also Revolution Plus in the U.S. and also the triple combo. In terms of PHARMAQ, we are convinced that this will continue generating double-digit growth. We expect double-digit growth in 2017. We have not yet provided details for 2018. We'll be providing this information in a later date. On Nexvet, it's too early to define what are the projections for the monoclonal antibody for managing pain in both dogs and cats. So, in all the pain market for dogs, it's about $400 million and we also know that cat is a real unmet need. So we see also opportunities to bring a monoclonal antibody to manage that pain for cats. In terms of diagnostics, we acquired SMB; that also complements the previous acquisition of Synbiotics. Now we have future participation in two segments. One is the rapid test at point of care, and the other one is equipment that will be coming out of the programs which have been developed by SMB. We are convinced that SMB have very interesting platforms in different areas: chemistry, immunology, molecular, also specialty. And we'll be working on developing all of these programs to bring products into the market. It will be a phasing of introduction of products, and we are confident that end of 2017 or early 2018, we'll start introducing new products into the market. Next question?
Operator: Your next question is from Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse: Great, thanks. Can you speak to some of the initiatives you alluded to in you prepared remarks in terms of the manufacturing footprint and also the potential for further rationalization? It sounds like you continue to expect the 200 basis points in gross margin expansion associated with those initiatives, I guess starting in 2018, but could that process be expedited at all? And then my second question. You mentioned building cash flow, which I think that statement is still absent from the press release disclosure. But can you speak to capital deployment priorities, how is the M&A pipeline shaping up, and is Nexvet fully incorporated into your guidance at this point from an expense perspective? Thanks.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Okay, thank you, Erin. We'll mention the comments on manufacturing initiative. So, first, we are – the manufacturing is always a continuous work in design opportunities for being more efficient. Reducing cost, it's a priority, but it's not the only priority that we have in design and manufacturing. We also want to make sure that we are improving the cost, at the same time ensuring that we have reliable supply. And at the same time that we are also working on reliable supply that we'll reduce our inventory levels. So this is something that is a target for the company. We identified a target for 2017, and we'll continue targeting inventory improvements over time. In terms of the initiatives that we already communicated is the 200 basis points by 2020. And you're asking if we can accelerate that. I think it's something that – we always try to do things as fast as we can, but at this point, what we are really targeting is to ensure that, by 2020, we generate these 200 basis points. And we also need to understand that, in some cases, these savings as a result of transferring the products from one plant to another plant or different plants, is something that it takes time, because it's a complex process to move products from different plants, and we need to make sure that when the product is in the final destination, it really delivers in terms of cost and also in terms of supply to the market. We also expect that, because of all the product rationalization, all the manufacturing plant rationalization, also we have opportunity for impact in terms of volumes and improving our allocation of overheads. In terms of cash flow and the priorities for our cash, we remain committed to invest internally, investing in commercial, and we have examples this year to invest in DTC campaigns to support new product launches. We also continue committed to bring innovation to the market internally with our R&D expertise and capabilities, and we see opportunities also for further expansion of some of the areas in where we think that we can improve our operations in terms of manufacturing, with special attention on ensuring that we have the right capabilities and capacity for vaccines in developed and also in emerging markets that also will be equally important. And we also mentioned that we, as a second priority, it's identified opportunities that will complement our internal efforts and will support further revenue growth and further profitability. And it's something that we are committed to identify these opportunities and bring these opportunities – to keep these opportunities – can bring values to our operations. And finally, you also asked in terms of Nexvet guidance. At this point, we are not yet providing any guidance in terms of Nexvet. It's too early. So we need first to have full control of all the programs that Nexvet has been – developed. We have access to some of these programs, but now that our R&D colleagues are really working together with Nexvet R&D colleagues, then we'll have a full understanding of the opportunity. So, Glenn will add some comments.
Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.: Yeah, Erin, just to clarify on the Nexvet. So for 2017, you'll notice that we did raise our R&D guidance, and that was to reflect the costs the we see for 2017 for Nexvet. Juan Ramón comment was more in terms of long-term guidance for Nexvet. The other thing I just wanted to comment on was the manufacturing initiatives. There are certain investments that we are contemplating that will lead to some increased capital expenses that'll keep our capital expense as we move to 2018 probably more aligned with previous years. However, those initiatives we do believe will shore up supply for some of our newer products, some of our key products, as well as key products in key markets. And they'll also have the right return from a financial perspective, bringing our costs down on those products as well. Next question?
Operator: Your next question is from Kevin Ellich with Craig-Hallum. Please go ahead.
Kevin Ellich - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC: Good morning, guys. Just, Juan Ramón, could you maybe give us an update on what you're seeing in the companion animal market? You guys gave some good detail on Simparica. Wanted to see why we saw the sequential decrease in Q2 and what your outlook is for distributor increases who are purchasing in the back half of the year. And do you plan on expanding your relationship with those distributors? And then secondly, on the production animal side, you've talked about the premium line of antibiotics like Draxxin. Did you say you expect the trend to reverse in the second half, where – kind of the midsize cattle being in the feed lots, and that could lead to increased sales?
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Well, thank you, Kevin, for the two questions. So first on the companion animals. So on companion animal, we expect that we'll continue generating very positive growth in the second half, and we expect that the differential between companion animal and the livestock will remain in the second half of the year. We have seen in the second quarter growth in the U.S. of companion animal, 7%, while international market was 15%. I think it was in line with our expectations. The U.S. in the second quarter in companion animal, we had some additional promotional activities that also had a temporary impact in terms of prices, but the growth in the different parts of the companion animal portfolio have been in line with our expectations. Simparica also had additional revenues in the U.S. in the first quarter. That had an impact in the second quarter. But we don't see any situation that is different than what we expected, very pleased with the performance of new products, Apoquel, Cytopoint, and Simparica. All indicators are showing our progression in terms of market share improvement in both – for dermatology and also for parasiticide segment. And in the other inline portfolio, again, so we have not seen any change in the generic assumption, so I think it's something that – it's in line with the plan that we have seen in previous quarters, maybe occurring on Rimadyl that's has been affected by the interaction of Galliprant. Galliprant is another product for treating pain, and we know that in this market, new products, they get significant attention and growth. And this growth is maintained depending on the results that are showing in the mid and long term in terms of efficacy and safety. But we are very pleased with our overperformance in companion animal, and definitely it's a significant driver of our growth in the first half, and we expect also a significant driver of our growth in the second half. In terms of the trends for the cattle in the U.S., you mentioned the Draxxin impact. I will say that maybe – well, definitely the mild winter and also the heavier animals into the feedlot had an impact in terms of the use of premium antibiotics. The other impact that we have seen was also the implementation of the Veterinarian (sic) [Veterinary] Feed Directive that has been affecting our cattle business, especially the medicated feed additives. We saw that it was affecting temporary to smaller producers in the U.S., and they will be adjusting how to use these products in the future. This adjustment is taking longer, and we have incorporated in our guidance a more permanent impact in our revenue. But, having said that, we expect more favorable conditions in the second half of the year for cattle, and we also have seen that in the second quarter premium antibiotics has been performing very well in the year. Next question?
Operator: Your next question's from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. David, can you check the mute function on your phone?
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Maybe we can try the next one?
Operator: Yes. We'll go next to Kathy Miner with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.
Kathy M. Miner - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good morning. Just a follow-up on the dermatology sector. Can you give us a little bit more color on Cytopoint, and how you characterize its use? Is it being used more every four weeks or every eight weeks? And are you seeing it used in more Apoquel-treated dogs or non-Apoquel dogs? And also just on Apoquel, can you talk about whether you're starting to see – getting any more traction in the acute and shorter-term settings as opposed to the chronic use? Thank you.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you, Kathy, and I will start with Cytopoint. And, first, I think Cytopoint has been – well, the indication of the label in the U.S., it's four to eight weeks. And we see that it's more used on the mid of this four to eight weeks than at four weeks. And we have seen also seen that Cytopoint in its infancy also having a 28% cannibalization to Apoquel. But combining both together, I think we are growing very nicely. And now I think we see the opportunity also to extend these experience to the European markets, in where we started the early experience program, and we expect a full launch in September in the European market. And in the European markets, the label, it will be different. It will be 1 milligram on four weeks, compared to 2 milligrams on four to eight weeks in the U.S. But still the products are very consistent in terms of efficacy and also in terms of safety. For Apoquel, we have seen now that Apoquel use has been extended or increased in terms of acute, but also in terms of seasonalized conditions for dogs, and this is the result of now full availability of the product in the market, and we believe also the effort that we are making in terms of direct-to-consumer advertising. Chronic use will remain the main generator of revenues because the use will be very prolonged, but the acute or the seasonalized use of the product also will add significant opportunity. Next question?
Operator: We'll go next to Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Good morning, folks. Thank you for taking the questions. Juan Ramón, just want to clarify your comments on Rimadyl. So I guess the pain franchise was lower, because of new product competition and not cheaper generics from the distributors. And then a follow-up on Brazil. Very good performance there given everything that's going on. My understanding is that the USDA has banned fresh beef imports from Brazil because of safety concerns. Obviously we know there's other concerns there as well in Brazil. So what impact could all of this have longer term on your business? And is there an opportunity for U.S. livestock to do better as a result and gain share? Thank you very much.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you, Alex. So for the question on Rimadyl, So we are not saying that generic competition is not gaining share. It's gaining share in line with previous comments. And there – well, the message I wanted to convey was that we have not seen significant changes in the trends of the generic penetration. What we saw is that product, which is Galliprant, which is a new product that has been introduced recently, it's a product developed by Aratana and commercialized by Elanco, it has been gaining share in this pain market. We have seen also in the past that new products in this market are having rapid penetration, because it's still some level of dissatisfaction in terms of safety. And products coming into the market may have some opportunity, and definitely the opportunity will be maintained if it can really deliver on the expectations in the medium and long term. But we don't think that will be something that – we are confident that Rimadyl, with so many years in the market, with a very well-established profile in terms of efficacy and also in terms of safety, will remain a key player in terms of managing pain for dogs. At the same time, so moving into the acquisition of Nexvet, it's very strategic for us to maintain our leadership in this area. We are convinced that there is still unmet needs in this market in terms of safety and efficacy. And monoclonal antibodies can really fill this gap in terms of providing an alternative to current products in the market, and we are convinced that in both in dogs and cats, monoclonal antibodies will play a significant role. In Brazil, definitely the scandals are not helping, but we have been managing quite well. Our growth in Brazil despite of this political and scandals situation and we – the investments that we made in terms of expanding our field force are having a very positive favor. We are growing sales in Brazil very rapidly in cattle, but also in some other areas. Areas like companion animal is also driving significant growth. And Brazil in general has been a market exporting in most of the cases processed beef rather than fresh beef to some of the markets, and this is not really changing. And Brazil, they had a temporary challenge when they had the scandal in terms of the meat quality with China, but this has been already managed. And I think the prospects for Brazil are very positive, and definitely Brazil will be continue competing with the U.S., although today they are competing with a different quality of meat. U.S. is much more focused on quality, while in Brazil at this point they are much more focused on process, which has – not so important in terms of quality. So very positive in terms of future growth in Brazil, and also we see some additional opportunities in terms of export in the U.S. Next question please?
Operator: And our last question will come from Brett Wong with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
Brett W. S. Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and fitting me in here. Just wanted to see if you could talk a little more on the U.S. livestock fundamentals. You already talked about the beef cattle outlook into 2018, expecting expansion. But how long are you expecting expansion in the other species like chicken? And when we see contraction in any of those markets including cattle, what is the expected impact to the business, given that the animal health products are a lot less discretionary in nature? Thanks.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you, Brett. And so we think that the fundamentals of the U.S. livestock are very strong. So, in terms of cattle, I described that in our opinion, cattle will continue being an important part of the production of quality meat in the U.S. and also export to many other markets. We expect also that the growth in terms of number of heads in cattle will moderate in 2018, but still growing, which is positive. And we also think that in both in poultry and swine, the production in the U.S. is very efficient. They are very competitive. The consumption of animal proteins worldwide will continue growing, and the U.S. will continue playing a significant role in terms of producing the meat that will be reaching their customers around the world. The poultry and the swine, they are two areas in where they can manage very well the additional volumes. And we expect that in 2018, poultry and swine also will remain positive. If we move – I was making comments in general to the market. If we move to our specific business, so we expect both poultry and swine in the U.S., showing positive growth in 2018. So we expect to bring new products. And also we have seen that even for producers that are moving to No Antibiotics Ever, we can offer to these producers a very good portfolio that will meet their demand. At the same time, also we generate also a very positive growth in our company. Next question?
Operator: It appears we have no further questions. I'll return the floor to you, Juan Ramón, for any closing comments.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you very much for joining us today. And we mentioned during the call, we are very pleased with the results. We are also very confident on the guidance for 2017. And, as I mentioned, companion animals will continue driving growth. But we see also positive growth in terms of livestock. We expect in the second half also maintaining the differential of growth that we have seen with the companion animal and livestock in the first half. With that, thank you very much for joining, and looking forward for meeting you again in the third quarter earnings call.
Operator: And this will conclude today's program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.

Operator: Welcome to the First Quarter 2017 Financial Results Conference Call and Webcast for Zoetis. Hosting the call today is Steve Frank, Vice President of Investor Relations for Zoetis. The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of Zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, and will not be forwarded automatically. In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call via dial-in, or on the Investor Relations section of Zoetis.com. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for your questions following the presentation. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.
Steve Frank - Zoetis, Inc.: Good morning, and welcome to Zoetis First Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. I'm joined today by Juan Ramón Alaix, our Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn David, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website, and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements. And that actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statements in today's press release and our SEC filings, including, but not limited to, our annual report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q. Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures which were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for U.S. GAAP, a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release, and in the company's 8-K filings dated today, May 4, 2017. We also cite operational results which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. With that, I will turn the call over to Juan Ramón.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Before I discuss our first quarter results, I want to share some of our views on the animal health industry. Our industry continues showing steady and predictable growth in the mid-single digits with about 5% to 6% growth for 2017, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. In 2017, companion animal and poultry are expected to grow faster than the industry average of 5% to 6% while cattle and swine will be growing below those rates. Companion animal growth will be driven by the increase of oral parasiticides and specialty care products in areas like dermatology, where our portfolio of Apoquel and Cytopoint is driven category growth. We should also see increased consumption of chicken driving growth in poultry. While expecting slower growth, cattle and swine will benefit from positive trends driven by additional head of cattle, higher prices of milk and an increase of global pork production, especially in China. As I have mentioned many times in the past, the relationship of the animal health industry in terms of species to particular areas and geographies is an important factor in the steady and predictable long term performance. And in this industry, Zoetis stands as the most diversified animal health company and continues delivering revenue growth above the industry average thanks to the strength of our portfolio and business model. We continue investing in our portfolio with highly productive R&D programs resulting in product launches and lifecycle innovations. In fact, we have continued to expand our canine dermatology portfolio. We've internally discovered and developed our product, Cytopoint. Last week, Cytopoint became the first monoclonal antibody approved in the European Union for veterinary use after having been previously approved in the U.S. in December and in Canada in March. Cytopoint is the first monoclonal antibody therapy approved to help reduce the clinical signs associated with atopic dermatitis, such as itching in dogs. We are very excited about the early market adoption of this product in the U.S. and the treatment choice it offers our veterinarian customers. In February, we also announced that the European Commission granted us a full license for Stronghold Plus, a topical parasiticide for cats that combines sarolaner, the active ingredient in Simparica, with selamectin, the active in our current Stronghold and REVOLUTION product lines. We continue to look at the ways to use sarolaner as a platform for other combinations and in another markets. We also continue to pursue lifecycle innovations that help ensure the availability of our revenue streams from approximately 300 Zoetis product lines. In the first quarter, we received approval for new indications, formulations and geographic expansion of key livestock brands such as Bovi-Shield and Fostera vaccine families and the Excenel RTU and Excede anti-infective. We continue to strengthen our portfolio in areas like Diagnostics with new approvals in the U.S. for our WITNESS and SERELISA lines of diagnostic test kits. You can read more about this in our press release. We also combined our internal investment in R&D with external opportunities in both our core business of medicines and vaccines and the expansion of our portfolio in complementary spaces like diagnostics, genetics and biodevices. You have heard me speak in the past about acquisitions like PHARMAQ in the fish market and SMB in the diagnostic space, and just a few weeks ago we announced another investment in our core business for treating pain in companion animals. We announced an agreement to purchase Nexvet Biopharma, which is an innovator in monoclonal antibody therapies for companion animals. This acquisition is expected to strengthen our R&D pipeline in this area and help sustain our category leadership in chronic pain for dogs while expanding the market availability in cats. Innovations like this are being supported by other investments with additional savings from our operational efficiency programs, and we have included in our guidance. For example, field force expansions in key markets like China and Brazil, direct-to-consumer marketing campaigns for Apoquel and Simparica and capital investment in our manufacturing network to ensure we have the technology, capacity and capability to support our long term revenue growth. All of these elements are working together to make sure we can capitalize on the opportunities ahead of us to continue growing revenues in line with or faster than the market and growing adjusted net income faster than spending. In the first quarter of 2017, we continued to see positive results from our diverse portfolio, innovative new companion animal products and a more efficient cost structure. Our revenue grew 6% operationally and excluding the impact of product rationalizations, which will also affect the second quarter results, our growth would have been 8% in the first quarter. We believe this growth is, again, faster than the market. The main driver of our revenue growth remained companion animal products, which grew 12% operationally, driven largely by sales of Simparica, Apoquel and Cytopoint. And our livestock portfolio grew 3% operationally with increases in swine, cattle and fish being partially offset by a decline in poultry products. Glenn will discuss that more of the market drivers and details in his remarks. We posted 10% operational growth in adjusted net income, once again faster than the revenue growth. We saw a modest 2% operational growth in operating expenses as we made investments in the promotion and support of new product launches which were partially offset by savings from our operational efficiency initiative. We continue to stay focused on ways to simplify our operations and drive efficiency, including through the ongoing implementation of our supply network strategy. In March, we announced plans to sell our manufacturing site in Guarulhos, Brazil. We expect to complete that transaction during the second half of 2017. It will be the eighth site that has been either divested or exited as part of the operational efficiency program and supply network strategy. We are pleased with the strong start to the year from a revenue and adjusted earnings perspective. And we are affirming our full-year 2017 guidance. With that, let me turn things over to Glenn, who will provide more details on our first quarter results. Glenn?
Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you, Juan Ramon. We performed well again in the first quarter based on our newest companion animal products and strength across many of our international markets; most notably, China, Brazil, Australia, and other emerging markets. Total company revenue grew 6% operationally, including a negative 2% impact from product rationalization. We saw no net impact from foreign exchange in the quarter. However, as our financial tables show, there were some meaningful changes in some individual currencies. Of that 6% growth, 5% came from companion animal growth in Simparica, Apoquel and Cytopoint. Sales of Simparica were $29 million for the quarter, and our total dermatology sales were $77 million. Additional growth drivers for the quarter were 1% from the introduction of other new products and a 2% impact from price increases. These growth drivers were partially offset by a negative 2% impact from product rationalizations. In terms of the bottom line, we delivered 10% operational growth in adjusted net income and 10% operational growth in adjusted diluted EPS. As we realize the benefits of our operational efficiency initiative, we have stayed disciplined on expenses to drive more profitable revenue, while making the appropriate investments to grow the value of our business. Juan Ramon spoke about these in terms of commercial and manufacturing investments. Now let's discuss segment revenues. Our international segment generated operational revenue growth of 9%, while the U.S. grew 4%. In the international segment, product rationalization had a negative 4% impact on growth. China had an exceptionally strong quarter, growing 47% operationally. This growth was broad based, with contributions from both swine and companion animal, with much of the growth coming from vaccines. In swine, we continue to see strong market conditions with high pork prices for customers as well as greater adoption of animal health products that can help drive more efficient and safe protein production. In companion animal in China, our field force is capitalizing on a growing pet population and increases in medicalization rates for pets. Brazil was also a strong contributor in the quarter, growing 15% operationally, with our price increases driving growth across our portfolio there. Significant growth in livestock benefited from strong market conditions for beef producers. And new companion animal products drove higher sales, with Simparic, as it's known in Brazil, getting off to a strong start from its launch in the fourth quarter. Our growth in both China and Brazil was aided by field force expansions in these markets which we have discussed before. Mexico made a significant contribution this quarter as well, with 10% operational growth. And our other emerging markets category grew 14%, despite a significant impact from our product rationalization. Shifting to developed markets, Australia grew 10%, drawing on performance in several key brands in Cattle, Sheep and Companion Animals as well as price increases and growth in Simparica and Apoquel. Italy, Spain and Japan also contributed to growth in the quarter while France declined 15%, primarily due to the comparison to a strong Q1 2016. We are expecting France to return to growth in the second quarter. To summarize, very strong growth in our International business is coming from a number of sources including strong market trends, strategic investments and our success in bringing new value-added products to market. Turning to the U.S., revenue grew 4%. Companion Animal grew 10% in the quarter while being offset by a decline of 2% in Livestock. The Livestock decline was due to our Swine business, where the timing of customer purchases had a negative impact in the quarter, and we continue to see competitive pressure on our vaccine franchise. In the U.S., we have made some changes to our Fostera PCV and M. hyo vaccines, and based on a recent large comparative trial, we believe this product should be well received by customers and make us more competitive in this space. The decline in Swine business was partially offset by growth in Poultry where we're seeing higher sales of antibiotic alternatives such as Zoamix. Our Cattle business in the U.S. was flat for the quarter as an increase in herd size is contributing to growth in our reproductive franchises. Performance was also supported by growth in ACTOGAIN and our SYNOVEX franchise which was offset by a higher mix of low-risk cattle moving to feedlots. Our medicated feed additive sales for both cattle and swine were negatively impacted in the first quarter by livestock producers' implementation of the Veterinary Feed Directive. This impacted U.S. livestock growth by about 3% as we continue to work with our customers on the implementation of VFD. Companion animal sales grew 10%, primarily due to the launches of Simparica and Cytopoint, as well as growth in Apoquel. This growth was partially offset by initial sales into expanded distributor relationships in the prior-year quarter. We are pleased so far with the performance of Simparica in the first spring buy-in season that it was fully available in the U.S. We've initiated direct-to-consumer and additional promotional campaigns, which we believe will help build upon the success we have seen so far. In U.S. dermatology, sales were $57 million for the quarter. Cytopoint has been well received in its first full quarter with a full USDA license and Apoquel is sustaining the base it built through the second half of last year. As we are gaining more experience with a full supply of our dermatology portfolio throughout a calendar year, we do believe there will be seasonality to the revenue with the second and third quarter dermatology revenues being higher than the first and fourth quarters. Overall, we continue to hear very positive feedback from our customers about Apoquel and Cytopoint. With the launch of additional promotional campaigns and DTC advertising we expect an acceleration of sales in the coming quarter. With the continued strong performance in the U.S. and the prospect for additional growth in international markets, we believe our global dermatology portfolio can grow to between $400 million and $500 million in the next three years. Now turning to the rest of the P&L. Adjusted gross margin of 64.4% declined approximately 300 basis points in the quarter on a reported basis and was sequentially flat with the fourth quarter of 2016. Coming into 2017, we have made additional cost improvements in our manufacturing network. In the first quarter of 2017, we recognized higher costs associated with previously produced inventory which depressed our gross margin. This will also will also negatively impact Q2. As we progress into the second half of the year, our results will fully reflect more of the impact of our manufacturing cost improvements. In addition, Q1 2016 contained some favorable items and Q1 2017 gross margin was negatively impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange versus last year. The first quarter results for adjusted gross margin are in line with our expectations and we have reaffirmed our adjusted cost-of-sales guidance for the year. Adjusted SG&A grew by 2% in the quarter, with higher promotional expenses to support new product launches and higher penetration of Apoquel, offsetting expense reductions from our operational efficiency initiatives. Adjusted R&D was flat for the quarter with an increase in project spending offsetting fixed expense reductions for our operational efficiency initiative. Adjusted other income included lower foreign exchange losses compared with the prior year and the positive impact of a legal victory in Norway for our PHARMAQ business. This legal win will allow us to launch a vaccine for pancreatic disease in the world's largest farmed-salmon market this year. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was approximately 28%. The tax rate in the quarter is significantly improved from the prior year due to the realization of benefits that resulted from operational changes implemented in the third quarter last year. It also reflects the effects of discrete items, including a small benefit from the vesting and exercise of employee equity awards. The year-over-year improvement in our adjusted effective tax rate was a significant driver of adjusted net income growth of 10% operationally. Of note, our one-time cash costs have come down significantly over time as we have moved beyond the efforts to stand up our company and execute on our operational efficiency initiative. Now moving to guidance for full year 2017, the year is off to a good start for us, particularly with revenue. We are reaffirming our previous guidance and expect accelerated growth in adjusted net income as we get into the second half of the year, primarily due to the cost-of-sales trends I discussed earlier. As I said in our fourth quarter call, we expect slower income growth in the first half of the year and our current expectations are consistent with that view. For the year, we continue to expect to achieve operational revenue growth of 5.5% to 7.5% and adjusted EBIT margin of 34% to 35% and operational growth in adjusted net income of 15% to 20%. Our guidance for adjusted ETR of approximately 30% is based on current U.S. tax law and does not take into account any potential changes being discussed in Washington. With more than half of our adjusted pre-tax income in the U.S., a lowering of the U.S. corporate tax rate would have a meaningful benefit to us. In the first quarter, we repurchased $125 million in shares and our guidance for reported and adjusted earnings per share reflects the share repurchase completed through Q1. Just to summarize before we go to Q&A, we're off to a good start to the year with continued momentum in the areas we expected, such as new companion animal products in markets like China and Brazil. We see a good runway for continued growth that is in line with or faster than the market based on our diverse portfolio and recently launched products. Our operational efficiency program has been fully implemented at this point and is expected to achieve more than $300 million in savings in 2017. We will continue to use some of these savings both internally and externally to support sound investments in our business and return excess capital to shareholders. And, we are reaffirming our outlook for 2017 and continue to project a stronger second-half to achieve our full-year targets. With that, I'll hand things over to the operator to open the lines for your questions. Operator?
Operator: And we can take our first question from Kevin Ellich with Craig-Hallum.
Kevin Ellich - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC: >: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Congratulations on a nice quarter. First off, could you maybe give us a little bit more detail on the strength that you're seeing in Companion Animal, specifically the strong growth in China, Brazil. And also, Glenn, you actually gave us some great detail on the dermatology sales. Could you break out what type of growth, year-over-year growth, did you see in Apoquel versus new sales of Cytopoint?
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you again for the questions. So, let me take first this trend in Companion Animal in China and Brazil. We have seen that the adoptions and also the medicalization rates in both these countries are growing. We identified this opportunity and we invested to capitalize on that, so we expanded our field force in China and Companion Animal and Brazil and the results are showing a very strong revenue growth. We also benefit in China with introduction of the new vaccines and also in Brazil now we have also almost all our portfolio approved and products like Simparica has been extremely well accepted by the market and they're generating very positive growth. Glenn?
Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.: Kevin, in terms of your question related to Apoquel and Cytopoint growth, so year over year, the Dermatology portfolio grew 47%. When you look at – actually the segment grew – Apoquel grew 47%, the segment grew 66%, so really Cytopoint, this was really the first quarter of full availability with full USDA license. So, it's almost 100% growth in terms of Cytopoint. So just to break that down again, the derm portfolio is 66% growth for the quarter, Apoquel 47% growth for the quarter.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Next question, please.
Operator: And we can take our next question from Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Esther Rajavelu - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, this is Esther Rajavelu for Gregg Gilbert. In Livestock, do you anticipate any changes in the vaccines portfolio offsetting negative impact from the feed additives going forward for the rest of the year?
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Well, this has partly been affecting in terms of vaccines mostly in swine and we have been working with our PCV2 and M. hyo vaccine. We have been developing additional trials and the trials are showing very positive results in terms of efficacy and we are convinced that now we have a product which is very competitive and this product will gain momentum in the U.S. market. We also introduce now in the international market the PCV2 and M. hyo vaccine and also this vaccine also will generate positive growth in the international markets.
Esther Rajavelu - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Next question, please.
Operator: We take our next question from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for it. Two quick questions. Was there any stocking or any outsized orders particularly OUS? And then also just on some of the dynamics in the livestock market, the data's been showing that herd size is increasing and clearly your data is reflecting that. Is there any signs at all that there could be potentially some oversupply and that they're thinking about doing some cattle herd culls? Thanks.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Well, let me take the question on livestock and cattle. So, we see the cattle business also showing that very positive trend, we still see that the herds are growing in countries like U.S. and also in Australia. Prices are also showing a positive trend. Most recently, on the news said that the cattle futures are 18-month high, which is also a positive. Also in the U.S., their feedlots and stockers are back to profitability. So, all this is indicating that the cattle business are showing a positive sign. For the year, we expect that for Zoetis, that the cattle will be growing mid-single digits which is positive and also the positive element that we have seen that the consumption of beef is also growing. Even in some parts of because of China consumption but these also accelerating exports. This is also helping producers to capitalize on investment that they been making in the last year. So, we see that I think the cattle business, it will be showing a positive trend, in general, for the market and also positive for Zoetis. We understand that in the first quarter we had some challenge, especially in the U.S. The challenge came from mild winter. It also generated a low risk profile for animals and then this affected our premium antibiotics. The other impact that we had in the first quarter in cattle was related to the implementation of the Veterinary Feed Directive; that created some challenge. In the cattle, especially in the small customers, they were not having a veterinarian associated with these operations. We expect also that this will be corrected in the coming months. But again, positive outlook for cattle, both in the U.S. and international. And now then, Glenn, you will answer the comment on stocking in the quarter.
Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.: Yes. In terms of the question on stocking in the quarter, there was no material stocking in the quarter. Perhaps in some markets, particularly Vietnam, there was some elevated sales in the quarter that will stall it. It's probably expect to reverse to some degree in Q2. The only other thing I would point out, particularly in the U.S. with Simparica, we had very strong sales of Simparica in the quarter. I wouldn't call that a stocking issues. It's more just the season for parasiticides in the U.S. and how the veterinarians typically make their purchases.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Next question, please.
Operator: We can take our next question from Jon Block with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you, and good morning. Two questions. I'll ask them both up front. Juan Ramon, maybe for you. Just some high-level commentary on the altered structure, if you would, with the distributors on the Companion Animal side where I think the contracts are more volume based, if you would, rather than exclusivity. How has that performance been? Has it been in line with your expectations? And then, Glenn, just maybe on the gross margin cadence, I know you guys don't want to guide for the quarter, but how do we ramp the 67%-plus for the year? Can we expect a modest improvement in 2Q and then much more pronounced in 2H? Thanks, guys.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you, Jon. Let me answer the question on what was shown on that. Maybe a little bit background on these questions. So, we launched many products, many new products, in Companion Animal and then with these launches we decided to review the collaboration with the distributors in the U.S. and then as a result of this review in 2016, we decided, in agreement with the distributors, also to include in their promotional portfolio our vaccine for companion animals. The results of this collaboration was very positive for them and also for Zoetis. Then in 2017 we decided to expand this collaboration not only to vaccines plus some other products that they were responsible before, also to our parasiticide portfolio, REVOLUTION, ProHeart 6, and Simparica. All indicators are very positive, and now thanks to our direct presence together with the support of distributors, we have been increasing significantly our sales force in markets that we know that are highly competitive, and this additional volume that has been generating through all these regional portfolio has been also supporting the rest of the portfolio. Those that are affected by generic competition that, thanks to these newer studies, we are still performing in line with expectations, and we have not seen significant change on the trend of general impact in 2017. So overall, very pleased with the new way that we are collaborating with distributors. And one of the impact that also we have seen that's very positive has been the evolution of Simparica, that now we have our sales force, and the sales force of distributors supporting Simparica.
Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.: And in terms of gross margin trending throughout the year. So, in Q2 we will still have somewhat of a negative drag on margin from the impact of the costs of previously produced inventory, but the impact will definitely be smaller than it was in Q1. Then as we get into Q3 and Q4, margin improves significantly as it really fully recognized the benefits of the improved costs that we were able to deliver as far as the operational efficiency initiative. So that should give you some understanding of the trending throughout the year.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Next question.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeffrey Holford with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Jeffrey Holford - Jefferies LLC: Hi. Thanks very much for taking my questions. So, it looks like you had a pretty strong Q1 in international. Is there anything out there through the rest of the year, just issues you may be concerned about that stops you at least raising the bottom end of your revenue guidance for the full year 2017? And then just secondly, on Nexvet, wonder if you might just give us a little bit more color on any timing and the size of opportunities within their pipeline that you might want to just highlight for us to give us some expectation of when that might start to contribute? Thank you.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Let me start with the question on Nexvet, and then Glenn will provide the comments on the guidance and most of the performance being international. So on Nexvet, we just announced the acquisition, but it is an acquisition of a company which is based in Ireland, and we need to follow their regulations and the requirements of the Irish authorities. So at this point, I think we have a lot of limitations, and let's wait until this transaction is concluded, and then I will provide all details of what we expect from Nexvet; and also timing of new product introductions.
Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.: And in terms of revenue and guidance for the year. So when you look at the performance for Q1, on a global basis we delivered 6% revenue growth for the quarter. That's very much in line with our full-year guidance of 5.5% to 7.5%. So the performance in the quarter was in line with what we expect the year, which is why we believe the guidance that we have is appropriate from a revenue perspective. International performance was positive in the quarter at 9% revenue growth, but again, definitely in line with our expectations and what we would expect throughout the year.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Next question, please.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse: Great. Thanks. A follow up to John's question on the gross margin. You had a particularly strong quarter in companion animals, typically a higher margin business for you. Your gross margin was essentially in line with your quarterly guidance that you gave on the last call. What can you speak to as far as the moving parts in the gross margin, and particularly just following the strength in that higher margin business for you? And then I understand you can't speak to Nexvet, but how should we think about the traction you are seeing with Cytopoint and the vision on the prospects for monoclonal antibodies in general, given now you've doubled down in the space with the recent acquisition of Nexvet? Thanks.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: So again, let me start with the comment on monoclonal antibodies and Cytopoint. That's actually what we see with the addition of Nexvet, without getting into details of products or timing of launches. So definitely the innovation that we have seen at Nexvet in terms of monoclonal antibodies combined with the expertise that we have developed with Cytopoint and the manufacturing capability that we also developed at the time of Cytopoint – this will be a significant opportunity in combining Nexvet capabilities with our capabilities. On top of that, we have based on that present knowledge on how to commercialize monoclonal antibodies, and we see a significant opportunity of bringing to the market new options in terms of pain. Still pain is a main need (38:22) in the Companion Animal market, and definitely we see another opportunity of expanding the market with introduction of monoclonal antibodies for cats. So we see that it has significant strategic rationale on this acquisition, and we see also that this will generate significant value to Zoetis over time.
Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.: And, Erin, in terms of gross margins, so as you mentioned it is in line with our expectations for the quarter. And in terms of mix, there was some up and downs. As you mentioned, Companion Animal performed very well, typically some of our higher margin products. Also though, we had a decline in performance in some of our premium antibiotics, which are also very high margins. And International also had higher growth, and International in general has lower margins than the U.S. So, overall the mix ended up being neutral to our expectations and still kept us in line with where we thought we'd be for the quarter.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Next question?
Operator: Our next question comes from John Kreger with William Blair. Please go ahead.
John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks. Just wanted to follow up on your comments about Stronghold Plus. When do you expect that product or something like it to be approved and launched in the U.S. in cats? And how about for dogs, either in the U.S. or Europe? Thanks.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Well, this combination is a topical combination, and technically it will be focused on cats. But we also discussed that we'll be using sarolaner as a platform to develop other combinations. These other combinations will be oral, and they will be focused on dogs. Your question about when do we expect to launch on the U.S., this is not yet defined. We are working with the U.S. regulators on answering and developing all the details for a demonstration, but at this point we have not provided any timing of the approval. As we progress on the discussion with the U.S., then we'll provide the details on the timing.
John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks. And then a follow up on PHARMAQ. Given your legal victory, can you just talk about where you think that business can go over the next couple of years? And maybe just even reset the longer-term strategy there? Is that a business that can start to be a more material contributor over the next few years? Thanks.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Well, thank you, John, for the question. We are convinced it's an area of growing opportunity, and we know that already the farmed fish is exceeding the consumption of wild fish. Still, there is a lot of use of antibodies in these segments. We expect that these antibodies will be replaced by vaccines. PHARMAQ is a leader in terms of developing vaccines. We are very pleased with the interaction of a new vaccine in Chile for SRS, which is also helping the reduction of antibiotic use in this country. But then the next opportunity should be China, Vietnam and other countries. Already they are number one in terms of farmed fish production. And again, we are working on developing vaccines that will be targeting these countries. There was also the legal litigation in Norway. It's opening to us the opportunity of launching a new vaccine for pancreatic disease which is very important in Norway and it's also helping us really to support the rest of the portfolio in Norway. We communicated that in 2017 that we expect to generate $125 million and that will be a significant, growth. In the first quarter, also, we show very positive growth for PHARMAQ and we are expecting for the year to generate more than 30% growth in terms of PHARMAQ. So, the prospects are very positive and we'll continue investing not only in salmon in where we have most of our revenues to date, but also in tilapia and other fishes that will be important in the future. Next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks very much. Well first, I wanted to congratulate you as well on the results. I just wanted to ask about the outlook on a couple of items. First of all, I think that you had mentioned 12% operational Companion Animal growth in the first quarter. Just wondering if we should expect that to accelerate or decelerate in coming quarters. Second, with respect to other expenses and the tax rate, which surprised me this quarter, the other expense item was $35 million in the first quarter. Wanted to get your guidance for how we should think about it in the second quarter and for the full-year. And then the same thing on the tax rate. The tax rate was 27.8%. Wanted to understand what you would suggest for the second quarter sequentially. And then finally, it sounds like the 2% price increase that you've seen historically and you saw this quarter is sustainable. Just wanted to confirm that, in coming quarters and for the foreseeable future, you continue to expect the 2% benefit from price for your business. Thanks so much.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you, Dave, and I will provide the comment on the outlook for Companion Animal and then Glenn will go to the details of tax and some of the questions that you asked including price. So on the outlook, so we have at least a 12% in Companion Animals. So we expect for the year that Companion Animal will continue growing at double digits and we think that this 12% it's probably a trend that we will see for the rest of the year. We should also have the benefit of the growth of Apoquel mainly coming from also the full introduction of international markets where now they are, some of the markets, they are now at launching pace. We also expect that Apoquel in the U.S. will continue growing. But now more than Apoquel, I think it's important to discuss about the Dermatology portfolio, including Apoquel and Cytopoint, but if we talk about Apoquel in the U.S., for instance, we are very pleased with the level of penetration in clinic. It's about 94% which is very good, but we only have 47% market share in terms of patients. So we still see opportunity for continue growing and taking share from steroids that still account for 30% of patients. Cytopoint, it's definitely has been very well accepted by the market, but still a very low market share in terms of patients, only 5%, but growing also very fast in terms of penetration. So, both products will drive growth and very important also Simparica in where we have seen very positive international growth. Now we have the benefit of this year of enjoying the full season so we have the product and we have seen that this product is performing that is positive for (47:07) performing extremely well. And one of the things that we've seen that is also helping that is the cooperation with distribution and we expect also that in the next coming months we'll see the impact, also, of our DTC campaign. So in summary, we expect that this 12% growth in companion animal will be maintained for a full year.
Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.: Hey David, this is Glenn. Just to your other questions in terms of how the quarter relates to the full year. I'm not necessarily going to break down quarter by quarter, but just how Q1 relates to the full year. So, the 2% price increase that we saw for the quarter we do expect to be maintained throughout the year, and in general we expect to generate 2% to 3% price increase, so nothing has changed from that perspective. In terms of the tax rate, the guidance on the adjusted ETR for the year is 30%. We came in at about 28% in Q1, really driven by A, some discrete favorable items, and also the recognition of some of the benefits related to employee stock options and restricted documents, and the tax effect of those in the quarter. So those had a favorable impact in the quarter versus what the trending will be for the full year. And then related to other expense. So, our other income in the doc (48:25) line was favorable in the quarter really driven by two key things. A, we had lower hedging costs than we've had in the past and also we had the PHARMAQ settlement for the PD vaccine that Juan Ramon spoke about just before.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Next question, please.
Operator: We can take our next question from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay good morning, folks, and thank you for taking the questions and congratulations on a good quarter. A couple of clarifying questions for Juan Ramon first. First confirming that you do expect U.S. livestock to return to growth in the second half, just want to make sure we're clear on that. And I didn't catch the Apoquel market share you stated. And a couple for Glenn if I may. As cash conversion improved this year, are you considering a more aggressive dividend policy to better reflect the sustainability of your business? And what are your thoughts on tax reform and how could it possibly impact Zoetis as you evaluate the various policies that are being discussed? Thank you very much.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you, Alex, and the answer to the U.S. livestock. I think we expect growth in the U.S. for our livestock, but mainly it will be important to provide some details on the different species in livestock, starting with swine. We expect mid to low single digits, and we expect that the PCV2 vaccine will help also to gain momentum in terms of revenues. We also think that the swine business in the U.S. is also having the benefit of high exports. The exports are growing 18% in the U.S. and this is also helping the producers to generate profitable results, and we are now, in our opinion, having the portfolio that will be creating that growth in the rest of the year. In the case of poultry, poultry we expect that the market will be showing very little growth. But on the contrary, Zoetis will be generating positive growth and growing faster than the market in poultry in the U.S. And finally, in cattle. In cattle, we faced down that challenge in the first quarter. The challenge of a milder winter, low risk profile, that also had an impact in our premium anti-infective. Also, as I mentioned the implementation of the Veterinary Feed Directive, that also had impact on our medicated feed additives. We expect that all these challenging implementation that affected the small producers will be managed in the future, and this will help also to have the fuller use of our products in the coming months. In the cases that are positive for cattle that make us positive about this segment, prices are increasing, and as I mentioned, the future prices are hitting highest in the stock. Also, the placement of the feed lot increased by 6%. And very positive, also, the animals are now moved with medium size compared to heavy size in the future, which is also increasing the risk profile of these animals. And again, another indicator which is a positive in cattle is that as feedlots and stockers are back to profit. So all in all, we think that the cattle market are having positive prospects. And we have the portfolio in our company also to generate positive growth in the rest of the year.
Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.: So, Alex, in terms of the cash conversion as you indicate, as we get outside of the costs of the operational efficiency initiative and a lot of the stand-up costs, our cash conversion is improving significantly. In terms of how we'll prioritize those – that additional availability; A), we'll continue to look internally for areas of high growth and investment. We'll also aggressively look at business development as well as an area. In terms of dividends, we'll continue to grow our dividend pretty much at or faster than the growth in adjusted net income. And really where we'll exhibit flexibility in terms of returning capital to shareholders will be with share repurchase. We recently announced the $1.5 billion share repurchase program. We indicated that that was flexible in nature. Just for context, in Q1, we repurchased $125 million in share. And as we go throughout the year, we'll continue to evaluate the magnitude and pace of share repurchase.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Next question, please?
Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.: And also just in terms of – in terms of tax reform. As we've said, we do have more than half of our pre-tax income in the U.S., so a change in the U.S. rate would definitely be favorable to us. Really, the magnitude of that favorability will really depend on the totality of the legislation. And we'll understand that more as that becomes more clear.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Next question?
Operator: Our next question comes from Brett Wong with Piper Jaffray.
Brett W. S. Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Yes. We're seeing some pressure in the dairy industry in the U.S. due to tariffs being put in place in Canada putting stress on trade. So granted, prices are still up year over year, but are you seeing any weakness in that market or expect to see softness in demand for your products in that sector?
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Yes. I lost the beginning of your question, so you were talking about dairy has moved in the U.S. And what else?
Brett W. S. Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Yes. Sorry about that. I was just wondering if you can comment around the U.S. dairy market, and we've been seeing some pressures there due to trade impact and so – or potential trade impact. And so just wondering if you are seeing any weakness yet or if you expect to see any softness there. And I know that prices are still elevated year-over-year, which is positive, but what you're seeing, if there's any weakness so far.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Well, the dairy producers, maybe they are now generating lower profit than in the past, but they're still generating a profit. So, we have not seen any significant change in terms of number of animals, which is defining the animal sales revenues. So, I think it is something that is stable. And in other markets, we have seen that they are recovering very well and countries like New Zealand are now back to much more profitable situation compared to the past. So overall, the dairy business for us, it's positive. But it also – we have some challenge in Western Europe in the importations to Russia has also been limiting the opportunity for revenues for some European dairy producers. But overall, our dairy business, it's showing positive growth for the year. Next question, please?
Operator: Our next question comes from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Divya Harikesh - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. This is Divya Harikesh on behalf of Jami Rubin. You described growth for the dermatology portfolio of $400 million to $500 million over the next three years. Can you help explain how much of that's coming from Apoquel versus Simparica and Cytopoint and just comment on your long-term expectations for these products? With Apoquel, have you already reached a stage where a lot of the growth coming forward is going to be from Simparica and Cytopoint that are in earlier stages of ramp. So, it would be great to better understand that.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you for the question. But maybe it's important now that when we discuss about Apoquel and Cytopoint, we discuss combining this portfolio. Both our products are targeting the same type of medical conditions. It's true that Apoquel, they have more indications than Cytopoint, but it's still – it's something that the market is understanding fully, how to use these products, considering the dogs, considering pet owners' preference and also the decision of veterinarians. So, I think it's important that we are not trying now to identify how much will be coming from Apoquel, how much with Cytopoint. Definitely something that we'll be providing this information on actual, but I think the important thing is that we expect to generate $400 million to $500 million revenues in three years' time which is, in my opinion, an increase compared to previous estimations and is related to the reaction of the market. We still see significant opportunities for growing in international. In international, we have many countries where we still have on launching pace. But in the U.S., we see great opportunities, as I mentioned, if we take Apoquel and Cytopoint combined, the number of – the market share in terms of patients is about 50%, 52%. So still we have a lot of opportunities for continuing growing that in this area. We expect also that the growth also will come from increasing awareness of pet owners through our digital campaign in the U.S. So, we expect that they are still significant growing opportunities for our Dermatology portfolio in both international and the U.S. Next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Thanks very much for questions. Just two here. First on the gross margin improvement as we think about the next few years. I think you've highlighted a 200-basis-point improvement by 2020 as you optimize infrastructure. Can we just get a little bit more color on how to think about that? Is that going to be a gradual improvement as we think about 2018, 2019, 2020? Or more of a step-function improvement as you do all that work and then we get more in 2020, it has a big step up? My second question was coming back to capital deployment and just like a little bit more about your longer-term leverage targets and where you'd like to see the company over time. I'm just trying to get my hands around a little bit more how much capital you're going to have to work with as you consider the various options for cash deployment going forward. Thanks so much.
Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.: So, Chris, so in terms of the 200-basis-point improvement that we expect in gross margin through 2020, we do expect it to be gradual. It's not going to be necessarily one-step change. There are activities that need to occur over those three years to generate that 200-basis-point improvement, primarily in terms of moving products from one location to another for manufacturing. So that will be a gradual improvement. In terms of capital deployment and our debt ratios, we're still targeting a gross debt ratio of 2.5 to 3 and we believe that is appropriate for our company and that will be what we'll be targeting for the next number of years.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kathy Miner with Cowen & Co. Please go ahead.
Kathy M. Miner - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good morning. Just two questions. First, and I'm not sure if I heard this before, but last quarter you had talked about having $50 million in sales still to work through the P&L from the streamlining. Could you tell us how much of that impacted Q1? And will the remainder be in the second quarter? And the second question is on antibodies in companion animals. Given your interest with both the IL 31 and your pending acquisition of Nexvet, have you also looked at antibodies in the oncology area, specifically anti-PD1s for use in cats and dogs? Thank you.
Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.: In terms of the $50 million in sales that was a challenge to growth for 2017. That was really related to the product rationalizations and the fact that we still had $50 million of sales in those earlier in 2016. So really 1% impact in terms of growth for the year is what we're anticipating for 2017. We expected to see the majority of that impact in the first half of the year, so about 2% impact from the product rationalizations in the first half of the year, which is what we saw in the first quarter. We expect a similar impact in the second quarter and then minimal to no impact in the second half of the year.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: And the question on monoclonal antibodies. Definitely now with the expertise that we have, that we gained thanks to Cytopoint, IL-31, and also the addition of Nexvet. We see opportunities of using the monoclonal antibody as another platform to develop other products in other indications. And oncology is one of the targets, but we are also discussing other areas that monoclonal antibodies be also responding to medical conditions or opportunities for some efficiencies in livestock. Other question, please?
Operator: It appears we have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the program back over to Juan Ramon for any final or closing remarks.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you very much for joining us today. And we'll be pleased to have following – follow-up comments with our Investor Relations group that will also be pleased to interact with you. Thank you.
Operator: And this does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect, and have great day.

It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.
Steve Frank - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you, operator. Good morning and welcome to the Zoetis fourth quarter and full year 2016 earnings call. I am joined today by Juan Ramón Alaix, our Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn David, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements, and that actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statements in today's press release and our SEC filings, including but not limited to, our Annual Report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q. Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and in the company's 8-K filing dated today, February 16, 2017. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. With that, I will turn the call over to Juan Ramón.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased to say that in 2016, we delivered our fourth consecutive year of operational revenue growth and improved profitability since becoming a public company. We completed a significant initiative to shape our business for greater efficiency and cash generation. And we continue to make investments that will sustain our future growth, innovation and market leadership. Our growth in 2016 was driven by the successful launch of several new products. The strength of our diverse portfolio and a deeper commitment to the direct customer relationships, productive R&D and high quality manufacturing that are the foundation of our business model. Let me highlight some of the headlines for 2016. We delivered on our financial goal for the year despite some challenging market conditions for livestock producers, especially in the U.S. We generated 5% operational growth in revenue for the full year, and 8% growth based on a normalized organic operational view that Glenn will discuss in his remarks. As expected, our companion animal portfolio led the way with 13% operational growth, thanks to Apoquel and other new product launches. Our livestock portfolio grew 1% operationally, overcoming the negative revenue impact of our producer rationalization initiative, and business changes in Venezuela and India. We posted 17% operational growth in adjusted net income and improved our adjusted EBIT margin to 32%. These measures demonstrate the positive impact of our operational efficiency changes and the benefits of new product launches like Apoquel. We were able to deliver these strong results on innovation while implementing important changes to our business last year. For example, we completed the implementation of our ERP system, which has really given us more efficient tools and better visibility across our operations. We eliminated approximately 5,000 low revenue, low margin SKUs from our product portfolio. And we have sold or exited six manufacturing sites. During 2016, we strengthened our industry leadership with more than 200 product approvals including Cytopoint in the U.S., the first monoclonal antibody approved to help dogs suffering from atopic dermatitis; Simparica, our new oral parasiticide and several new wonder vaccines. We continue to look at this productive R&D engine as critical to our future and we spend more on R&D than any of our peers. We also continue to see the value of investing in external business development opportunities. Last year, we acquired Scandinavian Micro Biodevices in the diagnostic space for approximately $80 million. And our prior acquisition of PHARMAQ contributed $90 million in revenue in 2016, while achieving rapid adoption of its ALPHA JECT LiVac SRS vaccine for salmon. Fish farmers in Chile have responded very favorably to the interaction of this vaccine. Finally, we returned $488 million in excess capital to shareholders through dividend and share repurchases. And we announced plan for a multi-year $1.5 billion share repurchase plan, beginning in 2017. All of these investments are consistent with capital allocation priorities we have shared with you in the past. All of the work that we have done in 2016 and in previous years such as building our infrastructure, investing in new systems and becoming more efficient has positioned us for success in 2017 and beyond. In 2017, we will target operational revenue growth of 5.5% to 7.5% and continue improving our adjusted EBIT margin as we realize the full benefit of our operational efficiency initiative this year. All the major actions of the operational efficiency program that we announced in 2015, has been implemented and we expect to exceed the initial target of $300 million in savings in 2017. These additional savings will be used to support our short- and long-term growth in several ways. In 2017, we plan to initiate direct-to-consumer marketing and advertising campaigns in the U.S. for two of our companion animal products. In the case of Apoquel, we want to increase awareness of atopic dermatitis among pet owners, especially those whose dogs maybe suffering from acute conditions. And in the case of Simparica, we want to illustrate the advantages of our products and increase our share of voice in the highly competitive parasiticide market. These campaigns will include national television ads and digital promotions online. They are targeted to begin in the first half of this year. We'll also support new product launches like Cytopoint, which was approved in the U.S. last year and Stronghold Plus, which is expected to be launched this year in the European Union. Stronghold Plus is a topical parasiticide for cats that combines sarolaner, the active ingredient of Simparica with selamectin, the active ingredient in our current Stronghold and Revolution product lines. This is our first combination product for sarolaner. This is a great example of how we use an R&D focus on lifecycle innovation to expand our platform and maintain a durable and valuable product line for decades. We also will remain focused on improving the way we interact with and support our customers. Our people and technology are important parts of any customer experience and they remain critical areas of investment. For example, we'll be deploying new tools and capabilities on our ERP system and we have been expanding our field force in markets like Brazil and China where we see significant and sustainable growth opportunities. We also see R&D, manufacturing and business development as areas where we will allocate increased capital this year to support our long-term growth plans. Our internal R&D products will help discover new products as well as develop lifecycle innovation across our approximately 300 product lines. Our business development team will continue exploring acquisitions, partnerships and alliances that enable us to fill gaps in our portfolio, and expand that further in complementary spaces and geographies. And we will continue executing our long-term supply network strategy to improve the quality and reliability of key growth platforms in manufacturing. We have become the profitable business and market leader we always envisioned when we launched in 2013, and the outlook for Zoetis in 2017 is very positive. We expect to see stronger growth from our companion animal portfolio again this year, driven by our dermatology portfolio, Apoquel and Cytopoint, further penetration of Simparica, and ongoing uptake of our new vaccines. And in our livestock portfolio, we expect a recovery and improved growth across our cattle, swine, and poultry species. In the case of fish, we expect that PHARMAQ to capitalize on the success of the new ALPHA JECT LiVac SRS vaccine in Chile. And we recently received a favorable legal ruling in Norway, the world's largest farm salmon market, which will allow us to launch our vaccine for salmon pancreatic disease this year, a great result and opportunity that demonstrates the value we saw for this acquisition. In closing, we are proud of our ability to deliver better than expected results in 2016, despite the market challenges we faced and the business changes we implemented. I want to thank all our Zoetis colleagues for their commitment and personal contribution to these results. As we look ahead in 2017, we see a brighter future. We have reshaped our business for long-term profitable growth based on our diverse portfolio, customer focus, innovative R&D, high-quality manufacturing, and improved capital efficiency. I thank you, our shareholders, for your confidence in Zoetis, and look forward to reporting to you on our progress. With that, let me turn things over to Glenn. Glenn?
Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you, Juan Ramón. Before discussing the fourth quarter and 2017 guidance, let me offer a quick perspective on the full year. We delivered revenue and adjusted EPS at the high end of our guidance ranges. Our new companion animal products, increased efficiency, and margin improvements all helped drive that performance throughout the year. Operational revenue growth for the year was 5%, but a better indicator of our underlying performance is what we refer to as our normalized organic operational growth, that was 8% for the year. It excludes the negative impact of our operational efficiency initiative and the positive impact of M&A. You can find the details of these items in the tables on our website. Of this 8% growth, 5 percentage points came from new products, including Apoquel, 3 percentage points came from the in-line portfolio, with 2 points of that from price and 1 point from volume. This will be the last quarter that we will report our normalized revenue growth metric, as our operational efficiency initiative will have only a small impact on our revenue in 2017. There will be some continued drag in our revenue growth from product rationalization, especially in the first two quarters of the year, and we will help you understand the magnitude of those items as we go through 2017. As we said in the past, we take a long-term view of our business, and prefer to assess our financial performance on an annual basis, rather than taking a quarterly focus. During the year, we saw many of the familiar seasonal fluctuations that occur in our industry. But as we progressed through the year, our expectations for outperformance steadily increased. Our team delivered on those higher expectations, with 17% operational growth in adjusted net income compared to the 6% to 12% we expected at the beginning of the year. This success demonstrates the strength of our diverse portfolio and business model, and it builds on many years of strong performance. We are especially pleased to have achieved these results during a period of significant change in how we operate our company. Turning to the quarter, we delivered double-digit operational growth in adjusted net income, overcoming the negative impact to revenue of fewer calendar days and business changes related to our operational efficiency initiative. Both reported and operational revenue growth were flat for the quarter. We saw no impact from foreign exchange to revenue, unlike many of our prior quarters. Our operational efficiency initiative reduced revenue by 3%, and fewer calendar days in the quarter had approximately a 4% impact. M&A activity, primarily PHARMAQ, contributed 2% to our revenue growth. PHARMAQ was below our revenue projections for the year, but we feel very good about the value we're getting from this acquisition. Our positive views are supported by the strong performance of our SRS vaccine in Chile and a recent legal win in Norway that opens the door to an important category in the aquaculture market. These two PHARMAQ drivers represent a meaningful portion of the value we saw in this company. While market conditions in Chile were challenging in 2016, the long-term structural drivers of growth that attracted us to the aquaculture market remain intact. Going back to our overall results, our normalized organic operational revenue growth was 5% in the fourth quarter. Again, this backs out the negative effects of our operational efficiency initiative, fewer calendar days in the quarter, and the benefit from M&A. This growth was balanced between our geographic segments on a normalized basis, with international growing 6% and the U.S. growing at 5%. In both segments, the main growth driver was new companion animal products. We continue to see strong growth of Apoquel and our vaccine franchises, and we're steadily establishing Simparica in the U.S. and other markets. In the U.S., we continued to absorb the decline in surgical fluid products. This was partially offset, however, by additional sales in the quarter as we expanded distributor relationships on other products. The U.S. companion animal grew 7% on a normalized basis. U.S. livestock grew 3% on a normalized basis, with growth in cattle and poultry offset by declines in swine. Market conditions in cattle continue to be difficult, and results were somewhat lighter than expected in the fourth quarter. However, our U.S. cattle business delivered low-to-mid single-digit growth on the same normalized basis for the quarter and year, despite very challenging market conditions for our beef and dairy customers. Again, this demonstrates the resiliency of the animal health industry and Zoetis even in challenging market conditions. International companion animal normalized growth of 16% was supported by new product contributions as well as higher levels of medicalization in emerging markets, a fundamental long-term structural driver of our business. 2% normalized growth for international livestock was supported by growth in China, Mexico and Brazil; offset by lower usage of antibiotics in Western Europe. You can see the full results of our top 11 markets in the table, but let me highlight a few items. Growth in key emerging markets, like Brazil and China, continues to be strong. Operational revenue growth in Brazil of 8% was driven by price, new companion animal products, and favorable cattle conditions. High demand for beef exports from Brazil more than offset the difficult market conditions in poultry and swine where producers saw higher input prices. Operational growth in China of 17% was driven by continued strength in the swine market and growth in companion animal vaccine due to increases in routine care. For the year, China grew 24% operationally, our fourth consecutive year of double-digit growth since becoming public. Our recent field force expansions in Brazil and China have been productive, and we'll continue to deploy selling resources in these and other markets where we see significant and sustainable growth drivers combined with high returns on our investments. Emerging market growth was not limited to Brazil and China. Our other emerging markets category grew 6% operationally. Now turning to the rest of the P&L, I'll quickly cover a few items of note in the quarter and then move to a review of guidance. Adjusted gross margin increased 110 basis points in the quarter on a reported basis, primarily due to favorable foreign exchange, which was partially offset by higher inventory charges. Adjusted other income included a $15 million charge for the devaluation of the Egyptian pound that occurred in November, after our most recent guidance update. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 25%. This rate included the effects of discrete items and the jurisdictional mix of earnings. This brought our full year adjusted tax rate to 30%, which was two points below our guidance for the year. Adjusted net income grew 13% operationally, despite the fewer selling days in the quarter. GAAP net income grew significantly on a reported basis in the quarter. This was due to the charge in the year-ago quarter related to the currency devaluation in Venezuela, as well as lower stand up and operational efficiency costs. Versus our full year guidance, our one-time costs were above the range as we settled the product dispute with poultry customers in Mexico and had higher than expected severance cost associated with our efficiency initiative. In the quarter, we also incurred a net tax charge as a result of the implementation of certain operational changes, including the revaluation of tax assets associated with the change in our operating model. All-in-all, Q4 was a good quarter wrapping up a great year. We delivered a normalized organic operational growth of 8%, adjusted gross margin improvement of almost 200 basis points, 23% operational growth in adjusted EBIT and 17% operational growth in adjusted net income. Now, let's talk about guidance for full year 2017. We are updating our previous guidance for changes in foreign exchange rates, since our last update in November. Our guidance now reflects rates as of late January, which reduced revenue guidance by approximately $50 million and adjusted EPS by $0.03. On an operational basis, our guidance is unchanged. We have however updated our growth rates to reflect the higher base of revenue, and income achieved in 2016. For the year, we expect to achieve operational revenue growth of 5.5% to 7.5%, and adjusted EBIT margin of 34% and 35%, and operational growth in adjusted net income of 15% to 20%. We continue to see companion animal driving much of our growth in 2017. We will have additional penetration of Apoquel including its expansion into more acute and seasonal cases. We will continue the launch of Cytopoint in the U.S. as we build our dermatology portfolio, and we will see additional market penetration of Simparica, as well as the launch of Stronghold Plus in Europe. All of the necessary actions to deliver our 2017 efficiency goals were largely completed by the end of 2016. We expect to deliver more than the $300 million in savings we initially targeted, some of which we will be investing back in the business. Despite the lower tax rate in the fourth quarter, our guidance for adjusted ETR is unchanged. We do not expect the favorable discrete items from Q4 to recur. Our guidance for adjusted ETR is based on current U.S. tax law, and does not take into account any potential changes being discussed in Washington. With more than half of our adjusted pre-tax income in the U.S., a lowering of the U.S. corporate tax rate would have a meaningful benefit to us. There are also other items that can impact our taxes going forward, such as border adjustability and the impact of deemed repatriation. We will be in a position to articulate the potential effect of these items as we gain more clarity. While we don't guide to quarters, I do want to reiterate my comments from last quarter that we expect to see our revenue and income growth weighted more significantly towards the second half of the year. As a reminder, in 2017, we will face approximately $50 million drag on revenue growth from the product rationalization. This will disproportionally affect the first quarter. We are expecting first quarter gross margin to be generally in line with the fourth quarter of 2016 due to the timing of recognition of cost of goods sold. We are also re-investing a portion of our additional cost savings, in investments in product launches and key brands like Apoquel, Cytopoint and Simparica early in the year. We expect to begin seeing the revenue effect of these investments in the second half of the year. The result is that we currently see limited adjusted income growth in the first half with significantly stronger growth later in the year. A final point on capital allocation. We have completed our initial share repurchase program and in December, we announced the $1.5 billion authorization. We view this repurchase plan as multi-year and flexible in nature depending on other capital allocation priorities. We have increased the pace of our repurchase from last year to $125 million per quarter. This pace is related to the improved cash flow we expect in 2017 now that we are beyond the cost of our operational efficiency initiative. Our guidance for adjusted diluted EPS assumes only that we offset dilution from equity awards. As a general rule, we view 2017 adjusted net income as a good proxy for the operating cash flow we expect to generate. We do expect to maintain CapEx in line with the last two years as we invest in manufacturing to deliver our in-line and new product growth. So let me wrap up before we go to Q&A. We achieved our 2016 revenue and adjusted EPS guidance. And we affirmed our outlook for 2017 with updates for foreign exchange. We continue to see a path to continued margin expansion, increased cash flow and greater efficiency as we achieve the full benefit of our operational efficiency program. And we're prioritizing and funding investments in long-term growth in all of our core capabilities. With that, I'll hand things over to the operator to open the lines for your questions. Operator?
Operator: And the floor is now open for questions. We'll take our first question from Louise Chen with Guggenheim. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Louise Chen - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So, I'm just curious on your priorities for capital allocation in 2017 and if you would continue to repurchase shares even with your stock at this price? Thanks.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you, Louise. And we'll maintain the same capital allocation philosophy that we already shared with you. So, we'll continue investing in the business. We see opportunities this year of reinforcing our presence in the market with DTC campaigns, also expanding field forces in the markets. We'll continue investing in R&D because we consider that the productivity of R&D is very high and we have been delivering very strong products and we'll continue supporting our growth with this investment. We'll also invest in manufacturing, to ensure that we have the capacity, and the capabilities that we will need to support our future growth. And we'll also continue assessing external opportunities, business and developmental opportunities that will reinforce our internal growth. And any excess capital we will return to the shareholders through dividends or the program that we already announced for buying shares back.
Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.: Yeah. And just to add to that, Louise, we're currently in the market purchasing this quarter, we expect to purchase about $125 million in shares this quarter.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi, good morning. So can you talk a little bit about the new product launches? I mean, we had some positive feedback on Cytopoint talking to vets at the NAVC Conference. And just wanted to get your initial thoughts on that product and how we should look at expectations on that? And I guess the other question is, it did look like you tweaked down your core growth guide by about 50 bps. I'm just sort of wondering what was behind that given that 4Q ended up exactly where we generally thought about it? Thanks.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you, Derik. I will answer the first question and then I will ask Glenn to provide an answer to your second question. Cytopoint, definitely the feedback from the market is extremely positive. But also we want to consider not Cytopoint or Apoquel as separate. We want to consider now our dermatology portfolio, which is now even stronger than last year with Cytopoint, and we expect that the combination of these two products will cover all the needs of veterinarians when treating acute, chronic, or seasonalized atopic dermatitis or any type of skin condition. So we are very excited about our portfolio. We are considering that Apoquel will continue growing and we're supporting Apoquel this year with additional resources in terms of DTC and some additional activities in the market. And this also will have an impact in the Cytopoint because, as I said, we'll consider the combined portfolio in dermatology as the way to deliver the value to our customers and to cover the needs in terms of treating itching conditions or atopic dermatitis.
Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.: And in terms of the growth rates for 2017 on an operational basis, when we set the guidance back in November, since 2016 actuals were not final, we based the 2017 growth off the midpoint of those ranges. Now that we have final 2016 actuals and we came in towards the high-end of those ranges, the growth rates naturally declined. I do want to make it clear, the operational numbers themselves have not changed and in the core expectations for the business have not changed, except for the update to foreign exchange that we've reflected.
Operator: And our next question comes from Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yes, good morning. Can you update us on your progress as you attempt to combine flea and tick and heartworm, and any possible timelines on that front? And in light of the Mars acquisition, can you provide some context on the long-term risk and opportunities associated with the consolidation of clinics? Thanks.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Okay, thank you. Well, we have the first news on the products in terms of combining the flea, ticks, and heartworm because now we have topical product, which is a combination of the active ingredient of Simparica, sarolaner with the active ingredient of Revolution/Stronghold that it's selamectin. And this product has been already approved in Europe and we plan to launch this product every soon in the European market. Definitely, this is only the first step. We'll continue working internally to combine the same principle of different agents to have broader spectrum of coverage in parasiticides, including internal parasiticides, in this case for dogs. We have not yet provided the timing of the launch, but definitely our R&D team is working in this combo, but also working in future formulations that can also include injectable formulations and longer duration of protection. When we have more clarity on the timing, we'll provide an update on this information. And then in terms of the clinic consolidation, so now Banfield that has around 900 clinics in the U.S. will be a consolidated with VCA that has another 800 clinics. So this will represent 1,700 to 1,800 clinics of a total of 30,000 clinics in the U.S. market for companion animals. We have good collaboration with both companies with Banfield and VCA, and we expect also to continue this collaboration. Based on comments that we got from Banfield, it seems that they will keep these two networks independent, and we will continue working with Banfield as a group, and also with different clinics that are part of a network, to promote and to support our portfolios.
Operator: And our next question is from Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Erin Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Can you speak to the recent shift in strategy and the rationale behind your direct versus third-party distribution strategy and how has there been – or has there been an evolution in the market that makes direct distribution less favorable to you, now that vaccines and parasiticides are opened up? And how much did those distributor shifts impact you in the current quarter, as well as in the first quarter, from a stocking perspective? How should we be thinking about the buying pattern? And then my second question is, what does your guidance assume in terms of underlying growth across livestock versus companion animal, and the underlying fundamental trends assumed in your 2017 guidance? Thanks.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you, Erin. So let me start with your question about the distribution strategy. And these are related, as you mentioned, to companion animal. In previous year, we had the exclusivity provisions for few products and with certain distributors. So in 2016, we extended the collaboration with distributors, adding vaccines, but on a non-exclusive basis, in this case for the vaccines. So this year also, we included as part of the agreement with distributors, our parasiticide products. So Revolution, ProHeart 6, and Simparica. This will be part now of the agreement with distributors. With these extended partnership with distributors, we are confident that we'll be able to increase our share of voice and also penetration in veterinarian clinics. Also the changes with distributors, with these changes, we have considered that it's much more attractive model to have that contract with the distributors based on total volume, rather than exclusivity, for a small number of products. Having said that, also, we remain committed to our commercial model based on direct interactions with customers through highly qualified field force to generate demand for our products. And the result of all these changes is that we expect a positive impact in our business. And the outlook for generics is also something that maybe some questions in the market will remain unchanged from what we said in the past. So, in summary, we are confident that this new model will be very attractive. We'll also have better support from distributors, while we'll maintain our presence (38:05) in the market with our direct interaction with the customers. Glenn will talk about what has been the impact in terms of stock and revenues related to the change on the distribution.
Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.: Hi, Erin. In terms of the stocking impact for Q4, when you look at that and if you compare that to our total sales for the quarter, it's less than 1%, right. So if you're looking at the companion animal growth, there was a benefit of slightly less than 1% related to that. The offset to that in evaluating the companion animal growth, particularly in the U.S., is the impact of the surgical fluid business and the decline we saw there, that was slightly greater than the impact of the stocking. To your question on the underlying trends in companion animal and livestock, as we've discussed, we do expect, again, companion animal to grow stronger than livestock in 2017. I think when you look at it, for 2016 on a normalized organic basis, right, growth in livestock was 4%, growth in companion animal was 14%. I think we'd expect that difference to come closer in 2017, but again, we'd expect companion animal to grow stronger.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jon Block with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks and good morning. Juan Ramón, maybe just qualitatively, if you could talk about how do you feel about U.S. livestock? Back in the summer when conditions did not seem overwhelmingly favorable, you put up a good 3Q number, aided by promotions. This quarter U.S. livestock, I think you said up low-single digits operationally, although an easier comp, yet conditions seem to be getting better, especially as we enter 2017. So maybe just any color on increasing momentum that you see in U.S. livestock, specifically cattle? And then quantitatively, Glenn, can you just provide Apoquel-specific numbers to the U.S. and international, and will we be getting that number going forward, or will it sort of be combined under the atopic dermatitis portfolio with Cytopoint? Thanks, guys.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you, Jon. And let me go through the different species in livestock in the U.S., starting with cattle. So we expect, in the cattle business, for the market growth that will be 2% to 3%, and we expect to grow faster than the market in 2017. We expect also a slowdown in terms of herd expansion. Still, in 2017, we expect the herd will be continue growing. But something that is new is, we expect that in 2018 and 2019 also, this herd expansion will be now stable. Beef prices continue being a challenge in the U.S. market, but still we expect a recovery in the second half of the year. And the dairy segment, in terms of profitability, is normalizing, which is also positive. So we will see also that the volume in terms of prevention and productivity will continue growing, and maybe will be a slowdown in terms of the use of anti-infective. As I said, 2% to 3% the market, and we are predicting that we'll be growing faster than the market. In poultry, we expect flat to 1% market growth, and we expect a growth in this segment for Zoetis. So we'll see continued pressure on antibiotics, but we also have a portfolio that can be alternative to the antibiotics, which are considered as medically important for human, and we can offer alternatives that will generate growth in our portfolio. And finally, pork, about 1% to 2% growth in the market, and again, we expect also to grow faster than the market, mainly driven by now the entrance of the new PCV2 vaccines in our portfolio that we expect to roll during the year. And we'll continue working on new combinations of vaccines or vaccines that will be adding antigen. That also will reinforce our position in pork.
Operator: And our next question...
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: And in...
Operator: Go ahead.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: We have another question that Glenn will talk about.
Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.: So in terms of the sales for Apoquel and Revolution, so for Q4 we saw $70 million in sales of Apoquel. So in the U.S. we had $50 million of sales, which was a nice pickup sequentially from Q3 as we work through the inventory issues we discussed in the prior quarter, so a nice sequential growth in the U.S. Internationally, we had $20 million in sales, which was a drop from Q3 as we expected. In the Q3 call, we talked a lot about the fact that there was some initial stocking in Japan. So, again, for the quarter total $70 million, and for the year we have $248 million of sales in Apoquel with a $170 million of that in the U.S. and $78 million international. In terms of how we're going to disclose that moving forward, between Apoquel, Cytopoint, or the derm portfolio, we're still early on in that. We want to see how the mix evolves, and then we'll determine what's the best way to disclose the sales are moving forward.
Operator: And we'll go next to Brett Wong with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
Brett W. S. Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Great. Thanks, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Wondering if you can please talk to the expected growth in Brazil in 2017. You mentioned that it's going to continue to be strong. But should we expect the ongoing high-single digit operational growth there? And what will drive double-digit growth in that region? If you can talk to both livestock and companion that would be very helpful.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: So thank you. So we stopped providing exactly rate of growth in Brazil. Definitely, we see Brazil market that will continue growing, growing in many different species, including companion animal. And that's why we decided also to expand our field force for companion animal in 2017, and we are also expanding our field force for cattle in 2017. So we are investing in the market because we see the opportunities that this market will continue growing. And we see that this market will also grow in terms of export. So the projections for Brazil continue being very positive. Still one of the things that is difficult to predict in exactly how much will be the impact of the different discussions in terms of trade. But we are confident that maybe Brazil can have a benefit on all these trade discussions, including the export, that has been very strong in the past. In companion animal, definitely we see the opportunity of increasing that medicalization in dogs. They will be also having the benefit of having the entire portfolio of Zoetis now approved in Brazil. We have Apoquel, we have also Simparica is something that definitely will help us to generate even faster growth in companion animal in this market. Next question.
Operator: And we'll go next to John Kreger with William Blair. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks very much. Juan Ramón, I think you said you guys exceeded your $300 million target for cost savings. Can you just maybe comment a bit on what were the lessons you learned there and what allows you to beat that goal? And remind us what your plan is to optimize the manufacturing footprint over the next couple of years? Thanks.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Well, the lessons that we learned – and thank you for the questions, John – the lessons that we learned that we understood from the beginning that there were opportunities for being much more efficient. But at the same time, we went through a process of building the infrastructure, implementing ERP. And we considered that it was too much trying to implement everything at the same time. But when we have full control on our operations, we really focus on improving our efficiency. And the result of this operational efficiency program is that, first, now we learned that managing so many SKUs is not adding any value to our customers. In the past, we tried to meet all customer needs in terms of not only products, but we remain with significant large number of products, but meeting expectations in terms of dosages, formulations that in many cases were adding only complexity and limiting our ability to be reliable in terms of supply. So this is one of the first lessons. So it's reducing complexity in terms of SKUs, in terms of market. It's providing to us the opportunity to be much more focused and provide more value to all our customers. The second lesson is that the reaction of Zoetis team in terms of embracing all these opportunities. And really targeting all these savings, we serve the objective of not only being more efficient but also supporting our future growth in a way that that will be stronger. And I think is the last lesson that we learnt through the process is that definitely there were significant opportunities of eliminating non-added value activities. And these were related to marketing, it was related to some of the activities that we were doing in terms of meetings and travels that were not adding value to our growth and not adding value to our operations. And we are very pleased what we have achieved. Definitely, we have now mobile that is (48:37) much more efficient in commercial, also in finance, and in many other parts of the company. But definitely, we learned that it's important to focus on improving profitability, but even more important than just improving profitability is ensuring the future growth of Zoetis. So then you asked about the plan to optimize manufacturing going forward. Maybe Glenn can cover this question.
Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.: Yeah. In terms of the plan to optimize manufacturing going forward, I think there are essentially three major plants that are still set to be transitioned by 2020. And as we go through that transition and move a lot of those products, we expect to get another 200 basis points improvement in our gross margins, but those are the next major initiatives related to manufacturing. Next question.
Operator: And our next question...
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Next question.
Operator: ...is from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. With this you are marking the end of the SKU rationalization program. Should we assume that the Zoetis story becomes more focused on top line growth versus margin expansion? And Glenn, can you talk about how much more room you see for margins? I think you had guided to 34%, 35% this year, it's up about 1000 basis points since 2012. How much higher can that go and what are the key drivers of that improvement. Thanks very much.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you, Jami, for the questions. The focus on revenue growth has been always a part of our objective. And what we achieved with this operational efficiency program, it's having more better allocation of resources to generate future growth. So the fact that now we were able to exceed the $300 million target, it's allowing us to invest in DTC, it's allowing us to expand our field force in certain markets, and also to invest in technology that also will support the interactions with customers. We are focused on revenue growth and we know that the revenue growth will be the only way to continue generating adjusted net income faster than revenue growth. But we also want to make sure that we generate profitable revenue growth. Glenn?
Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.: In terms of continued margin expansion, so we do expect this year of 2017 to be between 34% and 35%, which is a significant improvement over where we've been historically. We do see further room for improvement, we talked about 200 basis points that we see in gross margin coming by 2020 and we also do expect to be able to grow our expenses slower than our growth in revenue moving forward. That being said, we're not targeting a margin. We're going to look at the right investment opportunities and do what makes the most financial sense and provides the highest return going forward. But those are some of the key areas that will provide some additional margin opportunities as we move forward.
Steve Frank - Zoetis, Inc.: Next question.
Operator: Our next question is from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good morning, folks and congratulations on a strong 2016. There has been some concerns about generic erosion in your base companion animal business in the U.S., excluding the new products like Apoquel, Simparica et cetera. Could you comment on that, because I think you mentioned that the growth in the segment was driven by the newer products, so should we expect the base business to decline? And also just to follow-up on Simparica, what were the sales of Simparica now and what is the potential of this product in combination form? And forgive me if you've mentioned this, when should we expect the approval in the U.S. for the combination form as well? Thank you.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you, Alex. So we don't see any change in the outlook for generics in 2017 or 2018. So we know that the generics will capture part of the market. We have been managing very well in the past and we don't see anything that is creating a change in terms of generic penetration. So we are very confident that there is many different aspects that are also supporting our portfolio. We have very strong brand equity. We are promoting many products in our portfolio, which is also allowing us to also to offer volume discounts. We are a company that is bringing significant innovation, which is also an important part of what is our reputation in the market. And we maintain a significant presence in terms of direct interaction with customers. So all these elements are in my opinion supporting our portfolio and definitely we see that the generic will get part of the market. But no different what we have been communicated that over time, they can reach 20% to 40%, but definitely not in the first year as we have been demonstrated many times. So it's a very different market than human health, and I don't think things are changing that will increase the penetration of generics significantly. At least for companies that maintain a significant presence in the market, they promote large portfolio and they have the reputation and the interactions with customers. Simparica combo, I guess, that you referred to the product that has been recently approved in Europe, that it was a topical formulation for cats. We expect also to introduce this product in the market in the U.S. We don't have yet details or we have not provided the timing. Definitely, once we have more information, we'll provide these details. We file in the U.S., but it's FDA filing and it depend on the U.S. reviews, the timing of the approval and the launch of the product. The rest of the portfolio, combining the combo products sarolaner with other active ingredients to include internal and external parasiticide for dogs, again, so it's something that we are working and will provide more details when we are progressing in this project.
Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.: In terms of sales for Simparica that is something that we haven't disclosed. Performance this year has been in line with our expectations and we do expect peak sales for the product to be over $100 million. We expect it to be a blockbuster and we're also very focused on the platform that it provides us to have continued lifecycle enhancements related to that product.
Operator: And our next question from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yes. Thanks very much. Juan Ramón, I was hoping that you could talk about the competitive landscape, some of your large competitors have merged in the past. My guess is that the disruption at Lilly may be normalizing now and maybe they will be a slightly stronger competitor in the next year or two, but that's just a guess on my part, I'd love to hear your perspective on that. And if you could talk about the other major consolidation, and whether that's good or bad for Zoetis? Thank you.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Well, I will say that, rather than providing a general comment, maybe it's good to see what is the impact by species. First, on the consolidation of Boehringer Ingelheim with Merial. So in companion animal, the majority of the portfolio will be Merial. They will be adding some products, especially in pain, coming from BI. We don't see a significant change in the competition landscape in terms of companion animal. For cattle is where we see that the combined portfolio will strengthen the position of the new company. In swine, basically portfolio will be the portfolio that BI had in the past, so no changes in the competitive landscape, and the same for the poultry. Poultry will be mainly the Merial portfolio. So we don't expect significant changes in terms of competition, in terms of species. They will have, definitely, a bigger critical mass. This critical mass they can help them in terms of investments, and also especially in smaller markets, and definitely will be a stronger competitor than the two companies separated. At the same time, so the combined company, they will need to manage higher complexity, and I'm sure that they will manage in the future, but they will have to understand how to manage the diversity of this extended portfolio and also, they will be facing the distraction of the integration. So in 2017, probably we will see challenge and opportunities, not too big changes in terms of competition by species, and it's something that we are confident that we will be managing. You asked about Elanco. Elanco has been reinforced with recent acquisition, but this is something that, it's already part of our competitive landscape. So we don't see that Elanco in 2017 will have a different type of challenge, in terms of competition, compared to 2016.
Operator: And our next question is from Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore ISI.
Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. And sorry if I missed this during the prepared remarks or during the Q&A, but could you break out price, the impact of price versus volume, if possible, on an organic operational revenue growth perspective, for the full year? And it does look like, on the margin, inflation starting to pick-up in the States, at least, I haven't looked at rest of world data, but given the business model of Zoetis, do you think pick-up in kind of core CPI is going to allow you to do a little bit more with price, or is that just not relevant? Thanks a lot, and good to hear your voice, Juan Ramón.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Well, thank you, Mark. I think probably these questions will be answered by Glenn, he has all these details, and I'm sure that he can provide the answer.
Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.: Sure. In terms of the price volume growth for the year. So if we start with our normalized organic operational growth, right, of 8% for the year, about 5% of that comes from new products. So we'll classify that as volume, right. Then there is the remaining 3%. The remaining 3%, 2% of that comes from price and 1% volume. So in total, 2% price and 6% volume for the year, in terms of the impact that we have on a normalized basis. And in terms of the impact of inflation on price, that's something, as we go across geographies, not just in the U.S., inflation is definitely a factor that we consider when setting our price increases. So it definitely does have an impact on how we set those increases annually.
Operator: And our next question is from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Just a couple of quick ones here. Following up on the dermatology assets, can I just get an updated view in terms of peak sales potential when we think about Cytopoint and Apoquel, how large do you think that portfolio can become over time? And the second one was on tax reform. I think you've clearly articulated the company would benefit from a lower U.S. corporate tax rate, can you just elaborate a little bit more on border adjustment, I don't have (1:01:08) details at this point, but can you just give us a little bit of color in terms of, we think about your U.S. business, how much of that is manufactured in the U.S. versus ex-U.S., so when we get more details here, how much of the franchise would be affected? Thanks very much.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you, Chris. And I think we are not changing our projection that has been provided in the past for Apoquel, so we think that Apoquel will be generating more than $300 million on peak sales. How much is something that we'll see depending on also the market that will be also captured in Cytopoint. And we also think that, now that we have Cytopoint with a full license in the U.S., but still no Cytopoint in the rest of the world. I think it's important that we understand that the full potential of Cytopoint, and then we provide guidance on the combined portfolio, when we have this information. But we see that the Cytopoint will be adding revenues to the more than $300 million that we already communicated for Apoquel.
Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.: So, Chris. Specific to your question on border adjustability, when we look at that and we look at our imports and exports, we're essentially net neutral between imports and exports in the U.S. So in terms of the impact on tax reform, it's really going to depend on what the tax rates are on imports and exports to understand the impact of that. But from an overall number perspective in terms of what we import and what we export, we're essentially net neutral.
Operator: And we'll go next to Kathy Miner with Cowen & Co.
Kathy M. Miner - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good morning. Just one question, if you will. You mentioned the importance of R&D to the company. Can you give us an update on some of the either key areas you're looking at, or I know you've mentioned biologics as being of importance to you going forward, just any color you can provide going forward would be helpful? Thank you.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: So, in terms of biologicals, we will continue investing there heavily to develop new vaccines, to develop combination of vaccines. We also intend to reinforce our presence in cattle vaccines in Europe. We also want to develop a larger portfolio of vaccines in China, and we'll be developing a strategy to be having stronger presence of our teams in China, mainly for swine, but also with opportunities of other species. So all areas of R&D investment, we are now using the platform of sarolaner to develop a new parasiticide. And we mentioned the approval of sarolaner with selamectin in Europe for cat topical formulation, and we'll continue investing in this platform to ensure that we're covering broader spectrum of parasiticides. We also with Cytopoint, we have quite significant knowledge in terms of monoclonal antibody, and these monoclonal antibodies also will be targeting all the different indications including pain or including other therapeutic indications. And we're also targeting in livestock opportunities of improving profitability for productivity, improving productivity in livestock. So we know that there are now products that are helping us with efficiencies. We think that there will be opportunity for adding new products that will support this additional productivity in livestock.
Steve Frank - Zoetis, Inc.: And we will now open the floor for any follow-up questions. That's follow-up questions only, thank you.
Operator: And we can take the first follow-up from Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Erin Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi, thanks. It's follow-up on biologics there. I guess, what and maybe this depends on which indications you're focused on from a monoclonal antibodies standpoint, but will that fall under this FDA or the USDA jurisdiction? And how should we think about kind of the timeline of approval and commercial launch of those products?
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Well, Cytopoint has been under the jurisdiction of USDA. We expect that other monoclonal antibodies will depend. We expect that the indication for pain will be under the jurisdiction of FDA, but this will depend. And there is a clear definition of who should be responsible for each type of product, and also with discussions with the regulators when we start developing the programs, then we will find which will be the final regulator that will be involved in the approval.
Steve Frank - Zoetis, Inc.: And it appears we have no further questions, I'll return the floor to you, Juan Ramón for any closing remarks.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you very much for joining us today and we'll continue with providing updates to our business in a regular basis. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. A replay of today's call will be available in two hours by dialing 800-388-6197 for U.S. listeners and 402-220-1115 for international. You may disconnect your lines at any time and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2016 Financial Results Conference Call and Webcast for Zoetis. Hosting the call today is Steve Frank, Vice President of Investor Relations for Zoetis. The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, and will not be forwarded automatically. In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call via dial-in on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the floor will be open for your questions following the presentation. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.
Steve Frank - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you, operator. Good morning and welcome to the Zoetis third quarter 2016 earnings call. I am joined today by Juan Ramón Alaix, our Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn David, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements, and that actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statement in today's press release and our SEC filings, including but not limited to, our 2015 annual report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q. Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and in the company's 8-K filing dated today, November 2, 2016. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. With that, I will turn the call over to Juan Ramón.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. There's been a lot written lately about the animal health industry, livestock, in particular, and the cycles we face as a part of the global food supply chain. Let me start by saying that I'm very pleased with the positive result we have reported in the third quarter because it reaffirms that we understand the cycles of our customers' businesses. And as in the past, we continue to be resilient in our ability to adapt and steadily grow our business, despite the broader agricultural market changes. At Zoetis, we have regularly grown faster than the market, and we are very well positioned to achieve predictable growth during these cycles because of our diverse portfolio and global scope. We remain focused on the long-term full-year review of our business since quarterly results can be misleading about the cycles in our customers' markets. Our strength in all relevant geographies, species, and therapeutic areas help us offset many of the economic and business challenges that can affect part of the animal health industry in the near term. We're also making improvements in our cost structure and reallocating resources to the most important growth opportunities in animal health from a therapeutic area and geographical perspective. I'm pleased to say, we have nearly completed our operational efficiency initiative, and we can confirm that we expect to achieve the target of $300 million in cost savings by the end of 2017. We also now expect to achieve an adjusted EBIT margin of 34% to 35% in 2017, higher than our original projection, and we expect to grow our revenues faster than the market again in 2017. This quarter, we delivered strong results. We grew our revenue 4% operationally, with particular strength in our companion animal portfolio. When you exclude the impact of our operational efficiency initiative, foreign exchange, and acquisitions, or what we call normalized organic operational growth, our growth in the third quarter was 6%. On the same normalized basis, our companion animal products grew 11% and our livestock products grew 2%. The companion animal growth was driven by a full supply of APOQUEL and the introduction of other new products. And in livestock, the main driver of growth was strength in our international markets, which were able to offset the impact of product rationalization changes across the livestock portfolio. Moving forward, we expect companion animal to be the main contributor to growth in the fourth quarter and in 2017. And in terms of livestock, we expect improved growth as we get beyond the product rationalization impacts this year. Moving on to earnings, we grew adjusted earnings 6% operationally, reflecting the negative impact of higher adjusted effective tax rate. Glenn will discuss this in more detail. But, excluding tax and interest, our EBIT growth was 17%. As we finish up 2016, we are increasing our 2016 earnings guidance to reflect the strong performance we have achieved through the first nine months of the year. And based on the monthly (sic) [continued] trends we see and the confidence in our business, we are also improving our guidance for 2017, despite the recent negative evolution of currencies compared to the U.S. dollar. Let me provide additional business updates on some key products and discuss the investments we are making to support that growth. For the first nine months of 2016, we have generated approximately $180 million in revenue for APOQUEL, with about $70 million coming in the third quarter. We have here an excellent response from veterinarians and pet owners using APOQUEL, as we increase our penetration in new markets. Our research indicates that we are achieving great awareness and satisfaction among veterinarians, as well as more frequent proactive requests from pet owners. APOQUEL has now been launched with unrestricted supply in all approved markets. And we are working on further expanding its market share. In the U.S., we have seen growth of new patients since achieving full supply in May. APOQUEL has been doing very well in treating dogs with chronic allergies. And we are increasingly seeing it used for more seasonal and acute allergy causes, an important part of our expansion plans. As we look ahead with APOQUEL, we are trying additional ways to support this product growth. For example, in the U.S., we are developing and testing direct-to-consumer, or DTC, advertising and we expect to launch a national advertising campaign for APOQUEL in 2017. Also to support the growth of our companion animal business, we have also been expanding our product portfolios and field force in China and Brazil. These are great examples on how our efficiency initiative is ultimately about better allocating resources to generate sales growth. Meanwhile, Simparica, our new oral parasiticide for dogs, is available in the U.S. and most of the EU countries, and is being further deployed in markets like Canada and Brazil. In 2017, Simparica will be available for the full flea and tick season in the U.S. and EU. We are planning to support Simparica with additional promotional investment to ensure it has a positive impact in our revenue growth in 2017. We are also getting ready for the broader launch of our canine antibody therapy, targeting IL-31. This therapy is currently only available in the U.S. under conditional license. And in October, we expanded our efforts beyond dermatology specialists and made it available to all veterinarians in the U.S. We'll broaden distribution in the weeks ahead and we expect to achieve a full USDA license by the end of the year, with Europe to follow next year. We are also seeing good progress with the PHARMAQ acquisition that we made one year ago. We have posted $64 million in fish revenue through the first nine months of the year, despite the toxic algae bloom that has been impacting fish farmers in Chile. PHARMAQ has achieved rapid adoption of its ALPHA JECT LiVac SRS vaccine for farmers in Chile. Fish farmers who needed a more predictable and reliable means of protection have responded very favorably to recent information that LiVac SRS has already demonstrated protection up to 11 months after vaccination, and we continue testing for longer duration of efficacy. Fish farmers also view this vaccine as an important way to reduce the use of antibiotics in their operations. Now, let me turn to the R&D innovations that continue supporting our future growth and value creation. New product introductions like APOQUEL, the IL-31 antibody therapy, Simparica and the ALPHA JECT LiVac SRS vaccine are very important. And continuous innovation over the lifecycle of our products is also critical to our long-term success. In the third quarter, we had several approvals of new indications and formulations for key livestock products. In swine, we obtained approvals in the U.S. for new combinations of our FLUSURE XP vaccine. This now helps guard against additional flu strains that threaten swine herd health. We also expanded our FOSTERA swine vaccine with additional indications and approvals in markets like Brazil, Mexico and Korea. Our premium injectable anti-infective DRAXXIN received additional indications and approvals in Japan and Canada. We also obtained approval in Japan for BOPRIVA, a unique vaccine that temporarily reduce testosterone in bulls, providing farmers with a highly-effective way to manage aggressive behavior. We're also making investment and showing progress in our diagnostic portfolio. In August, we acquired Scandinavian Micro Biodevices or SMB. They are pioneers in developing the manufacturing microfluidic lab on a chip diagnostic products, which are used for veterinary point-of-care services. SMB's promising product line has helped our existing diagnostic business, which obtained approval for values and test kits in the third quarter in new markets such as Mexico, Japan and Korea. Lots of good news to share about our new products, lifecycle innovation and business development activities. In summary, we have continued to demonstrate the strength of our diverse portfolio across geographies and species. And this time, we see particular strength in our companion animal portfolio. We are realizing the benefits of a disciplined approach to R&D and business development, which is strengthening our business for the long term. And we expect to achieve our operational efficiency initiative target in 2017 and set ourselves on a path to increase profitability, cash generation and value creation, while maintaining our revenue growth. With that, let me turn things over to Glenn. Glenn?
Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you, Juan Ramón. Before I get into the financials, I wanted to thank many of you for reaching out and speaking with me since I became CFO in August. I'm very excited to take on this role and work with the rest of Zoetis' leaders to continue driving the performance of our company. As CFO, I am committed to maintaining our reputation for financial integrity and transparency and continuing an ongoing dialogue with the investment community. We remain focused on achieving our updated financial guidance for 2016 and 2017, building our capacity for long-term revenue and earnings growth, and delivering the innovations and financial performance that people have come to expect from Zoetis. I am pleased to say that in my first quarter as CFO that we are making excellent progress on all those fronts, and we are raising our earnings guidance for 2016 and improving our earnings guidance for 2017, despite the negative impact of foreign currency, which was approximately $0.03. The consistent performance we've delivered over time through recent periods of major efficiency initiatives and change is a testament to the quality and commitment of our Zoetis colleagues. So, what are the key takeaways for the third quarter results? Continued strong operational revenue growth from our diverse portfolio, continued improvement in our adjusted EBIT growth and margin, a meaningful contribution from several new product launches, lifecycle innovations and targeted business development activities, and finally, an updated guidance for 2016 and 2017 that reflects our recent performance and confidence in the future. Now, let me walk you through the major pieces of our third quarter income statement and provide some color. We generally talk to operational growth, which excludes the impacts of foreign currency. You can also see, once again, in the tables on our website that we are providing additional detail on impacts related to our operational efficiency initiatives, M&A, and in the case of the year-to-date charts, the extra days in our first quarter relative to the prior year. We refer to the revenue growth excluding these items as normalized organic operational growth. For the third quarter, operational revenue growth was 4%, which excludes the 2% negative impact of foreign exchange. Now, let me take you through the key elements of our performance and bridge that to our normalized growth. First, APOQUEL and a number of other new products contributed 5% of our revenue growth. The in-line portfolio grew 1%, with price contributing 2% and volume declining 1%. Recent M&A contributed 3% to our growth, while our operational efficiency initiative reduced our growth by 5%, due to product rationalizations and changes to our business in markets like Venezuela and India. Accounting for all of these factors, we delivered normalized organic operational growth of 6% in the quarter. And for the first nine months of the year, our revenue growth on this basis was 7%, in line with our view of 7% to 8% growth for the full year. Turning now to our segment performance; in terms of the U.S., we generated 1% operational growth compared to a very strong third quarter in the previous year. Just a reminder, the U.S. grew 19% in Q3 2015, with livestock growing 13% and companion animal growing 27%. In the third quarter of 2016, U.S. companion animal products grew 5%, driven by APOQUEL, Simparica and other new product launches like our new vaccines. This growth was partially offset by a decline in surgical fluid products. In U.S. livestock, we declined by 2% against the very strong year-ago quarter when we grew 13%. The decline was primarily due to the impact of SKU eliminations, lower sales of our swine products, where we continue to see increased competition, as well as the impact of a challenging market environment, especially for our cattle and swine customers. We partially offset this decline with growth in our cattle business, where successful promotional activity drove increased volumes. Shifting back to a normalized organic operational growth basis, U.S. grew 3% with companion animal growing 6% and livestock growing 1%. Turning to International, revenue grew 6% operationally. We delivered very strong operational growth of 15% in companion animal and 2% in livestock. Our International business saw a significant impact from our operational efficiency initiatives, which reduced growth by 8%. By species group, the impact was 9% in livestock and 6% in companion animal. M&A activity, primarily PHARMAQ, contributed 5% to our International revenue growth. Based on these factors, our normalized organic operational growth for International was 9%, with companion animal growth of 21% and livestock growth of 4%. You can see the full results for our top 11 markets in the table, so let me highlight a few items. Growth in markets like Japan, Brazil, Germany and Australia was primarily from companion animal products and launches of APOQUEL. In Japan, we saw a significant benefit from the initial stocking of APOQUEL with wholesalers in the quarter. France and Canada both saw a mix of companion animal and livestock sales driving their growth, including sales of APOQUEL and a more stable environment in France around antibiotic usage and prior regulatory changes. Meanwhile, we continue to see livestock supported with growth in cattle in Brazil and swine in China, where we currently have favorable market conditions, as well as growth in companion animal in China, where we are seeing positive trends in medicalization rates for pets. Overall, we have been very pleased with the strong growth we have seen in emerging markets, particularly China and Brazil, where we have invested in expanding our field force and product portfolios to effectively capitalize on the fast-growing trends in these countries. We'll continue to deploy selling resources in these and other markets where we see significant and sustainable growth drivers, combined with high returns on our investments. Wrapping up the revenue picture, there are five key takeaways for the third quarter. Our diversified model continues to deliver steady, predictable and meaningful revenue growth, with strong product lines and geographies balancing the effect of certain market challenges and cycles. Product rationalization continues to impact revenue growth. However, we continue to deliver strong growth on a normalized basis. APOQUEL once again was a significant growth driver, with launches in new markets and continued expansion of the customer base in existing markets. Other companion animal products, like Simparica and recent additions to our vaccine portfolio, are contributing to growth. And finally, when it comes to revenue, we are improving the base business in various emerging markets by expanding our product portfolio and adding to our direct sales capability. Turning to the rest of the P&L, adjusted gross margin improved 120 basis points, primarily due to a more profitable mix of products, while foreign exchange had a negative impact of 70 basis points this quarter. Adjusted operating expense also declined, reflecting the continued realization of our operational efficiency changes and continued discipline around SG&A, which includes the addition of PHARMAQ expenses this year. Improved gross margin and a reduction in operating expenses enabled us to grow our adjusted EBIT by 17% operationally, versus the 4% operational revenue growth. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter was 31.6% versus 25.1% in the year-ago quarter. This difference was primarily driven by the impact of the European Commission tax ruling earlier this year, and the benefit of certain discrete items in the year-ago quarter. As a result, adjusted net income grew 6% operationally, reflecting the change to our adjusted tax rate and higher interest expense, which offset much of our adjusted EBIT growth. For the quarter, GAAP net income grew 26% on a reported basis, aided by a reduction in stand-up costs and restructuring charges, as well as the revaluation of deferred tax assets related to the establishment of our new International operating model. Moving to guidance for full-year 2016, we are narrowing to the high end of our revenue range, and increasing our adjusted diluted EPS to reflect our ongoing confidence in the momentum of our new products and the sustainable cost benefits of our operational efficiency initiative. As you model out the remainder of 2016, remember that we have five fewer days in Q4 2016 than Q4 2015. And this is usually our highest quarter in terms of operating expenses as a percent of revenue, and our lowest quarter for gross margin, due to the seasonal nature of our product mix. For the year, we expect to achieve operational revenue growth, including the impact from product rationalization, of 4% to 5%, and adjusted EBIT margin of approximately 32%, and operational growth and adjusted net income of 12% to 15%. The significant increase in our guidance for reported diluted EPS is due to our increased outlook for the business and the favorable tax items realized in Q3. Moving to 2017; since our last update in August, changes in FX rates have lowered our views for revenue by $50 million and adjusted diluted EPS by $0.03. However, the overall evolution in our business over the past year has been positive on balance, as our companion animal dermatology portfolio continues to grow and several livestock markets in our International business are strengthening. These changes are allowing us to increase the lower end of our revenue range and maintaining the high end, while absorbing the negative impact of foreign exchange. Cost of goods remains the same at 32% to 33% as we have been successful in our cost reduction efforts, as well as our SKU rationalization that has brought an improved mix. On SG&A, FX changes were slightly in our favor. However, we are increasing the lower end of our range and maintaining the high end as we allocate a portion of our cost savings to promising investment opportunities, such as, advertising and promotion investments in key companion animal franchises like APOQUEL and Simparica that will drive revenue starting in 2017 and over the next several years. Field force expansions in Brazil and China where we see sustainable growth drivers and opportunities for increased market share, and enhancements to our diagnostics commercial capabilities following the acquisition of SMB. We're also taking on the necessary R&D investments to develop SMB's pipeline, as well as investing additional R&D dollars to some of our key international growth markets. When you take all of these changes together, we are increasing the lower end of our adjusted EPS range, maintaining the high end of $2.38, despite the negative impact of foreign currency, while also improving our view for adjusted EBIT margin to be between 34% and 35%. While we don't provide quarterly guidance, we do want to point out that we are currently expecting the delivery of full-year 2017 adjusted diluted EPS growth to be more heavily weighted to the second half of the year for a few reasons. First, we will have some lingering effects from the operational efficiency initiative in the first two quarters as we continue to sell out remaining inventory in Q1 and Q2 of 2016. Second, a portion of our revenue growth is dependent upon the ramping up of new product launches, which we expect to build throughout the year. Finally, many of the incremental investments we are making on the SG&A line are weighted towards the first half of the year and begin to deliver results on the revenue line as the year goes on. A final point on capital allocation; we are continuing to repurchase shares at a steady rate of $75 million per quarter. At this rate, we'd exhaust our current plan at the end of this year. Share repurchases will continue to be an important element of our capital allocation framework and we will provide a more specific update later this year. So wrapping up; we've improved our outlook for revenue. We've achieved our targeted cost structure. We're prudently taking on investments in long-term growth. We've improved our outlook for adjusted EBIT margin and we've improved our view for EPS. There's been a tremendous effort to get where we are. We're proud of what we've achieved to-date and we are excited to continue to move the business to new heights. With that, I'll hand it over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?
Operator: And we'll take our first question from Louise Chen with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.
Louise Chen - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. My question here is on livestock. How should we think about Zoetis' ability to grow livestock sales through pricing pressures in the U.S. for cattle? And can you provide more details on the herd size, U.S. feed lot sales, and producer profitability and the puts and takes here? Thanks.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you, Louise. It's Juan Ramón. Well, on the question on the livestock and how we plan to grow this business in price or other volume growth, definitely, we'll continue applying the same strategy in terms of pricing that can be justified through outcome and providing the value to our customers. We continue having these prices vary constantly over the years, and we also plan to continue increasing these prices in the future. In the U.S., as we reported, livestock in this quarter grew by 1% in terms of normalized growth, so excluding the impact of SKU or currency or M&A. If we go to the sales of – in light of this growth, cattle grew by low-single digit, swine declined and poultry have double-digit growth. So, talking about the cattle and also the situation on the feed lots and all different drivers that are affecting this segment, so let me describe the factors that are impacting the cattle business in the U.S. So, one, it's more animals, which is positive. We have seen also in this quarter higher placement of animals in feed lots, another positive element. But there are other elements, which are negative and we have seen that in the quarter. So, first, the producers are losing money. Animals are entering heavier into the feed lots. And also, we have experiencing mild weather conditions in the U.S. that are driving a lower-disease incident. So, net-net, compared to one year ago, we think that the situation is less positive. But still, with this situation, we have been able to grow the business and the reason why we are growing is because of our portfolio, the ability also to increase prices and also the team, which is interacting with customers. The last comment I want to make here is that this is a business, livestock, which is affected by cycles. Cycles that have been affecting in the past, and will continue affecting in the future. Despite these cycles, the animal health industry has been very resilient and they're showing very steady growth. In the past, that's 5% to 6% and we expect also in the future despite of those cycles we will continue growing at the same rate. And definitely, we see Zoetis also growing in 2017 in livestock in line with the market.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question with Jon Block with Stifel. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Jonathan Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks, guys. Good morning. And maybe I'll just try to ask both questions upfront, so the first one on APOQUEL. I think it's now $280 million run rate before the DTC. So, how do you feel about that north of $300 million goal? Is that now possibly $400 million? And maybe if you can talk about what prior DTCs have done to other Zoetis products, like Rimadyl. And then just a follow-up on the U.S. livestock; you mentioned you're up 1% after the adjustments in the SKU rationalization. In the comments, I think you called out some promotions in the quarter. So just wondering, is the thought of positive U.S. livestock growth for the year still intact? Just trying to get the fluctuations between 3Q and 4Q. Thanks, guys.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you, Jon for the question. On APOQUEL, we expect definitely to exceed that $300 million. We want to make sure that we have full understanding of the market reaction not only in the U.S., but also in all the rest of the markets in the product has been now made available that – with full availability. We also need to have a full understanding of what will be the impact not only in chronic, but also in seasonal and acute. And we said that DTC campaign, definitely, we expect to broaden the access of – or expanding the access of the product to more patients and also bring pet owners to the clinics then the veterinarians then can prescribe the product. In terms of other DTC investments, we mentioned also that we are considering also DTC for Simparica. It's something that we will consider in the U.S. when we have the right level of penetration in the market. In terms of cattle; so cattle in the U.S., we expect that at the end of the year, we'll be growing and we insisted many times that it's important not to look at our business on a quarterly basis, but on a full-year basis. And in full-year basis, we still expect the cattle business showing positive growth. And we know that some cycles that can be negative at certain point will turn into positive in the following phases or the following quarters or months. So, we are confident also that the cattle business in the U.S. will be showing growth in 2017.
Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.: And this is Glenn. And just to add on to APOQUEL in terms of the DTC. Since we don't have a lot of experience with DTC with a lot of our other products, we did run specific pilots for APOQUEL that give us strong confidence in the return that we're going to get that investment in the future. And then the other thing in terms of the peak sale, we really do want to stress to look at that from a dermatology portfolio perspective. We're very excited about IL-31 in the future that that's going to bring for us.
Operator: Okay. Our next question comes from Jeff Holford with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Jeffrey Holford - Jefferies LLC: Thanks very much for taking my question. Just for Glenn, I wonder if you can just tell us around some of the inventory management you have. You have the SKU focus. You quite clearly guided for that in 2017. Could you just tell us if there could be further inventory movements from the integration of SAP and is that included in the 2017 guide? And then just quick add-on of you noticed – you mentioned an update on the share repurchase, would that be part of our Capital Markets Day later this year? Thank you.
Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.: So from an inventory perspective, we definitely still do see significant opportunity to reduce our inventory moving forward. We currently sit at 10 plus months of inventory on the balance sheet and that's definitely an area of opportunity that we see. And we'll start to see benefits from the additional visibility we have in SAP. We'll start to see those benefits in 2017 and beyond, so definitely an area of opportunity for us to increase our cash generation. The other question in terms of share repurchase, so we have a $500 million share repurchase program in place that started last year. We'll be complete with that program by the end of the year, and we'll come back to the market later in the year with our intentions for that moving forward. But share repurchase does remain a very important part of our capital allocation priorities.
Operator: And the next question comes from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi. Good morning.
Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.: Good morning.
Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Could you talk a little bit about the swine business, and how much of a headwind has that been to organic revenue growth the last year or so? And I guess, when can we think about new product timing and concentrations of that? I mean just talk a little bit more about how you are thinking about rebuilding that business, or expanding that business.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Yes. And let me describe the swine business, not only in the U.S., but also International. Internationally, the swine business has been showing double-digit growth, which is very strong growth. While in the U.S., we saw in this quarter, a decline. The main reason of this decline was some challenge in terms of one important vaccine that is used in the swine industry, which is the PCV2 vaccine. We expect to update this vaccine, and having a positive impact in terms of growth in 2017. The rest of the markets outside of the U.S., the performance has been very strong, especially in China, where we continue seeing the benefits of more sophistication of the swine production (39:16). And we are very well positioned to maximize the opportunities in this (39:21) market. We also – after we explain that, we are expanding our portfolio and field force in the country, in China. And definitely, we see swine generating net growth in 2017.
Operator: And our next question comes from John Scotti with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
John Scotti - Evercore ISI: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So I wanted to ask on operating margin, because given the increase in 2017 guidance; Glenn, in your new seat, would appreciate any thoughts on where you see operating margin growth beyond 35%? And specifically, where do you think the upper bound of operating margin expansion is? Is above 40% realistic here? And then also, can you comment specifically on the contribution of the manufacturing initiative in future years? And then really fast, sorry, just a follow-up on APOQUEL. You mentioned you plan to exceed $300 million, can you provide any detail on timelines for that? Is that a 2017 event? Thank you.
Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.: So, in terms of the $300 million, I'll take that question first, that is a 2017 event. Exceeding the $300 million is baked in to our projection for 2017. In terms of operating margin, so we're not targeting a specific operating margin going forward. We're really focused on income generation and cash generation, and that is our focus. However, when you look at what we articulate as our long-term strategy, the ability to grow revenue at a faster pace than our costs, that definitely does lead to increased margins as we move forward. And in terms of the benefit that we expect to get from the supply network strategy moving forward, so we have articulated and we're still committed to, by 2020, we do expect to achieve an extra 200 basis points improvement in our margin from that strategy. So, when you take all of those factors together, that definitely leads to improved margin. But again, our focus is on cash generation.
Operator: And the next question comes from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Unknown Speaker: Good morning. This is Jonathan (41:21) on the call for Jami. So, if protein prices continue to fall and are sustained at lower levels as a result of your cyclical factors, would that potentially cause you to revise your expectations, particularly in cattle and swine? And a second question, some of your competitors have cited challenges in their dairy segment, and given that you discuss cattle as a consolidated figure, I was hoping that you could comment on trends seen in that particular group? And further, can you elaborate on the progress of the SKU rationalization program and when that will begin tapering off, and whether you will see operational growth in U.S. livestock remain positive, net of these rationalizations? Thank you.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you for your questions. Hi, Jonathan (42:02). Let me start with the comment on the protein pricing and how this can be affecting our business. So, we have seen that these prices are going up and down, it is part of cycles that has been affecting our industry for decades. And we have been managing that very well, this situation. We saw prices going down for poultry, and then the next cycle, going up. It always depend on the supply. The demand continue growing, and it is something that will help the industry to continue generating more revenues. We don't think that the current situation is specifically negative. It's something that we expect that there will be a reverse in the near future. And we will see that this is not having a negative impact in our projections. And, again, so this industry (43:11) has been very predictable and showing steady growth, even in situations with significant negative factors, including the drought or even including the economic crisis in 2008, the animal health industry was probably one of the few industries showing growth in this negative environment. Dairy, we have seen that the prices of dairy has been down significantly at the beginning of the year. Now these prices are recovering, and very important is that we have not seen any reduction of a herd in terms of cows, which is an indication that producers are still keeping the animals to ensure that they will be able to supply market demands in the next cycle. So, we expect also dairy having a positive trend in 2017. And then, Glenn will talk about the SKU rationalization.
Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.: In terms of the SKU rationalization, we are essentially complete with that program. However, we did have some sales of these products in Q1 and Q2 of 2016. That does pose a challenge in the comparative for 2017. We estimate that impact to be about 1% for 2017 and more disproportionately weighted to the first half of the year.
Operator: The next question comes from John Kreger with William Blair. Please go ahead.
John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks very much. Glenn, can you expand a bit more on the supply chain optimization plan? You've talked in the past about a couple hundred basis points goal, but could you maybe just lay out a little more specifically, the timeline and the strategy to get there? And then secondly can you give us an update on how the livestock antibiotic portfolio did in the quarter? Thanks.
Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.: So, in terms of the supply chain optimization, there are a number of sites that we're still in the process of divesting or changing our strategy in three sites essentially that will need to ship product from one site to another. That occurs over time. So the progression of that 200 basis points improvement that we talked about through 2020 will come over a number of years. You'll see that in 2018, 2019, and 2020. It won't be an automatic shift. It's based on the timing of shifting the products of the – from those three plants. In terms of livestock antibiotic growth year-to-date, we are seeing positive growth year-to-date in those products. There are some shifts with M&A – within MFA. But overall, our antibiotics are growing year-to-date.
Operator: And we'll take the next question from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Frank DiLorenzo - BMO Capital Markets: Good morning. This is Frank DiLorenzo on behalf of Alex. Thanks for taking my call. Regarding business development, will management continue to look towards small opportunities such as the recent Scandinavian Micro Biodevices deal, or are you willing to consider larger deals. Also along those lines, are there any particular areas of interest that you are focusing on? Thanks.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: So, we are not limiting our target in terms of M&A to small acquisitions. What we are targeting is a business that will support our strategy and also will create value. And I think we have significant experience in integrating companies. We think that any acquisition that is supported by the strategy and the value creation will generate synergies in terms of costs and also revenues. We are also defining what are the areas of interest for M&A. We will continue assessing opportunities in our core business. But also, we will consider in diagnostics also in genetics, and in devices, as a way to complement our portfolio and maximize the already existing infrastructure that we have that we will be using these products also to deliver even higher value to our customers.
Operator: We'll go next to Kathy Miner with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Kathy M. Miner - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you, good morning. Two questions, first on APOQUEL, I think you've talked in the past that the APOQUEL sales have been largely three-quarters U.S. and one quarter O-U.S. How has that shifted and how do you see that trending going forward? And also on APOQUEL, are you able to tell us how many dogs in the U.S. have been treated with APOQUEL so far? And then secondly just a broader question on pricing trends, as you look into 2017, can you remind us what you're pricing expectations are, both U.S. and O-U.S. and whether there's been any change from 2016? Thank you.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Let me start with the comment on prices. So, on prices, we are consistent also with the animal health projections. And the animal health projections is growing prices 2% to 3%. And this has been always very consistent in the past, and we'll continue applying this 2% to 3% in our projections. And we expect that 2017 also will be in line with these percentages. Not too big difference in terms of U.S. or international. The only difference in some international markets with high inflation rates, the price increases can be higher and in line with this inflation. You also asked about the use of APOQUEL in the U.S. mainly. And well, so far, until very recently, the use of APOQUEL has been mostly focused on chronic. We have seen already in this quarter that it's already APOQUEL in the U.S., which is where we have more recent market research. The use has been also extended to seasonal and chronic and acute. And we expect also this to continue not only in the U.S., but also in the international markets. And we are very confident that the expansion of the products will be driven by the use in all the different categories; chronic, acute and seasonal. You also asked about what is the division of APOQUEL U.S.-international. Well, this quarter, on the $70 million, $40 million came from the U.S. and $30 million international. This is something that is probably not representative of the full potential of international and the U.S. What we can also show in the market through market research is that the new patients is growing constantly in the U.S., which is very positive, and we expect that this will continue. And if the results of the pilot is showing positive for the DTC that we are testing in the U.S., then we expect that this will be also accelerating the use of APOQUEL in the U.S. As you know, not in all markets that DTC is available because there are some restrictions in terms of regulatory for direct-to-consumer advertising in many markets in the world.
Operator: And we'll take a follow-up from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Unknown Speaker: Hi. Thanks. This is Mike (51:10) on for Derik just with a quick follow up. In the last couple of months there's been a lot of movements in the competitive landscape with companies moving ahead with proposed asset swaps, some divestitures. Can you talk a little bit about how have you seen any change in the competitive landscape, if you've been able to gain any share, and especially in the last quarter there was a lot of mixed results from competitors, particularly in companion animal in the U.S. Some promotional changes with flea and tick; can you just talk about if you've been able to capitalize on any of those disruptions in the market?
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Well, let me start saying that we believe that we have the best portfolio in animal health industry in both companion animal and livestock. We have significant new products launch recently, and also very important our R&D investment in our current portfolio is also showing very positive results. So, we don't think that the consolidation of the industry that will be taking place from now until the end of the year will change that significantly the competitive landscape. We compete not on a global basis, but also on a country basis and also on species basis. And there are not too significant difference because of this consolidation. So, we are very confident that we remain very competitive, and the products that we are introducing and also this report in terms of promotional activities and R&D and even manufacturing quality and delay of supply will help us to maintain and expand our market share.
Operator: And it does appear we have no further questions at this time. I will return the floor to you, Juan Ramón for any additional or closing remarks.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: So, thank you very much for joining us today. And as we said, we reported very strong results in the quarter. We are very confident on the projections that we are making for 2016 and 2017. And we'll connect again in the next earnings release. So, thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And this will conclude today's teleconference. A replay of today's call will be available in two hours by dialing 800-839-1320 for U.S. listeners and 402-220-0488 for international. Please disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.

Steve Frank - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you, operator. Good morning and welcome to the Zoetis second quarter 2016 earnings call. I am joined today by Juan Ramón Alaix, our Chief Executive Officer; and Paul Herendeen, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statement in today's press release and our SEC filings, including, but not limited to, our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q. Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables of our earnings press release and in the company's 8-K filing dated today, August 3, 2016, and also in the slides accompanying this presentation that are available on the Investor Relations page of our website, zoetis.com. With that, I will turn the call over to Juan Ramón.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you, Steve, and good morning everyone. Our performance this quarter once again demonstrates why we have confidence in the consistency and the predictability of our results and why we are the leader in the animal health industry. True to our diverse business model, we continue generating result from many different sources, both in the U.S. and international markets and across different species and therapeutic areas; and our portfolio help us deliver steady results over the long-term despite some economic and market challenges that exist. Our R&D investment is maintaining a high level of productivity with new products like SIMPARICA as well as lifecycle innovation and market expansions for key product lines such as DRAXXIN, VANGUARD and VERSICAN Plus. We also combine this internal investment with external partnerships and opportunities with products like SILEO, the new noise aversion medicine we are marketing for dogs in the U.S. In addition to sales and innovation, we are demonstrating our leadership in the animal health industry with the profitability and performance of our operations. We have been executing on the operational efficiency program we announced last year; and we are on track to deliver more than $300 million dollars in savings and an adjusted EBIT margin of 34% by the end of 2017. We believe this achievement in efficiency and profitability is unparallel in the animal health industry. Looking more closely at our second quarter results, operational revenue was up 6%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. As you will recall, this year our revenue growth and focus will continue to reflect the impact from changes related to the operational efficiency program we put in place in 2015. Those SKU rationalization and business changes in countries like Venezuela and India continue to partially offset more significant gains in our core business. Excluding these impacts and the impacts of acquisitions, our normalized organic operational growth will be 9%; and on the same basis, our companion animal products grew 15% and our livestock products grew 5%. Paul will provide more details on the bridge from reported to normalized organic operational growth in his remarks. The growth in companion animal was based on the strong performance by APOQUEL, as well as our recently launched vaccines and SIMPARICA. In livestock, we saw growth coming from a recovery of cattle business in the U.S. In swine, the positive performance from the International segment was offset by a decline in the U.S. And in poultry, we declined globally due to market conditions and pressure from competition. We are improving our cost of sales and gross margin as we refine our manufacturing network, execute our efficiency plan and focus on continuous improvement. On an operational basis, our adjusted operating expenses were flat in the second quarter, even as we grew revenues significantly; thanks to the ownership and mindset of our colleagues and expense management discipline. The growth in revenues, gross margin improvement and discipline on expenses resulted in adjusted net income growth of 22% operationally; once again, supporting our long-term and value proposition to grow adjusted net income faster than revenue. We always emphasize a full year view of our business to account for some of the seasonal fluctuation and timing patterns in animal health; and we continue to see good progress through that lens. We're increasing our guidance for 2016 based on our strong performance in the first half of the year, the continued strength of our business model and the confidence in our outlook for the rest of the year. Paul will go through updated to 2016 guidance in his remarks. Now let me turn to the innovation investment that are fueling our performance this year and positioning us well for the future value creation. At the beginning of the year, I said we needed to execute flawlessly on our new product launches; and I'm very pleased with our progress. In the case of APOQUEL, it has become a very positive story. For the first half of 2016, we have exceeded $100 million in revenue; until May, we have been supplying APOQUEL with no restrictions. Recently, we have launched in additional markets such as Brazil, Japan, Mexico and Russia; and in the coming months, we plan to introduce APOQUEL in the rest of the approved markets such as Colombia, Peru, and Uruguay, as well as Singapore and Hong Kong. SIMPARICA, our new oral parasiticide for dogs is now available to customers in U.S. and most of the European countries; and we expect it to be further deployed in Canada, Brazil and New Zealand during 2016. We are pleased with the launch of SIMPARICA, despite being the most recent entrant in a very competitive oral flea and tick market for dogs. At launch, SIMPARICA was introduced with extensive published data, showing its rapid onset of action, its sustained persistence of protection against fleas and ticks and other advantages over various oral and topical parasiticides on the market. While new products have been a big lift for us recently, we continue to build on our major established product lines and focus on the lifecycle innovation that will keep our portfolio strong and sustainable. One of the strengths of our R&D organization is ability to innovate across the phases of care that veterinarians encounter; phases that includes prediction, prevention and treatment. Our R&D begins with an understanding of the biology of the diseases, their pathways and how they work. Then, we complement that with customer insights that come from our commercial teams working shoulder to shoulder with veterinarians and producers; and we apply this knowledge across the phases of healthcare. We use innovations in genetics, diagnostics and increasingly digital platforms to help predict risks or detect diseases in species. This means the ability to breed healthier and more productive animals, to detect disease earlier and to develop practices informed by bioinformatics and digital applications that capitalize on the use of big data. In the second quarter, for example, we continue to expand our business diagnostic franchise into new markets with an additional approval in Spain for livestock test kits. These point-of-care test kits deliver accurate, fast and clear results that give the customers timely and informed diagnosis without disrupting their clinical consultation. Our customers are also seeking for new solutions to get ahead and help prevent infectious diseases. We have been placing a greater emphasis on our vaccine portfolio, some of which we introduced last year and others that we continue to expand in terms of approvals and geographies. For example, in the second quarter, we expanded our VERSICAN Plus and the VANGUARD vaccine franchises with new approvals in Europe and Canada. VERSICAN Plus, a combination of vaccines that protect dogs against 10 canine diseases was first approved in European Union in 2014; and this quarter, we received additional approvals in the United Kingdom, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands for a smaller combination of the vaccine. Additionally, VERSICAN Plus Rabies achieved approval for a new claim in European Union three years duration of immunity. Meanwhile VANGUARD B Oral and VANGUARD crLyme vaccines were approved in Canada after having just received their U.S. approval in December 2015. And finally, across the phases of healthcare, we develop medicines to treat sick animals. DRAXXIN, one of the Zoetis' largest global product lines and was first introduced in 2015 (sic) [2005]; and this quarter, we received approval of a new label claim in Europe for DRAXXIN and DRAXXIN 25, an injectable anti-infective for treating swine respiratory disease. In addition to our internal R&D, we also look for partners that can help broaden and strengthen our product portfolio. For example, in May, Zoetis launched in the U.S. a product called SILEO under an exclusive agreement with Orion Corporation. SILEO is the first and only medication approved by the FDA for treatment of noise aversion in dogs. And if you were in the U.S. this July 4, you probably read about or heard about this exciting new product that brought hope to many dog owners. In summary, we have continued our positive momentum through the first half of the year based on the strength of our U.S. portfolio and dedicated Zoetis colleagues. We continue to reap the benefits of a productive, world-class R&D organization focused on new products and lifecycle innovation across our approximately 300 products lines. And we are executing on key product launches and our operational efficiency program to ensure our long-term growth and value creation. With that, let me turn things over to Paul. Paul?
Paul S. Herendeen - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you, Juan Ramón. Another solid quarter with lots of good things to cover, so let's get to it, starting with a quick walk down the P&L for the quarter. Then, I'll provide some commentary on a number of areas that I believe will be helpful to understanding our quarter, our first half of 2016 and what you might expect for the balance of 2016. Before I start, I want to point out that the SKU rationalization and the changes in business models we made in several international countries continue to have an impact on our revenue in 2016 and growth in revenue for 2016 compared with 2015. First, we're confident that the steps that we took and are taking to improve efficiency will put Zoetis in a position to deliver higher profits and cash flows and to better grow those profits and cash flows from here forward. Second, while we're going through this transition, we believe it's important that we and you have visibility into how to the go-forward portion of our business is performing. So we prepared analyses that strictly eliminated SKUs out of our revenue to show the underlying growth of the go-forward business. On our website, you'll see slides and you'll find a table – or tables rather that show our reported revenue growth for the second quarter and for the first half of 2016; and then walk you through the impacts of foreign currency, the operational efficiency changes related to SKUs and other business model changes, recent M&A; and in the case of the year-to-date charts, the extra days in our first quarter relative to the prior year. The objective here is not to divert attention from the reported revenue growth rates; it's to provide perspective on how you might think about our future growth prospect in our to-be state. While we use the phrase operational growth, that means excluding the impact of changes in FX rate versus the same period in the prior year; when we say normalized organic growth for any period compared with the prior year period, that means excluding the impact of FX, the eliminated SKUs, the business changes outside the U.S., the extra days in the first quarter of the year and the impact of recent M&A. So with that lengthy preamble, let's talk about the quarter. Revenue grew 6% on an operational or constant currency basis. We posted an adjusted gross margin of 67.9% in the quarter, resulting in adjusted gross profit growing faster than revenue; up 11% on an operational basis. Adjusted operating expenses were flat on an operational basis, reflecting the great progress we've made on our efficiency initiative. As Juan Ramón said, we're on track to deliver more than the previously announced $300 million in savings associated with the efficiency initiative; and those savings are considered in our guidance for 2017. The combination of 11% operational growth of adjusted gross profit and the flat adjusted operating expenses enabled us to grow adjusted EBIT for the quarter by 25% on an operational basis. Below the operating line, we had higher interest expense and higher effective tax rate on adjusted income, which together reduced the operational growth rate of adjusted net income to 22%. We put adjusted earnings per share of $0.49 on the board for the quarter. And the strong performance in the first half of the year enabled us to increase our guidance for the full year 2016 by 3% – excuse me, $0.03 per share across the range; a solid quarter and a solid first half of the year for sure. So a bit deeper dive on revenue. The star of the quarter geographically was the U.S., up 10%, and by global business it was companion animal, up 13%; and both of those are on an operational basis. Of course, APOQUEL was an important driver of both. APOQUEL sales in the quarter were roughly $60 million. APOQUEL has a lot of revenue growth still ahead. And with SIMPARICA and a number of other recently introduced companion animal products, we expect our companion animal business to drive above market revenue growth through 2017. Our International segment was up 2% operationally, and the global livestock business grew about 1% operationally. Both were disproportionately impacted by our SKU reductions and the changes we made to our operating models in countries, including Venezuela and India. On the flipside, global livestock is benefiting from M&A, mostly PHARMAQ. Now let's talk about the components of our operational revenue growth of 6% in the quarter. APOQUEL accounted for 3% of that growth. New products other than APOQUEL, including our new companion animal vaccines, SIMPARICA, SYNOVEX ONE and SILEO, to name a few, added 2%. In-line products added 4%, with 3% coming from increased prices and 1% for volume; and M&A accounted for another 2%. The impact of the SKU reductions and the changes in business models reduced our growth by some 500 basis points; and that gets you to the 6% operational revenue growth for the quarter. Pretty good, right? Once again, our revenue growth came from a number of sources and reflects the strength of our diverse business model. Let's turn to our two segments, U.S. and International, starting with the U.S. Overall, the U.S. business was up 10% in the quarter. On a normalized organic basis, the U.S. grew 11% in the quarter. U.S. companion animal business was up 17% mainly due to the ramp of APOQUEL, the launch of SIMPARICA and the introduction of other new products. Half of the growth was driven by the ramp of APOQUEL. U.S. livestock grew 2% with a 4% pick up from increased selling prices that were offset in part by volume decreases related to some of the SKU reductions. On a normalized organic basis, the U.S. livestock business delivered growth of 5%, compared to a 9% decline in Q1 of this year. The business rebounded nicely in Q2 and the year-to-date normalized organic growth rate for the U.S. livestock business was negative 3%. After the first quarter, there was some concern out there about the health of our U.S. livestock business. For the avoidance of doubt, after a slow start, we expect our U.S. livestock business to deliver growth for the full year 2016 on a normalized organic basis. Within U.S. livestock, cattle, especially beef cattle, was particularly strong as the herd size and placements in feedlots were increasing and drove higher demand for our high-value injectable anti-infectives, vaccines, parasiticides and the recently launched SYNOVEX ONE implants. U.S. swine products experienced a decline due to competition for Fostera PCV vaccines, new restrictions on the use of some of our products for pork exports to China, a decline of PEDv revenue as the disease is no longer prevalent and some eliminated SKUs. U.S. poultry revenue declined in the quarter with the impact of SKU rationalization more than offsetting growth from the increased use of our health maintenance products and MFAs for antibiotic flea production; products like Zoamix, for example. On to the International segment, revenue from our International segment was up 2% operationally. On a normalized organic basis, the growth rate was 7%. On the same normalized organic basis, the international companion animal business led the way, up 10%, while international livestock was up 5% in the quarter; again, both of those are on a normalized organic basis. It's worth spotlighting a few countries for you. China was up $14 million or 49% operationally. Pork prices in China were relatively high leading to favorable conditions for pork producers and for our swine portfolio, including products like DRAXXIN, EXCEDE and our vaccines. About one-third of the growth in China was driven by products purchased by producers to stock up ahead of label changes for some of our products. Finally, we had a very successful spring promotion that drove increased sales of our REVOLUTION and DECTOMAX products in China. In Brazil, cattle and companion animal sales were strong, but partially offset by a weakness in poultry. The cattle portion of livestock in Brazil enjoyed favorable market conditions, leading to strong performance from our vaccines and parasiticides. We also saw increased adoption of IMPROVAC in the swine business. Across the portfolio, we also benefited from increased selling prices. The poultry business saw high input prices and increased restrictions on exportation to Japan that made for a challenging market for poultry producers and saw us lose a few accounts based on price. For the quarter, Brazil grew 6% operationally. Australia posted a solid 10% operational growth for the quarter, led by the launch of APOQUEL, the success of a promotional campaign for REVOLUTION and sales of anti-infectives for cattle. On the negative side of the growth ledger, in the UK, we saw our sales decline 21% operationally. The biggest factor, nearly half the decline was due to weather. A wet winter to spring delayed the cattle sheep turnout seasons; and that was a factor. The second quarter was also negatively impacted as we were in the process of shifting the acquired Abbott products to our distribution and we saw the channel accelerate purchases into Q1 and work off the inventory in Q2. Year-to-date, the UK business is up 3% operationally. Finally, the grouping in other emerging countries declined 5% operationally with the biggest drags being Venezuela and the SKU reductions. We saw growth across most of the countries in this grouping, including through the addition of PHARMAQ revenue in Chile. So on revenue, high level, the beat goes on. Growth from many sources in a diversified model that enables us to overcome softness in parts of our business with strength in other areas. Now let's shift to the rest of the P&L. We posted a high gross margin, 67.9% in the second quarter. But before we all start high-fiving each other, let's look at the factors that led to the 250 basis point improvement over the prior year quarter. Of the improvement, roughly a third came from price increases; a third from a mix shift toward the high-margin companion animal products; and a third came from other areas, mostly improvements in our supply chain efficiency. These three net positives experienced a bit of a headwind due to unfavorable foreign currency. Our gross margin has been improving, but it's not a one-way ratchet and there are some seasonal elements that we expect to come into play in the second half of 2016. For example, sales of our livestock products are greater as a percentage of total revenue in the second half of the year; and pricing promotions heading into the fall can lessen our net selling prices and thereby reduce gross margins in the period. These factors are expected to result in our reporting lower gross margins in the second half of the year as compared with the first half. And finally, there's, of course, FX. Predicting the timing and magnitude of FX changes on the cost of goods sold and on gross margin in short periods is very difficult. So that's a lot of discussion designed to caution you about assuming that our guidance for adjusted cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue for 2016 and 2017 are conservative. There's good news here. We fully expect our gross margin to continue to improve over time based on increased selling prices, increased sales from our companion animal products versus livestock and increased efficiency on our supply chain. But the upward journey will not be linear quarter to quarter. Turning to adjusted operating expenses. There is really not a lot to say except that we're on track to take out more than our target of $300 million of operating cost by year-end, so we enter 2017 in our new leaned out state. Total adjusted operating expenses were flat on an operational basis when compared to Q2 of 2015. Note that our operating expense base is not static. We've added costs, selling, marketing and R&D to the base via the PHARMAQ acquisition and to support the launch of SIMPARICA and we may consider investing in promotion of certain key products or incremental R&D. The purpose of the efficiency initiative was to eliminate non-productive expenditures, not to ignore high-value investments we can make in our business. At this stage, our to-be operating expense structure is what you see in our 2017 guidance table. We continue to demonstrate excellent expense discipline through the second quarter, and that combined with the gross margin improvement enabled us to post operational growth of adjusted EBIT of 25% for the quarter. Below the operating line, we had increased interest expense due to the note issuance in Q4 that funded the PHARMAQ acquisition and pre-funded the $400 billion of debt that matured in the first quarter of the year. And our effective tax rate on adjusted income increased by some 100 basis points, mostly due to the change in our tax status in Belgium. Bottom line, our adjusted net income grew operationally 22% and our adjusted earnings per share grew 23% operationally, about 100 basis points faster than adjusted net income, as our fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding in Q2 2016 were almost 1% less than in Q2 of 2015. Couple of additional factors, I think, that you need to think about for the balance of 2016 and into 2017. First, as always, FX. While there has been a bit of volatility in FX rates recently, notably with the British pound and the euro, the FX impact on the balance of our year and into 2017 is little changed from our last guidance update. The overall impact on our future expectations for our International operations, based on FX rates, in late July are negligible. That said, FX rates had a negative impact on our reported revenue and profit rates, decreasing revenue growth in Q2 by some 300 basis points compared with Q2 of 2015 and adjusted net income growth by some 800 basis points. Contrast that with a 700-basis-point drag on reported revenue growth in Q1 and a 1,300-basis-point drag on adjusted net income in Q1. So as we had hoped on the last call, the impact of FX rates on our reported growth is moderating. Regardless, we continue to measure ourselves on a constant currency or operational basis. Next, the SKU reductions, including the changes we made to our business models in places like Venezuela and India. As we communicated on our last call, we expect the SKU reductions and business changes to decrease revenue growth by some 500 basis points for the full year 2016. In Q1, the impact was roughly 400 basis points; in Q2, it was roughly 500 basis points; and year-to-date, it was roughly 500 basis points. I'll point out, there's a little bit of rounding in there. You can see the impact of the SKU reductions in business model changes on the revenue growth in the charts that are on our website that I mentioned earlier; and I call your attention to those. I think they're helpful. On to one-time costs, I won't use this time to walk through the table in the press release, but want to call your attention to a contra expense item from the reversal of a portion of our severance accrual. At the time we recorded the accrual, we based it on the best information available. As it's worked out, we expect to pay out a little bit less in severance than we had thought, mainly due to a greater level of voluntary attrition than expected. From a cash out the door perspective that's a good thing for us. For the avoidance of doubt, the reversal did not increase our adjusted net income, but it did increase our reported GAAP net income in the quarter and was a factor in narrowing the gap between adjusted earnings and Generally Accepted Accounting Principle earnings. Finally, on to guidance. Today, we're updating our guidance for the full year of 2016 for a couple of things. We've increased our revenue guidance range by $25 million to reflect the strength of our business and our improved visibility now that we're through the first half of 2016. And we moved our expectations for adjusted cost of goods sold as a percent of revenue from a range of 33% to 34%, to approximately 33%, so the favorable end of the range. Adjusted EBIT projections have improved in a similar fashion, so that's been updated too. We also updated our one-time costs to reflect the lower expectations for the severance point I just talked about. All other categories remain the same and the result is that we've raised our guidance range for 2016 adjusted earnings per share by $0.03 to the range of $1.86 to $1.93 per share. Note that the operational growth rate for adjusted net income implied by our guidance increased by 100 basis points and is now a range of 10% to 14%. The majority of the increase in our guidance is operational, not FX-related. Now, we can all do the math into what our guidance implies for the second half of the year for adjusted net income per share and you may think that that outlook is anomalous, given the second half revenue is expected to exceed revenue in the first half of the year. Here are a couple of observations about the phasing of our business in 2016. First, we do expect second half revenues to exceed the first half, that's a good start. However, as I mentioned earlier, we expect to generate lower gross margins in the second half of the year than seen in the first half due to mix and promotional programs reducing net selling prices and, therefore, gross margins. Next, our major promotional spending and operating expenses in support of our various product franchises are more weighted to the back half of the year. And finally, our R&D spending also skews to the second half of the year. Generally, the benefits of the increased sales expected in the second half of the year compared with the first may be more than offset by reduced gross margins, and the phasing of spending on promotional programs and R&D. So you all know I don't like to talk about quarters, but here are a couple of tips for phasing Q3 and Q4 2016. We expect Q4 to be our highest revenue quarter. We expect gross margins in the second half to be below those in Q1 and Q2. Selling expenses are expected to be heavier in the second half of the year, particularly heavy in Q4; and R&D spending in the second half is expected to be higher than the first half and heaviest in Q4. From adjusted net income perspective, Q3 may be the low quarter for the year. What's the most important is that we raised our full year 2016 guidance at revenue by $25 million and at adjusted earnings per share by $0.03. This is all good stuff. Our guidance for 2017 is unchanged. We expect a more detailed look at 2017 at the time we report our third quarter. That's it from me. Keith, let's go ahead and queue up the Q&A.
Operator: We will take our first question from Louise Chen with Guggenheim. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Louise Chen - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could give us more color on why you think livestock sales should continue to improve in second half 2016, especially since some of your competitors posted disappointing livestock sales this quarter? Thanks.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Well, livestock is a combination of many species. Let's start with cattle and let's start with cattle in the U.S. Cattle in the U.S. have two different segments, beef and dairy. In beef, we have seen that the number of animals, it's larger than the previous year by 3%. In the second quarter also we saw that the number of placement in the feedlot increased by 5%. On the total year, we expect that the number of animals will be about 3% higher than 2015; and also the placement on the feedlot during the second half will be lower than in the second quarter we expect also to grow by about 3%. With all this, we expect that the cattle business for beef in the U.S. will be positive. We have seen also improvement in Australia because of the weather conditions. We have seen also that the fundamentals of the Brazilian remains very strong with even increasing exportations. So in our opinion, the cattle business for beef will be positive for the year. Dairy, prices are having a negative impact in the profitability of farmers around the world. In the U.S., we expect that the business will not be – or revenues coming from dairy will not be a significant driver of growth; although we have seen also that so far farmers are not reducing the number of animals, so which is also a good indication that they also expect improvement in pricing in the second half or first half of 2017. Swine, and for us as we said, in the international business is doing extremely well. We expect this trend to continue in the second half. In the U.S., we are facing some competitive challenge that we also expect to start solving in the fourth (sic) [fourth quarter 2016] and first quarter of 2017. And poultry is the area in where we expect probably less positive evolution for our portfolio. But, in general, we expect that livestock at the end of the year will be showing a positive growth.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from John Kreger with William Blair. Please go ahead.
John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks very much. Juan Ramón, can you talk about longer term goals that you've got for SIMPARICA and SILEO? How do you think those products over time will end up sizing compared to APOQUEL? Thanks.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Well, we expect SIMPARICA being a key product in our portfolio. And we think that SIMPARICA and SIMPARICA also as a platform for adding new products into the parasiticide franchise will be an important product. We mentioned that we expect this product to generate more than $100 million. Based on the current trends of the market switching more into oral and moving away from topicals will represent a higher opportunity for SIMPARICA. For SIMPARICA, we also are implementing our approach in lifecycle innovation from the very beginning. So we expect also to increase or to improve the label of SIMPARICA very soon with new ticks and also new indications and using SIMPARICA as a platform to combine the active ingredient of SIMPARICA with other active ingredients that will extend the protection of dogs for any type of parasiticide. We will be also working on how to use SIMPARICA active ingredient also to develop products for cats. So, overall, we consider that SIMPARICA as a platform will be a very strong product in our portfolio. SILEO, it's a product that – it's showing that why we are the product of choice in the animal health industry. It's also combining our internal effort with external collaborations. We obtained the license from SILEO from Orion Corporation for the U.S. And SILEO got very good support in terms of communication at the time of the launch. And it will not be a large product in our portfolio, but it's adding solutions to our customers and definitely it's increasing the relevance of Zoetis in terms of providing any type of needs to our customers.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Jon Block with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Jon Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great, guys. Maybe I can slip in two quick ones. SIMPARICA, you just mentioned the label expansion. What about plans for a DTC similar to what we've seen from some of the competitive offerings. And then if so, on the DTC, Paul, is that embedded into some of that promotion expenses that you mentioned in the back half of the year? And then also, if I can just ask one on APOQUEL. I think you threw out $60 million versus $50 million last quarter. What do you feel like inventory looks like in the channel, people who were sort of trying to horde or stockpile that in the early days? Thanks, guys.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Let me start with SIMPARICA and then I will ask Paul to answer on the APOQUEL question. So definitely we see SIMPARICA as a strong candidate for DTC promotion. But we also we want to make sure that the product has enough penetration in the market to benefit for this type of investment. And we'll consider this opportunity when we have the product well established in the U.S. market, and we expect that to be in 2017. In terms of APOQUEL, I will ask Paul to answer the question on the inventory channel.
Paul S. Herendeen - Zoetis, Inc.: Sure. And I'll come back and hit the DTC question as well. With respect to APOQUEL and the channel, I think we saw a much more normalized pull-through of APOQUEL in Q2 than we had in Q1. Anybody that wants APOQUEL can get it now. They can order what they want. And so, we're starting to see a more normalized or a matching between our revenues and the products that are moving out through the various clinics where it's been stocked. You hit it right on the head. I mean, earlier when people were not quite convinced that we've put the supply chain issues behind us, people were hording it or holding it in the office to ensure they had supply. But that is, from our perspective, less and now you're seeing normal stocking and pull-through of the product. There may be pockets where it's still there, but much more normalized; and we're excited about prospects for APOQUEL. With respect to DTC, and if you think about DTC for potentially two products, it's APOQUEL and it could be SIMPARICA, I'd just say that within our guidance or within our OpEx guidance for 2016 and 2017, there are dollars allocated for promotional programs, including DTC. I think when I talk about – and during my prepared remarks, not ignoring opportunities to invest and say, we made assumptions about the level of promotional spend against all of our product franchises. And it's currently embedded within our guidance for 2016 and 2017 to the extent that we see great returns from certain promotional activities, we may well increase them in the future. But for now, they're baked in.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Let me add one comment of APOQUEL. And in APOQUEL, we have seen that most of the use of the product has been in chronic conditions. Now the effort of our people, it's really to promote the product to expand also the use to acute indication. That is something that we are confident that over time the opportunity of APOQUEL will continue growing.
Paul S. Herendeen - Zoetis, Inc.: Yeah. As long as you went there. Some great statistics that I think are helpful, but people think about APOQUEL and the potential for APOQUEL, whether it's in the U.S. or outside. If you take the universe of itchy dogs, over half of itchy dogs are considered acute. They have average treatment days of a couple of weeks. And so, on a percentage of the market basis, it's not great, but there is a lot of opportunity for us there. And of course the thought is the next largest group in terms of a percentage are the seasonal itchy dogs and then the smallest is the chronic. About 20% are chronic; it's a little less than 20% are chronic. And, of course, our view is that when you have an acute situation and you bring a dog is there's that opportunity where that dog can get excellent relief from using a product like APOQUEL. And to the extent that it turns out that that dog has seasonal issues, then, well, it can move into a different category. So there is a lot of opportunity here for us. We started off by really focusing on that slightly less than 20% of the market that was in the chronic category, albeit when they go on to therapy, they go on for a large number of days. I'll stop there.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Erin Wilson with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Erin Wilson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): All right. Thanks. On your restructuring, SKU rationalization, overall cost structure initiatives, how should we think about the quarterly progression throughout the year? What would you – or would you say you're running ahead of plan? What were you able to accomplish in the quarter and what's left to do on that front? And then my second question is on capital deployment. Can you just sort of outline your near term and longer term priorities there, particularly as cash flow builds heading into next year? What is your guidance also assuming in the way of share repurchases? And if I can ask just a really quick housekeeping question – if you haven't broken it out yet, the U.S. sales and International sales of APOQUEL? Thanks.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Okay. So I will answer the first question on – I think it was a question on APOQUEL? But let me – did you ask...
Paul S. Herendeen - Zoetis, Inc.: It was the restructuring process.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Restructuring. Okay. So let me cover that. So we are ahead of our plans, and we mentioned that we expect that to generate more than $300 million. The initial target was $300 million. So also the good news is that we are ahead in the implementation and we'll generate in 2016 also higher savings than initially expected. In terms of the SKU rationalization, plans are in line with expectation. We have eliminated the majority of the SKUs now. There are still some few SKUs that we decided to keep until we have some other product that will be replacing these SKUs. So we'll minimize the impact of the reduction. And in terms of the plans that we included as divestment or exiting, we did almost all the work now. Countries that we changed the distribution model has been fully implemented. So we are definitely extremely pleased with all the progress that we made in this program. So, Paul, will talk about the capital deployment.
Paul S. Herendeen - Zoetis, Inc.: Yeah, I will take capital deployment. I think we continue to look for ways to invest our cash flow back in our business where we could earn the highest returns. Certainly to M&A and as we said pretty consistently, to the extent that there's not a better call on our cash flow within our business for M&A, then when will distribute it back to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We are currently purchasing shares at the rate of about 75 million a quarter. We have a program that runs through the balance of 2016; and we're obviously in the process of looking at 2017 and beyond and thinking through what we'll do there. But, Erin, you bring up a great point and it's something we talk about quite a bit. 2016, we don't really demonstrate through our quarter results the real cash-generating properties of our business. 2017 will be the first opportunity for the market to see in our reported results the ability of this company to generate significant free cash flow. And the reasons for that are the obvious ones that we're completing our standup from Pfizer, and that's been expensive and lengthy; we are completing – or generally completing the payments for implementing our efficiency initiative and we hope to put those behind us by the end of 2016. And so, when we enter 2017, you're going to see a much more normalized level of cash generation from this company. And as we generate that cash, we will stick to the model of looking for ways to deploy inside, outside in value-generative M&A. And last and certainly not least, in the form of our dividends and share repurchases.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Okay. So you also asked about sales for APOQUEL U.S./international. U.S. is about 75% of the total amount that we reported for the first half and 25% for international.
Erin Wilson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Is that the first half?
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: First half, yes.
Erin Wilson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Just so it's clear.
Operator: We'll take the next question from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets.
Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Good morning, folks, and congratulations on a strong quarter; and, Paul, thank you for the great visibility. Good stuff, as we like to say. Apologies if I missed this, but the tax rate was a little bit lower than we expected. I'm wondering if you could give us your updated thoughts there and if there's any updates regarding your longer term expectations? And just a follow-up on the capital allocation strategy, given current market demand for yield and is there an opportunity to kind of reevaluate share repurchases as opposed to more aggressive increase in your dividend, particularly given that as you just mentioned, your cash flow generation and predictability should improve after 2017? Thank you.
Paul S. Herendeen - Zoetis, Inc.: Sure. I'll start with the tax rate. Yeah. The tax rate was a little bit lower, but you should note we did not change our guidance for the full year 2016. Tax is a fun thing. It's like I talked about how difficult it can be to calculate or predict the impact of FX on your gross margin. Similarly, trying to forecast your tax rate by quarter or by half year, the longer the period you're forecasting, the more accurate you're going to be. It is entirely likely and possible that we'll see some discrete items in the second half of our year that would cause our tax rate to be higher in the second half than it would be in the first. Generally, what I want to report is, we've made excellent progress in managing our tax position in light of the challenge that was thrown at us by the European Commission in January of this year; and we feel good heading into 2017 that we'll be able to achieve the effective tax rate that we've guided to on adjusted pre-tax of roughly 30%. So I'll leave it at that. And I think your other question there was around dividend versus share repurchase and how do you think about that perhaps as you move into 2017 with a more normalized cash flow coming out of the company. Let me say it's something that we will more likely address in detail later in the year. As I said, as we go through the process of looking at 2017 in some detail and we'll come back to you. Just state that we intend to return to shareholder's, through dividends or share repurchases, capital that's not needed to invest productively within our business or for M&A. I know a lot of you would – we've been out in meetings to say do you have a personal preference for share repurchase versus dividend. Let's leave that discussion for the fall.
Operator: The next question comes from Jeff Holford with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Jeffrey Holford - Jefferies LLC: Hi. Thanks very much for taking my question. Just wanted to get a quick comment from the management team there, just where your barometer is right now on M&A and business development? Thanks very much.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: So we define that the first priority in terms of capital allocation is investing internally. We have a significant return on R&D, significant return on also the commercial activities. Second would be M&A. And, M&A, we consider a scenario that we will continue assessing any opportunity in the market and bringing to our company things that will enhance our core business or will complement our portfolio. We mentioned that diagnostics was an area that we entered some years ago, and we are committed to this area. And we will continue assessing and bringing additional opportunities to our diagnostic portfolio. Genetics is another area that we are already participating. We have seen that genetic is growing very fast in terms of genetic markets and also in terms of other areas that also will support the increase of productivity in livestock. Definitely, we'll be assessing the opportunities to participate in this broader market. And actually, we will consider how we can enhance our core portfolio in livestock, companion animal or aquaculture now that we are also participating in aquaculture. We use also business development to support our R&D efforts. And we will continue partnering with universities, also with biotech companies and other partners that will also support our R&D efforts.
Operator: The next question is from Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore ISI.
Volodymyr Nikolenko - Evercore Group LLC: Okay. Thank you for taking my question. It's Vlad Nikolenko on behalf of Mark Schoenebaum. First of all, congratulation with the quarter's strong performance, EBIT and EPS. It's very nice and (53:20) that. So the question will be about the guidance and longer term margins. So back in November 2014, the company issued the long-term guidance for the first time given target 34% operating margin in 2017. So I'm wondering – and since that day, they just never re-issued the longer term guidance and did not expand to further years. So wondering if you're planning to provide longer term guidance in the future or it was more like one-time event in advance of restructuring a month later. And if there is no long-term guidance, how should we think about operating margins going forward? And if you can also specifically and whether there is a limit for operating margin growth and whether you can specifically quantify contribution from the product gross margin growth due to ongoing supply network rationalization initiative? Thank you.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Thank you. Let me make a short comment on the guidance that we provided back in November 2014; and then I will pass to Paul on how we see this margin evolving over time. So the first thing, almost three years ago or two years-and-a-half after we made this projection, we are confirming that in 2017 we'll be improving or reaching that 34% EBIT margin. And moving from at that time 25% that was projected for the end of 2014 to 34%, it's a significant improvement. And I think it's probably the confirmation of the predictability and the sustainability of our business. I think there are not too many companies that after three years they can maintain what I consider of course an aggressive target of improving our margin by 900 basis points. Now I will turn to Paul to provide some additional comments.
Paul S. Herendeen - Zoetis, Inc.: Yeah, sure. And I want to be real clear. One, why did we provide long-term guidance? We provided that because we knew the steps that we were about to embark on would include the SKU rationalization, the change in business models outside the U.S. and a pretty substantial change in our OpEx base. And in light of that, outside parties trying to forecast what we would look like in 2016 and then in 2017, you would've had no chance to really be able to be somewhat accurate. And so, we felt compelled to provide longer term guidance to let people determine through their own models whether they were in the neighborhood of what we were thinking or they had a difference of opinion. I think that was a one-time event. We, like most other companies, are reverting to having just – will revert to having just one year worth of guidance on the Street. So we'll provide the update, as I mentioned, in my prepared remarks for 2017 later this year and then we'll have 2017 on the board. But I really want to focus on comments, Vlad, that you made around the 34% kind of operating EBIT margin – or excuse me, adjusted EBIT margin target that you referenced. Because I want to be really, really clear. We're not targeting a maximum operating margin. We're seeking to maximize our cash flow and grow it at a fast rate. If that's at a 33% margin, that's okay; if that's at a 36% margin, that's okay too, but it's not focusing solely on what is that margin and let's maximize that margin. We're looking at maximizing earnings as a proxy for cash flow and then growing it as quickly and for as long as we can at an attractive rate. Now, separately I believe you asked about is there an upper limit. One of the advantages of our company is that we have a wonderful global footprint where we have the scale to support that global footprint and generally – not completely, but generally, we have the ability to drive a lot more revenue on the infrastructure that we have deployed around the globe. So the answer is, yeah, we have the ability to continue to leverage our cost structure and thereby improve that operating margin. But what I don't want people to do is to focus on and say, a 33% or a 35% or – and look at that and say, well, gee, that's less than I thought. The goal is not to continue to drive that percentage; it's to maximize profit, cash flow, grow it and grow it fast and grow it for a long time. So I rambled a little bit there, but I hope I covered your question.
Operator: The next question comes from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Sorry. I was just coming off mute there. Thanks very much. I was just hoping for a bit of a higher level framework for where you are with the restructuring and reorganizing of Zoetis. My sense is that you're about two-thirds of the way done of rationalizing SKUs and rationalizing people and your SG&A, et cetera. But, obviously, it's different for the cost of goods sold line than the SG&A line. So I was hoping that you could just provide a little bit higher level framework for how far you are along with the rationalization and restructuring by cost line? Thank you.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: So thank you, Dave. Let me maybe provide a little bit more details on where I see we are in terms of our progress in terms of restructuring efforts. So I would say that all the efforts in terms of commercial and R&D are mostly completed. What we are still not fully finalized is related to some areas of G&A, mainly finance and IT, because this was also dependent on the implementation of SAP and we wanted to make sure that while we were transitioning to a different model – a more efficient model, we were ensuring the compliance of any type of finance, tax or IT elements. But we have no doubt that by the end of the year, all the programs will be in place and we'll start 2017 with a new base. In terms of SKUs, I said most of the work has been completed. And there are only some SKUs that we'll be eliminating from now until the end of the year; and this will be also with the introduction of new product that also will help us to minimize a negative impact of this last SKU rationalization. The other area that is still work in progress, but also progressing in line with expectations is the manufacturing changes. We exit the seven plants that we targeted. There is one plant that is still in progress, but five have been sold, one has been exited and the other one is in process. So in that area, things are progressing very well. There are some structural changes also in manufacturing that are a work in progress. And, again, so we plan to finalize this work by the end of the year and start 2017 with a full implemented plan for the operational efficiency program that we announced in 2015.
Operator: The next question is from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Unknown Speaker: This is Jonathan (01:02:05) on the line for Jami. Juan Ramón, your discussion on R&D productivity is encouraging, but if possible we'd like to receive greater transparency on what that means. We're expecting 5% to 6% of operational growth for the next five years. Can you help us parse out what contribution comes from same product, same indication sales growth through price and volume? And based on your expectations for R&D productivity, what contribution is expected from new products and label expansions that come from this investment? Thank you.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: The answer to this question in R&D is also answering how much are we allocating to new product innovation and how much we are allocating to lifecycle innovation. And we have actually buckets in our R&D expenses, one is related to regulatory expenses, about 15%; and then the other 85%, it's split between new product innovation and lifecycle innovation. So we are investing significantly to keep our current portfolio updated and competitive. So how much are we generating in terms of growth in-line compared to new products and price. So we describe that the animal health industry will be growing 5% to 6% in the next coming years. About half of these 5% to 6% will be related to price; and then in-line, we'll have half of the growth and new products have half of the remaining growth. The ability of Zoetis and other companies to grow faster than this 5% to 6% will come from new products. So, in 2016, excluding the impact of SKU rationalization, in the second quarter, this normalized operational growth is 9%. So how much came from the price? It was about 3% from price. New products also generated a significant part of this growth; and the in-line portfolio, it was growing volume by 1%. So the rest of the portfolio, APOQUEL generated 3 percentage points, other new products another 2 percentage points. So you see that the new products in the second quarter were generating about 500 basis points out of this 900 normalized organic operational growth. And that is what we also expect there for the future. For the future, we have communicated that we plan to grow in-line faster than market. In 2017, based in our guidance, we plan to grow faster than the market; and this faster growth will come from new product launches.
Operator: And the next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.
Chris Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Thanks for the questions. Just two quick ones here. First is on restructuring. To the extent that there are excess savings relative to your initial plan, should we think about those savings falling to the bottom line or are those likely to be reinvested in the business? And the second question was on China, you've had very strong growth for last couple of quarters. How much of this is near term in nature given some of the topics you described in the commentary versus sustainable step-up in growth in that part of the business? Thank you.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Well, let me start with the question on how much we plan to circulate the excess of the savings into our profits and how much we plan to reinvest. And the answer will be, if we see opportunities of reinvestment, these extra savings that will generate future of growth and future profitable growth, then always we will decide to reinvestment in areas that will create future higher value for all our shareholders. And if we'll have these opportunities, then these excess savings will go to our profits. In China...
Paul S. Herendeen - Zoetis, Inc.: Hold on, before you flip to China. Again, I want to make this point and it was in my prepared remarks, but it's an important point. Efficiency initiative was all about eliminating non-productive expenses. Those are expenses that don't drive value for our company. So to the extent that we eliminate those, the returns are awesome. It's the first thing anyone should do is eliminate non-productive investments in the business. That gives us the ability to consider investments that will produce outside returns back in our business. And so, it's a very important point. And, by the way, when we boarded on that efficiency initiative, we targeted the $300 million and we believe we're going to be able to deliver savings beyond that. This sort of activity is a continuous process. It doesn't start and end when we announced the program last year. This is something that we will continue on and we look for ways to eliminate those non-productive expenses; and you can have the choice of either having enhanced near term profitability or we may see opportunities to redeploy those funds in more productive areas. So I wanted to make that point. Do you want to talk about China?
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Yeah. In China, we see China as a country that will continue offering high opportunities for growth. We describe many times China as the largest producer of pork in the world. They have more than 600 million (pigs). Some of the statistics there are also indicating that they have 800 million of pigs; and still a lot of this production is not consolidated or is not highly sophisticated. And we expect that this will represent big opportunities for companies like Zoetis that can offer products that will increase the productivity and the quality and safety of the production in China. We also have seen opportunities in other species like cattle. The objective for us in cattle is to build a stronger portfolio, especially to build a stronger portfolio in vaccines. And the way that we are doing that is first trying to get approval for a portfolio that is already available in other markets, also in China. And second, to invest in R&D locally to produce specific vaccines for cattle, for swine and also for poultry. And this is a strategy that we are following, and we are convinced that China will continue growing, not only in livestock, we have seen a significant success in our portfolio in companion animal. We have now a portfolio, which is covering vaccines and covering some other products. We still have the opportunity in China to approve APOQUEL in the future – to approve SIMPARICA. This will take some time, but we are convinced that the potential growth of China will continue. There has been in the second quarter some additional growth coming from these extra acquisitions from channel distributors in anticipation of changes on the label. This is mainly administrative changes rather than a lot of work really to update the indications updates there (01:10:23). So you have seen that we wanted to ensure that the product will be continually available in the market without any kind of a reduction.
Paul S. Herendeen - Zoetis, Inc.: I want to make one – it's one point, and Juan Ramón covered this. But China, from a growth perspective, is attractive both on the companion animal front and the livestock front. And so that's an important point and I think he covered the structural elements that will lead to we believe good long-term growth opportunities. What's also interesting about China is how it affects one of our other key markets, which is Brazil. I think many of you may have seen recently an article that talked about the increase in exports of beef from Brazil to China. That's a good thing for us, because we're present in Brazil and that helps with the health of our customer base in Brazil. So China has a pretty interesting influence on our business, both for what we do there, but also on other segments of our company.
Operator: We'll go next to Douglas Tsao with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Douglas Tsao - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just really quickly, in terms of APOQUEL, I think you said that you're selling without restrictions since May. Just curious what the sales would have been this quarter if you'd have been able to sell without restrictions the entire time?
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Well, it's always difficult to respond to these hypothetical questions, so I think definitely much higher than what we reported and not only in the U.S., but also in the other markets. So imagine that we have had APOQUEL fully available and fully launched in all markets from January 1, then definitely the revenues will be much higher than the $100 million at this point. How much, I think, is difficult to assess. But we are convinced that the opportunity is not only on having the product available without restrictions to all markets, to all customers, but the opportunity also to expand the use of APOQUEL not only to chronic, but also to acute indications. And this is where we're making a lot of efforts and we are considering different ways of communicating through veterinarians and also different ways to communicate that to pet owners to increase the awareness of the product and to make sure that the pet owners are also going to the clinics asking for APOQUEL for both chronic, but also acute indications.
Operator: Thank you. We'll go next to Erin Wilson with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Erin Wilson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks. Just a couple of follow-ups on innovation, new products. Can you speak to the value proposition of IL-31 and monoclonal antibodies in the veterinary setting just in general? And on SIMPARICA, would the cat indication for SIMPARICA likely be a topical product and would it likely have the same sort of six-month age restriction similar to the canine chewable? Thanks.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Let me start with the easiest answer on the cat. So definitely cats, in general, they don't like pills. And if you want to really to succeed in the cat market, you need to offer a topical indication; and this is what would be working in our R&D program really to bring this product into the market. So IL-31 still is a product that has been commercialized under a conditional license. It means that we still have very limited promotional activities for IL-31. So we want – or we focus during this period until full license to get the experience of using this product and also to develop all the data that will support the approval, the full license of IL-31. The feedback from the market so far is very positive. And, again, it's very complementary to APOQUEL. APOQUEL will be in both, acute and chronic. IL-31 being a product which is injectable, maybe we will position more in chronic than acute, but still will be opportunities for both indications. And as I said, in terms of efficacy, greater response from the veterinarians, mainly dermatologists and some experienced veterinarians and also great on safety. So I think all the indications are very positive to IL-31. And this will be, as I said, very complementary to our atopic dermatitis franchise (01:15:31) itching conditions. And we are very pleased with what we are doing. Last comment on SIMPARICA. So we continue to see SIMPARICA as a platform. So the active ingredient of SIMPARICA will be used for combination products, also for oral, for atopical; and we are convinced that this will be a significant product in our portfolio. And I think just to remind that in the cat business – or parasiticide, the cat market, we have REVOLUTION and REVOLUTION is performing very well. And we also expect that with the new lifecycle innovation that we are applying to SIMPARICA, the REVOLUTION penetration also will also be reinforced.
Operator: And it appears we have no further questions. I'll return the floor to you, Juan Ramón, for any closing remarks.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much for joining us on this call. And with that, I hope you have a very good day. Thank you.

In the interest of time, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and then queue up again with any follow-ups. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to John O'Connor. John, you may begin.
John O'Connor - Vice President, Investor Relations: Thank you, operator. Good morning and welcome to the Zoetis first quarter 2016 earnings call. I'm joined today by Juan Ramón Alaix, our Chief Executive Officer; and Paul Herendeen, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'll remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and actual results could differ materially for those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statement in today's press release and our SEC filings including, but not limited to, our 2015 annual report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q. Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures which were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and in the company's 8-K filing dated today, May 4, 2016. We will also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. With that, I will turn the call over to Juan Ramón.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. We delivered another solid quarter, demonstrating our steady and predictable growth, and confirming the strength of Zoetis as the industry leader in animal health. The diversity of our portfolio in terms of geographies, species and therapeutic areas, as well as our business model continues driving our performance. In previous years, we have seen different species leading our growth based on changes in market trends and the mix of products in our portfolio. For example, in 2013, our growth was driven largely by swine and poultry products. In 2014, it was driven by cattle and swine. And in 2015, companion animal and cattle led the way. This quarter, the most significant operational growth driver by far has been our portfolio of companion animal, a trend we expect to continue through 2016. Our companion animal business is growing, thanks to the increasing sales of APOQUEL, the addition of Abbott Animal Health products, the introduction of new vaccines in Europe and the U.S., and the overall positive performance of the rest of our portfolio. It is important as we experience softer growth in livestock. We continue to invest across our portfolio, and during the first quarter, our R&D investment continued to show many positive results, including the approval of SIMPARICA, our new oral parasiticide in the U.S., Brazil and Canada. This quarter also marked the completion of our ERP implementation. After nearly two years, all our commercial operations, manufacturing plants, and support functions are on a single platform, enabling us to achieve greater efficiency. Overall, we have been able to accelerate our operational efficiency program with a positive impact in 2016 and we expect to exceed the initial savings target of $300 million by 2017. I am pleased to say that with the positive momentum in the business and the help of improved foreign exchange rates, we are increasing our guidance for the two-year, 2016 and 2017. Coming now to more detail on our first quarter results. Operational revenue growth was 12% and you can find a slide on our webcast that break this down. These reflect six extra days in the quarter due to the accounting calendar, as well as the negative impact of changes in markets like Venezuela and India, and the product SKU rationalization that we communicated last year. Adjusting for these factors, the growth will be 10% operational and 6% excluding the additional impact of recent acquisitions. In the quarter, we grew adjusted net income by 28% operationally, once again growing faster than revenue and helped by the fact that our OpEx increased only 2% operationally compared to the 12% revenue growth. We continue to deliver our long term valuable position of growing adjusted net income faster than revenue. In looking at the overall market, we continue to see the animal health industry performing well, despite global economic challenges. We have seen good growth in most markets as greater consumption of proteins and increased medical spending on pets continues to help create customer demand for our products. As always, while I'm very pleased with the quarterly results, I also want to emphasize the need to look at our business on a full year basis to account for some of the seasonal situations and timing patterns in animal health. Let me now update you on our new product launches and R&D developments. APOQUEL is showing a steady growth. We have continued to launch APOQUEL in each of our markets such as Canada, Australia and New Zealand, and we plan in the coming months to introduce the product in the rest of the markets where it has been approved, including Japan, Brazil and Mexico. And this month, the product will be available to customers without restrictions. In the first quarter, APOQUEL sales were approximately $50 million, an increase of about $40 million from the year ago quarter. As previously communicated, we expect APOQUEL to generate peak sales of more than $300 million. As far as SIMPARICA, our new once monthly chewable tablet for the treatment of fleas and ticks, it was launched in the U.S. and in several European markets. It is early, but we are hearing a positive response from our customers and we expect performance to ramp up in the remainder of the year. We are also developing the combinations of the sarolaner molecule in SIMPARICA with other agents. This would cover a broader spectrum of parasites, including heartworm and we see sarolaner as a strong platform for future lifecycle innovations. Our canine antibody therapy that targets and neutralizes IL-31 to help treat atopic dermatitis in dogs has been introduced to veterinarian dermatologist in the U.S. under a conditional license. And we received another conditional license in Canada in the first quarter. We are hearing a very positive customer feedback and we are gaining market experience with the product. We continue to allocate our capital for investments in key commercial activities, R&D programs and business development opportunities that can generate faster revenue growth. For example, vaccines and genetics are two areas. We are expanding our portfolio as we put greater R&D emphasis around disease prevention. And in the first quarter, we had several positive developments. We received approval of RUI LAN WEN, the second vaccine resulting from our joint venture in China and the first combination vaccine in China to help protect pigs against a certain locally prevalent disease. We also gained approval in China for our poultry vaccine to help prevent Marek's disease. In the U.S., we have now received licenses from the USDA for a new VANGUARD B Oral vaccine and three new VANGUARD Rapid Resp Intranasal vaccines. Zoetis is now the first and only manufacturer to offer oral, intranasal and injectable options for vaccinating dogs against Bordetella bronchiseptica. We also granted a conditional license in the U.S. for an Avian Influenza Vaccine to help prevent diseases caused by the avian influenza virus H5N1. We are participating in a process to supply the USDA with this vaccine for the Stockpile should they decide a vaccination strategy is needed. We're also seeing progress in genetic tests, as our farm animal customers want more information about traits and conditions that can help them build a healthier and more productive herd. During the quarter, in the U.S., we launched CLARIFIDE Plus, the first commercially available genetic test that gives dairy producers a direct way to predict risk factors for costly diseases in hosting dairy cattle. And just last month in Chile, we launched the ALPHA JECT LiVac SRS vaccine for salmon, the first attenuated live vaccine against SRS. This was a significant R&D achievement by PHARMAQ, and a much needed product to help Chilean fish farmers, great news for the industry and a terrific new opportunity for Zoetis. In summary, we are off to a good start for 2016, based on the strength of our diverse portfolio and the continued benefits of our R&D investment. We have been able to accelerate our efficiency program and expect to exceed initial savings target of $300 million by 2017. And finally, with improved foreign currency rates and the positive momentum of the business, we are increasing our guidance for the full year 2016 and 2017. With that, let me turn things over to Paul. Paul?
Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, Juan Ramón. I'm going to hit on many of the themes covered by Juan Ramón because they're important to the financial review of the quarter. So, let's talk about our first quarter performance. I'll walk you through a number of factors that you should consider to gauge how we did in Q1. There's some helpful information on the webcast slides and, of course, included in our press release. I'll then hit on a few other highlights in the quarter results and discuss our updates to guidance. Now, before I jump in the quarter, let me say that we know that the U.S. financial markets are quarter-centric and not to naucify quarterly modelers, but in any quarter, a lot of noise can and does creep into the comparison with the prior-year period. In our discussion and our webcast slides, our objective is to try to highlight for you the major elements of the noise in our results so that you can calibrate how our reported performance might influence your thoughts about our future prospects. The most important thing about our first quarter performance is that the results for Q1 supported an improvement to our outlook for the full year 2016. So, with that background, let me cover two important points that will enable me to put our 12% operational revenue growth in perspective. First, we operate on a 4-4-5 financial week calendar, with our International operations closing one month ahead of the U.S. Now, this is a carryover from our days as part of Pfizer. Under our 4-4-5 calendar, every handful of years you'll have a quarter in a year that has as many as six extra calendar days in it. That's what we have in Q1 2016 compared with Q1 of 2015. We estimate that the additional days account for approximately 6% of the 12% operational revenue growth for Q1 2016 versus 2015. Important safety tip for those with quarterly models out there, our fourth quarter this year will have five fewer days than the prior-year quarter and the full year 2016 has one more calendar day than 2015, this being a leap year. So, that's the extra days. Second, our operating efficiency initiative was a drag on our operational revenue growth in the quarter. We estimate that the combination of the eliminated SKUs and the changes to our business models in Venezuela, India and other countries reduced operational revenue growth by some 4%. So, think about it like this. 12% operational growth for the quarter, minus 6% for the extra days, plus 4% for the impact of the efficiency initiative, equates to a normalized growth rate of approximately 10%. Of that 10%, roughly 4% came from acquisitions including Abbott, PHARMAQ and other smaller transactions. So our organic operational growth in Q1 was circa 6%, and including acquisitions, was 10%. So, not 12%, but pretty good, right? Now, highlights for the first quarter, very high level. We've now entered what I previously referred to as the golden age of our companion animal business. With full supply of APOQUEL, the launch of SIMPARICA, a refreshed companion animal vaccine line, and the conditional license for IL-31, we are positioned to deliver significant growth in our companion animal business in 2016 and beyond. On a normalized basis, organic operational revenue growth, which adjusts for the six extra days, the impact of the operational efficiency initiative and M&A, we had about 20% growth in companion animal in Q1 compared with Q1 of 2015, and the growth was reasonably consistent between the U.S. and the International segments. On the same normalized constant currency basis, livestock was up 1% with solid performance in the International segment, offset by a decline in the U.S. Q1 of 2015 was a particularly strong quarter in U.S. livestock and there were a number of other factors that I'll touch on later. Our livestock business both in the U.S. and International segments are healthy and poised to contribute to revenue growth in the remainder of the year. Stepping down the P&L, our adjusted gross margin hit an all-time high of 67.4% in the quarter, a bit above the high end of our full year guidance range. But I'll point out that from a gross margin perspective, many things fell on the favorable side of the line during the quarter – mix, level of scrap, et cetera. Our expectations for gross margin for the full year continue to be in the range of 66% to 67%. In operating expenses, total adjusted OpEx grew 2% on an operational basis, but if you remember those extra six days, they impact our expenses as well. Our progress in reducing operating cost continues and we are on track to deliver on the promises of our operational efficiency in this initiative in 2016 and expect to enter 2017 having taking more than the targeted $300 million of costs out of our company. With our gross margin expansion and active efforts to contain operating costs, our 12% reported operational revenue growth translated into 37% operational growth in adjusted operating profit and 35% operational growth in adjusted income before tax. The EC's actions last January were a key driver of the 350 basis point rise in our adjusted effective tax rate to 30.9%, which resulted in our adjusted net income in the quarter rising 28% operationally. Our purchase of shares, which began in Q1 of 2015 – started in January 2015 – helped to reduce our fully diluted share count from 503.2 million in Q1 of 2015 to 499.5 million in the current quarter, and that led to operational growth of adjusted diluted EPS of 29%. So, that was a very quick walk down our P&L for the quarter. Here are a few more contextual details that I believe will help you think about our performance. First, FX. Dare I say that we may have found the bottom of the cycle? Maybe not, but the environment has improved for sure. Foreign exchange had a negative 700 basis point impact on our revenue growth in the first quarter compared with Q1 of 2015. That's a big hit. But based on current rates, the FX impact on our growth will lessen over the remainder of the year. While we continue to measure our performance on an operational or constant currency basis, it just feels better when the gap between operational and reported results narrows. Next, the SKU reduction and the changes to our business models in countries like Venezuela and India reduced our operational revenue growth by roughly 400 basis points. You should expect the growth drag on the full year to be roughly 500 basis points, so more of a negative factor compared with the prior year for the next nine months and particularly in Q2 and in Q3. Importantly, the impact of the SKU reduction and the changes in business models are felt more in our International segments than in the U.S. and more in livestock than in companion animal. Let me step through the elements of the 12% operational revenue growth in Q1. Price accounted for 3% of the growth, APOQUEL volume another 3%, 4% from acquisitions, 6% from growth of in-line products and minus 4% from the impact of the SKU reductions and changes to business models in Venezuela, India and other countries. Companion animal was the star of the quarter. Revenue growth normalized for both the six extra days and the impact of the efficiency initiatives increased 20% operationally. APOQUEL was the major driver, but other products contributed as well including vaccines as well as the Abbott acquisition. We also expanded U.S. customers' access to a number of our companion animal products to third-party distributors and that change led to a one-time in semi-permanent buildup of their inventories during the quarter to establish their base level. In livestock, we had lots of puts and takes. The normalized organic revenue growth was 1% operationally with the International segment up 5% and the U.S. segment down 9%. First, let's talk about International. The France livestock rebounded as the anti-infective sales in the quarter were higher when compared with a very light Q1 of 2015, which was caused by new legislation last year. Australia livestock also pushed the strong quarter with better weather playing a role. In Brazil, we benefited from above average price increases and continued favorable conditions in the cattle segment, which were in part offset by the negative impact or SKU reductions. In U.S. livestock, a mild winter was a major driver of lower cattle product sales in the quarter. With milder weather, there was a less risk of disease incidents and that impacted our premium products. We also saw decline in swine products due to increased competition. In summary, after adjusting for the noise, we had a solid quarter from a revenue perspective and through the ongoing programs to improve efficiency, delivered an improved gross margin, contained operating costs, and posted strong growth and profits. Switching to restructuring charges, let me quickly review this quarter's one-time charges related to certain significant items. First, the stand-up costs, which are mainly associated with our separation from Pfizer totaled $12 million in the quarter, down about half from the prior year. That work continues to wind down and will be substantially completed later this year. In the second bucket, cost related to the efficiency initiative, we recorded $5 million of costs, which were more than offset by $33 million gain associated with the sale of four manufacturing sites in certain products as part of the efficiency initiative during the quarter. Interesting – rather than the gain, I like to think about it from a gross cash perspective. Gross pre-cash proceeds from the sale of the sites was $75 million. We have additional assets for sale including a transaction in Taiwan, which closed last Friday and any impacts from those sales would further affect cost in this second bucket. Finally, we recorded $3 million of cost associated with our ongoing supply network strategy initiative. We're still in the early days of that initiative. We also did record a one-time net tax charge of approximately $35 million in the quarter relating to the nullification of our Belgium tax ruling by the European Commission for periods from 2013 through 2015. Now, turning to guidance. There are four factors that lead us to narrow and raise our guidance for 2016. First, let me cover the easy one, FX rates. We refreshed our guidance for our current FX rates and that was certainly a help in our guidance. Second, in the first quarter, our International segment was stronger than we had expected and we're confident that strength will carry through the balance of 2016. Third, we are more confident in our expectations for APOQUEL as we put supply issues behind us and have launch plans in place in new markets and they're well underway. And fourth, we reduced our guidance for our 2016 effective tax rate on adjusted income by 100 basis points. This is due to changes in our projected mix of income by jurisdiction as a result of internal restructuring of our International operations. If you want to calibrate the various factors, at the midpoint of our guidance range for adjusted EPS, we raised guidance by approximately $0.10 a share, I'd be remiss if I didn't say it's actually $0.105, but it's $0.10 a share for this purpose. Roughly $0.03 comes from FX, roughly $0.04 comes from stronger operational performance and the reduced tax rate added roughly $0.03. I hope that helps you think about the change for the guidance. For 2017, the only change we made at this point are based on changed FX rates. So, to go through it for 2016 and 2017. For the full year 2016, we now expect revenue between $4.775 billion to $4.875 billion, reported diluted EPS of between a $1.41 and a $1.56 per share and adjusted diluted EPS of between $1.83 to a $1.90 per share. For the full year 2017, we now expect revenue between $5.075 billion to $5.275 billion, reported diluted EPS of between $2.01 to $2.19 per share and adjusted diluted EPS between $2.24 and $2.38 per share. Now, to summarize, we enjoy a diverse product portfolio, global footprint and productive R&D that together enable us to balance fluctuations across different species, therapies and markets, and deliver consistent revenue and profit growth over time. We are well down the road of improving the efficiency of our operating expense structure, leading to improved margins and we're on track to achieve an adjusted EBIT margin of 34% in 2017. With the continued focus on expense efficiency, we expect to deliver operating profit growth faster than the revenue growth. Last but certainly not least, we strive to intelligently allocate our capital and actively manage our capital structure to drive shareholder returns. That's it from my prepared remarks. Let me turn it back to Juan Ramón before we get to Q&A.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Paul. And before we begin the Q&A, I wanted to mention our personnel development. So beginning July 1, John O'Connor, will be promoted to the role of Vice President of Corporate Strategy, Business Analytics and Enterprise Risk Management for Zoetis; and Steve Frank will now lead our Investor Relations program; John will be reporting to Alejandro Bernal, Executive Vice President, President, and Group President of Corporate Strategy, Commercial and Business Development. John has done a great job as Head of Investor Relations over the last two years, and I wanted to thank him for those contributions. He will continue to be a valuable advisor to me, to Paul, and Alejandro in his new capacity. I am pleased to say that John will leave the Investor Relations program in good hands, and there is Steve Frank. Steve has a great knowledge of our industry and business, having worked in animal health for the last 15 years, and has been involved in our recent acquisition of PHARMAQ, Abbott as well as our IPO. Many of you know Steve, and he has been working with John in IR since 2014 to prepare for this opportunity. I'm sure we will have a seamless transition. With that, let me open the lines for Q&A. Operator?
Operator: And we will take our first question from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital. Please go ahead.
Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good morning folks and congratulations on the quarter, and congratulations, John, on the promotion. I'm not sure if I got the April cost sales. If you don't mind repeating what the April cost sales were by region? And could you also comment on some of the vaccines that you are developing on your livestock business, particularly the avian vaccine. Thank you very much. We'd appreciate it.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. So, the first question on APOQUEL. Total revenues for APOQUEL in the quarter were $50 million, and U.S. generated $35 million, and in International markets $15 million. These, I guess, it's answering your question on APOQUEL. You also ask about new vaccines. On new vaccines, we have new vaccines for companion animal, and this has been introduced in Europe as well as in the U.S. I mentioned new vaccines that are in the U.S. covering oral injectable intranasal, and I mentioned this for a specific Bordetella bronchiseptica disease. So, this is something that definitely represents a significant upgrade on our portfolio for companion animal infections. We also launched a new vaccine in China, used for swine, and it is combination of vaccine for PRRS with a combination for swine fever in pigs. So another opportunity for increasing our presence in China, and increasing our presence in the swine market in China. That is a significant opportunity for Zoetis. Next question, please.
Operator: And we'll go next to Louise Chen with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.
Louise Chen - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So you guys talked about maybe exceeding your operational efficiency target of $300 million. I was wondering if you could give more color there on the potential upside, and then how this could positively impact your 2017 guidance and margin expectations? Thanks.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, we already incorporated in our guidance for 2017 the potential exceeding of the $300 million. At this point, we have not provided any concrete amount of this existing opportunity – is something that in the future. As we move into the programs, we'll be sharing that with you. Next set of question, please.
Operator: Thank you. And we'll go next to Erin Wilson with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Erin Wilson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): A follow-up to that question on the restructuring, SKU rationalization and overall cost structure initiatives. How should we think about the quarterly progression throughout the year? And then as a second question, how would you characterize the current environment in the U.S. livestock business? You mentioned weather impacting the business in the quarter, but how should we think about the dynamics now? Thanks.
Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes. Erin, it's Paul. I'll take the how do you think about the OpEx roll out. As we said, we expect to enter 2017 with the cost structure trim down to its new inefficient level. We have some work to go on that and I think that if you're a quarterly modeler, I know you are, I think you got to think about it as continuing to show in positive impact through Q4. It's not like we're going to finish this in Q2, we're not going to finish in Q3, there is more to come that you will see evidenced in our cost structure in Q4. So, I don't know if that exactly answers it. But, yes, suffice to say that the improvements will continue to occur throughout 2016 and with a good chunk in Q4 2016. Do you want to take the last one?
Juan Ramón Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Let me cover the question on the U.S. livestock. Let me start with the cattle. On the cattle, there are two segments, beef and dairy. Let's talk about beef. Beef, we reported that there were probably milder winter conditions that impacted our premium net products, but the fundamentals of the beef market of the cattle are very strong. We have seen that the increase in placement in feedlot. We also expect that it will continue for the rest of the year and also we expect that at the end of the year, the number of cows in beef will be increasing by 2% to 3%. So it's something that even if we have seen some temporary impact in the first quarter, we want also to see this business on a yearly basis and we're confident that on a yearly basis the market remain very strong. In dairy, what we have seen is the global prices for milk has been going down. This is also resulting in some negative impact in dairy customers. And in some of the cases, we expect that they will be reducing the number of dairy cows. Again, so it's a cycle that we have seen also in previous years. After a cycle of low price reduction of cows, it will be another cycle where prices will go up and then they will be rebuilding the herd. So, we don't see that this is something that is concerning on medium, long-term process for the business. In swine, we reported that we are facing some additional competition for vaccines. It's a similar case that we saw in the past with companion animal. We identified this need in companion animal. We have been working to upgrade our vaccines. Now our vaccines in companion animal are very strong and we are doing the same with swine. So, we are working to upgrade our swine portfolio for vaccines and we're confident that this also will bring us the opportunity for growing in the future. We don't expect the swine to be a significant driver of growth in 2016. And finally, poultry. Poultry in the U.S., I think it's a positive segment. We expect to generate the net positive growth in 2016. Next question, please.
Operator: And we'll go next to John Kreger with William Blair. Please go ahead.
John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks very much. Can you just talk a little bit about the strategy around dermatitis in dogs now that you've got IL-31 out there as well as APOQUEL? What are you learning about the market and how best are you using those two products? Thanks.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, it's still very early because, first, APOQUEL has been – because of the limitations in terms of supply – has been mostly used in chronic dogs with dermatitis. We expect now that in May we are opening the market without restrictions. They will be expanding the market not only to chronic but also to acute. In the case of IL-31, IL-31 has been introduced as a conditional license. So what we are doing is to gain experience in the market by doing some activity with dermatologists, veterinarian dermatologists. This also has the objective of collecting all the data that will support full license in terms of efficacy of the product, but we are convinced that there are two products that they are very complementary and one is oral, the other one is injectable. There are some dogs which are not managing well swallowing pills. This is something that IL-31 will cover. There also, not everyone is responding the same way to treatment. So we see that APOQUEL, in some cases, is working very well; IL-31, in some of our cases, is also working very well. So the veterinarian will have the option to choose what is the best treatment there, depending on specific cases of dogs with atopic dermatitis or with any kind of skin conditions. Finally, APOQUEL will have broader indications, while IL-31 will have the indication of atopic dermatitis. Next question, please.
Operator: We'll go next to Chris Schott with JPMorgan.
Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Thanks very much for the questions and congrats, John. First, just update on SIMPARICA and how you're thinking about the rollout of the product? I guess, should we think about a slower ramp here, given entrenched competition, and what type of share do you think Zoetis can ultimately capture of this obviously very large end market? Thanks.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, as I mentioned, it's early, the introduction of SIMPARICA. SIMPARICA has been introduced in the U.S. and in a few European markets. We just plan to introduce the product in the rest of the markets where the product has been approved. SIMPARICA has been launched with very strong publications and comparing SIMPARICA against other products, oral and topical. And we have seen that SIMPARICA, it's showing very positive comparison in terms of faster action. So it's very fast on killing ticks and fleas and also very important. So, the SIMPARICA is keeping full efficacy during the duration of the treatment, which is also very important and much better than some of our competitors. So, we are definitely convinced that SIMPARICA will have a place in the market. I think we are not yet establishing what is the target in terms of market share, but definitely we expect that we'll gain the market share that corresponds to a company that our strength, the capabilities and our operations in the market.
Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, it's Paul. I just want to follow-on on that. I think that the overall market size is for parasiticides is about $4 billion. The dogs' portion is about $2.5 billion; the fastest growing segment are the oral parasiticides. But if you want to think about the market, it's kind of in that $2.5 billion market and I think that we believe that there are two things. One, with our footprint and the quality of our salesforces we have the opportunity to certainly penetrate that $2.5 billion market and participate in the fastest growing part. The second thing I want to point out is, this is a self-developed product, and that means the economics of this product to us as compared with the economics of the product to Merial and to Merck that we're in license through third-parties. This is a very good product for us and we're really excited about both the prospects of penetrating their market, but also getting the fruits of our investment in R&D. So this is a great story and we'll see how it plays out.
Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thank you, Paul.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Next question, please.
Operator: We'll go next to Jeff Holford with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Jeffrey Holford - Jefferies LLC: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks very much for taking my questions. So Elanco licensed a new canine osteoarthritis drug just in the last quarter. I wonder if you could talk about that in terms of why you didn't feel compelled to license that asset and just remind us what products do you have in that area and if you're very active in terms of R&D late-stage development there and how that might impact your franchise? Thanks very much.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, thank you for the question, Jeff, and we believe that we have a portfolio in pain, which is very strong. We have RIMADYL in all markets. We also have in the European market another product, which is also complementary to RIMADYL, which is called TROCOXIL and very important. So we have a lot of experience in this area, and this expertise is not only in terms of commercial, but also in terms of R&D. And in R&D, it's an area of focus and we have programs in pain that I'm convinced that will strengthen our portfolio in the future. Next question, please.
Operator: We'll go next to Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore ISI.
Volodymyr Nikolenko - Evercore ISI: Hello. Hi, guys. Thank you for taking my questions. It's actually Vlad Nikolenko on behalf of Mark Schoenebaum. Congrats with the strong quarter and, John, congrats on promotion. So I have two somewhat related questions. First, more about macro trends in general. So your official guidance for 2016 and 2017 implies a strong operational growth in terms of revenue like mid to high single-digits. So I'm wondering if we can think about this revenue growth over the longer term that just will continue to grow in line with the rest of the industry – animal health industry or at some point, we need to expect some slowdown of this trend. And second, somewhat related question is about segments. Do you have more color about the potential long-term growth in different segments of products, antibiotics versus vaccines versus other pharmaceuticals and other segments that you report? Thank you.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Vlad, and let me first describe what are the macro trends. So we see that the overall macro trend that maybe are is lowering down the growth in some markets. It's not affecting the same way to our industry. And one example, so we have seen that in Brazil, the GDP, it's declining, while the GDP for agriculture including their livestock is growing. So, again, so it's – in the animal health industry, I think we cannot extrapolate the macro trends which are affecting other sectors to our trends. And our trends are based on population, it's still continue growing; middle class, which is still increasing, and also they need to improve productivity because – well, the world is being challenged with the need of more food with fewer resources. And companies like us is that we can bring this type of innovation, we have a significant opportunity for our growth. And the same drivers are also impacting their companion animal. More people, more middle class is increasing the number of pet adoptions and also very important, the amount that pet owners are spending per pet in keeping these animals healthier and to live longer. So we are very confident that the macro trends remain positive for the animal health industry. And for Zoetis, we have been targeting to grow in line or faster than the market. In the first two years as independent company, we had been growing faster than the market. In 2016, because some one-time impact related to our operational efficiency, the reported growth will be lower. Adjusted by this factor, we expect that we'll be growing in line or faster than the market. The same for 2017. We have projected for 2017 a growth that, in my opinion, at the midpoint, is faster than the projection of the market and we have no reasons to believe that in the future we'll (sic) [we won't] continue growing in line or faster than the market. So one of the things that are very important is that we have already all what is needed to maximize our portfolio. And very important, our R&D investment continued delivering very strong results. And we have been continue bring into the market new products, but also very important bring into the market lifecycle innovation, which is also helping to protect our future growth. And maybe Paul can talk about trends in therapeutic areas, antibiotics, vaccines, pills that are part of our efforts to ensure that we have the right balance and the right opportunities for our growth.
Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. Sure. And when you think about – when people talk about anti-infectives or antibiotics, people look at our portfolio and they say, gee, you're a market leader in anti-infectives. I hear this and I see this in the news and therefore we have a lot of revenues at risk. And to put in perspective, I think what people mostly focus on the amount of anti-infective sales that we have in livestock. They're not necessarily as concerned with the anti-infectives that's used in the treatment of companion animals. We saw about $1.3 billion of anti-infectives in the livestock segment. But importantly, Vlad, first I'm going to talk about our company and our outlook. Included in that $1.3 billion, about $1 billion of that are in the form of high value injectable products that are dosed to animals when they are sick and where the alternative is that animal could die and the animals around that animal could die. And that's why we characterize as the responsible use of anti-infectives and that is the overwhelming majority of our portfolio was products that fall into that category. And while there continues to be pressure or concern from folks generally about the use of anti-infectives and wanting to use anti-infectives, what they are mainly focused on is not treatment of sick animals, but really the use of anti-infectives in ways that would, for example, to promote growth. Within our portfolio, about $300 million balance in livestock, that is mainly anti-infectives that are used in feed and in water. Our work with our customers and our own diligence strongly suggest that those products are being used in what we would call a – what we call a responsible way, in other words, not in sub-therapeutic doses to promote growth, but to treat sick animals. Even still, if I were looking as an outsider, I would look at that $300 million as – that's a piece I got to keep my eye on and that's a piece I'd be concerned about. Now, back to the overall trends. Our anti-infectives continue to grow, but they grow slower than the balance of our portfolio. And just so, well, real quick, of course, that's baked into our 2016 expectations, our 2017 expectations, and frankly is baked into our folks who look at our industry generally about what the long-term growth prospects are for the industry. It's an important part of the industry, and so that's baked into the macro view of our industry to able to grow mid single-digits or better for the foreseeable future. I'll continue on because it's a very interesting topic. We pivoted many years ago away from the development of additional anti-infectives to a focus on vaccines because the best way to reduce the use of anti-infectives is to reduce the incidences of disease. That's the best way. And we've been very successful of pivoting our R&D portfolio and now our product portfolio to feature vaccines and will assist producers in maintaining the health of their herd so that they would have to use less anti-infectives. So that's a big area for us. And we focused – I'm focusing all of this on the livestock segment because I think that's where your question lies. So I'll stop there. Next question, please?
Operator: We'll go next to Douglas Tsao with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Douglas Tsao - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the questions. Just on the IL-31, what is your expectation in terms of timing for going from a conditional to a full approval and just obviously there's some limitations in terms of your promotion of the product right now. Just how widely is that being used in terms of veterinarians?
Juan Ramón Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Doug for the question. So we expect but there is something that will depend on the final approval from the USDA. We expect this approval by the end of the year. So now what we are doing, it's a gaining experience and also collecting the data in terms of efficacy and this will be submitted to the USDA for final approval of the product and is related to the U.S. we have similar partner in Canada and a different one in Europe. Also, we expect in Europe this product approved in the future. So today it's used under this conditional license. So the use is quite limited because we're just going to fewer customers in the U.S. mostly veterinarian dermatologist, some other customers are using the product. Now the objective is not really to generate significant revenue growth but to gain experience of the product and making sure that the product it's generating the amount of data that would support full license. We're convinced that IL-31 will be an important product in our portfolio and very important so it's – Zoetis, it's developing a franchise which is this skin conditions, itching, atopic dermatitis. And with two products in the market I think it might have been that we have very strong position with it the future opportunities. Next question please.
Operator: We are going next to Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.
Divya Harikesh - Goldman Sachs International: Good morning. This is Divya Harikesh on behalf of Jami Rubin. Just wanted to get your latest thoughts on capital allocation. Are there other assets that look more attractive at current valuation or areas that are of particular interest to you. Also how much leverage would you consider given the market's increasing concern on leverage levels for companies. Thank you.
Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: This is Paul. I'll take that on the capital allocation front. Of course, we continue to – I think like most companies and we focus first on what kind of capital can we allocate within our company to drive incremental revenue and profit growth that is always going to be very high return activity. So, first thing we do is try to max out programs inside that can drive revenue and that falls in the bunch of categories that's – yeah that could be incremental salesforce, it could be investment in DTC advertising to grow markets, it could be incremental investment in R&D to develop new products. It could be incremental CapEx to create a technology platform. So it's all those things. So we do that first. The second piece which is I think what you're asking about is outside. So we look outside on what sorts of opportunities do we see. We see a very consistent flow of what I'll call smaller deals that we do every single year that none of which I think on an individual basis is going to be exciting to the market at large, but in the aggregate help us one, feed our R&D effort because we can acquire technologies and things that feed R&D. Second is small add-ons that we just continually do and yeah that can be anywhere from $40 million to $75 million a year in activity and that's relatively consistent. The next bucket would be sort of the mid-sized M&A and I think last year and, I guess, I'd put PHARMAQ in that category and maybe even Abbott in that category as well. Lastly, we were fortunate enough to close two deals. I wish we could do that every year. The challenge is not our desire, would you do this deal. We will do those deals 100 out of 100 times if they present themselves. So we are – as I used to always love to say, we're tanned, rested and ready to do those deals when they present themselves and we're spring loaded to go after them when they present themselves but now predicting when they're going to be available is the challenge. On the larger scale M&A, really, I guess, what you think of it as potentially transformative, we've said many times over, our transaction with one of the top five companies is very difficult for reasons of anti-trust sort of – think of it as FTC type issues because there's a lot of concentration now amongst the top, say, five companies. So, the prospect for a transaction, I'd say, never say never; it's not zero, but it would be pretty hard. And then, next down the list, there are opportunities, there we continue to look. We are very active and I should say we're very proactive in targeting assets that we think would be interesting and valuable to add to our company, but of course, we're not going to disclose what our list of targets might be at any moment in time. And then, the last bucket is the one that I think is important – I referenced it in the tail end of my prepared remarks – and that is returning capital to shareholders. As we enter 2017, we have lots of the standup costs and the operational efficiency cost, and all those things behind us, not just from a P&L perspective, but also from paying out the accruals, et cetera, and we put that cash flow behind us, that negative cash flow behind us and we enter 2017, we still have to throw off a fair amount of cash. And the question is, well, gee, if you don't have anything to do with it, what are you going to do? Well, a couple of things. One, we have a dividend. It's a circa – a commitment this year of – call it circa $190 million or thereabouts in 2016. We have a share repurchase program. We are currently purchasing shares at the rate of 75 million a quarter under a program that we announced way back in November of 2014. And so, long-winded but, we intend to the extent that we can't deploy that capital in our business or outside our business, to return to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases over time. We think that's appropriate. Cash is a non-productive asset for us to have around, but this also dovetails nicely into the discussion of capital structure, which you inquired about as well. So, we have articulated that we expect to operate in the normal course of business in the range of 2.5 to 3.5 times trailing EBITDA for a debt level for our company. Operating in that range will enable us to maintain an investment grade rating – we believe will enable us to maintain an investment-grade rating – and that's important, as you pointed out. I mean, the market is taking a different look at leverage levels today than they might have two or three years ago, and we're cognizant of that. I said – but because we get this question a lot, I'll restate it. People say would you ever do a deal that would cause you to be above that range? The answer is, yes. So, we would go above the top-end of that range to pursue what we felt was value-generative M&A. Would we go above that range to buy more stock? Probably not. In fact, I'll say definitely not. But we would in the context of making an acquisition. And so, we get below 2.5 times. We probably put some leverage on, we get above or up to the top-end of the range at 3.5, you'd expect us to manage that leverage down. The objective is to try to operate in that range and I'll stop there. I think as to the high-end of the range, I don't know what it is.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Next question please.
Operator: We'll go next to David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.
David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Right. Thank you very much. So, I was a little bit on and off the call. I just have a couple of questions on the guidance changes. So for the 2016 guidance, Paul, what percentage of the EPS guidance increase was due to operations and what percentage was due to FX? And then for 2017, obviously, you haven't updated that guidance for operating performance; you've only updated it for FX. When do you expect to update it for operating performance? Could we expect that after the second quarter results or do we have to wait until the company goes through its full-year annual planning in the fall? Any color on that would be helpful. Thank you.
Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. Sure. Thanks for the question, David. It's Paul. I'll take that. I'll go through the – the factors in – the midpoint in the range $0.10 up, $0.03 from FX, $0.04 from stronger operational performance and then the tax rate was a $0.03 helper as well and that gets you to the $0.10 raise at the midpoint of our range in 2016. You're quite right. 2017, we said, we updated our 2017 guidance solely for the favorable change in FX rates. It's 2017 guidance. We're one quarter into 2016. We have a pretty broad range there. You can surmise that our outlook continues to be in that range or we would have adjusted – or adjusted that range. So there is no set time at which we would change our operational view of 2017, but to the extent that we were outside the range for 2017, we'd change it. I'll stop there. Next question, please?
Operator: And we'll go next to Kathy Miner with Cowen & Company.
Kathy M. Miner - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good morning. First, I just had a follow-up on the sarolaner. Could you confirm that you do have full supply now so you're ready for full global launch? And was there any stocking in the first quarter of sarolaner? Second question has to just do on the SKU reduction, you've targeted 5,000 or roughly in total. Can you give us a sense of sort of where that's out right now and does that – is that something that just sort of goes away slowly as the year unfolds or is it more dramatic that they're kind of there until year-end? And also a sense of what therapeutic categories those SKU reductions are coming from. So as we sort of look at that, we can get sense of where some of those reductions will be coming. Thank you.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Let me start with sarolaner, SIMPARICA now. The name in the market is SIMPARICA and we have no restrictions for this product. We have enough of our product to introduce the product in all markets and where the regulatory authorities have approved. And this, in the U.S., all new markets and we also have operations for Canada and some other countries. So it's something that we don't see any restriction. So, at the time of the launch in the U.S. and also in Europe, there is no any significant loading of the product in the country. So, most of the product was related to samples that we provided to the veterinarians to get familiar with the product. So, we have not generated significant revenues in the first quarter, but we expect that these revenues would be ramping up during the rest of the year. So, we have very good expectations for the product. As I mentioned in some of the other comments, we have very strong publications supporting the efficacy of the product. As I said, this product is working very fast and also it's showing that during the duration of the treatment, it's having very strong efficacy. So, there is no drop in efficacy at the last day of the duration of the treatment, on the contrary is maintaining the efficacy. In terms of SKU, I think we have made significant progress on SKUs. So, most of the SKUs have been already eliminated from our portfolio, and maybe there are some few SKUs that will be eliminated from now until the third quarter, which are related to SKUs that will be replaced by other products that we are introducing in the market. But the large majority of SKUs has been already eliminated from our portfolio.
Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Let me continue on that because I think you asked the question about how it plays out over the course of 2016, and also important. We eliminate an SKU from the portfolio. If we sell it, like as we did, we sold some plants, as I said in my remarks, during the quarter and we sold it with the product. Obviously, the product is gone. We eliminate an SKU and we stop producing. We may still have inventory and we may still sell it. And so that's why you are seeing it play out over the course of 2016. But let me frame it. Q1, we said the impact of SKU reductions was about 4%, we said that we expected to be about 5% and this is growth versus prior year. For the full year, which it says that during the nine months, Q2, Q3, and Q4, it will be greater than 5% impact from a growth perspective versus the same period in the prior year. And I further said that it's mostly in Q2 and Q3. So the middle part of the year as we sell out these products and they are gone, and what you're going to see is a moderation of that in Q4 because we did start to see a impact in Q4 of last year. And as we enter 2017, there is still going to be a drag, because you still sold them at the beginning – some of these products at the beginning of 2016. But if you look at the kind of run rate when we enter Q1 of 2017, that will be fully reflective of all of those SKUs being gone, and again, impact versus prior year heavier in Q2, Q3 of this year, moderate in Q4, there is still an impact in Q1 next year, and Q2 next year, but it diminishes pretty substantially. The cool part is, we will have this activity behind us entering 2017. Next question, please?
Operator: And we do have a follow-up from Erin Wilson with Credit Suisse.
Erin Wilson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great. Thanks so much. Also, I still don't see a balance sheet in the release. I guess my bigger question here is what can you accomplish in the way of working capital improvements near-term, and to address the high inventory days? And then also, how much was the distributor stocking contribution in the quarter? I assume that's related to the vaccine business. Was that material?
Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, it's Paul. Let me take the balance sheet and working capital questions. Yeah, we are working very hard to shrink and then eliminate the gap between when we report our earnings and when we release the balance sheet. We are expecting to file our Q Friday of this week. So, yeah, we've shrunk it to a couple of days. It had been substantially more than that. That's just a – we could not shrink those days in the context of also changing all of our ERP systems et cetera. So we are working on that and our goal is, to be like most other companies, to have our balance sheet on the same day to report earnings. So just know that that's a priority for us and we'll get there. With respect to working capital, you pointed out to the day sales of inventory that we are on at the end of the year. We expect that we can have some pretty sizable improvements in our investment and working capital efficiency. Now with the – thank some higher power of the completion of our SAP implementation where we have every part of our company up on one instance of SAP, we now have the opportunity to activate the tools that will enable us to much more tightly manage our investment and inventory while at the same time having a high service level to our customers. That's not something that is instantaneous, that is something that we explored it and I think I've said in public forums before, we expect to make progress against that in 2016. We'd expect to make much more substantive progress on that in 2017 and that is the focus of our opportunity in being more efficient in working capital. We're pretty good in accounts receivable. I'd say pretty good, we're good in accounts receivable and we are also good on accounts payable. So it's really inventory that we are focused on, expect a modest improvement in 2016 and more significant improvements beginning in 2017 as we get the tools up that will enable us to better manage our supply chain. Your question regarding the distributor stocking, again that was in the U.S. That was with respect to some companion animal products to increase. So the amount that went in was approximately $18 million in the quarter. And so, it's something that you should take into consideration. Next question, please?
Operator: And it appears we have no further questions. I'll return the floor to Juan Ramón for final comments.
Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Great.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you very much for your attention. And looking forward for following quarters and also the interaction with all of you. Thank you.
Operator: And this does conclude today's teleconference. A replay of today's call will be available in two hours by dialing 800-757-4761 for U.S. listeners and 402-220-7215 for international. Please disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good day and welcome to the fourth quarter and full year 2015 financial results conference call and webcast for Zoetis. Hosting the call today is John O'Connor, Vice President of Investor Relations for Zoetis. The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, and will not be forwarded automatically. In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call via dial-in or on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. At this time all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for your questions following the presentation. In the interest of time, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and then queue up again with any follow-ups. It's now my pleasure to turn the floor over to John O'Connor. You may begin, sir.
John O'Connor - Vice President, Investor Relations: Thank you, operator. Good morning and welcome to the Zoetis fourth quarter and full year 2015 earnings call. I'm joined today by Juan Ramón Alaix, our Chief Executive Officer; and Paul Herendeen, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website, and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a full list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statement in today's press release and our SEC filings including but not limited to our 2014 annual report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q. Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures which were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and in the company's 8-K filing dated today, February 16, 2016. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. With that I will turn the call over to Juan Ramón.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, John. And good morning, everyone. In today's call I will provide perspective color based on the performance for the full year 2015 and our goals for 2016. Paul will discuss some of the fourth quarter highlights, the 2015 net results and our guidance for 2016 and 2017. In 2015, we affirm Zoetis' reputation as the global leader in the animal health industry with a strong financial performance, continued investment in our future growth and a commitment to creating a value for our customers and shareholders. For 2015 our diverse portfolio enabled us to grow our revenues by 8% operationally, with particular strength coming from R&D innovations and acquired products from Abbott Animal Health. In our three years as a public company, we have been delivering consistent operational revenue growth and we expect our 2015 to show again that we are growing faster than the industry. We grew our adjusted net income by 24% operationally, and grew our adjusted EBIT margin from 25% to 28% as we continue our focus on greater efficiency in our business. Even while we are scrutinizing our efficiency, we also continue to allocate resources for future growth. We invested $1.6 billion in 2015 across strategic acquisitions, internal research and development and capital expenditures in areas like manufacturing and supply. And finally, in 2015 we returned approximately $370 million in excess capital to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. This performance reflects our disciplined implementation of our business plan and our colleagues' tremendous dedication to serving our customers. I am pleased to say that as a result we met our guidance for revenue and exceeded our guidance for adjusted net income in 2015. On a reported basis we had a flat revenue growth due to an 800 basis point impact from foreign currency, but we still grew our reported adjusted net income by 13% thanks to our continued focus on achieving our efficiency goals. Looking ahead to 2016, first and foremost we are focused on delivering our financial guidance for the year. We are projecting 2% to 4% operational revenue growth, which reflects the impact of our SKU realization and changes to our operations in Venezuela. Excluding those impacts, we expect to grow revenues 8% to 10% operationally with 2 percentage points coming from the addition of PHARMAQ. This means organic growth is expected to be faster than the market again. And for 2017 we expect to continue growing faster than market at the rate of 5% to 9% as we are confident in our end markets, business model, the prospects for new product launches, improved product supply and progress in our efficiency goals. We are also confident in our pricing strategy. Our prices are defined by the value that we can demonstrate to our customers who buy and pay for the products we completely independent of third-party payers. In January we updated our adjusted EPS guidance for 2016 and 2017 to reflect the impact of the European Commission decision on our tax rate. Today we are pleased to reaffirm our 2016 and 2017 guidance for adjusted earnings per share despite the negative impact of foreign currency and the change in our operations in Venezuela, which will have a negative impact of $0.06 in 2016 and $0.08 in 2017. Our second objective for 2016 is to ensure the successful launch of new products that are critical for our long-term revenue growth. We are increasing supply for APOQUEL and also launching in new markets. This growth already surpassed $100 million with a limited availability in 2015, and we see significant room to grow from this level with long-term peak sales of more than $300 million. Another important breakthrough in the area of dermatology, our canine antibody therapy against atopic dermatitis has been introduced in the U.S. to veterinarians and dermatologists, and we are preparing for global market availability later in 2016. Meanwhile SIMPARICA, a new oral parasiticide, will help us to better compete in the global market of flea and tick products, a market of approximately $3 billion. SIMPARICA was approved in the EU later last year, and we are awaiting approval in the U.S. this quarter. We expect the launch in both the U.S. and EU in the first quarter of 2016, and see sales ramp up during the year. Our third major objective this year is enhancing the supply and customer service, an area where we fell short last year. As we continue with our supply network strategy, we are making steady improvements, most notably in APOQUEL. We're also investing to build capacity in product categories that will be an important part of our future revenue base. In the near term we believe that a simplified supply chain with fewer manufacturing plants, focused on expanding the set of products will improve our performance. We also remain on track to complete the global implementation of our new Enterprise Resource Planning system, or ERP, in the first quarter. The ERP will support our overall efficiency goals and will help us better manage the processes and information to run our business. And we continue to refine these systems over the course of the year; we'll make certain we are exceeding our customers' expectations. Our fourth major objective is around capital allocation and how we maximize our cost structure, investment in R&D and business development. We are making a good progress in shaping our cost structure as part of the overall efficiency plan we announced last May. That work has been accelerated, and the additional cost savings has been included in our guidance. It is equally important to realize that while we are implementing these plans, we have remained committed to building the three interconnected capabilities that drive our success with customers: U.S. sales, innovative R&D, and high quality and reliable manufacturing and supply. The implementation has been resourced, even as we go through changes in other areas of the company. Our investment in R&D continues showing high return and support for our future growth. I am very pleased to say that our efforts to refresh our portfolio with innovative vaccines offerings, especially in companion animal are paying off. Last year, we launched a new combination vaccine for dogs across the EU called Versican Plus, and has been very well received by customers. In the fourth quarter, Zoetis was granted a conditional license from the USDA to market our canine influenza vaccine, the first conditional licensed vaccine to help control disease associated with canine influenza, the virus that is H3N2. In December, we received our U.S. license for VANGUARD crLyme, a vaccine that aids in the prevention of conditions associated with Lyme disease in dogs. And in November, we expanded our INNOVATOR horse vaccine franchise in the U.S. with the launch of our vaccine to aid in the prevention of leptospirosis. Meanwhile in aquatic health, shortly after closing our deal with PHARMAQ in the fourth quarter, one of their new vaccines for salmon received an emergency license in Chile, one of the world's largest farmed fish markets. Our focus on enhancing our portfolio resulted in recent approvals for new indications and formulation of existing products. In January, Zoetis received FDA approval for an update to the labeling for CERENIA, which allow for intravenous administration during the surgical protocols that use medication that induces vomiting. We launched a new formulation of LUTALYSE, a reproductive product for use in dairy and beef cattle, in the U.S. We are also viewed as a partner of choice, for all innovators in the industry. In January we enter into an agreement with Anatara Lifesciences, a company in Australia. We'll be evaluating their non-antibiotic, anti-infective product as an alternative to antibiotics that could treat and control infections in farm animals. And finally, in terms of business development, we'll continue to look for M&A opportunities like we did last year with Abbott Animal Health and PHARMAQ, while we continue with our internal investment in new products, lifecycle innovation and research alliances. In summary, we delivered an excellent 2015, built in our diverse and market-leading portfolio of products for animal health. We are getting significant traction in the business as we continue reducing complexity, achieving efficiencies, and freeing up resources for our most promising growth opportunities. And we remain well positioned as the industry leader based on our core capabilities and singular focus on animal health. With that, let me turn things over to Paul. Paul?
Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thanks. Thank you, Juan Ramón. Let me put an exclamation point on Juan Ramón's overview of 2015. What a terrific year we had. If you think back to a year ago, we had a number of very challenging initiatives in front of us, most notably, the design and implementation of the efficiency initiative that we announced in May, and also the rollout of our enterprise-wide SAP system in our most important market, the U.S., as well as many other key locations around the world. I can tell you that both of those projects put enormous pressure on the company, on our colleagues, and in some cases impacted our customers. But we were able to stay on task, overcome many challenges, and deliver results that we're very proud of. So let's talk about our performance. We had very strong sales growth in the U.S., up 13% for the full year, driven by good livestock sales primarily in cattle, the addition of Abbott Animal Health, and increased supplies of APOQUEL. In the international business we delivered operational sales growth of 4%, which reflected good performance in major markets like Brazil and China, which grew 11% and 17% respectively, partially offset by the business changes that we are making in Venezuela. We reduced our total operating expenses by 1% on an operational basis in 2015 compared with 2014 while growing revenue 8% operationally. We kicked off our efficiency initiative in May and were able to capture meaningful savings in 2015, particularly in the second half of the year when we reduced our operating expenses by 3% on an operational basis while we were growing revenue 7% operationally. To be fair, the true test of the operating efficiency improvements that we are making will come over the long term. Anyone can cut costs and improve profits in the short term. The challenge is to improve profits and then grow that larger profit pool at an attractive rate. To do that, you need to be thoughtful about where, how, and how much you reduce costs. We continue to prioritize and spend behind activities that deliver value to our customers and therefore support our growth, namely our sales forces, our R&D engine, and our supply chain, so very good stuff for the full year 2015. Let me turn to the quarter quickly. You can read the details of our fourth quarter results in the press release and tables, but let me hit on a few highlights, focusing on themes that may be impactful on our future results, starting with revenue. Again, good operational revenue growth of 6% in the quarter coming against a very strong quarter in 2014. Next, improvement in operating efficiency; total operating expenses were down 8% operationally in the quarter, and this enabled us to grow adjusted net income by 29% operationally. Foreign currency continued to be a strong headwind for us as it is for most multi-nationals. Changes in FX rates reduced Q4 reported revenue growth compared with the prior-year quarter by some 900 basis points. There's a word for that; it's brutal. Setting aside FX, we feel very good about the underlying drivers of our operational; that is, constant currency revenue growth. For the quarter, the 6% operational revenue growth included 3% from increased APOQUEL sales due to better supply, 3% from the acquisition of the Abbott Animal Health products, 2% from price increases across the portfolio, and 1% from new products. Yet these drivers were partially offset by a 3% decline of in-line product revenues. I want to point out that's primarily related to ongoing changes to our business model in Venezuela and other countries like India, which were initiated as part of our efficiency program. As I said previously, the changes we have made and are making to our business model in certain markets impacted our second half 2015 performance and will have impact on our 2016 revenue growth. But these changes improve our prospects for longer-term revenue and profit growth. That's the prize. In the case of Venezuela, you'll recall that we are reducing our activities there due to unfavorable economic conditions for multi-national companies. We've been selling down our inventories in the country, limiting our future exports to Venezuela, and this quarter we decided to revalue our assets and liabilities there, based on the free floating SIMADI exchange rate. In the case of India, we remain committed to our business there, especially in our companion animal and poultry businesses, with a direct field force. However, we are making changes in our approach to the dairy segment. That segment has not consolidated in the way that we had expected over the last several years, and so we are eliminating our dairy field force there and pursuing a distributor partnership to serve those market needs. It's worth noting that revenue from our other emerging market geography includes Venezuela and India, and declined 3% operationally in the fourth quarter. If you want to go back and you can exclude India and Venezuela, other emerging markets would have grown by 12%. The other emerging markets segment will continue to be an area where we see some noise in 2016, as it includes the countries that will be most significantly impacted by the SKU reductions, as well as market changes that we are undertaking as part of our efficiency programs. While I'm on the subject of international markets, I know there continues to be general concerns with the outlook for countries like China and Brazil, given lots of recent media reports about their slower GDP growth and their economic outlooks. Generally, demand for animal health products is tied to more stable growth drivers, mainly the demand for animal proteins and the increased adoption and medicalization of pets, both of which move as a function of population, income, and urbanization. Fundamentals in the animal health segments of both China and Brazil remain strong, and here's the proof. For the full year 2015, we grew revenue in China and Brazil on an operational basis 17% and 11% respectively. In the fourth quarter, China and Brazil grew 14% and 10% respectively. Both markets on a constant currency basis are growing at healthy rates and the growth prospects of these markets remain solid. And so I pose the question rhetorically. Why is that? For China it's two things. One is the fact that the consumption of animal proteins in China is growing and has continued to grow even in challenging economic times. Second is the goal of the Chinese government to see an improvement in the productivity, safety, and quality of their food supply. That means moving from smaller farms producing animal proteins to a more industrialized model, and that model requires more animal health products to maintain and drive the productivity of the business. Now frankly, as I'm saying this, the second factor should be the first. It's a powerful driver, and it will last for many years. Now turning to Brazil, Brazil is a very developed livestock market, and domestic consumption of animal protein is only a part of the equation. Brazil is a significant exporter of meat. And so to the extent that the consumption falls within their borders, they have the opportunity to use exports to maintain the health of their livestock businesses. With the weakness of the real, exports are even more attractive today. So counter to what you might conclude when seeing negative headlines about conditions in Brazil, the Brazilian livestock industry and the supporting animal health industry are quite strong. Using China and Brazil as examples, the key takeaway should be that we operate in an industry that's very resilient. Now I use that word quite a bit, even in times of economic stress, and that applies to developed as well as emerging markets. Turning to restructuring charges, this quarter we had significant one-time costs that drove a decrease in our reported GAAP net income and earnings per share. Let me explain this quarter's major charges in terms of the three buckets that we use. First, the standup costs which are mainly associated with our separation from Pfizer totaled $34 million in the quarter. That work will be substantially completed by mid-2016. We recorded $4 million of costs associated with our supply network strategy, and we are still in the early days of that initiative. And we also recorded $52 million of one-time costs associated with our operational efficiency initiative which reflected the acceleration of some of those plans and the associated costs into the fourth quarter of 2015. And finally, we have taken accounting actions related to the revaluation of our bolivar-denominated assets and liabilities in Venezuela this quarter. We believe it's appropriate to change to the SIMADI rate as our exchange rate for Venezuela. And accordingly, we recorded charges of approximately $93 million in the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, we also announced the sale or exit of five manufacturing sites in the U.S., India and Taiwan, which we expect to generate proceeds in excess of $80 million of cash during 2016. Turning to guidance, we've provided a bridge in our tables and slides to help show the changes in our guidance for 2016 and 2017, to spotlight the impact of changes in FX rates and changes to our operations in Venezuela. We now expect for the full year 2016 revenue of between $4.65 billion to $4.775 billion, reported diluted EPS of between $1.30 and $1.48 per share, and adjusted diluted EPS between $1.71 and $1.81 per share. For full year 2017, we expect revenue between $4.95 billion and $5.15 billion, reported diluted EPS of between $1.95 and $2.13 per share, and adjusted diluted EPS between $2.18 and $2.32 per share. Our revised guidance reflects the impact of the European Commission's decision on Belgium's tax rulings and the related effect on our earnings, which we disclosed in early January. Our effective tax rate on adjusted pre-tax income is expected to be approximately 33% in 2016 and 30% in 2017. In January we communicated that the changes to our tax rates reduced our expectations for adjusted diluted EPS guidance for 2016 and 2017 by $0.13 and $0.06 per share respectively. Note that we expect to record one-time net tax charges during 2016 of approximately $55 million, of which approximately $35 million to $45 million will be recorded in Q1. These Q1 charges relate to the nullification of our Belgium tax ruling by the European Commission for the periods from 2013 through 2015. Included in the total $55 million charge is an estimate of a future impact of the revaluation of deferred tax accounts currently associated with our Belgium operation. You can see these $55 million of one-time costs footnoted in our guidance bridge for 2016. Our revised guidance today also reflects our latest views of our operations in Venezuela, updated FX rates as of the end of January, and other efficiency improvements to offset some of those impacts. Here's some really good news. Other than the impact of the change to our expected tax rate due to the EC ruling, a factor over which we had no control, we're holding our guidance range for adjusted earnings per share for both 2016 and 2017. We expect the momentum that we carried through Q4 combined with the expected pace and magnitude of the efficiency initiative should enable us to offset the unrelenting headwinds of FX rates and the change to our business model in Venezuela. Yeah, we're proud of that. And since I have the floor and I like to talk about our company, here's my summary of the year. Looking back at 2015, what you see is another year where the global animal health industry posted solid mid-single-digit growth despite many challenges in many economies around the world. And you saw our company, Zoetis, deliver strong operational growth of revenue, up 8%, by pulling on all of the levers that we have available to us: the best animal health sales forces on the planet, the most productive R&D team in the industry, value-generative M&A, and a supply chain that is a core strength of the company. And we delivered operational growth of adjusted earnings per share of 24% for the year. And I'm going to repeat that because it's awesome. Adjusted earnings per share for the full year 2015 increased 24% on a constant currency basis to $1.77 per share. I call out the $1.77 because while we always measure ourselves on a constant currency basis, at the end of the day we put an actual dollar amount on the tape. Way back in November of 2014 we put 2015 guidance on the – excuse me – 2015 guidance on the table. We guided revenue in the range of $4.85 billion to $4.95 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $1.61 to $1.68. Since that time, we, like many multinational companies, have been battered by FX that dramatically reduced our reported revenues. But here's where we're different from many of those other multinationals. Throughout 2015 we held the line on our guidance for adjusted earnings per share and in November of 2015 we actually raised the range to $1.70 to $1.74. And now we report actual results of $1.77 per share. We're able to do that because we as a management team brought forward a plan in May of last year to improve the efficiency of our cost structure and then we as a team got after it and reduced and controlled expenses to give us the best shot in delivering to you, our shareholders, the best earnings we could under the circumstances. As I love to say, pretty good. So here's my pitch. The global animal health industry is not just resilient; it has characteristics that point to an extended period of predictable mid-single-digit growth. And the number one company in the global animal health industry is Zoetis. In the three years since we've been public, we've put results on the board that support what we see as our key value drivers. First, we can grow our revenues at a rate equal to or faster than the mid-single-digit growth rate expected for our industry. Second, we can leverage our expense structure to drive increasing operating margins, delivering profit growth faster than revenue growth. And third, we can intelligently allocate our capital; actively manage our capital structure to grow adjusted earnings per share faster than operating profits. In today's dystopian financial markets where investors may be looking for shelter from the storm, I think my suggestion would be to look at companies in reverse alphabetical order and start with Z for Zoetis. That's it for my prepared remarks. Let's get to Q&A. Keith?
Operator: Okay. We can take our first question from Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Good morning, thanks for taking the questions. I guess, Paul, could you just go back to the contributions from acquisitions in the quarter? I kind of missed those prepared remarks. And then, Juan Ramón, I wanted to get an update on SIMPARICA as well. I think in the press release it says you expect approval now in Q1. I think previously you said first half of 2016 so I guess what's the change and what should we expect heading into Western Vet?
Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, I'll start, Kevin. Good morning. It's Paul. I'll start with the components of the growth. We had 6% operational revenue growth in the quarter and we recognize the goal was whole percentages here so there's rounding that comes into play but it was 3% from increased APOQUEL sales, 3% from the acquisition of the Abbott Animal Health products, 2% from price increase across the portfolio, and 1% from new products. Then the offset to that was about a 3% decline of what I guess we'll call revenues of all other products. And again, that is primarily related to the change in the business model in Venezuela and countries like India and places that were affected by our efficiency initiative. I hope that answers the question.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Paul. I will take the question on the SIMPARICA. So we submitted to the FDA all the information and based on the normal timing for approval, we expect SIMPARICA to be approved in the U.S. in the first quarter. This all will be depending on final decision of the FDA. Next question, please?
Operator: And our next question comes from Louise Chen with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.
Louise Chen - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So I do see slide 18 in your presentation but I was wondering if you could help us better understand the underlying sales growth for the year without the impact from restructuring and SKU reductions? And then also, do you expect your sales growth to accelerate after these programs are completed? And when might we actually see that? Thanks.
Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Sure. Louise, its Paul. Let me take that, and thank you for asking the question, Louise, because if you just take the headline and say, gee, we're looking at 2% to 4% operational growth in revenue next year, people say, what's up with that? So let's start with from the 2% to 4%, the operational efficiency initiative, the effect on SKUs, and now Venezuela and other markets where we're going to change our model, reduced that by some 600 basis points. You can see that if you look at that slide 18, 600 basis points. So there's 8% to 10% if you're thinking about what our actual expectations are for normalized operational revenue growth in 2016 v. 2015. And if you want to take PHARMAQ out of the equation and go what's the organic portion of that, it's about 200 basis points. So as you look at that slide, again I'll call everyone's attention to it, we tried our level best to help you think about the strength of 2016 because this is quite a strong year by showing you this waterfall slide. So 2% to 4%, 600 basis points on the efficiency initiative, SKU reductions, Venezuela, India, et cetera, gets you to 8% to 10%, and if you want to look at that on an organic basis it would be 6% to 8% by taking PHARMAQ out of the mix. Before I concede the floor, I want to say two things before I talk about 2016, because we did change from 3% to 5% operational growth to 2% to 4%. That is predominantly because we had previously articulated that range at the midpoint of our 2015 guidance for revenue. And as you saw, we had strong revenue in Q4, and for 2015 it was about $25 million higher than that. And that accounts for the change from 3% to 5% down to 2% to 4%. We feel really good about what we put on the table in 2015. And as we think about it, we really are excited about 2016, even though it will be masked a little bit by the changes that we are making to our model. Now last before I concede the floor, you asked the question about what could we expect in 2017. We expect a return to the same kind of solid growth that you would have expected in 2016 but for the change in the efficiency initiative. We're currently forecasting on an operational basis 5% to 9%. That's pretty solid, and that's being driven mainly by new products. Next question, please.
Operator: And the next question comes from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets.
Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good morning, folks. Thank you for all the details on the slides and congratulations on a strong operational performance in 2015. Paul, cost of sales grew at a higher rate than revenues in the quarter, and as a result gross margin was lower year over year and sequentially versus 3Q. I was wondering if you could give us your thoughts there on gross margin. And just a general question for the both of you, your stock has obviously been underperforming despite this strong operational performance. I'm wondering if you could give us your thoughts on that. And is there an opportunity for a more aggressive share buyback at these levels? Thank you.
Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Sure, it's Paul. I'll take the Q4 margin. That was predominantly due to FX. Again, I would look at the full year and how we came out, and it was in line with what we were expecting. I know, Alex, we've traveled together a little bit. You look at a quarter; there can be a lot of variability that sneaks into the equation. You compare it against this, that and the other thing. Things happen in a 90-day period that smooth themselves out over the year. I would look at the 65%-odd margin that we put on the board for the full year, and that's indicative of the strength. But the one thing in the fourth quarter was FX. FX is hard to forecast when it flows through cost of sales, but it sure does. The second thing I think you asked a question about the share price. We're watching our company along with many others lose value, at least in the eyes of shareholders or people who are holding our stock. We continue to do what we can do. We're driving real fundamental value. You posed the question about our share buyback and the scale of that, et cetera. I'd point out that when we were last in the window I guess, which was in the early part of November, the stock was $43 – $44, I think, and I'm going from memory here, $43 – $44. And we elected at that point in time to increase the pace of our purchases. As everybody can do the math, we bought about $50 million a quarter through 2015. We're currently buying stock back at a pace of about $75 million a quarter. I know that's not a ton. But as I said also many times, we had a lot of calls on cash in 2016, but even so we elected to increase the pace at which we were wanting to acquire shares. So I hope that answers the questions.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director: I will add a comment here, Alex. I think that in many cases our company is still associated with the human pharmaceutical industry. And discussions on prices, for instance, have been affecting the human pharmaceutical industry, while this should not be having any impact in our share value. Our prices, as I mentioned in my comments, are completely dependent on third-party payers. We price based on the value that we can demonstrate to our customers, and our customers are not only buying and paying the products they buy from us. So this is something that in my opinion should be also included when different investors or analysts also define the value of Zoetis and also the value of the animal health industry in general.
Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Next question, please.
Operator: And the next question is from Erin Wilson with Credit Suisse.
Erin Wilson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great, thanks for taking my questions. How should we think about the quarterly progression of the U.S. livestock business? And could you characterize the overall health of the U.S. livestock industry just more broadly? And then one on R&D; on the parasiticide front, should we expect that you're ready to launch as soon as SIMPARICA gets approval in the U.S.? And then with the potential flea, tick, and heartworm combination chewable product, longer term, how long in the pipeline, or how far along in the pipeline is this product? And when should we expect it I guess to launch, and is it in the guidance?
Juan Ramón Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director: So thank you, Erin, for your question. In terms of the launch of SIMPARICA, we are ready to launch as soon as we get approval from the FDA. We're also ready to launch not only in U.S. but also in the European markets. And the team is ready, the plans are in place, and we have a product to supply to the market. You also asked a question about the livestock progression in the U.S. And definitely we have seen that in general the livestock has been performing well in 2015. In terms of the quarters, the fourth quarter has been stronger than expected because already in the last year, we reported very strong revenue growth, and in this year also we grew significantly. And in terms of the different areas of livestock, we see also opportunities in cattle, we see opportunities in poultry, and we see opportunities also in swine. We expect also in 2016, the momentum will continue. We see positive trends in the cattle industry, mainly on beef; that we expect that the number of animals will increase by 3% or 3.5%. And this will expect, also will drive additional use of animal health products. And you also asked about...
Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: The combination product.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director: The flea and tick and the heartworm. Definitely, our R&D team is working on developing this product and finalizing all the information for submitting all the dossiers to the FDA. We have not yet communicated when we plan to have this product into the market. As we get closer to the finalization of all the different filings, then we'll communicate to the market. And this has not been included in our guidance for 2017. So next question, please.
Operator: We'll go next to John Kreger with William Blair.
John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi, thanks very much. You mentioned that you had some issues last year with customer service. I think you said mainly around APOQUEL. Can you just expand upon that? Is that issue behind you? How comfortable are you that you will not have any residual issues as we move through 2016? And then, Paul, maybe just talk a little bit more about longer term, your tax rate thoughts? Do you think 30% is the long term right number to use, or is there an opportunity to maybe push that lower? Thanks.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director: So we have had supply issues for APOQUEL, and the supply issue has been resolved now. We have now the process for the production of the active pharmaceutical ingredient that had been the bottleneck of manufacturing APOQUEL. We have a process which is much more robust and much more consistent. And we are really producing all the product that will be delivered in 2016, and we'll increase significantly the supply to the market. We are also planning to expand APOQUEL to the rest of the world in where the product has been approved, and we plan to do that in 2016. So we are convinced that APOQUEL will deliver significant growth and all the issues that we faced in 2015 will be behind us. We also reported in 2015 that the implementation of the new ERP also created some issues in terms of deliveries of products into the market. We are very pleased now how the implementation of the ERP has been now performed in the U.S. We have now 90% of our orders delivered the same day, which is a significant achievement, and we are working on improving there, the rest of the functions that also are provided to the customers. We expect that also the ERP, will be supporting our operations in a very efficient way in 2016. And this is something we plan to finalize all implementation of the new system in this quarter, and then moving forward, to maximize the way that we'll be supporting our business.
Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: John, its Paul. I'll take the tax question. First let me just say we were very disappointed with the European Commission's kind of stating that the Belgium tax rulings like we had are illegal, and essentially nullified our arrangement there. We're disappointed because the Belgians have been very supportive; we've built a terrific operation there. I think I've said in a prior public forum, the Belgians on the contrary, have been one of the more responsible countries with respect to tax policy and how they used it to attract employment and investment into their country and it's a shame. So set that aside, we're very disappointed. It obviously was not something that we were planning on. And let's pretend that, that didn't happen for a second. We had previously articulated, we thought our tax rate in, call it 2017, would have been on the order of 28%, our adjusted ETR roughly 28%, and now it's 30%. So we lost a couple of hundred basis points there in 2017. But what I would suggest to you is, just as we had articulated with respect to our structure before this happened, we can grind that down, but we wouldn't be grinding it down. The frustrating thing for us is, we were doing pretty well, fine tuning our global operating model to be efficient and here we have to go back and we have to change course a little bit. So not something – it was not a happy day for us but we're responding the best way that we can. And I think the way we look at it is we just add 200 basis points higher ETR in 2017 and our job is to grind that down. Next question, please.
Operator: And the next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.
Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Thanks very much. Just a couple of here. First, on the 6% impact from the SKU reduction in 2016, I guess now that we're further along in that process, any surprises in terms of customer behavior, in terms of the SKU changes? And I guess is there an opportunity for that number to be lower than 6%, either through uptake of alternatives of those products, or just other initiatives you put in place? And the second question which is as we're looking out 2016, just any dynamics we should be keeping in mind for modeling this year in terms of quarterly progression? I guess are there any particularly difficult or easy comps that we should be watching as we're kind of thinking about the quarters this year? Thanks very much.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Chris. What we evaluated very carefully when we decided to reduce SKUs on how will be the impact to our customers, we made sure that none of the SKUs that we are eliminating has no alternative to our customers. These alternatives can be from our competitors or can be alternatives, in our portfolio. The 6% impact in our revenues is the net result of reduction and also the assumption that some of these reductions of SKUs will be moved to other SKUs in our portfolio. In terms of reaction from our customers, I think in some cases, well, they will like to have these products in their portfolio, but they also understand that more important than offering 13,000 SKUs is ensuring that we have a reliable supply. What we want to make sure that when they place an order, they get the order on time to treat or protect the animals. And this is one of the important strategic rationales for our SKU rationalization. It was not only to improve gross margin, but also to ensure that our supply to the market is much more consistent and we can meet all customer submissions. And then Paul will take the question on the phasing in terms of quarters.
Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I think there are two things that I'd be mindful of; one is how the SKU reduction plays out with respect to our revenues. You'll recall that we announced this program in the middle part of 2015, and so we're just starting to see here in Q4 an alignment to Q1 and Q2, the impacts of the SKU rationalization. And it will be relative to the prior year, it will be a significant factor. But we will have to keep our eye on. The second part is with respect to our cost, our efficiency initiative. We continue to ramp up the amount of savings that we are seeing flow through, and of course the first half of last year we had a modest amount of cost containment or that occurred in the first half, but that steps up and we currently are tracking, as you saw, with an 8% operational reduction in operating expenses in Q4, tracking at a much lower rate, so that will be a very helpful driver on the operating expense side in the first half of the year, and then that benefit, if you will, comparing back to the prior year will moderate over the second half of the year. I think that's about all we want to cover on phasing. Just lastly, I'll say it again and again and again, we look at our business on a yearly basis. Trying to – I know you have to and that's what you do and all, and we'll try to be as helpful as we can with respect to the phasing but we run our business on an annual basis. Next question, please.
Operator: Our next question is from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.
Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Just a couple. First, Paul, maybe you can answer this. On the 2% contribution from price, can you talk about the outlook? How did that look on a global basis U.S. versus outside of the U.S.? And what is the outlook for price increases going forward both in the U.S. and across different geographies. And then, Juan Ramón, just a question for you; as you are now, congratulations, three years as an independent company and it's been very exciting to see how Zoetis has evolved and achieved such tremendous success in a short period of time. Congratulations. But maybe you could just sort of step back and tell us – when I look at the industry, the animal health industry, it doesn't seem that a whole lot has changed. It still remains highly fragmented. We've seen a little bit of movement with Novartis swapping its business to Lilly. You've made a couple small acquisitions. But by and large, the industry hasn't changed much. Do you see more consolidation going forward? Or do you see some of your peers spinning out their animal health businesses like you have done for yourself? And what does this all mean for your future in terms of M&A? Thanks very much.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Jami. And I will try to answer both questions. So in terms of the 2%, so the 2%, as you mentioned, it's a global increase. And in terms of where we see this 2% in the different geographies, definitely we have been very consistent in the U.S. with price increases of around 2%. And in the rest of the markets, it depends. So in high inflationary markets, we increased significantly the prices to compensate for inflation and also to compensate for foreign exchange. In some markets where the economies are – the inflation is very stable or probably not having any inflation at all, so we are also trying to adjust our prices based on these situations. So in Europe or Japan and some other markets we have been increasing prices but at a lower rate than in the U.S. or some of the markets where we had the opportunity to increase the prices because of inflation. The second question was related to the consolidation of the industry and the top four or five now animal healthcare companies represent almost 70% of the total market, which has already been increased significantly from some years ago. Do I see opportunities for further consolidation? I think there are still opportunities, especially on the second tier of companies, after these four or five companies we see opportunities for the consolidation. We expect now the merger of Boehringer Ingelheim and Merial being completed, there's another round of consolidation, and maybe in the future also we'll see some additional consolidation. Definitely the consolidation would be limited because of antitrust issues, but without these antitrust issues or managing these antitrust issues, definitely consolidation can represent a good opportunity for the animal health industry. The last comment I want to add is that the top 10 companies in animal health represent something like 80% of the total market. On the 20% which is remaining we have maybe hundreds of companies that in -where I expect that this will be a significant consolidation here. And Paul will add some comments in terms of the pricing.
Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Sure. I mean Jami asked a specific question. I think Jami was trying to get to where is our pricing power. For the full year, emphasis full year, our price added approximately – a little better than 2% overall but U.S. is about 2% and international was about 3%. Again, a lot of rounding here, but more price increases outside the U.S. than in. Next question, please.
Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you, Paul.
Operator: The next question comes from Doug Tsao with Barclays.
Douglas Tsao - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe if you could provide a little bit more of an update in terms of how you will sort of increase the availability of APOQUEL, is this what we start now in terms of broadening the number of veterinarians who will have access to the product? Or is it going to be focused more on current – expanding to new patients? Also, if you can just provide some commentary in terms of the MFA business and how it's faring right now? One of your competitors spoke about some regulatory headwinds in that business and whether you're seeing those as well? Thank you.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Doug. In terms of the increase for APOQUEL, so let me start saying that we have now two sources of the production of API and the second source that will be a company in Switzerland which is called Siegfried will double the capacity of the production of the active pharmaceutical ingredient. We plan to now offer APOQUEL to more veterinarians and also to offer more available product to existing veterinarians. At the same time, also the plan is to introduce the product in the rest of the markets where the product was put on hold because of product availability. So we are convinced that during 2016 we'll be able to meet all the demand from the market. In terms of MFAs, I think MFAs in our case continue growing very strongly and we have the advantage of – that's right this is the diversity of our portfolio. It's not only diversity in terms of therapeutic areas or in terms of different types of products, but also within the MFAs we have a lot of diversity. And for products that will be maybe facing some challenge because of changes on the approach of the use of antibiotics, and I mentioned in the medical important antibiotics in MFAs with indication of a growth promotion, this will be eliminated but in our portfolio we also have a non-medical important antibiotics in MFAs that can be a good replacement for those that will be eliminated. We have in total in MFAs $500 million in sales and we grew operationally in 2015 by 8%. So definitely we expect that those are probably the only indication of growth promotion which are medically important for human health that will have an impact in the revenues but this impact will be minimum. Next question, please.
Operator: We'll go next to Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore ISI.
Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI: Hey, Paul. My email went up during your prepared remarks. I just wanted to say that it was really a brutally awesome prepared remarks section, especially the part about how we should reverse the alphabet, I love that. That's a great idea. But in all seriousness, I had a bunch of questions, but I'll limit it to 1.5 because most people have been doing it. Number one, given all the opacity that – you guys have tried to do everything you can to make it clear but this the confusion, I guess, that FX potentially creates, why not synthetically hedge against the effects on that at least in that net income line especially after the turmoil this year, although you guys have done a great job helping us understand the effect. And then number two, maybe I missed this, but I didn't hear you break out APOQUEL sales on 4Q. I was wondering if you could. I apologize if I just missed it, if you could break those out in the U.S. and also the rest of world. And if you already answered that one, then my question would be the 6% to 8% normalized organic operational growth, what are the components of that for 2016 that you see? Thanks.
Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Sure, I'll start with the FX. I think when you're looking at trying to hedge operations around the world against foreign currencies, you have two choices. You can either, in non-technical terms, let it fly, which is what we do with respect to operations like many, many other multinational companies do, or you can attempt to hedge. If you hedge, you hedge within a quarter, and the analysis that we've done has suggested that you're essentially chasing down. You limit the cost of the hedges, ultimately make it like a less than fruitful exercise. Now others will tell you that they can do it, and that's okay. That would be their point of view. I point out that a couple of the currencies that tend to be the most volatile, there are not markets for us to go out and hedge. I think they're not deep enough. They're not efficient enough. And so you wouldn't be able to fully offset that. I think I love your word there, opacity. I might have mispronounced that. We're trying our best to let the market follow along with as much of the information that we have that we can share with you so you can decide how we're performing. We do now, and we will continue to manage ourselves on an operational basis, meaning a constant currency basis. And I will hope against hope perhaps that at some point in the future here we'll see some more stability in the foreign exchange rates, and that we'll enjoy the positive upside, not from an operational perspective, but from a reported perspective of currency, FX rates going in the opposite direction. Juan, do you want to take the APOQUEL sales, or would you like me to?
Juan Ramón Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director: The APOQUEL sales, I think we had more than $100 million in 2015. It's about $110 million. This was below initial expectations. And the only reason for that was that ensuring that we have enough product to supply to customers, and not increasing the number of customers having access until we have the certainty that the product would be available. Now we're having a situation that we increase significantly the production, and we'll be able to increase the deliveries to our customers. Globally in international markets, I think we had about $40 million, and then the rest was in the U.S. But it's important to understand that in international markets it was very limited number of countries where we have the product available in the market. You also asked about components of our organic growth, 6% to 8%, and Paul will provide the details of this.
Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Sure, I'll start. First of all, we expect to continue to be able to take consistent price across our portfolio. That's a driver. Second is there's a significant impact from new products in 2016, which frankly will be an even bigger impact on 2017, and then just performance of our portfolio. When I say new products, I'm focusing on the ones that you can see that make a difference. I'd point out that we have lots of new products that we don't talk about necessarily individually and maybe individually don't move the needle, but in the aggregate they sure do. 6% to 8% normalized operational growth in revenue next year would be terrific, and then again going into 2017 new products help even more.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director: And, Mark, let me correct the total revenue that we generated internationally. Internationally was $20 million and then the rest was in the U.S. And I want to insist that in the international markets we have very limited number of markets and also limited supply. So the potential in both U.S. and international is much higher. So next question, please.
Operator: We'll go next to David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.
David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yes, thanks very much. My questions are financial. Obviously, you've covered a lot of ground on the business and the outlook. So, Paul, two questions. First, could you please discuss the outlook for 2016 cash flow, including cash flow from operations and then planned uses of cash? And then second, if you could, just comment on the quarterly progression throughout the year, just to make sure that we set up our models appropriately and we understand the different variables to consider. Thanks very much.
Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Sure, I'll start with the discussion around expected cash flow. Recall that we try to call them out each and every quarter. We have a large amount of expenses that we're incurring with respect to: one, the standup from Pfizer; second, the operational efficiency initiative; and now we add to the list a potential true-up of our international taxes in light of the EC's comments. If you look at our guidance tables, we call out the amount or the expected amount of the acquisition costs that we expect to incur in 2016 and then again in 2017. Those are I would call them – they're not normal and they will go away, and most of them will go away towards the latter part of 2016. But in 2016 it's a fairly significant call on our cash. Secondarily, we continue to be in a phase of investing in our supply chain. We continue to invest capital there, so our CapEx is tracking at a rate that exceeds our ongoing depreciation rate, so net-net we continue to invest there. Of course, we called out that we now have a program that everybody can do the math, where at least the current expectation is we're purchasing shares at the rate of $75 million a quarter. It's $300 million this year plus our dividend. You can do that math. And those are other than our earnings are the things that you need to take into consideration when thinking about our cash flow. I don't want to stop without speaking about efficiency of working capital. That is something that is to come. It's not something that you would see necessarily in 2015 and not in an enormous way in 2016. By the end of this quarter, we expect to have our ERP system up and running in all of our locations around the world, which is going to give us the ability to then implement tools, to much better manage primarily our investment in our inventories. Our receivables, I think we do a pretty good job there, and we certainly do the same things as everyone else with respect to payables. But we will not start to see some maybe significant cash flow from the improvement in cost of working capital really until 2017. I wasn't specific there, David. I wasn't specific for the reason we don't want to provide specific guidance with respect to free cash flow, but I believe we've provided each of the components that will enable you to look out to 2016, 2017, and then beyond. I think when you get out into the latter part of this decade, our depreciation should start to normalize at a level close to our depreciation amount. I'll stop there.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director: You also asked about the quarterly progression for 2016. Let me provide a couple of comments here. So first we expect that the new product launches will have no impact in the first quarter and we expect that these products ramping up during the year. Also APOQUEL, we expect that the biggest impact we'll see from the second quarter of 2016 as we also extend the product availability in the markets where the product has been already introduced, and we also launch in new markets. In terms of expenses of course, also our efficiency program, will have much more impact in the second half than in the first half, because in the second half, we plan really to complete most of the actions that we took as part of the announcements that we made in May, and this also will have a positive impact in our results in the second half of the year. Next question please.
Operator: We'll go next to Kathy Miner with Cowen & Company.
Kathy M. Miner - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you, good morning. Two questions, one first on PHARMAQ. When you acquired the company, you had stated that it was growing about 17%. Is that still a good estimate going forward, or could it be higher given their late stage pipeline that you talked about? And also do you continue to expect it to be neutral to EPS this year and then accretive thereafter, or could that accelerate? And the second question just has to do on trends outside of the U.S. in livestock. We saw the issue in France last year where they changed the legislation on antibiotics. Are there any other areas that we should look for in 2016 where there may be similar changes? Thank you.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director: So Thank you, Kathy, for the questions. In PHARMAQ, what we communicated is that we plan to generate that revenue for $100 million in 2016 and $125 million in 2017 and at the end of the year PHARMAQ reported revenues of close to $80 million, so we see a significant increase in terms of our revenues. What we saw during the due diligence when we acquire in terms of the pipeline, it's performing now with the launch of the product in Chile that it was under this emergency license. And we will continue progressing in the plans that we have for PHARMAQ. So we are very excited about the opportunities of PHARMAQ. We are working also in terms of integrating the two companies, but ensuring that PHARMAQ remains a leader in aquatic health with enough identity to maximize the relationship with the customers that they already built through many years. In terms of the comments that you made, in France, definitely in 2015 we saw an impact because of the change of the legislation in France. This was affecting antibiotics. We expect also that antibiotics will continue having discussions and restrictions in some of the markets. This has been incorporated in our guidance for 2016 and 2017. And we also think that the projections that external sources are making about the total animal health industry and also the growth in antibiotics are consistent with what with our projections. So the industry will be growing about 5%. Antibiotics is expected to grow at half of this rate. The advantage for Zoetis is that it will have in our portfolio, antibiotics which are injectables, which are considered as premium antibiotics that are kept by veterinarians as a resource to ensure that they are treating and in some cases protecting also animals against infections. So we are confident that the impact that it will have in antibiotics will be lower in our revenue, but in any case all these elements have been incorporated in our projections. Next question, please.
Operator: We'll go next to Jeff Holford with Jefferies. Jeff, if you want to check your mute button please?
Jeffrey Holford - Jefferies LLC: Hi. Can you hear me now?
Juan Ramón Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, we can.
Jeffrey Holford - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you. Good morning. I just want to ask a couple of questions around Sanofi and Boehringer. First off, if you expect that business combination or that potential business combination to have any impact on the competitive environment for you as you go forward into 2017 and beyond, any specific areas of concern or opportunity there? And then second, just as you got two European companies coming together there. You've talked very briefly in the past about potential inversions, lack of opportunities, that's potentially two less opportunities now. Just any updated thoughts there is that's really looking beyond you now to potentially look at any kind of inversions or spin-versions out there. Thank you.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Jeff, for the question and definitely the Sanofi/BI merger will create a very strong competitor. It will be the second largest animal health company in our industry. But we don't think that the combination of the two companies will create additional competitive challenge to Zoetis. We have the scale, we have the diversity, and we have the business model that has been proven very successful in the past and will continue also being successful in the future. The productivity that we have in R&D is also showing very high levels. So we are confident that we'll continue growing in line, or faster than market. So we are projecting in fact in 2016 and 2017 we're growing faster than market despite of Sanofi/BI or despite of all these additional consolidations in our industry. Sanofi and BI, they are two European companies that potentially can be, maybe an opportunity for tax inversion, but also creating significant anti-trust issues to Zoetis. So we continue assessing opportunities that, to further consolidate, not with the only objective of saving on tax, but a combination of synergies that we can generate in terms of revenue, in terms of costs, opportunities on reducing our effective tax rate, and definitely creating a value to the company. Next question, please.
Operator: Next we'll go for a follow-up with Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray.
Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Hey. I was just wondering if you could comment about the, I guess Juan Ramón, did you say you guys have – supply of SIMPARICA is ready for launch? I just wanted to make sure I had that right.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. I said that SIMPARICA product is ready for launch and as soon as we have approval for FDA, we'll be launching that in the U.S. and also in Europe. So we have the product in our warehouses.
Operator: And it does appear we have no further questions. I'll return the floor to you, Juan Ramón, for closing remarks.
Juan Ramón Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you very much. And thank you for joining us today. As we continue through 2016, we are determined to make the most of our business model, our interconnected capabilities and the fundamental drivers of growth in animal health. We'll complete our operational changes, becoming less complex, more efficient and more agile. And we'll invest in growth opportunities to strengthen our business. I am confident that these steps will help improve our margins, better serve our customers and build shareholder value over the long term. And I look forward to reporting to you on our progress in each of these areas. Thank you very much.

Operator: Good day and welcome to the Third Quarter 2015 Financial Results Conference Call and Webcast for Zoetis. Hosting the call today is John O'Connor, Vice President of Investor Relations for Zoetis. The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, and will not be forwarded automatically. In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call via dial-in or on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for your questions following the presentation. In the interest of time, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and then queue up again with any follow-ups. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to John O'Connor. John, you may begin.
John O'Connor - Investor Relations Officer: Thank you, operator. Good morning and welcome to the Zoetis third quarter 2015 earnings call. I'm joined today by Juan Ramón Alaix, our Chief Executive Officer, and Paul Herendeen, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statement in today's press release and our SEC filings including, but not limited to, our 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K and our Reports on Form 10-Q. Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures which were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or US GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable US GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and in the company's 8-K filing dated today, November 3, 2015. We also cite operational results which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. With that, I will turn the call over to Juan Ramón.
Juan Ramón Alaix - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, John. And good morning, everyone. Today I will discuss our performance for the third quarter and make comments about the acquisition of PHARMAQ, which we announced last night. Paul will then update you on our guidance for 2015, 2016 and 2017. All of the growth rates I'm discussing today are operational, excluding the impact of foreign exchange currency. I am very pleased to report that this quarter we continued to deliver strong revenue and adjusted net income growth based on our diverse portfolio of high-quality products, excellence in execution and our continued discipline on cost and expenses. Despite some global economic challenges, the animal health industry remains resilient based on the strong fundamental drivers for improved protein production and healthier pets. Our growth strategies and resources are aligned against these drivers to expand our market leadership in the industry. The acquisition of PHARMAQ, a market-leading company in aquatic health, is an example of this growth strategy and will bring us another platform to strengthen our Livestock business. This quarter's growth was largely due to the performance of our Livestock business in the U.S., the integration of Abbott Animal Health products into our business and the growth of recent product launches, led by APOQUEL. During the third quarter, we generated operational growth of 9% revenue and 31% in adjusted net income, delivering adjusted diluted EPS of $0.50 per share. And thanks to our efficiency improvement, reported adjusted net income grew 22% despite a negative impact of foreign currency, which resulted in flat revenue growth. As we break down our third quarter revenue via species, Companion Animal grew 18% due to the additional sales from Abbott Animal Health and the continued performance of key brands, such as APOQUEL in the dermatology space, REVOLUTION in parasiticides, as well as CERENIA, PROHEART and CONVENIA. I'm very positive about the progress we have made on the integration of Abbott Animal Health and we expect to exceed the targets we set from this acquisition in terms of revenues and cost synergies. In Livestock we grew 5%, driven by strong growth in cattle, which was tempered by relatively flat sales in swine and poultry. Cattle grew 8%. We were able to capitalize on favorable market conditions in the U.S. and Brazil with our key brands and some recent product launches. This growth was partially offset by the impact of our business reduction in Venezuela and lower sales in France. As you may recall, we had increased customers' orders in France last year that came ahead of the introduction of a new anti-infective legislation. Swine products grew 1%. We delivered exceptional growth in China as a result of our strong portfolio and improving market conditions, which was offset by lower sales in Europe and Venezuela. Poultry sales were flat based on the growth in Latin America, including Brazil, which was offset by lower sales in other emerging markets and the U.S. The diversity of our portfolio across species, geographies and therapeutic areas continues to help us maximize opportunities in animal health, while mitigating the risk that can arise in certain markets. Now let me talk for a minute about our business in two markets whose economies has been getting a lot of attention and where we continue to produce strong results despite overall economic volatility. In Brazil, the animal health industry is very resilient and not being impacted by the current economic decline there. Consumers are reducing their spending in other areas, while maintaining their consumption of animal proteins. In some cases, we may see them switching from more expensive to less expensive meat, but since we are well-positioned in other species, we have been able to sustain a strong Livestock business. We are also at a very positive point in the cattle cycle in Brazil, with tight supplies of animal and high prices for meat. This place a premium on animal health and creates incentives for our customers to build their herds. In China, we are also seeing exceptional revenue growth for our business, despite some recent reports of a slowdown in their economy. Demand for proteins, especially pork, has shown stronger growth. And we are seeing higher prices for meat in the market. The long-term trend of smaller farms consolidating into larger operations will also add to our growth, as the swine population becomes increasingly medicalized and production become more efficient. While the economic challenge in China may impact other sectors, it wouldn't have a significant impact on the animal health industry and China continues to focus on improving the quality and stability of its food chain. Through the first nine months of the year, we have continued to deliver on our value proposition by growing adjusted net income faster than revenue. Our operational growth in revenue and adjusted net income were 9% and 22% year-to-date. And despite the impact of foreign currency, we have delivered 1 and 15% growth. As I have said many times, our industry-leading sales force, high-quality manufacturing and focus on new product innovation and enhancement remain key elements of our competitive advantage. Now let me turn to some other updates. Last night we announced our agreement to purchase PHARMAQ, the global leader in vaccines and innovation for aquatic health. The acquisition is a great strategic fit that brings to Zoetis an animal health leader with similar competitive advantage, an industry-leading portfolio, strong customer relationships and world-class innovation and manufacturing. PHARMAQ strengthens our Livestock business by providing a market-leading portfolio and a strong late-stage pipeline. Fish is the world's largest category of animal protein and they are leaders in the fast-growing animal health market, farm fish. The acquisition strengthens our core business in three key ways. PHARMAQ expands our customer base into the farm fish segment, it adds to our diverse portfolio a leading vaccine for farm fish and innovative parasiticide as well. PHARMAQ is the market leader in vaccine for farm fish, a market growing 10% annually. And finally, it expands our R&D program in aquatic health, with a strong late-stage pipeline expected to deliver new solutions to the market in the near-term. Zoetis has an excellent track record of identifying and integrating their businesses, and this one meets all our criteria in terms of strategic fit and value. With this acquisition expected to close on or about November 10, I'm very excited to welcome the PHARMAQ team to Zoetis. Our companies share a passion for supporting customers and keeping animals healthy and productive, and that gives us a strong foundation to build on. We also continue to see steady progress in the new product innovation and lifecycle developments coming from our internal R&D team. In September, we received a positive opinion from the European Medicines Agency for initial marketing authorization of SIMPARICA, a once-monthly chewable medication for the treatment of fleas, ticks and mange mite infestations in dogs beginning at eight weeks of age. We await for the news in Europe and the U.S. on potential approvals of SIMPARICA. I will keep you informed of future developments. In another step to maintain our global R&D leadership and to grow in critical emerging markets, just last week we strengthened our commitment to China. We announced the opening of a new research and development center near Beijing and the opening of a new global manufacturing facility near Suzhou, which replace our original plant that has been there since 1995. These investments are a strong foundation for future growth in China and the broader Asian market. Now, let me turn to another topic that I mentioned last quarter, ERP implementation and APOQUEL supply. The vast majority of the ERP implementation issues in the U.S. are being resolved and customers should be seeing the level of service improving. In the third quarter, we had continued with successful implementation in another 27 markets, which cover Europe, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East, and we remain on track to complete the global ERP program by the end of Q1 2016. As for APOQUEL, we have been able to resolve manufacturing issues related to our active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API. We are also in the process of bringing on a second source for API supply in the near future. We continue ramping up production of finished goods in the fourth quarter of 2015. Although we now expect slightly lower sales of $125 million in full year 2015 than previously anticipated, we expect to be in a stronger supply position as we head into 2016. With the strong demand we have seen, even though we have not yet fully launched this product to our customers, we are increasing our view of peak sales for the product to more than $300 million. We look forward broadening customer access to APOQUEL in markets like the U.S. and launching in additional markets around the world in 2016. In summary, we delivered excellent third quarter operational results with diverse sources of revenue growth across our portfolio. We continue to implement changes to reduce complexity and cost in our business and to strengthen our ability to execute on the market opportunities before us and we remain well positioned for profitable growth based on our core capabilities, our diverse portfolio and continuing investment in the areas that matter for our customers: high quality customer service, relevant innovation and reliable supply. I will now ask Paul to provide some comments on the quarter. Paul?
Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, Juan Ramón. The financial highlights of the quarter are, once again, strong operational revenue growth of 9% coming from a variety of sources and cost discipline that together were the major factors in driving significant operational growth in adjusted net income, as Juan Ramón said, up 31% from Q3 of 2014. Now, I'll sound like a broken record, but I want to emphasize that we manage our business for the long-term and, when we measure how we're doing, we look at years, not quarters. A lot of noise can creep into any one quarter in isolation. For example, we have seasonal elements to our business that impact our customers' buying patterns and those patterns are not necessarily consistent year-to-year. The high productivity that we enjoy from our R&D engine sees revenue growth, but not necessarily in a linear fashion. My point is that 9% operational growth of revenue and 31% operational growth in adjusted net income for Q3 as compared with Q3 of 2014 is good, but the year-to-date operational revenue growth of 9% and the adjusted net income growth of 22% and our revised guidance for the full years 2015, 2016 and 2017 are better indicators of our performance and prospects. And they look pretty good, right? While we believe that the best way to evaluate our performance is on an operational basis, our guidance and your financial models are focused on expectations for our reported results. I bring this up because we've been able to maintain and now improve our 2015 guidance for adjusted net income per share in the face of unrelenting FX headwinds. And we're proud of that. Before I provide some comments around our guidance, let me call your attention to a few items of note in our quarterly results. Once again, our Q3 and year-to-date results reflect the multiple ways that we can and do deliver revenue growth. Of the 9% operational growth in revenue in the quarter, 3% came from the acquisition out of the Abbott Animal Health products, 2% was driven by increased sales of APOQUEL, 3% came from the impact of increased selling prices and about 1% came from other new product introductions. We had unit growth in our other in line products other than APOQUEL of about 1%, but that growth was offset by reduced sales in Venezuela. Now, there's a real balance in how we generate revenue growth and continuing evidence that we can tap all of these sources to drive growth at or faster than the projected mid-single digit growth rates of the markets in which we compete. A few highlights. U.S. business was very strong, posting 19% growth in Q3 over Q3 of 2014. The Companion Animal business was up 27% and Livestock was up 13%. Within Companion Animal, the big drivers were the addition of the acquired Abbott Animal Health products, increased sales of APOQUEL as we continued to ramp up the supply of the product and strength across other key brands, including REVOLUTION, CERENIA, PROHEART and CONVENIA. In Livestock, strong sales of cattle products, for example, DRAXXIN and CEFTIOFUR led the way, while we had more modest gains in swine and a slight decline in poultry. Buying patterns, particularly in the Livestock segment, can fluctuate due to weather patterns and herd movements. Q3 of 2015 saw seasonal demand for Livestock products pick up earlier in the year than we observed in 2014. The outlook for the second half of 2015 remains solid, but with revenue skewed more towards Q3 than we saw in 2014. Turning to the International segment, which grew 2% operationally for the quarter, let me highlight five countries; three that contributed to growth, Japan, China and Brazil, and two countries, France and Venezuela, where we saw declines compared with the year-ago quarter. First, Japan. The significant increase in Japan, up 56%, is mainly due to the comparison with a weak Q3 of 2014 when we bought back inventory in connection with the termination of a distributor agreement in Japan. Revenue in China increased 24% operationally, as higher pork prices created favorable conditions for pork producers and supported strong demand for our vaccine products. Revenue in Brazil was up 12% operationally, fueled by price growth, new product launches and successful promotional efforts by our Brazilian colleagues in what is, despite the broader economic climate, a favorable environment for cattle producers. Growth in Japan, China, Brazil and other markets were offset mainly by declines in France, which was down 27% operationally, and Venezuela. In France, Q3 2014 revenues were substantially higher than normal as customers bought products ahead of changes to France's regulation of anti-infective sales. In Venezuela, as we reported back in May, we are reducing our efforts in the country in light of the uncertain economic situation there. Before I move on, I want to put an exclamation point on Juan Ramón's comments around Brazil and China. There's been a lot of talk recently about the challenging economic environments in Brazil and China and the impact of those economies on global companies, like ours. I won't repeat everything Juan Ramón said, but I do want to add a finance guy's perspective. The challenges in Brazil and China are real, but just how challenging they are depends on the segments in which you compete and other fundamental factors. Our business and our company tend to be less impacted by general economic conditions and Zoetis' prospects in China, Brazil and related markets remain good. Our operational growth in China of 24% in Q3 was actually faster than was posted for the first half of the year. And in Brazil, our operational growth in the quarter of 12% was the same as our operational growth through the first half of the year. I bring this up because there will continue to be hand-wringing about the impact of these economies on global businesses, and appropriately so. However, our belief is our industry and our company are far less exposed to weakness in these economies than other companies and industries, and our historical results and our results so far in 2014 support that belief. Quick update on our operational efficiency initiative. We're making excellent progress implementing the structural and organizational changes that will drive the cost reductions we outlined to you in May. We remain on track to deliver our target of at least $300 million of cost reductions entering calendar 2017. I want to repeat that we have been and continue to be thoughtful in how we achieve those cost savings with a focus on efficiency and the preservation of the core strengths of our business model: our direct sales forces, our productive R&D engine and our supply chain. In terms of one-time costs, you'll recall that I talk about these costs in three buckets: our standup and other one-time costs, the costs associated to our efficiency initiative and the costs associated with our supply network strategy. In the quarter, we incurred $28 million of stand-up and other one-time costs. The stand-up costs associated with our separation from Pfizer are largely behind us and should be complete in 2016. We recorded $21 million of one-time costs associated with the efficiency initiative in the quarter. Much of the cost of the initiative were recorded in Q2 of 2015. And finally, we recorded $3 million of costs associated with the supply network strategy. We continue to be in the early days of this initiative. We have provided a slide summarizing our current estimates of the total cash cost associated with each bucket. Now here's the payoff pitch. Updates to our guidance for 2015, 2016 and 2017, the good news here is that there is a lot of good news. Let's start with 2015. We narrowed and revised our guidance range for revenue. Let's not lose sight of the negative impact of FX rates that reduced the range by some $25 million since our last update. We reduced the top end of the range by $25 million, but held the low end of the range. Next, we have reduced the expectation for adjusted cost of sales as a percent of revenue by some 50 basis points to 100 basis points to now being approximately 35%. Of this improvement, some comes from the favorable impact of FX rates, so those benefits may be judicious, (24:44) but some of the improvement is structural in that it represents improvements in the management of the supply chain. For SG&A, we narrowed the range towards the upper boundary. For R&D, we decreased the range by $30 million to a range of $350 million to $370 million, reflecting a more rapid realization of some of the savings from the efficiency initiative. I want to point out that even though we are spending less in R&D, we continue to commit the necessary resources to support our rationalized product portfolio and to develop new innovative products to fuel our long-term growth. Finally, we revised our guidance for our tax rate on adjusted income down by about 100 basis points to approximately 28%. Part of this favorability is structural, coming from refinements and simplification of our operating model as well as several discrete items that occurred during the quarter. All of these things together enable us to raise and narrow our range for full year 2015 adjusted net income per share to $1.70 to $1.74, with the entire range of our revised guidance above the high end of our previous guidance. As I said, good news. Looking out to 2016. The negative impact of FX rates would have lowered our prior revenue guidance by some $105 million. However, a combination of factors has enabled us to increase 2016 revenue guidance by $75 million to $100 million. Supporting the increase are the acquisition of PHARMAQ, increased expectations for the acquired Abbott products and APOQUEL and the addition of new products, including IL-31 and SIMPARICA. The new revenue guidance range for 2016 implies operational growth versus 2015 in the range of 3% to 5%. As a reminder, this growth rate is suppressed by the impact of the ongoing SKU rationalization and our decision to reduce our activities in Venezuela. The increase to the range of SG&A costs is a result of several factors, including cost that's moved as a function of our now higher revenue outlook, second is the inclusion of SG&A cost for PHARMAQ and finally cost to support the launches of IL-31 and SIMPARICA. I want to point out, launch costs for Animal Health Products tend to be more modest and of shorter duration as compared with launch costs in human health. We reduced our outlook for R&D costs consistent with my comments around 2015, but then we added in costs associated with Aquatic Health R&D, which is embedded in PHARMAQ. The other significant change is the reduced expected tax rate on adjusted income from 30% to 28%, this reflects some structural benefits coming from actions to further refine and simplify our global operating model, which are expected to continue into future years. The net result of all the changes we are making to our outlook for 2016 is that we are revising upward our guidance for 2016 adjusted net income to the range of $925 million to $975 million, with implied operational growth moving from 12% to 19% to the range of 14% to 20%. The range for 2016 adjusted EPS moves up to $1.84 to $1.94. And especially in light of the FX headwinds, this is good stuff. Finally, and I'll spend less time on it, 2017 guidance. In a nutshell, the negative impact of changed FX rates on the previously provided revenue range is a reduction of about $115 million. But we are increasing 2017 revenue guidance by $175 million. The increase is driven by the acquisition of PHARMAQ, increased expectations for the acquired Abbott products and APOQUEL and the inclusion of the new products, IL-31 and SIMPARICA. Where previously we had guided to operational revenue growth in 2017 versus 2016 in the range of 3% to 7%, we are now guiding to the range of 4% to 9%. And this is truly organic growth as the acquisitions for both the Abbott products and PHARMAQ are fully reflected in our 2016 guidance. I call your attention to the tables that contain all the details of our guidance in 2017 and the changes from prior guidance and I'll just skip to the end. We're increasing our guidance for 2017 adjusted net income by $30 million to the range of $1.125 billion to $1.195 billion, implying growth on an operational basis in 2017 versus 2016 of 18% to 26%. And our guidance for adjusted EPS has been increased by $0.06 per share to the range of $2.24 to $2.38 per share. Again, strong and reflective of the team here taking all steps to drive profitable growth. Please note that for 2016 and 2017 we've assumed a constant diluted share count of approximately 502 million shares, as we expect our share repurchase program to at least offset the dilutive impact of our share-based comp plans. Speaking of our share repurchase program, in the third quarter we purchased 1.1 million shares for about $50 million, an average price of $46.92 per share. Through the third quarter and year-to-date in 2015, we repurchased 3.2 million shares for an aggregate $148.1 million, an average price of $46.45 per share. Before we move to Q&A, I want to take the opportunity to talk about the strength of our industry and our company in turbulent times. I have to say we've been a little frustrated watching our share price drift lower while at the same time knowing that we are delivering across a range of activities that we believe are building the value of our company. We ended 2014 with a share price of roughly $43, not a lot different from our closing price last night. But here's a short list of the things that we've accomplished since the beginning of the year. In January, we closed the acquisition of the Abbott Animal Health business. In February, we put a strong full-year 2014 on the board, delivering operational revenue growth of 7%, adjusted net income growth of 13%. In May, we unveiled our operational efficiency program and provided you with a road map in the form of longer-term guidance as to how we intend to increase profit levels and improve our adjusted operating margin to the mid 30%s. And we reported a strong Q1 of 2015 with operational revenue growth of 6% and adjusted net income growth of 14%. In August, we put a strong Q2 on the board, year-to-date operational revenue growth of 8% and adjusted net income growth of 17% and we announced that we received a conditional license on the innovative monoclonal antibody for Canine Atopic Dermatitis, which you call IL-31. Today we post a strong Q3 of 2015, with year-to-date operational growth of revenue of 9% and adjusted net income growth of 22%. And we announced the acquisition of PHARMAQ, providing us with a market-leading presence in aquatic health, the fastest-growing segment of the animal health industry. That's a heck of a year and we're only through Q3. Our industry has continued to prove its many positive attributes. And coming up on three years since our IPO, we believe the team here has proven the strength of Zoetis' business model and our capability to deliver to you value. That concludes my prepared remarks, and so let's open the line for questions. Keith?
Operator: And we'll take our first question from Erin Wilson with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Erin E. Wilson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. How would you characterize the underlying demand trends across the U.S. livestock market? How should we think about the quarterly progression here given the buying patterns you alluded to in the press release? And if you could comment on poultry dynamics as well. And then part two of my question would be, as far as the acquisition goes, can you speak to underlying profitability of the business and potential synergies and cost savings associated with the PHARMAQ deal and your capacity for future business development initiatives? Thanks.
Juan Ramón Alaix - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Erin. And let me answer the first question on the demand in the U.S. Definitely, there are different drivers depending on the different types of animal proteins, cattle, pork, swine. I would say that the cattle, it's still facing maybe some limited production, although the demand has been reduced slightly. Because of the limited production, it seems most of the producers are rebuilding their herd and sending less animals to the slaughterhouses. At the same time, in some markets we have seen that the demand for beef has been changing slightly, but we remain very positive in terms of the cattle business in the U.S. In terms of poultry, the demand continues very strong. And I think we expect also that not a significant impact in terms of the avian flu affecting the meat part of the poultry segment, although this is affecting the egg production. And in swine, in 2015 we have seen a significant increase in the supply because of the PDV is not affecting and the farmer have been able to increase significantly the number of animals. And this also has been making a pressure in terms of prices. But for the animal health industry, it has been positive because there are more animals and more animals to be treated and protected. In terms of PHARMAQ, I think really Paul can provide the details on this acquisition.
Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Sure. And I think your question, Erin, was around how do you think about this business in the go-forward? And firstly I want to point out a couple of things. Is this is a business that shares a lot of the characteristics of our business. These are long-duration assets participating in solid growth markets that are supported by a productive R&D engine. It's very similar to our business. There are cost synergies associated with our acquisition here, however, this is not a cost synergy deal. PHARMAQ have solid operations on the sales and marketing side, as well as in the R&D side and of course in the manufacturing arena. And so from a cost perspective, this is not like a classic cost synergy deal; this is a transaction that puts us squarely in a space that's going to grow quickly, that comes to us with a well-developed pipeline featuring near-term opportunities to continue the attractive growth that they deliver. And I'll get the start date wrong, but I believe that they've been growing at a compound rate of about, through 2014, of about 17% in that business. And so thinking about this business, this is more about supplementing our Livestock business, getting us into a space of where we're not presently represented. And we love this deal, we love the value of this deal and we think you will too once it starts to play out over the course of the next couple years. I think there was a third question there was kind of capacity for more deals to say, look, we've had a great year so far in 2015. When you look at the Abbott transaction as a classic good deal for us that came up a couple of times in our prepared remarks, we're doing better both in terms of driving revenue synergies and cost synergies on that deal. I wish there were 10 of those out there to be done every year, there just aren't. But when they come up, we would certainly look to pursue additional transactions like that. Larger more strategic transactions, like a PHARMAQ, there are a handful of opportunities out there. Do we have the capacity to do it? Well, we haven't even closed this one yet. So we'll get this one closed up and then we'll start or continue the process of looking for what that next opportunity is. M&A will continue to be an element of our strategy.
Juan Ramón Alaix - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: But we want to make sure that we remain very disciplined in terms of assessing opportunities for M&A and also we want to make sure that we maintain our ratios in terms of debt, which are a range between 2.5 to 3.5. That is something that we'll be also considering. One important element that we mentioned many times is that our market share also is creating some limitations in terms of large acquisitions in terms of antitrust. But we'll continue assessing opportunities as they come and always applying a criteria that will support any kind of acquisition.
Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Okay. Next question, please?
Operator: We'll take our next question from Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Juan Ramón, wondering if you could talk about the strength that you saw in some of the developing markets, like Brazil and China. I think we saw 12% operational growth and 24% in China. And then I guess just going back to the acquisition, Paul, could you talk a little bit about the profitability of PHARMAQ and I guess the justification for the valuation or how you guys think about valuation for deals like this? Thanks.
Juan Ramón Alaix - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Kevin, for the question. Let me start with China. China remains a market with a significant growth potential. And we mentioned that several times that the consumption there is increasing very fast because of the increase of middle class, but also very important for our industry, they are changing also the way they are raising animals. So in the past in China, there was significant part of animals, I'm talking about pigs, that they were small productions or even backyard production. We have seen that it's a significant shift from this kind of production to more sophisticated production and this is what is generating a significant opportunity for animal health industry that can provide the quality of a product that can increase the productivity in these farms. We have been also investing in China since many years. We have in China the infrastructure to maximize any new products that we are bringing to the market. We have been launching new products in China, some of them as a result of a JV that we formed a couple of years ago. And we are very pleased with the all the things that are going on in China. As I said, we don't see that this economic slowdown is affecting the animal health industry. In Brazil, the situation is different. Brazil remains a very strong market in terms of production of animal proteins for export. Brazil is one of the key markets in terms of export and they also have the benefit now of low cost in the country and also lower prices because of the real has been reducing against the dollar. So these elements are creating a very good momentum in Brazil. We have seen also Brazil that the cattle industry, it's increasing the herds. Prices of meat are also very positive. The only comment in Brazil is that we have not seen any reduction in terms of internal consumption; what we have seen is switching from more expensive meat to less expensive. If the situation remains in the future in terms of economic crisis, we need to assess if their internal consumption will be affected. But so far, we have not seen any kind of reduction of meat consumption in Brazil, so the prospects for this country remain very positive. Paul will talk about the acquisition.
Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, Kevin, thanks for the question. And I think you have to think about the PHARMAQ acquisition as being comprised of two pieces, one is that base business that's been growing very quickly and, by the way, has been supporting solid investment in R&D. And that leads me to the second piece of the value, which is the pipeline opportunities that come with the company and those are both near term and they're longer term. I said earlier I think in response to Erin's question, you've got to look at this business as being one that's very similar to ours in that it enjoys that long duration, long durability of the revenue streams, and that includes taking into consideration the near-term pipeline opportunities. If you look at this deal on a near-term basis and say, gee, accretion and it's neutral in the first year and then it's accretive thereafter. This is a deal that goes on and enjoys that long period of sustainable growth of profit and cash flow as added into our business and so that's how we value it. We value it on a fundamental basis, not necessarily – if you're going to look at it, a sales multiple is not appropriate here.
Juan Ramón Alaix - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Let me add a couple of comments on PHARMAQ that, in my opinion, are important. I think first, the farmed fish market is the fastest-growing market in the animal health industry. PHARMAQ has been delivering very strong growth in the last 10 years. We mentioned that a CAGR of 17%. And, very important, PHARMAQ is focused on the area that is showing the fastest growth within aquatic health, which is vaccines. And definitely PHARMAQ is the leading company in terms of innovation in vaccines that will be a great opportunity for the future in terms of revenue growth. So we are extremely happy with this acquisition and we are convinced that this company integrated into Zoetis and having the support of our infrastructure will also maximize the opportunities in the farmed fish.
Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Next question, please?
Operator: Our next question comes from Louise Chen with Guggenheim Partners.
Louise Chen - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. So first question I had here was just on the potential for cost cuts greater than $300 million. And then a second question is just on the PHARMAQ deal again here. My understanding is that Permira had brought this company for meaningfully less two years ago. I'm just curious your thoughts here on your valuation for the company. Thanks.
Juan Ramón Alaix - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: In terms of cost cuts, I think we are on track to deliver what we announced, the $300 million by 2017. And the teams are working very hard. So we have made significant progress. And as you remember, there were some elements of this program related to SKU rationalization, also the reduction of some of the manufacturing plants and also the reduction or the change in some of the markets in where we were operating direct and we will be now operating through distributor. But still, this market is representing a small part of our portfolio because 95% of the revenues are still generated through our direct interaction with customers. So the report here is that we are doing very well and we plan to meet or exceed the $300 million. In terms of PHARMAQ, Paul will cover this question.
Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, sure. Permira bought the company back in 2013. A couple of interesting tidbits. We would've loved to have owned this company back in 2013 and tried to own this company back in 2013 and we were not able to acquire it back in 2013. And so what has happened since then, and I think you have to take your hat off to the team at PHARMAQ and Permira for backing that team to do what they needed to do to substantially build the value of that company over the last several years. What did they do? They advanced the pipeline, which for us is a very important factor. And while they were doing that, they continued to deliver growth in their base business and build that company. So that company is worth a heck of a lot more today than it was in 2013, number one. And number two, I would argue that it is worth more in our hands than it's worth in other people's hands because of our opportunities to drive geographic revenue for this part of our company that is not available to a stand-alone.
Juan Ramón Alaix - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Next question, please?
Operator: Our next question comes from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets.
Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the strong quarter. Paul, sorry to keep going back to this, but I think it's an important question. How profitable is PHARMAQ and what is your expected profitability for this business given increased scale as part of Zoetis? And also, gross margin was higher than we expected. How much of that was FX as opposed to product mix? Thank you.
Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, with respect to the profitability of PHARMAQ, the business is profitable. It is supporting and has been supporting a substantial investment in R&D and continues to be a profitable business. Not sure we want to get into providing the entire P&L for PHARMAQ and, say, oh, here's exactly what they're doing. But suffice it to say that we think that the company, as part of Zoetis, fits with our model of long-term revenue growth and driving that over an extended period of time. And clearly we see a lot of value there. I don't want to provide a P&L for PHARMAQ for 2014. I don't think it would tell you the whole story. The salient points again, and I'll keep coming back to this, is a base business that is growing very rapidly, a base business that has supported the investment of R&D and helped them develop a pipeline that we see a great deal of value in as we go forward. With respect to gross margins, one thing you've got to take into consideration, I called it out in my remarks, is that FX has a favorable impact on our reported gross margin. And that was I believe roughly 100 basis points – someone will correct me if I get that wrong, but I believe it was about 100 basis points. And that turns around if FX rates happen to go in the opposite direction, but, yeah, it's roughly 100 basis points. There are some structural things that we've done in the early stages of our supply network strategy to improve the efficiency of our supply chain and, therefore, improve margins through doing things more efficiently in the supply chain. And those are permanent and structural and that over time – this is just the early stuff with respect to the supply network strategy. We've articulated in 2020 we expect to have another couple hundred basis points of gross margin from the broader supply network strategy, which really we're just at the early stages of.
Juan Ramón Alaix - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, maybe not to go into the details of the P&L for PHARMAQ, Alex, but maybe some information that can be interesting there for you. First, I think this business, it's mostly a vaccine business. So we are not talking here about maybe feed additives, but a vaccine business. The second is that this industry is highly consolidated. So the cost to bring the products to the customers is not as expensive as in Companion Animal. So it's fewer customers and it's also providing operating ability that is related to the cost of commercialization of all the products of PHARMAQ. So what I want to say is that it's a profitable company and definitely we see the opportunity to make this company even more profitable in the future. Next question, please?
Operator: We'll go next to John Kreger with William Blair.
John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks very much. Switching gears to SIMPARICA, are you still comfortable that product gets on the market in the U.S. next year? And does your guidance assume a 2016 launch? And then maybe a just quick follow-up. You mentioned France had some tough comparisons, with antibiotic regulations kicking in a year ago. Are there any other regions where you're watching closely for perhaps more restrictive regs around production antibiotics? Thanks.
Juan Ramón Alaix - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So let me start with SIMPARICA, John. We expect the U.S. launch in SIMPARICA next year. We'll always depend on FDA approval, but we are preparing for this launch in the U.S. and also the launch in the European market. In terms of France, France we reported that last year there was a change of legislation. So the change in the legislation was mainly eliminating rebates on sales of antibiotic and then customers bought in anticipation of this new legislation. Definitely we are monitoring any kind of changes in terms of restriction on the use of antibiotics. There are movements, mainly in Western Europe, and we are tracking all that and this has been incorporated in our guidance for 2015, 2016 and 2017. Still, we consider that today there are no alternatives to treat animals that are sick other than antibiotics. And in many cases, the only way to achieve the productivity that customers need, we also need to prevent diseases with antibiotics. What we have seen in many markets, including the U.S., mainly a reduction of antibiotics which are medically important for human. But again, we don't see these changing significantly our revenues in the U.S., mostly because they will be moving to other antibiotics that we also have in our portfolio. Next question, please?
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. And we'll go to David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, your line is open.
David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yes, thanks very much. Congrats on all the news flow. My question relates to 2017 revenue and your guidance. Could you just remind us for some of the key new product launches, what you're incorporating into your 2017 guidance for those major new product introductions and then also whether you are excluding any new product launches from the 2017 guidance? Thanks very much.
Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. Hi, David. It's Paul. Thanks for the question. This is both 2016 and 2017 and following on from the last question, SIMPARICA is included in our 2016 and 2017 guidance. And we're expecting the o-U.S. launch of SIMPARICA and then anticipating the U.S. launch of SIMPARICA, so that's in both 2016 and 2017. IL-31 is also in 2016 and 2017, but point out that we're currently operating under a conditional license and expecting to have a full license in the latter part of 2016. So the impact on 2016 is pretty modest. And then you see it included in our 2017 under a full license, so it's in there as well. And with respect to the question of is there anything – well, just to be super clear. And of course this now includes PHARMAQ as part of our guidance in 2016 and 2017 as well. We only add in products to our guidance when they achieve a high probability of regulatory and technical success and these are the only new products that we have included in 2016 and 2017. Next question, please?
Operator: Yes, and I will try Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Christopher T. Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Can you guys hear me now?
Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes.
Christopher T. Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Sorry about that. Just had two questions. First, can you just elaborate on the priorities for business development following yesterday's deal? I guess my question is, just how many more assets like PHARMAQ or Abbott are out there? Is it a large universe, or is that a fairly targeted group of companies or divisions of companies you can target? And the second question was just on APOQUEL. I appreciate the comments earlier. But when we think about 2016 growth for APOQUEL, is capacity a rate-limiting factor or is it really just how quickly you can build demand for next year? Thanks so much.
Juan Ramón Alaix - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Let me start with the easiest answer, which is APOQUEL. In 2016, we don't expect to have any limitation in terms of capacity and it's just the time for introducing the product in more customers in those markets in where we have already introduced the product and also launching in new markets. But we don't expect to have capacity issues. We have solved the API, we have a second source of API also in 2016 and now the manufacturing group is working to produce all the tablets that will be available to customers in 2016. In terms of BD, opportunities like PHARMAQ are unique, so I don't think that we'll find so many opportunities like PHARMAQ in the market. But there may be some assets that can be attractive to us, not many, but it will be maybe in some countries maybe some companies that will be for sale in the future. But, again, so we need to understand that because of our market share, we're facing some limitations in terms of antitrust that we need to incorporate in our evaluation. But we have been demonstrating that we are understanding the opportunities in the market, Abbott Animal Health, KL, PHARMAQ, and we'll continue assessing these opportunities in the future.
Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, I want to continue on, on that because after the press release last night, we started getting a lot of questions about BD strategy and are there other, I'll put air quotes around this, big deals out there. And we want to be clear. If you'd asked us in June of 2014, say, gee, do you think you can do two right down the middle of the fairway business development deals in 2015? We would have had a fair degree of confidence that we could do that, but, as we all know, whether or not you can actually do those two deals is good material for a debate. We're very fortunate in that 2015 we've had two very good and two very different type of deals present themselves. One, the classic tuck-in acquisition, where I mentioned before, but it's worth mentioning again, we acquired in the beginning of the year. We are achieving greater than our targeted level of cost synergies and we're delivering revenue synergies, that's a great deal. I will do that deal 100 out of 100 times. And then secondarily, PHARMAQ, which for us from a strategic perspective and a value perspective is one of those rare deals that comes around not all that often. If you think about the aquatic health industry, it's roughly a $400 million industry and here's a company that in the very near term you would expect to have a 25% or greater share of that rapidly-growing segment. And it happens to be a business that we know a lot about. I mean if you think about us on a fundamental level, what do we do? We are excellent at developing and promoting products to producers of animal protein for human consumption. This is right in the middle of the fairway. But if you'd asked us a year ago or more than a year ago, gee, are you going to be able to do a deal like that? We would have been hopeful, but the opportunity needs to present itself. Two important points. One is we will maintain the discipline to focus on business development opportunities where we can leverage our particular competitive strengths to build and drive value for our shareholders. We think that there are other opportunities for us as we look out into 2016 and to 2017 and we will continue to pursue those opportunities, but I want to be clear, they're more likely to fall in the category of an Abbott-type deal than a PHARMAQ-type deal. That said, there's always opportunity. I'll stop there. Next question, please?
Operator: Our next question is from Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Volodymyr Nikolenko - Evercore ISI: Thank you. It's actually Vlad Nikolenko on behalf of Mark Schoenebaum. Congratulations for the great quarter and smart acquisition of PHARMAQ yesterday. Actually a question more about the macro situation about what else is going on in biotech. There have been a lot of chatter and noise in present from political front about potential regulation of drug prices in the human health. And Zoetis looks like being a victim of overall selloff in biotech. So I just want to hear your perspective on animal front (1:01:30) of potential regulation or even just headline from political noise from human health on animal health and Zoetis' ability to continue increasing prices on something like 2% or 3% per year. And second question is more about long-term guidance, specifically tax rate. So whether revised guidance, additional decrease in the long-term tax rate of 100 basis points to 200 basis points, if it's sustainable or if there is additional limit to decrease tax rate even further? Thank you.
Juan Ramón Alaix - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Vlad. I'll start with the first question on macro environment and then Paul will answer the tax rate. So the first thing, we are not a human health company. And we try from the reading to explain how different is animal health to human health. And the most important difference is that our business is a business-to-business model. We are not dealing with a third-party payer, so our prices are defined by just the pure market dynamics. So we sell what our customers that are also paying are willing to pay for based on the value that we can demonstrate to them. So regulating prices in an industry which is just a market-driven industry will not make any sense, but it's something that we don't see happening. And in terms of what is the macro environment, we describe that our industry is very resilient to economic dynamics. We saw that in 2008 and 2009. We also saw that in 2012 at the time of the drought that our industry responded extremely well. So one of the characteristics of animal health are stability and sustainability and we think that it is one of the attributes that make our industry very attractive to investors.
Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I think on the tax rate question, I'll restate one of my phrases around our tax rate is, we have the opportunity to continue to lower our tax rate, but, as I said before, it's going to be evolutionary not revolutionary. We through the process of our efficiency initiative, which we kicked off in May, have taken steps to both define and simplify our global operating model. And that's had some benefits to us in terms of our global effective tax rate and that's a tax rate on our adjusted net income, by the way, and adjusted pre-tax either way (1:04:32). And we expect that we can continue to do that, but, again, I don't want to provide anybody with the unrealistic hope that we can suddenly dramatically change our tax rate. But I think that you can see in the progression of 2015, in our guidance for 2016 and 2017 that we are continuing to take those steps that we can take in order to try to drive that tax rate down. But, again, evolutionary, not revolutionary. Next question, please?
Operator: We'll go next to Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.
Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Just a couple of follow-up questions. Most of my questions have been answered. Paul, you said in your remarks that you're surprised your stock price is so low. What is your capacity for embarking on a very large share buyback program? I would think you'd want to put your money where your mouth is and if you think the stock is so cheap, why aren't you guys announcing a big buyback program? And then secondly, Juan Ramón, I'm sorry if I missed this, I was in and out of the call, but you talked about making an aqua health acquisition for the past couple of years. What other areas, where are there holes in your overall business areas or business segments, where do you feel – is it geographical that you'd like to fill in or is it actually product-related? What are the other businesses that you would like to be beef-up in? You were very clear about aqua health for the past couple of years. So what other businesses are you seeking to add to your portfolio? Thanks very much.
Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Sure. Jami, thanks for the questions. And I'll start with the share buyback. And here's a thing. We have a share buyback program; I know it's modest. And we continue to buy back shares and have been buying them back since the beginning of the year. And this is a balance between allocating capital to those activities that we think will build the most value over the long term. And for this year it's, again, I think so far a remarkable year. Beginning of the year we allocated capital to the acquisition of the Abbott Animal Health assets. Great place to put our money. Secondarily here, hopefully on or about November 10 we'll close on the PHARMAQ acquisition. These represent deployment of capital ways that we'll continue to build value for our shareholders over the long term. While we're doing that, we continue to buy back shares. To the extent that we find ourselves in an environment where we have lots of cash flow and nowhere to deploy it in a way that we felt was value generative, yeah, we could increase the scale of our share buyback. But right now, going out and levering up the company to buy back a bunch of shares is not something that we're going to do.
Juan Ramón Alaix - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Jami, thank you for the question. And let me describe where we're at now. So definitely before the acquisition of PHARMAQ, the only area that was significant for animal health and where we were not participating was aquaculture or this aquatic health. Now, with the acquisition of PHARMAQ, we have filled this gap. So now we are number one in cattle, we are number two in companion animal. But I think we have been taking all the actions to have a stronger position in this category with a launch of APOQUEL, the acquisition of Abbott Animal Health and also our internal efforts in terms of R&D, to bring new parasiticide that was an area where we were underrepresented. We are convinced that we have all what we need to compete in this space. We are number one in swine and we are number three in poultry. And definitely in poultry we see opportunities if they come to consider some acquisitions of products or other assets. We incorporated a small acquisition in poultry this year, mainly on devices. And we are also working internally to develop the portfolio and the pipeline that will bring us to a stronger position. In terms of geographies, we have a very strong position in all the of the markets. And very important, in those markets where we don't have yet the position that we should have is not because we don't have the portfolio, it's only a question of registering the portfolio and bringing this portfolio to the market. So I see in terms of geographies more opportunistic than need. And then moving to what will be other opportunities, definitely any area that will be complementary to our core business, which are medicines, that can enhance these core business and create additional revenues and profits will be part of our assessment. Next question, please?
Operator: And we'll take our last question from Doug Tsao with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Douglas D. Tsao - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. Just maybe clarify on APOQUEL. So will you be at a state without any supply constraints by the end of this year, or will that sort of take place in phases over next year? And just in terms of the second source of API, is that going to be a back-up source or is that going to be a source that is going to be regularly contributing towards production? Thank you very much.
Juan Ramón Alaix - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Doug. And in terms of APOQUEL supply, we expect to have a supply for meeting the demands of customers in the U.S. and UK markets at the end of the year. Then we'll continue introducing the product in other markets. And we don't think that supply will be an issue to deliver all customer demand in 2016. The second API source, it will be not just of a back-up, it will be a contributor. And we have the opportunity to double the capacity of the existing capacity that we have. And this is also something that will protect future revenues of future demand for the product. So we are very confident that the API will be enough to produce all the finished product that will be demanded by the customers in 2016.
Operator: And it does appear we have no further questions, so I will return the floor to Juan Ramón for closing remarks.
Juan Ramón Alaix - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So thank you very much for attending this call. And, again, we are very pleased to have the results of this third quarter. But more important, my opinion, it's how confident are we in terms of our future, in terms of revenues and in terms also of adjusted EPS. We are very confident that we'll be delivering very strong results despite of the negative impact of exchange rate. That has been compensated with the introduction of new products and also the performance of the rest of the portfolio. So with that, thank you very much for attending this call.
Operator: This does conclude today's teleconference. A replay of today's call will be made available in two hours by dialing 800-283-4605 for U.S. listeners and 402-220-0874 for international. Please disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Welcome to the Second Quarter 2015 Financial Results Conference Call and Webcast For Zoetis. Hosting the call today is John O'Connor, Vice President of Investor Relations, for Zoetis. The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of Zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer and will not be forwarded automatically. [Operator Instructions]. It's now my pleasure to turn the floor over to John O'Connor. John, you may begin.
John O'Connor: Thank you. Good morning and welcome to the Zoetis second quarter 2015 earnings call. I am joined today by Juan Ramon Alaix, our Chief Executive Officer; and Paul Herendeen, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statements in today's press release and our SEC filings, including, but not limited to, our 2014 annual report, on Form 10-K and our reports on form 10-Q. Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures which were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and in the company's 8-K filing dated today, August 4, 2015. We also say operational results which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. With that, I will turn the call over to Juan Ramon.
Juan Ramon Alaix: Thank you, John and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss our performance for the second quarter and provide updates related to the integration of Abbott Animal Health, the performance of new products and progress on our operational efficiency program. Paul will then will provide additional perspective on the quarter and comment on our guidance for 2015, 2016, 2017. All the growth rate that I'm discussing today are rational, excluding the impact of foreign currency. I am very pleased to report that this quarter, we generated very strong revenue and adjusted net income and growth based on the strength and the diversity of our business. The growth this quarter was driven by the positive performance of our portfolio, in both companion animal and livestock. The addition of Abbott Animal Health and the growth of APOQUEL and other new products and the continued discipline on operating expenses. In the quarter, we generated operational growth of 11% of revenue and 20% in adjusted net income or adjusted diluted EPS of $0.42 per share. This performance continued to demonstrate our long-term valuable position and grow adjusted earnings faster than sales. In the quarter, APOQUEL contributed 2% of revenue growth or $19 million. Abbott Animal Health accounted for 2% of the revenue growth or $25 million and another 2% came from new product launches. The remaining at 5% is related to both performance including a 2% price increase. In livestock, we view 8% even by some growth in cattle and swine. Cattle then grew 9% with continued favorable market conditions in the U.S. and Brazil, partially offset by the impact of the full reductions in poultry. Swine products also made a contribution this quarter, growing 14% based on strong sales in the U.S. and China. In the U.S., the markets for swine continued for building after the original impact of PEDv. We continue adoption of our key brands and a positive impact in terms like our better ACTOGAIN. Quarter revenue grew 1% reflecting new product launches which were partially offset by the customer rotation of medicated feed additives in certain Latin American markets. Turning to companion animal, revenue grew 15% due to additional sales from the Abbott Animal Health and the continued performance of key brands such as APOQUEL in the [indiscernible] space and some whole and production insights. We feel very good about the progress we have made on the duration of Abbott Animal Health and we expect to achieve the target we've set from the condition in terms of revenue and cost percentages. Now switching to Sarolaner operational updates, we completed the go live profile of our ERP system in the U.S. at the beginning of May as scheduled. From a systems and control point of view, the completion was successful. However, due to a large number of our customers electrically impacted by our change of systems, we've had customers experiencing a disruption in their services. The variability of these shipments and these issues have been resolved. And customers should see the level of our service improving and turning to the quality they expect and deserve from us. Foreign presentation in other countries will remain on track to complete the growing ERP product by the end of Q1 2016. As for the Abbott growth, since the beginning of the year, we've had significant increase product supply and today more than 13,000 veterinarians have access to APOQUEL in the U.S. and more in markets outside of the U.S.. We have the manufacturing capacity to meet the future demands of the public but the process of scaling up the active pharmaceutical ingredient or API, as we mentioned to you. We have now made the necessary changes to improve the process and we're continuing to ramp up the manufacturing . While the situation is improving, we're not yet meeting all our market demand and our first priority is to manage a solution of available supply to our locations and to fulfill August for our current customers. With that in mind, we have temporarily suspended taking new first-time customers' orders for APOQUEL in most markets. We remain committed to making APOQUEL available to new customers as soon as possible. Even with these change in our operating products, we now expect revenue for APOQUEL to be about $150 million in 2015 and increasing really early in 2016. The productivity of our investment in new product notion and following the product development continue to support our future growth at. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has granted a conditional license for a first trial of first-of-its-kind antibody therapy that targets interleukin-31 or IL-31, to help reduce clinical signs associated with atopic dermatitis in dogs. It represents another major breakthrough from our R&D platform based on new scientific insights into the pathway of allergic skin conditions. We continue to receive approvals for new indications and formulations of our key products and we have expanded many products into new markets. In the second quarter, for example, we seeked approval of a new label claims in the U.S. and European Union for CERENIA, an antiemetic to treat and prevent acute vomiting in dogs and cats. We continue expanding the breadth of our FOSTERA swine vaccine franchise. We have new label claims in Canada and Latin America. And DRAXXIN 25, an injectable anti-infective which will tapped an important market for swine, was launched in additional European markets, such as Spain, Italy and Portugal. Now to achieve concerns, comments and update on the operational efficiency program, we announced that last quarter. I do want to recall the program we announced it to simplify operations, improve our cost structure and better allocate the resources for future long-term growth. We expect to generate cost savings of at least $300 million in 2017 and improve our adjusted EBITDA margin from 25% in 2014 to approximately 34% in 2017, as we review complexity and achieve greater focus on key brands and markets. Our visual leader is moving ahead with elimination of approximately 5000 SKUs from our total of 13,000 and changing or solution model in about 25 markets. Approximately 45 countries will remain with our direct sales model and generate 95% of our revenue. Meanwhile, we have begun the process of selling or executing seven manufacturing sites. And another few sites will be sold or exited in a later phase as part of our supply network strategy. We've also started job reduction as we reorganize and streamline our operations. We're making very good progress on implementation of our operational efficiency program. And I'm very optimistic about delivering or exceeding the target of $300 million in savings by 2017. While we're making these changes on efficiency, we remain absolutely committed to the moment that has been driving our success. Our direct selling approach and world-class sales reinforce creating us from the competition. Our investment in relation, the drive breakthrough products and also ensure the lifecycle development of our portfolio and our high-quality manufacturing and supply. In summary, we deliver excellent second quarter operational resource; with various sources of revenue growth across our portfolio. We remain well-positioned for profitable growth based upon on our core capabilities, diverse portfolio and focus on expansion growth. And we're seeing new initial progress on the efficiency program that made us get more competitive and profitable for the long term. I will now ask Paul to provide some comments on the quarter. Paul?
Paul Herendeen: Good morning. The financial highlights of the quarter are regular growth and cost discipline. Revenues were up 11% operationally compared to Q3 in 2014 with growth coming principally from the addition of acquired Abbott Animal Health products, the ramp up of APOQUEL and of those and strength in our livestock portfolio. With respect to operating expenses, we especially took ownership to reduce expense in order to preserve our 2015 profit guidance in the face of currency headwinds and animal health growth of operating expenses to 2% on an operational basis compared to the prior-year quarter and keeps us on track to deliver on the 2015 portion of the efficiency initiative that we announced back in May. Strong revenue performance in animal gross profit margins mainly due to the favorable impact of FX on cost of goods sold and expense control enabled us to report very strong adjusted net income growth of 20% operationally and 14% on a reported basis. While the year looked no mean, we know what's coming next. While good performance in the 98% window looks great in the headline, we think about our business in terms of the year or even years. We don't guide to quarters and we don't manage the quarters so please view this quarter as a strong quarter and view it as what it is, an indication that we remain solidly on track to deliver our 2015 guidance and beyond. With that as a backdrop, I want to note that we narrowed our 2015 guidance towards the upper end of the range. Good stuff indeed. Our FX rate and I want to, again, call your attention the impact of FX on our reported results. Foreign exchange rates continued to mute our reported revenue and profit growth. FX rates reduced our reported sales by some $106 million compared to Q2 of 2014 or roughly 1,000 basis points, while adjusted net income growth was reduced by $12 million or roughly 600 basis points compared with the prior-year second quarter. We measure our performance on an operational basis or on a constant currency basis and on that basis, we delivered. As part of the operational efficiency program we announced in May, we consolidated from four of the reporting segments to two, U.S. and International. From here forward, our financial reporting will reflect this new structure. A few weeks ago we issued and 8-K to provide a historical view of our 2014 and third quarter 2015 results in this new reporting structure and I hope this helps you update the financial models and prepare for today's call. The consolidation of our business into two segments will reduce the cost and complexity of our operations and also improves our decision-making and accountability at the local market level where we drive value. It's real concerns that the consolidation segment might reduce visibility into our performance. Let me say that we believe that the revised disclosure providing revenue details on most on -- excuse me, providing revenue details on our most important countries rather than a somewhat arbitrary geographic grouping, should give you better visibility into the results and how we drive our results. And to at least organize the leads, you will see revenue for the U.S. and international segments as well as additional breakdown showing revenue for our top net 11 international countries. This gives you visibility into the markets that account for nearly 80% of our sales. Approximately 20% of remaining revenue are being grouped and reported as other developed markets and other emerging markets. I will caution you that with the increased granularity of the revenue we're reporting, you will see quarter-to-quarter fluctuations and I would not read too much into that if you are looking at a single quarter in a single market in isolation. One of the strength of our business models is the geographic diversity of our revenue and profit streams, particularly in livestock. We participate in global markets and strength and weaknesses in digital markets are generally offset by performance in other markets. Finally, we also provided an important disclosure of the two segments, showing revenue, cost of sales, operating expenses and pre-tax earnings. I hope you will agree that our new financial reporting model is an improvement over the prior model. Let me call your attention to a few highlights from the quarter. Juan mentioned this earlier but it's worth repeating because it's a great way to illustrate the ways in which we can grow our top-line. Top-line as we knew. We delivered operational growth of 11% in the quarter, of which 3% was unit growth of in line products, 2% was from price, 2% was from growth of APOQUEL, 2% was from the additional acquired Abbott Animal Health products and 2% was from a range of new product introductions. I need to go second quarter, we covered all of the ways we certainly can deliver operational revenue growth. Next, looking at the U.S., very strong growth of 17% over the prior-year quarter, we delivered growth in all species, companion animal, cattle, swine, poultry and equine. In companion animals, the big drivers for the other share of the Abbott products and APOQUEL. In cattle, we had a continuation of favorable conditions to putting use of our premium products and we increased sales of the ACTOGAIN. In swine, product sizes impact from the PEDv outbreak and you had the positive impact of new products in the portfolio, the PEDv vaccine and medicine. Finally, poultry grew largely from the introduction of our ZOAMIX Project. In the international group which grew 6% operationally, the top three countries contributing to the growth for Brazil, up 9%, mainly due to the favorable conditions in the livestock segment and new product launches; China which was up 26%, with our livestock business benefiting from higher anti-infective use in some key swine accounts and growth in companion animal, driven by from momentum from [indiscernible]; and then finally in the UK which was up 12% based on strong performance of stronghold and the addition of the Abbott Animal Health products. We do have species international group; livestock was up 6%, with cattle and swine offsetting lower sales of poultry products. Companion animal group, 8% operationally, primarily from sales of APOQUEL in Spain, India and Germany. A pick-up in sales of swine products in Western Europe, Australia, Canada and China and strong vaccine sales in China. I should note that other emerging markets grew 10% operationally and that included growth in Venezuela. You will recall that we're reducing our activities in Venezuela pending an improvement in the economic environment there for multinational companies. We're slowing down on inventories in the country and we will limit our future exports to Venezuela. Accordingly, sales growth in this market will trend downward over the balance of the year and continue into 2016 at significantly lower levels. The impact of our reduced emphasis in Venezuela is reflected in our guidance for 2015, 2016 and 2017. Let me turn you to our operational efficiency initiative and I will give this from the finance guy perspective. I will start with the punch line. We're on track to deliver at least $300 million of operating expense reductions by calendar 2017. As we implement the changes needed to deliver those savings where we will intact the interconnected capabilities with [Technical Difficulty] advantage, our leading direct sales force, our highly productive R&D engine and our global supply chain. When we enter 2017, we will do so with a direct presence in all of the markets around the globe that matter. And we will be promoting a portfolio comprised of the products that matter to our customers and have the best prospects for delivering revenue and profit growth. We want to be transparent with we respect to one-time costs and I want to call your attention to targets in the second quarter and broken down into three buckets. First, the standup and other one-time costs which are mainly associated with our separation from Pfizer totaling $39 million in the quarter. The lion's share of the standup cost should be behind us at the Q2 of 2016. Next, we recorded $263 million with costs associated with operational efficiency initiative, mainly for 2017 after attributed by the changes to our organization. This included about $25 million in non-cash charges. And, finally, there's a bucket for our supply strategy which had $15 million of charges as we're still in the early stages of this initiative. You can see on our webcast line the current estimates of one-time costs expected to be recorded in 2015 to 2017. Please note the cash forecasts for these projects remains the same as our previous guidance. Next guidance to 2016, based on our strong performance in Q2, we now in a range for revenue and adjusted EPS towards the top end of our range for revenue to $4.7 billion to $4.775 billion and adjusted EPS to $1.63 to $1.68 per share. With respect operating expenses, as I said earlier, we made excellent progress comparing that of the operating expenses in the first half of 2015. It's real important to note that there are some natural seasonal trends to how we incur expenses. In 2014, we incurred 45% of our total operating expenses in the first half of the year and 55% in the second half, with Q4 being our highest expensed quarter. That's a trend that you'd expect to see continued into 2015 but we expect to have a balance between Q3 and Q4 than in the past which was more heavily loaded in Q4. Please keep that in mind as you think about the balance of this year. Turning to our longer-term guidance for 2016 and 2017, we're affirming our expectations for 2016 and 2017 and call your attention to the table that's included as part of our press release. While thinking about the longer-term, I want to point out that we assume a constant diluted share count of approximately 502 million shares outstanding. As we said on our last call, but worth repeating, we intend to use our share repurchase program to at least offset the dilution related to the equity-based compensation that we provide to our colleagues. And I want to reiterate that the efficiency initiative will trigger an acceleration of some dilution and to those plans. During second quarter we repurchased 2.1 million shares for $98 million, an average price of $46.19 per share. Next, we saw that we recently filed on shelf registration statement. While we have no immediate plans to raise capital, the shelf provides us with the financial flexibility and access to capital markets quickly and when and if appropriate. Looking now ahead over the next six quarters or so, we had a number of calls with our cash including our standup cost, the cost of implementing the efficiency initiative, our dividend, ongoing share repurchases and a $400 million debt maturity in February of next year. So it makes sense to be prepared for that, right? That concludes our prepared remarks and we will now open the line for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And will take the first question from Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
Kevin Ellich: Ramon and wondering if you would give us a little bit more detail behind your comments on the APOQUEL supply and what is going on with the ERP in the implementation with the billing issues?
Juan Ramon Alaix: I will answer the APOQUEL question and then I will ask Paul to provide details of the presentation of the ERP, not only in the U.S. but also in other markets where we're implementing this new system. So in terms of APOQUEL, as I said we were able to increase significantly the supply from equity but still we're facing some challenge in ramping up and the manufacturing of API. And API is explaining some order of comments and it is a very complex manufacturing process and we had some delay in terms of permitting all the needs for finished goods. Now we have a process that in our opinion will meet the demands of the market and we expect that very soon we will be able to meet all the market demands in the power expectation. In 2015, as I said, we plan to sell about $153 million, 1.50 and that significantly increase the revenues in 2016. I'm very confident that the situation is under control. We have all the capacity that we need to use API and also to use the finished books in various in the market will start getting all the needs from our customers. For now Paul will provide an update
Paul Herendeen: Let me start by saying when we went live with the implementation SAP in the us in the beginning of May itself, high level and the go live was and continues to be a success and that is not to say that everything is perfect. I would say on the good side there is one reference and we have full control of our key business processes and we have full contact any of our financial information. We have work to do in addressing the ways in which our system changes and has enacted on our customers. The us segment of our business we interface with tens of thousands of customers and the overwhelming majority have been systems working well at that does not matter if you are a customer where our systems change has led to issues with respect to you and the customer so addressing all of those issues and it continues to be a top priority for us and we will continue to look at resources and about an outstanding issue and I'm sure you and others on the line including some of our customers this is something that Wanda and I think about every day. Last thing on this I hope is I've been involved in a number of SAP implementations and all of them have been successful and none of them have been without bumps in the road. We're going to call this implementation of success. Our customers are happy with the level of our customer service and we have work to do there and we're on it and we're on it every day.
Operator: And we will take next question from Louise Chen with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.
Louise Chen: Paul, I know you don't manage the quarters but I was curious how we should think about third quarter and fourth quarter were qualitatively in terms of EPS progression because you did announce a meaningful beat and second quarter but you did not raise your guidance as much is the be. Thanks
Paul Herendeen: A couple of things let's talk about it in second half. Please keep in mind as I mentioned earlier during my prepared remarks that the net-net was down over the second half of the year and we paired our expectations to APOQUEL to the lower in communicated range. Still expected to sell more than four times last year's volume but towards the low end of our previously range for APOQUEL also bear in mind you're looking at our business in the second half of the year and our livestock business that's been chugging along quite nicely thinks some very tough comps in the second half of the year. So realistically from the revenue perspective if we're going to be making our guidance range and we think that's pretty good. We're on track for 15 and on track for 16 and on track for 17 picked out on the expense side which really has more of the question to of around income, the income and where it should be and to call out my prepared remarks and it's at 55% of our OpEx in last year came in the second half of our year. We're expecting similar phasing in the second half of this year although less pronounced than you saw last year between Q3 and Q4 so you really need to take that into account in order to think about the full-year. We tightened our guidance range. We continue to be on track and we think for a very solid 2015 with a lot of moving parts and on into '16 and '17.
Operator: And we will take next question from Erin Wilson with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Erin Wilson: Can you speak to the recent acquisition of KL progress in the poultry segment and will that be a meaningful contributor going forward and how should we think about capital deployment more broadly as it relates to acquisition and how would you characterize the deal pipeline right now and are you looking at both small and large target? Thanks.
Juan Ramon Alaix: The first on the KL acquisition, it was a small acquisition but it's an indication that also enforce our presence in the country and will reinforce our presence also in the revised part of our business. So we're entering into a revised business some year ago and we have reason on [indiscernible] the ability to vaccinate and it's a very efficient device vaccinating up to 60,000 eggs per hour. Whether this device we're now -- KL problems but also we have strengthened our position in this part of the business. So it's more material but at the same time we also provide some additional relations with our customers and provide some additional service to them. Paul will respond to the capital deployment
Paul Herendeen: On the capital deployment I can't resist going through the whole sort of diagram of how we think about capital allocation. First and foremost we look for invest in our business and see opportunities to drive significant value for example increased investment through R&D and sales investment that, that would be our first call because we have a business that can generate organic growth in line or in the markets in which we compete with these investments and that would lead to a solid organic growth and earnings. Now next M&A is adamant to our organic growth it will be added to our organic growth, I think good example the Abbott acquisition earlier this year which is fitting in quite nicely and helping us with our results. We think we entered Q1 perhaps it might have been observed in that, we mentioned anatomy of line of sight towards completing the standup I described us as interested and ready to look at M&A opportunities that are out there in the market and we're looking for leverage in the places where we have expertise and where we can leverage our core capabilities, broad-spectrum we look at pipeline assets. We look at in-market products and technologies, we look at company acquisitions. I want to point out that we use a return date to evaluate transactions and we look for deals that add value and cash flow and retail will be value generated to our shareholders as we look to pursue those deals. We've got some capacity to do deals and we're interested in saying there are certainly areas that are adjacencies for us or areas where we currently like to do that
Juan Ramon Alaix: And we continue assessing any possibility [ph] that we make a strategic sense, we will generate synergies in terms of revenues and cost. We like the financial value. Also very important also we did incorporate into this assessment any antitrust in partners that we may have. That's really where we see M&A as a way to complement our internal growth, our operational growth and internal growth and that will increase the value of Zoetis and value to our shareholders.
Operator: The next question comes from John Kreger with William Blair. Please go ahead.
John Kreger: My question relates to the atopic dermatitis franchise that you are building. Can you talk about how APOQUEL these additions versus the new IL-31 antibody and do you expect to do a full launch of the new antibody now or wait for more clinical data. Thanks
Juan Ramon Alaix: John. APOQUEL it's an oral treatment compared to IL-31 which is injectable. APOQUEL is a pill that need to be taken on acute and also chronic conditions of the dog. While IL-31 it's more injectable so it's different and it will depend also on the [indiscernible] but definitely we see both of the problems very complementary and maybe one much more focus on the first line treatment and while IL-31can be used more for chronic conditions and for those dogs that require some additional attention from veterinarians and follow-up from veterinarians. The full launch of the product will release when we get the full license. So at the beginning we plan to do the product -- we continue to review the methodologies in the U.S. and then we will gain details on the efficacy that the data will be used to present this information to the USDA and then finally get final approval for the license in about a year.
Operator: Next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Chris Schott: We have had several big presence [indiscernible] with APOQUEL and IL-31 and [indiscernible]. Can you talk about how you think about the anticipated case of additional R&D development, should we expect another large product launching every two years and every year and then just on business development you said in the past that you’re looking to upgrade from smaller and mid-sized deals and that these opportunities tend to be more therapeutic and geographically focused. Are any therapeutic or geographic areas that are particularly attractive and are you interested in continuing to build-in devices or diagnostics? Thank you.
Juan Ramon Alaix: I will try to go through all of the different questions that you raised starting with the path line. We're very pleased with the productivity of our investment in our R&D. We've been able to produce APOQUEL but also control that we're very strong players in terms of vaccines and we had the opportunity to use also the vaccine [indiscernible] in record time and now we have also IL-31 and that will also complement our franchise dermatology space and we also expect in 2016 gaining approval for an oral parasiticide that is an important segment and where we're today we're under represented. We expect to enter this product in both U.S. and also the European markets. Definitely we're focused on bringing innovation and, in my opinion now we're showing that we're leading not only in terms of revenue but also in terms of innovation that we've been showing many examples of how our team is delivering this kind of innovation. At the same time, we're continuing investing in the part which is equally important which is extending the lifecycle of our portfolio. And this will present a significant part of our investment in fact most of our R&D budget is located to ensure that our problems remain competitive and we achieve that by combining products, increasing indications and also geographical expansion. So we’re very pleased with our innovation and pipeline, we definitely we like to see that these deliveries of this success continues in the future. In terms of business development, that you ask, we're now in a situation that we contemplate business development from a provisional first time. We have a significant presence in all of the therapeutic areas, we have facility presence in all geographies and also in all species but we still see opportunities some in cases between gaps that also strengthen our position. But it will be only when it makes sense from the financial point of view. In terms of other areas, we're very open to contemplate opportunities outside of our core business. We enter some into these complementary spaces, in genetics, devices and diagnostics and we will continue assessing opportunities in these areas that we will reinforce our position
Paul Herendeen: Before we for a jump off I want to go back to the kind of how do you think about the productivity or the pace coming out of R&D because it is one of our competitive trends. We often talk about and this is in round numbers, everybody, we often talk about our industry growing mid-single digits over time with if you thought of it is five using as an example, five is a 5% growth industry and 2% coming from units and 2% coming from price, 1% coming from new products. Our goal is to deliver more from self-developed products to the 1% and again I don't want to focus too often on one quarter but if you look in our quarter, second quarter of this year we have 2% of our growth year-over-year from introduction, products that have been in-line less than a year. Products like [indiscernible] collection of all other products that are in line for less than a year. So there is lots of things that are included in our R&D that are not in the same categories perhaps like an APOQUEL or Sarolaner or perhaps even an IL-31 but we go along and that growth is one, meaningful and two to the extent that we can grow faster in that market and that helps us deliver on one of our valued propositions which is our ability to grow our sales at a rate faster than the market.
Operator: Yes the next question is from Kathy Miner with Cowen and Company.
Kathy Miner: I was wondering if you could give us a little more of an update on your outlook for the livestock by species of cattle, swine and poultry and specifically as we get through the end of '15 and into '16 and also if you could point out what are the tough comparisons are for the second half that you mentioned earlier? Thank you.
Juan Ramon Alaix: Starting with livestock we see the market conditions are still favorable. If we start with cattle, the price of beef remains high. We see that also the value of the animals remain very high and this also creates an opportunity to continue providing [indiscernible] producers the problems that they need to keep the animals healthy and productivity. Swine and poultry are also two species that have been performing very well, swine in this quarter represented the growth of 14% while in the quarter poultry was showing only 1% but one of the advantages of Zoetis is that we have a presence in all species and we can really maximize opportunities despite of some temporary challenges in one species or one in geography. So in that respect we see that the prospect for livestock remain positive and we see that continually in 2016.
Paul Herendeen: The other question was to talk about the tougher comparison in livestock compared to last year. You look back in the second half 2014 and we had margins or significant ramp up of [indiscernible] and things like that in the prior-year that were not present in the first half of 2014 and the compared year. So that's what leads to more difficult comparison year-over-year. in the livestock space.
Operator: Next question is from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Alex Arfaei: Paul, can you give us your thoughts and expectations regarding potential tax reform in the U.S. which seems to be gaining traction and specifically for your company as we [indiscernible] important goal for your tax rate and follow-up if I make strong performance in Brazil driven by new product launches, are these products that are already available in other major markets or can we expect similar launches for these products? Thank you.
Juan Ramon Alaix: Looking at the first tax question is, tax is on [indiscernible] going on forever but it doesn't mean it won't create some traction but it's important to our structure and the answer is it could be to the extent that we have earnings and cash that's offshore and part of our tax structure partly intend to permanently deploy that capital offshore, the rules are changing, it affect us just like any other U.S. multinational company. So we will just have to wait and see on that
Paul Herendeen: Let me then answer to your question about product traction in other markets. We see in general that companion animals are more global produce and this is something we have that products in that segment [indiscernible] in all markets around the world and this has been the case of APOQUEL and also would be the case of IL-31 and some of the products in these categories. In terms of livestock, it depends. You asked about the Brazil, Brazil is a very strong market in terms of cattle but also the cattle industry we have very specific conditions and we have been introducing definitely new product but in some cases very specific to Brazil and more recent interaction has been produce for reproduction that has been produce introduce in Brazil at the end of 2014. We will continue to try to expand our portfolio as much as we can geographically and definitely this is part of our potential growth ensuring that we have all of the heavy market introducing in all of our markets.
Operator: We will go next to Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Mark Schoenebaum: The growth in the third quarter I just want to continue the question about the tax. So I'm wondering how much tax optimization or tax planning are already included in the long-term guidance because it looks like the effective tax continues to be between 29% and 30% for the next two years. How much is already tax planning that was already included in the new guidance and if there is any additional potential to optimize further the tax rate in the longer term? And somewhat related to the question about M&As, what rates would be interested in introductions and for purposes whether [indiscernible] interested in merging with the company which is not truly animal health. Thank you
Paul Herendeen: So first question how much is included in our long-term guidance? We’ve a structure I think we’ve articulated that we think we have a solid structure based on the hand that we're dealt here that will allow us to maintain a tax rate in the order of call it 29%-ish for the planning horizon for us at goes out at least three years that we provided guidance. We talked many times and we look for any opportunity to grind that rate down and it is a grind. It is not something that there is a magic bullet that we can put in place in the new structure and magically reduce our tax rate by 700 basis points. We do what we can and we think we have a good solid supportable structure and that’s what is included in our guidance over the long-term. With respect to an inversion, we talk about this as well. In our there are precious few companies that would make sense for us to work with and the second thing that we try to talk about at our investor day back in November of last year is based on our particular set of circumstances we feel that in an inversion transaction the benefit if you focus on the entity that’s currently called Zoetis an offshore [indiscernible] debt would be roughly reduce our tax rate by some 600 basis points market folks are suggestive that there are other ways that could be pretty dramatically beyond that and that's our point of view and that's what we said back in November and we continue to believe that. So in terms of the transaction it could be helpful and it's not something that for us would take our tax rate down into the one-time single digits
Juan Ramon Alaix: So we haven't distributed any option but you have to think about this opportunity that can be justified not only because of tax but because of the strategic rational of the position and this is something that we include in the assessment.
Operator: We will go next to David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: It's [indiscernible] filling for Dave, so I have a question on pricing. Wondering whether some of this can raise prices in livestock and companion animal anymore then you have in the past?
Juan Ramon Alaix: We're always trying to maximize gross profit and the opportunity to maximize gross profit is coming from including the volume, including prices and finding the right balance between volume and price. And we will find good strategy in terms of prices and definitely see opportunities to raise prices at the higher pace and we would consider that. We have been quite aggressive and price increases in some of the emerging markets and where we have high inflation and then because of that we're also applying high price increases. In developed markets what we're trying to also is make sure we remain competitive and we're not creating a negative impact in our volume that also we have impacted revenue in terms of cost of manufacturing. All of these is part of what we consider in terms of price increases. 
Operator: Next question comes from Jeff Holford and this will be our final question today. Jeff, go ahead.
Jeff Holford: So as well as operational efficiency program being very good for helping the efficiency of the overall business, you did talk on last quarter's call about how this might make Zoetis much better platform for integrating acquisitions. Can you just give us a bit more feel of when this process would progress through to the point where less focus on drug in the process and the platform is more efficient and you might be able to consider larger size deals because I would assume at the moment with a lot of work still do on this program, that’s not something that should be in the cards right now. Thank you.
Juan Ramon Alaix: On the primary it's running and in my opinion it's running at full speed. So we will be finalizing all of the necessary changes at the end of this year and there will be also a significant work done in terms of reduction of SKUs and also changing the internal markets. I don't see at this point that our operational efficiency program is any kind of restriction, or creating any kind of restriction for M&A. On the contrary now we have an operation that is a key endpoint and we can really maximize the opportunities for any position with the model that will be more profitable. So they will start running well in terms of our program. I don't see any concern or issue on delivering or exceeding the target of 600 million and at the same time considering the M&A opportunities.
Paul Herendeen: The operating efficiency initiative is not a gaining factor looking at our M&A opportunities. The best time to do a deal is when there is an attractive actionable deal in front of you, what I expressed earlier was we're ready and we would be able to take advantage of the situation if we could present itself, we’re good to go.
Operator: We will take that from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead
Unidentified Analyst: This is Arielle in for Jami. I just wanted to follow up on the M&A question. Can you discuss your firepower. You mentioned on many calls that you’re somewhat cash restrained with operational efficiency, so are you able to do a large scale deal and can you remind us what your max leverage ratio you are comfortable with? Are you willing to use equity and then just secondly there has been a lot of restrictions with antibiotic usage and livestock so can you just give provide color at what is the downside risk for your business. Thanks
Paul Herendeen: We're thinking about M&A let's go back and start and answer the capital structure question first, we might express an upper bound of what we would put on in terms of leverage but what we have said is we're generally thinking about target for as roughly 2.5 turns of EBITDA in our cap structure and the expectation is in the normal course ranging 2.5 to 3.5 times somewhere in that vicinity. Now what we have also said is that we have the right opportunity we would be more aggressive in the use of debt capital in order to be able to complete a value generative transaction. So what does that mean? It means that we look to balance our desire to maintain a solid credit profile and access the capital with how much debt we put on and having a clear pathway to reducing the leverage over a period of time. We have the capacity to do good sized deals within our company. And as I said the best time to do deals is when there is an opportunity in front of you and we would use all available leverage in order to be able to formed and conclude the transaction that we felt was value generative for all the shareholders
Juan Ramon Alaix: And then let me take the question on what is the potential risk. We have in our portfolio about 30% of our revenues coming from antibiotics. Out of this 30%, 25% is a companion animal and we see low risk and then the rest is between MSAs and also injectable products which again we see less risk than probably is provided to animals in feed. There are different levels of categories on the use of antibiotics, [indiscernible] and also the different species where the problems arise. There has been a significant rumors or comments mainly in poultry where some of the producers have decided to move away from medical important antibiotics and to use non-medical important antibiotics. We have in our portfolio both and we think we can provide to our producers, mainly poultry activity produce that will meet their demand and also meet also consumer demand. So in our opinion I think it is a risk that is manageable and the advantage that I mentioned in many occasions we have a portfolio which is extremely diverse in terms of species, in terms of geographies and in terms of specific areas and also very important in terms of specific areas when they move away from antibiotics they need to increase significantly the use of vaccines to protect this animal. So again we have a significant presence in vaccines so we can compensate any kind of impact on certain areas and have increased in others.
Operator: It appears we have no further questions at this time so I will turn the floor back over to Juan Ramon for any closing remarks
Juan Ramon Alaix: Thank you very much for attending this call and thank you very much for your questions and again we think that we reported this quarter very strong results and we're very confident on delivering our objective in 2015. Thank you very much.

Operator: Welcome to the first quarter 2015 financial results conference call and webcast for Zoetis. Hosting the call today is John O'Connor, Vice President of Investor Relations for Zoetis. The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, and will not be forwarded automatically. In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately 2 hours after the conclusion of this call via dial-in or on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. [Operator Instructions] It's now my pleasure to turn the floor over to John O'Connor. John, you may begin.
John O'Connor: Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to the Zoetis First Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. I'm joined today by Juan Ramón Alaix, our Chief Executive Officer; and Paul Herendeen, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'll remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statement in today's press release and our SEC filings including, but not limited to, our 2014 annual report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q. Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and in the company's 8-K filing dated today, May 5, 2015. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. We have a significant amount of detail to cover today, including specific details of our financial outlook through 2017. We will be posting both Juan Ramón and Paul's prepared remarks on the Investor section of zoetis.com following the call to help clearly disseminate these details. With that, I will turn the call over to Juan Ramón.
Juan Ramón Alaix: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I will briefly comment on our performance for the quarter. And then I will provide details of the operational efficiency program that we announced this morning. Paul will then walk you through our result for the quarter and discuss the financial impact of the operational efficiency program, including an update to guidance for 2015, '16 and '17. During the first quarter, we generated operational growth of 6% in revenue and 14% in adjusted net income, delivering adjusted diluted EPS of $0.41 per share. During the quarter, half of our operational growth or 3% was attributed to price. New products, such as ACTOGAIN an acquired product from Abbott Animal Health, accounted for 2% while in-line products contributed to 1% of revenue growth for the quarter. As a note, all the following growth rates that I will discuss are operational. In livestock, we grew 7% to $715 million with all species contributing to growth. Cattle revenue grew 7% to $397 million with favorable market conditions in the U.S. and Brazil driving growth across the portfolio, while weather and reduced herd size led to declines in Australia and New Zealand. Swine revenue, which grew 13% to $170 million, is benefiting from increased herd size in the U.S. after a winter of lower piglet mortality from PEDv plus positive industry momentum in the CLAR region. Poultry revenue grew 1% to $129 million as the U.S. reintroduction of Zoamix, a medicated feed additive, helped to offset a negative impact from the timing of product rotations in several countries. Turning to animal health -- companion animal health. Revenues grew 4% to $377 million due to the continued performance of key brands and overall strong growth in China and Latin American markets. We closed on the purchase of Abbott Animal Health assets in early February, so sales of newly acquired Abbott products also contributed to results. They were recorded primarily in the U.S. where we have seen additional competition in the pain and sedation markets. These results continue to demonstrate the strength of the business model as defined by our 3 interconnected capabilities: the largest and most capable field force in the industry with direct customer interactions, investing more innovation than any other company, and having the highest quality products and more reliable supply at a competitive cost. These 3 capabilities form an essential foundation for long-term success in animal health. Going forward, we are committed to investing in these capabilities but also see an opportunity to use them in more focused ways to enhance competitiveness and drive greater value for our customers and shareholders. Over the last 2 years, since becoming an independent company, we have delivered on our operating and financial targets, created shareholder value and continue to meet our customer needs while standing up a new global company and infrastructure. We are certainly proud of what we have achieved. And as we transition out of our stand-up phase, we are focused on driving efficiency and reducing complexity that is a barrier to productivity. The program we announced today is a comprehensive plan that is designed to simplify operations, improve our cost structure and better allocate resources. We enter this next stage building on solid business performance, and we'll emerge as a stronger, simpler and more cost-efficient organization. We expect to generate cost savings of $300 million in 2017 and see our adjusted EBIT margin improve from 25% in 2014 to approximately 34% in 2017 as we reduce complexity and achieve a greater focus on key brands and markets. We are fully aligned to achieve these goals and have the plans in place to incentivize our leaders to exceed these targets. These initiatives will allow us to derive additional value by taking full advantage of our scale. It will allow us to invest in the products, markets and infrastructure that will drive profitable growth and continued leadership in the animal health industry. There are several important reasons why we are initiating this program. First, after 2 years of separating from Pfizer, we now have full control of our operations, manufacturing and corporate systems and we have identified significant opportunities for improvement. Second, while the breadth of our portfolio and global footprint remain strength of our business, we have seen certain elements of our breadth generate complexity that is a barrier to delivering value to our customers and to generating long-term growth. Third, we are beginning to see the benefits of implementing our ERP system. The resulting standardization and potential to simplify our business through our new ERP system will allow us to increase productivity and streamline operations. And finally, we remain focused on growing revenues and finding the most productive ways to allocate resources to internal investments and business development activities. We have 3 main objectives for this operational efficiency initiative. First, we want to reduce complexity that does not add value for our customers and our business. Second, we want to optimize our resource allocation and efficiency. And third, we want to better position Zoetis for long-term profitable growth. We'll deliver our first objective to reduce complexity by enhancing our focus on products, markets and manufacturing plants that are most important to our future. We'll eliminate approximately 5,000 lower-revenue and lower-margin product SKUs out of a total of 13,000. This will drive higher focus and more reliable supply of our products and services. We'll enhance our manufacturing operations and accelerate the implementation of our supply network strategy. We plan to sell or exit about 10 manufacturing sites over the long term. Reflecting the strategic importance of manufacturing to our business model, Roman Trawicki, President of Global Manufacturing and Supply, will now report directly to me as part of the executive team. We will change our selling approach in approximately 30 markets by shifting to an indirect sales model or reducing our presence in certain countries. We reduce the number of regional reporting segments from 4 to 2: the U.S. and International. We expect these changes to result in greater decision-making authority closer to the customers while leveraging our scale to efficiently deliver marketing and other operational support. The U.S. Region will be led by Kristin Peck and the International Region will be led by Clint Lewis. Both are current members of our executive team and will continue reporting to me. To deliver on our second objective, to optimize resource allocation and efficiency, we will take the following actions: We will leverage the efficiency and standardization of our newly implemented ERP system to significantly reduce general and administrative costs in corporate functions. In addition to the ERP benefits, another important efficiency driver will be a reduction of management layers and increased span of control through the organization. We'll improve our ability to be more dynamic and agile in responding to customer needs by shifting marketing resources closer to the customer and simplifying all areas of noncustomer-facing commercial infrastructure. And we'll enhance our R&D focus to support a smaller portfolio of products as well as better prioritize the R&D portfolio to invest in projects with the highest returns. In the past, we have demonstrated our commitment to improve our operations and be more efficient. In 2009, we achieved a successful transformation when we became the world's largest animal health business through several acquisitions. Then in 2013, we became a large, global independent company followed by 2 consecutive years of industry-leading performance. Through each of these changes we have made ourselves better, improve how we serve customers and create new and greater value to our stakeholders. I'm confident that the comprehensive plan we have announced today will allow us to transform again, building on our successful business model to deliver high-quality profitable revenue growth and becoming a more competitive company. These are significant initiatives that will drive us to be a more focused and streamlined company. As a result, we'll see a reduction in the number of positions at Zoetis of approximately 2,000 to 2,500 over the next 12 to 18 months, subject to any consultation with work councils and unions in certain markets. With the implementation of this initiative, we will better align Zoetis' resources and operating structure with our 3 interconnected capabilities; supply products, more reliable and at a competitive cost; increase capacity to invest in future business drivers; and finally, tailor the product portfolio and improve efficiency of the operating model so we can pursue the next horizon of opportunity as a world leader with a single focus on animal health. Through this process, we'll be more competitive and better positioned to achieve long-term profitable growth. Before Paul cover the financial details, I would like to thank all our colleagues who have contributed to our success through an environment of intense change. Our next transformation will be key to supporting our future success, and I know that we have the capabilities and the team to implement these significant changes. Paul?
Paul S. Herendeen: Thank you, Juan Ramón, and good morning, everyone. We have lots of important things to talk about on this call, as we just revealed our plans to improve the efficiency of our operating model. But before we get to that, I don't want us to lose sight of the terrific quarter that we just put on the board. So let's get started. As you'll remember, our fourth quarter of 2014 featured strong operational growth and we were able to carry that momentum forward into Q1 of 2015 and give us a good start to the year. We delivered on our primary value drivers posting revenue and adjusted net income growth on an operational basis of 6% and 14%, respectively. Pretty good, right? Like other U.S. multinational companies, FX rates had a major impact on our reported results. On a reported basis, FX rates decreased our reported revenue by $58 million, resulting in our reported revenue growth being flat with Q1 of 2014. The impact on our adjusted net income was $16 million and so reduced our growth in adjusted net income from 14% on an operational basis to 8% on a reported basis. So FX impacted our top line by some 600 basis points and adjusted net income by 600 basis points. I said this before and I'll say it again today, we can't control FX rates. We manage our business on an operational basis, and on that basis, we're continuing to deliver strong fundamental growth in revenue and profits. You can read about the regional segment results in the press release and tables, so I won't spend too much time on them here, but I do want to cover a few highlights. The U.S. continued to perform very well, up 9% versus Q1 of '14, with strong livestock performance, which was up 14%. We continue to gain share in the U.S. livestock segment, especially cattle, based on producers' confidence in the reliability of our products to protect their investment in their animals. In companion animal, which was up 3%, we anticipate even more positive results through the balance of the year as we now have increased supply for APOQUEL. CLAR also continues performing well, with revenue up 13% on an operating basis, and that's driven by Brazil and other emerging markets. Later, when I talk about our go-forward plans to streamline and adjust our global footprint, I'll speak to our plans to deemphasize our efforts in Venezuela where the business and economic climates are becoming more challenging. In APAC, where we posted 1% operating growth in revenue, we're seeing good performance in emerging markets like China but drought conditions in developed markets, including Australia and New Zealand are having an impact. In EuAfME, where revenue was flat compared with Q1 of 2014, the takeaway is that good performance on our key brands in companion animal are being offset by declines in anti-infectives, primarily due to legislative changes in France. Now let me turn to what I will call our operational efficiency initiative. This initiative is a natural next step in the evolution of our company as a stand-alone entity with a singular focus on animal health. While we enjoy an enviable position in animal health today, our current product portfolio, footprint and organization came about in ways that were, to some extent, unplanned. The makeup of our product portfolio was heavily influenced by human health acquisitions made by Pfizer that had animal health components. These were very important to building our scale and portfolio, but the animal health assets were not the focus of those deals. And while we spend a lot of time and energy standing up our own organization and building our own culture, we quite naturally carried across organizational designs, processes and practices that worked well when we were a division of Pfizer, but may not represent the best options for a pure-play animal health company. Said another way, it's doubtful that we serendipitously came upon the best possible structure and organization to maximize our opportunity in the animal health industry. Our first priority over the last few years has been to build out the functions that we need to support our business on a stand-alone basis. We had to establish our own supply chain, build our own IT infrastructure and put in place the G&A functions like finance, HR and legal to support a global public company. While we did that, we elected to leave our commercial and R&D organizations largely as is to minimize the impact of our stand-up on our customers and on our business. I think our track record of revenue and profit growth over the last 2 years, and so far into 2015, support the wisdom of that approach. But now with the completion of the stand-up activities in sight, it's time to look at the entirety of our current state and take steps to improve the design and efficiency of our company. Importantly, we are not questioning the fundamental elements of our business model. Our model relies on what we refer to as our 3 interconnected capabilities: one, face-to-face interaction with our customers to drive revenue; two, investment in product innovation to sustain our revenue base and our growth prospects; and three, the ability to meet our customers' demand with quality products. These capabilities form the basis of our competitive advantage in the global animal health industry and changes to these areas will fall into the category of continuous improvement, not major changes. The bulk of our future cost savings will not impact these areas. Our field force, the personnel in the front lines with our customers, will remain largely intact. The scope of our activities in R&D will also remain substantially the same, and we will continue to invest in programs to build and improve our supply chain. Let me separate the 2015 program into 2 parts as I see them and then add on the previously announced supply network strategy to think about 3 areas of focus. Part 1 is what I'll call rationalizing our footprint, part 2 is driving improved efficiency in our operating expenses, and part 3 is streamlining and improving the efficiency of our supply chain. Starting with rationalizing our footprint. This work included a review of the number of SKUs that make up our product portfolio, consideration of moving to indirect sales models in a number of markets where we currently have a direct presence and evaluations of markets where we might choose to reduce our efforts. The headline here is that we will be eliminating nearly 40% of our total SKUs. These SKUs create significant complexity across multiple functions within our company. Of course, this will reduce our revenue and gross profits in the near term, but it will enable us to substantially improve the efficiency of our operations, from our supply chain and sales support, to G&A expenses and the product maintenance costs that are part of our R&D. With a leaner portfolio comprised of our more profitable product assets, we will have better growth prospects. We also intend to move from direct sales models to indirect distributor models in certain countries and reduce our efforts or exit some markets. When complete, the streamlining of our portfolio and global footprint will reduce our expected 2017 sales by some $280 million and gross profit by about $100 million. For the avoidance of doubt, those numbers are based on current FX rates. The estimated revenue and gross profit impacts are reflected in our revised guidance for 2016 and 2017. Part 2 of the initiative is driving improved efficiency within our SG&A expenses and our investment in R&D. We're collapsing from 4 regions to 2 as we go forward. We're reorganizing the support for countries, including enabling functions, like finance, IT, HR and legal, but also the noncustomer-facing resources that support our field sales forces. We're taking steps to improve the focus of our R&D activities, supporting a smaller portfolio of products, identifying greater efficiency in our regulatory practices and better prioritizing our R&D spend. And yes, our expected spend for customer-facing resources will be less as well, mainly driven by the reduction in the number of markets where we'll have a direct presence, and the deemphasis of certain other markets but also through improvements in efficiency. In total, by calendar 2017, we expect our total operating expenses, that is the sum of SG&A plus R&D, to be roughly $300 million less than it would have been but for this initiative. As I said just a moment ago, we are not changing our business model here and that should be reflected in the way you should think about the sources of the $300 million of future savings. Roughly 1/3 is expected to come from reduced G&A and another 1/3 from commercial resources that are not customer-facing. That's roughly 2/3 of the expected savings coming from areas that should not impact our ability to deliver near-term and long-term revenue growth. Of the remaining cost savings, about 10% is expected to come from improvements in efficiency within our R&D organization. About 5% is expected to come from the reduction of our field resources tied to our revised global footprint and reduced emphasis in some emerging markets, and the balance of the cost savings here is expected to come from reducing complexity and increasing efficiency in other areas. The third and final piece of the initiative is the supply network strategy that Kristin Peck outlined at our Investor Day last November. Most of the benefits of that work will be realized after 2017. So for now let's set the supply network strategy aside and focus on the activities that will impact our results in the period from 2015 to 2017, but keep in mind that the supply network strategy initiative is expected to add some 200 basis points to our gross margin by 2020 on top of the improvements driven by the 2015 initiative. You've heard me say this many times in the past that when we're looking at our operating efficiency, there are opportunities for us to do better. Today we back those words up, providing you with a framework of our plans to improve the operating performance of Zoetis while preserving the key elements of our value proposition. In our to be state in calendar 2017, we'll be an even better company than we are today, more profitable on a slightly smaller revenue base, positioned to deliver better growth from a more focused product portfolio and working off of a leaner cost structure that can be leveraged to support revenue and profit growth over the long term. After completing the change we're announcing today, we'll still be the leader in animal health, and we will continue to be the biggest investor in innovation in animal health. And we will continue to have the largest direct sales network in the industry. Our improved efficiency will provide us with more flexibility to allocate resources where we can best serve our customers' needs and to further distance ourselves from the competition. The efficiency initiative adds an estimated $200 million to our expectations for pretax earnings in 2017, driven by the $300 million in operating expense savings, offset in part by the $100 million of projected decrease in gross profit attributable to the streamlining of our product portfolio and the rationalizing of our global footprint. This initiative adds roughly $0.28 to our prior estimate of 2017 adjusted net income per share. So the song remains the same, only better. We're a company that can grow its re-based revenues in line with or faster than the mid-single-digit growth of our markets while holding the growth in our leaned-out operating expenses to the inflation rate and thereby delivering long-term profit growth greater than our revenue growth. And that's off of a higher profit base, and that's a winner. Of course, the improvements in our future financial model don't come free. So I want to take a few minutes to talk about one-time costs generally and to specifically address the costs associated with the efficiency initiative. First, it's important for you to know that we have a high standard when it comes to costs that we characterize as onetime and, therefore, are excluded from adjusted net income. Our policy limits such adjustments to purchase accounting, acquisition-related costs and certain significant items that we evaluate on an individual basis. These include direct and incremental costs required to complete the stand-up of the company and those direct costs that we will incur to execute our efficiency plan. Next, we want to be transparent about the amount and nature of these costs, so our intention is to provide disclosure of our onetime costs in 3 buckets. The bucket for stand-up costs and other onetime costs that you're already familiar with; a new bucket for the efficiency initiative that we announced today; and a third bucket for the cost associated with the longer-term elements of the supply network strategy. We estimate our remaining pretax stand-up and other onetime costs at $180 million to $210 million with those costs to be recorded primarily in the remainder of 2015 and through 2017. These are primarily all-cash costs. We estimate the onetime pretax cash costs associated with the efficiency initiative to be in the range of $340 million to $400 million and to be incurred in 2015, 2016 and with some modest portion moving into 2017. We expect actual cash payouts to occur over the next few years. Note that there will also be noncash charges triggered by this initiative. We are not providing an estimate of these charges as both the amounts and timing could vary widely. As we incur these noncash charges, we'll call them out for you when recognized. Finally, the supply-network strategy. onetime-pretax cash costs are currently estimated at $60 million to $100 million and are expected to be incurred over the term of the plan. It's worth noting that we are still in the early phases of architecting the supply network strategy, and the final onetime costs for this activity could be substantially different depending on the final outcome of our ongoing analysis of our supply network and the timing or nature of any specific site exits. There will also be noncash charges triggered by the supply network strategy, and we will call those out to you when recognized. Note that the estimates of onetime pretax costs for both the efficiency initiative and the supply network strategy ignore the possible proceeds that we may receive from the sale of certain assets, which could potentially offset some of the onetime cash costs. We provided a webcast slide that summarizes our current estimates of the onetime pretax cash costs associated with each of the 3 buckets over the period from 2015 to 2017. We will refresh our view of the various buckets of onetime costs as appropriate. I want to call your attention now to an unrelated change to our go-forward outlook, and that's our decision to decrease our activities in Venezuela. The animal health industry in Venezuela features solid underlying fundamentals and our business there has performed well. However, recent economic developments necessitate an evaluation of our efforts there. While our business in Venezuela is profitable, it has become increasingly difficult to realize those profits in U.S. dollars. Unless and until that environment changes, sales and profits there will drive low quality earnings, so we're significantly paring back our activities there. To be clear, Venezuela is a solid local market and we will maintain a presence there as we believe that the environment will improve over time. However, in the interim, we believe it's prudent to reduce our activities and exposure there. The decision to reduce our activities in Venezuela impacts our revenue and profit expectations for 2015, '16 and '17. The impact on 2015 can be seen in the exhibit to our press release that bridges from our prior guidance to our revised guidance. We've also provided a slide on the webcast that shows the impact of Venezuela on 2017, which decreases our expectations for adjusted net income in 2017 by $0.07 per share. Now let me provide an update on our guidance for the full year 2015 in light of the changes in FX rates since our last guidance update, the anticipated impacts of the efficiency program and our decision to reduce our efforts in Venezuela. I also want to update you on our expectation for 2016 and '17 and to provide you with more detail about those years. We felt it was important to say more about 2016 and '17 as there are a lot of moving parts here, and we want you to have a clear picture of our expectations. First, 2015 full year guidance. In our press release and in a webcast slide, we provided a bridge from our prior guidance to our revised guidance. The headline is that despite the continued headwinds from changes in FX rates and our decision to reduce our business in Venezuela, we're holding our guidance for adjusted net income per share for 2015 in the range of $1.61 to $1.68 per share. This includes pluses and minuses. FX is a minus again. The changes in FX rates from late January, underlying our last updated guidance, to late April, decreased our revenue expectation for 2015 by some $75 million or 155 basis points, while the impact on adjusted net income was much less, only about $5 million or 60 basis points. Then our decision to pare back our efforts in Venezuela reduces our revenue expectations by $50 million, operating expenses by $5 million and decreased our expectations for adjusted net income by $25 million. Finally, the big plus, and that's the impact of the efficiency initiative, which reduced our expectations for operating expenses by $45 million compared with our prior guidance and increased our expected adjusted net income by $30 million. So when the dust settles, we expect our reported revenue to be down by $125 million from our prior guidance range and our adjusted net income to be consistent with our prior guidance, $1.61 to $1.68 per share. It's worth pointing out that we decreased our 2015 guidance for revenue growth on an operational basis by 100 basis points to the range of 5.5% to 7.5%. The reduction in the growth rate is due to the expected reduction in sales in Venezuela. We translate Venezuela revenues at the fixed official exchange rate of VEF 6.3 to the dollar, so the $50 million expected reduction in revenue shifts the operational growth rate. And the adjusted net income operational growth rate is estimated to increase 1% as a contribution from our efficiency program should more than offset the impact of Venezuela. Turning to 2016 and '17. We provided a lot of detail for you so that you can recalibrate your expectations for us through 2017. As you can see how this longer-term guidance compares with your prior expectations, I submit that you must first revise your prior expectations to reflect the changed FX rates. To help you do that, the change in FX rates from late January to late April should reduce your 2016 and 2017 revenue expectations by roughly 215 -- excuse me, 215, 2-1-5 basis points, cost of goods sold by 260, 2-6-0 basis points and operating expenses, including both SG&A and R&D by 170 basis points, with the result being a roughly 235 basis point decrease in projected adjusted net income driven by the changes in FX rates. Using that re-based forecast in comparison with our revised guidance for 2016 and '17 will enable you to isolate and evaluate the impacts of the 2015 efficiency initiative together with our decision to reduce our efforts in Venezuela. In a nutshell, and looking at 2017, when the full benefits of our efficiency initiative are expected to be realized, the efficiency initiative increases our expectations for 2017 pretax income by roughly $200 million. Meanwhile, the Venezuela action reduces our pretax expectations by $55 million. Net, we add $145 million to our pretax expectations for 2017, roughly $100 million in adjusted net income or $0.20 per share. As Juan Ramón mentioned, the steps we are taking over the next several years are expected to enable us to improve our EBIT margin by some 500 basis points in 2017 to circa 34%. Here are a few other factors for you to consider. Our guidance does not reflect any future currency devaluation in Venezuela. We expect a slightly higher effective tax rate for the remainder of the year 2015, higher than the 27% that we had in the first quarter of 2015. The operating expense benefits that we are seeking will begin to be most evident in Q4, and our guidance assumes a constant diluted share count of approximately 502 million shares outstanding. This includes share repurchases totaling an estimated $100 million in the first half of 2015, which are partially offset by actual and projected dilution relating to employees' equity-based compensation. We also assumed a comparable level of diluted weighted average shares outstanding for 2016 and '17 as we intend for our share repurchase program to at least offset projected dilution from future employee compensation programs, including the acceleration impacts of our operational efficiency initiative. All the other details of our guidance are included in the table attached to our press release. Finally, we covered a lot of ground on this call. To assist with clear communications, as John said, we will be posting copies of Juan Ramón's and my scripts to our Investor Relations website following this call. That concludes my prepared remarks and we'll now open up the line for your questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Louise Chen with Guggenheim.
Louise Alesandra Chen - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division: So my question is on your organic sales growth and also your gross margin once you lap on the headwinds from, I guess, getting rid of some of these lower-margin SKUs.
Juan Ramón Alaix: Thank you, Louise. And definitely, our plan is to have our growth in terms of revenues in line or faster than the market. The market is expected to grow about 5% in the medium- and long-term, and we are also targeting it to grow in line with this growth or exceed this growth. In terms of gross margin, we also plan to significantly increase our gross margin. So eliminating these lower-margin SKUs will represent 200 basis points of gross margin improvement and also the price increases and also the discipline on -- or the reduction of expenses also will generate a significant improvement in gross margin. So on top of that, as Paul mentioned, our plan and work strategy that we announced at the time of the Investor Day will also generate another 200 basis points of gross margin improvement.
Paul S. Herendeen: Yes, Louise, and it's Paul, I'll just follow on that. I'll just point you to the slide on the webcast for the 2015 to '17 guidance, and you can see the impact -- or the expected improvement in our gross margin there, where we're looking out to 2017 after the, as I say, after the dust settles. So we'll get to a margin where we're projecting a range of 32% to 33% and with the opportunity to do better than that as we continue our progress on our supply network strategy.
Operator: And we can take that question from Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray.
Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: So looking at the operational improvement initiative. Paul, you laid out a lot of good information. I guess kind of a combination question. In 2016, operational growth looks a little bit like the negative 1% to plus 2%. Is that really due to getting out of Venezuela? Because it looks like you guys expect some pretty decent growth from that market. And I guess strategically, have you embedded much in terms of M&A acquisitions? I guess, where do your interests really lie within diagnostics? It looked like a new product launch in diagnostics may have helped drive some of the companion animal growth we saw in U.S. Just wondering if that's the feline rapid test and wondering if you have other plans in that category.
Paul S. Herendeen: Yes, thanks for the question, Kevin. It's Paul. I'll start with talking about the growth rate in 2016. I mean, one of the reasons why we felt compelled to provide a lot of detail around '16 and '17 is, as we go about the, what I'll call, the rationalization of our portfolio, the timing of when those sales go away will certainly have an impact on what you should expect, as what we expect, for 2016. And then we return to what I'll call a rebased model in 2017. So 2 things affecting '16: one, as you correctly point out, is Venezuela hitting the operational rate; and the second is, the timing of the SKUs that we're pruning from the portfolio when we start to see a decrease in sales. You note that we, for the balance of '15, expect -- did not show you a line item reducing our revenue expectations associated with the reduction in the SKUs in the portfolio. That really starts to come into play in 2016 and we should enter '17 clean.
Juan Ramón Alaix: So let me answer the question on M&A. So definitely, M&A is part of our strategy, and we are considering any M&A opportunity that will increase the value of this company and will support our objective in terms of generating higher margins in our operations. So where is our interest? Any opportunity which is in the animal health domain. We think that we have all the capabilities, and also now we have, or will have, even much better ratios in terms of cost and in terms of expenses to revenue, so we can really maximize opportunities of any potential acquisition.
Operator: And we can take that question from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.
Christopher T. Schott - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Just wonder if you'd -- try and elaborate a little bit more on the operational efficiency initiative here. I guess in the past, you've talked a lot about your direct selling model being a competitive advantage versus some of your peers. Can you just elaborate a little bit more with the decision today in the smaller markets to move to more of an indirect model? Just what's changed in terms of that view? Is it that these were markets that were never going to get the scale you needed to justify the investments you're making? I'm trying to understand a little bit more the strategic shift that you're making on those. Second question is just with the new kind of plan as you're aligning your approach here. Are there any management incentives that you're putting in place or any changes to management incentive that are going to come about as a result of this operational efficiency plan as we think about the 2015 targets, et cetera?
Juan Ramón Alaix: Thank you, Chris. And what we are trying with this initiative is to be much more focused. And we mentioned many times that our diversity, or the breadth of our business, it was a competitive advantage. But we have also identified some areas or some elements of this diversity, which is adding a complexity, which is a barrier to deliver value to our customers and also to create that value to Zoetis. What we are trying is we've now been much more focused on the countries and also the products that will generate the highest value to Zoetis. It's to really move away from our model, which is a model that will be 100% applicable to those markets, and we are now in these small markets in -- where we don't see that the model is efficient in terms of our profitability, and then moving to a model that will be indirect and will be relying more on distributors to support our revenues. So the strategy is not changing. What we are, it's really focused on the market that would generate the highest opportunities for Zoetis and also the product that will integrate the highest revenues to our company and the most profitable growth. In terms of the management incentives, we have in place programs to incentivize our leaders in Zoetis for exceeding the $300 million target that we have in our program. So we have these plans and we are convinced that we'll be working to meet or exceed our objectives.
Operator: We'll take that question from Erin Wilson with Bank of America.
Erin E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Does the new guidance on the top line include contributions in Sarolaner, and could that still provide upside? And do you have cash flow forecast for us? And I think you gave some color here, but does your guidance include share repurchases and plans for deleveraging?
Juan Ramón Alaix: So let me answer the first question, and then Paul will answer the second one. Thank you, Erin, for both your questions. So the new products, Sarolaner, IL-31, are not part of our guidance today. So we are in process of discussing with the FDA and USDA and other regulators. So once we have more understanding of the timing of these product launches, we'll incorporate in our guidance.
Paul S. Herendeen: And it's Paul, I'll speak to the cash flow guidance. We're not providing -- we provided an awful lot of detail on the operating side here through 2017. We're not, at this time, providing a forecast of cash flow and our balance sheet, but suffice it to say that we talked in the past about our desire to improve our asset efficiency. For example, through the implementation of our global ERP system, SAP, we expect that over time, we'll be able to reduce our investment in our inventory and unlock some cash there. Frankly, by paring down our business and pruning our portfolio, with the SKUs, that will unlock some cash -- cash as well. We do have an awful lot of calls on our cash here coming up in the very near term. I mean, if you think about it in the first quarter, we completed the acquisition of the Abbott Animal Health assets. We do continue to use cash to fund the onetime costs associated with our separation from Pfizer, and we've provided an estimate of the remaining amount of that to be somewhere in the range of $180 million to $210 million. We provided you with an estimate of the cost of the efficiency initiative that we announced today and the early stages of our supply network strategy, and those costs are estimated in the range of $300 million or $400 million to $500 million over the next several years. And we have, I'll call it out for you, the $400 million debt maturity coming up next spring. And then we have our regular dividend coming up. So we do have some sizable calls on our cash. We have actually provided you also with some guidance, a little bit of guidance at this stage around our share repurchases. We indicated that we expect to purchase, in aggregate, $100 million worth of shares over the first half of 2015 and that we can -- expect to continue acquiring shares in the amount that will at least offset the ongoing dilution from our equity-based compensation plans. And I said in the past, I'll say it again, the share repurchase will be an ongoing part of our plans for our capital allocation. I think of it -- share purchase activity that underlies our 2017 guidance as a baseline for that activity. As we generate either free cash or debt capacity, we'll adjust our plans there as appropriate. Did I cover it all? Sorry, the deleveraging question as well. Yes, we have stated in the past that we have kind of a notional -- when we talk about our capital structure, a notional floor of gross debt to trailing 12-months EBITDA of 2.5x. So I want to reiterate there's a permanent role for debt in our capital structure, and when you think about that cap structure, we remain committed to be responsible stewards of our shareholders' capital. And our hierarchy for that capital allocation will be first and foremost inside our business; second for business development activity that is value-generative; and lastly, transactions and shareholders including both the regular dividend and the ongoing share repurchases. So again, think of that 2.5x as a floor and think of our hierarchy of capital allocation as I outlined it for you. I hope I answered the question.
Operator: And we can take our next question from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets.
Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets Equity Research: We appreciate all the details on the efficiency program. EuAfME sales were below expectations. Could you comment on the impact of the new anti-infective legislation in France and whether you think that's going to spread to other developed markets. And Paul, I'm not sure if you addressed this, but how much of your lower OpEx this quarter was driven by FX as opposed to other savings? And then, finally, could you comment on the launch of APOQUEL and whether your prior guidance still stands.
Juan Ramón Alaix: Thank you, Alex. So the situation in Europe/Africa/Middle East, revenues were affected by the France performance. So they announced the new legislation related to anti-infective legislation. It's eliminating rebates offered by animal health manufacturers to both wholesalers and veterinarians. And as a result of this elimination of rebates, there was an adjustment in the market in terms of inventory levels. We expect that this will be, in the next quarter, compensated and back to normal situation. And now Paul will answer the comment also in terms of the impact of FX.
Paul S. Herendeen: Yes, Alex, and there's really 2 ways you and think about this. First is you can see the impact, the impact on the first quarter alone, on SG&A expenses in the quarter was roughly 5% change was due to FX, and in R&D, it was 2%. I think a more helpful way to think about it might be to look at our guidance bridge slide going from our previous guidance in February to our updated guidance today. And you can see the expected impact on the full year relative to that February guidance is roughly $20 million on SG&A expenses and none on R&D.
Juan Ramón Alaix: And then the comment on the APOQUEL. So in the first quarter of this year, the revenues of APOQUEL have been still facing limited supply. But from April, we have been able to meet the demands of our customers in U.S., also U.K. and Germany, and we expect that the product will meet our expectations in 2015 of delivering $150 million to $175 million in 2015. And we also are planning now in launching APOQUEL in additional markets that will be also making contribution to meet these expectations for the product.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore ISI. [Technical Difficulty]
Juan Ramón Alaix: We have some problem there with the line?
Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI, Research Division: So the question is about incremental form of [indiscernible]. So the question about M&A and the Tax Matters Agreement with Pfizer that I believe expires next month. So your new cost reduction plan and Tax Matters Agreement expiration, whether this will change your overall strategy for future acquisitions, M&A, and whether you're still open for targets of various size or -- and think about the ZTS as -- more as a net acquirer, not acquisition target. As well as if you're still open for potentially inversion transaction as an avenue to reduce effective tax rate.
Juan Ramón Alaix: So let me mention on the tax agreement that you're right, this tax agreement will end on June 24. We mentioned on previous calls that this is something that will eliminate any restrictions, but we didn't think that it was a significant restriction for any type of transaction related to acquisition or licensing or any other divestment. In terms of the new program, its changing our strategy, we think that our strategy has been always to consider M&A opportunities that will create value to Zoetis and will create more value to our shareholders. Definitely, the new program will generate more cash, and more cash also will help us to consider any kind of opportunity. In terms of inversion, I think again, so we are open to any opportunity that will increase the value to our shareholders and is something that we'll be always open. But we know there are not too many options that we can consider in terms of inversion or acquisition of our company that will facilitate this kind of tax strategy.
Paul S. Herendeen: I'll just follow on, in that I think that with our leaned-out structure, we will be better positioned to realize value from acquisitions that we might consider. I mean as -- looking backwards, using as a great example, the Abbott Animal Health assets. When you have a better cost structure and you can absorb those and realize the synergies, you can gain better value over assets that you're able to acquire. As Juan Ramón said, I want to buttress that as well. We're always thinking about ways that we can build value here, and one of those ways is through smart business development activity.
Operator: We can take that question from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.
Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Just to follow up on an earlier question, about trying to trim assets [ph]. Clearly what you're doing makes a kind of sense, simplifying a very complex cost structure, it's -- reasons why companies spin off assets and those assets tend to perform much better as separate companies. But I'm actually kind of surprised, Juan, when you said your expectation is that revenue growth -- you sort of reiterated the type of organic growth that you have been anticipating, which is the market growth of 5% to 7%. I would think, with shrinking the revenue base and getting out of slower growth or less profitable businesses, that would give you an opportunity to accelerate top line growth, and wondering if you can just talk about that.
Juan Ramón Alaix: Thank you, Jami, and I think you are right in your comment. We are doing that because we think that being much more focused will be an opportunity to accelerate growth in products, markets that will be important to our future profitable growth, and this is something that definitely we will be working to ensure that the programs that will stay in our portfolio will generate maximum opportunities. The other important thing is that we also want to make sure that we increase our supply to our customers on those problems that really matter to them. And we want to have a reliable supply and to eliminate the risk for product supply issues that's always very, very different [ph] to our customers. So with being much more focused we are convinced that we can generate a higher profitable growth.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Kreger with William Blair.
John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: You talked about a changing approach to R&D. Can you just elaborate a little bit on that? And one specific one. Do you still expect Sarolaner to reach the market by spring of '16? But then more broadly, what are the source of products that you're refocusing the R&D efforts on? Is there any criteria around, let's say, region or animal species?
Juan Ramón Alaix: Thank you for the question, John. And in terms of R&D, so we are eliminating 5,000 SKUs. So if we are eliminating about 40% of our total SKUs, you can also assume that we'll be eliminating some of the programs that are a very important part of our investment. And just to remind you, almost 50% or even more of our R&D investment is related to life cycle management. So if we are eliminating 40% of our SKUs, we should be also eliminating programs in life cycle management that are supporting this part of the portfolio. We also think that it's a good opportunity also for us to identify the future problems that will generate the highest potential in the animal health industry. We have been extremely successful in identifying these opportunities, and APOQUEL is a good example, but also our progress on bringing back vaccines to the market like PEDv vaccine and many other vaccines that we have been introducing is a good example of being focused, identifying these opportunities. It's a great opportunity for us like this. We'll remain doing that and we are not changing our approach in R&D, but we are trying to identify those projects that would generate the highest return to our company. In terms of Sarolaner, we are working with the FDA. We are presenting all the information that FDA is requesting, and we expect that the program will be launched in 2016.
Paul S. Herendeen: Before we ask the next question, it's Paul, and I just want to jump in. R&D is, as I said in my prepared remarks and Juan Ramón referenced as well, that's 1 of our 3 key interconnected capabilities and one where we're not changing substantially here. What we're looking for is ways that we can improve the process by which we select projects to go into the queue and then come out on the other end. And John, the way you phrased your question was almost exactly the way I've talked about this inside, is the alignment of our portfolio around our key brands and around our key regional strategies for growth, and ensuring that this course alignment of our R&D strategy around those key brands and regional strategies. And as I say all the time, any process -- and we've been very productive in R&D. Any process that we have can be improved and that's what we're doing here, call it, continuous improvement.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kathy Miner with Cowen and Company.
Kathleen M. Miner - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Just to follow up a little more on the 5,000 SKUs that will be eliminated. Can you give us a little more color on them? Such as how many products this might include and will we see a change in your therapeutic product mix post the elimination of these products? And second, just a quick question on the antibody for atopic dermatitis that you expect conditional approval for, is that still on track for the end of this year?
Juan Ramón Alaix: Thank you, Kathy, and definitely, these 5,000 SKUs are not 5,000 products. The number of products is much lower. I don't think we have provided the number of programs that will be affected. It's something that definitely, we plan to provide this information to our customers in the next coming weeks, and we also plan to send a communication to our customers on those programs that will be affecting every market. In terms of the change of the mix, well, the mix will improve in terms of profitability, so these products, as we mentioned, are low margin. So by eliminating these low-margin products, we'll improve our margin and mix and this will have a positive impact in our operations. IL-31 is still on track for conditional approval in 2015. We are working with the USDA and we expect this conditional license approval anytime at the end of the year.
Operator: And our next question comes from Liav Abraham with Citi.
Liav Abraham - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Just a quick question on the sales force. If I understood correctly, the reduction in the sales force that you proposed is only from the sales force that's associated with products or regions that you're exiting, and you don't anticipate any curtails in sales force in the regions that will remain ongoing. Is that correct? I just want to make sure that I understood that correctly.
Juan Ramón Alaix: Thank you for the question, Liav.
Paul S. Herendeen: I'll take it.
Juan Ramón Alaix: No the reduction on the field force, it's mainly related to those markets that we are planning to change our model, moving from direct to indirect. Also, in some of the markets, so we are also adjusting our field force to the real potential of our portfolio. We are not changing our field force in key markets like the U.S. We have some small adjustments in some markets in Europe, which is also the reflect of the market potential of those markets. But basically, we are maintaining our presence in the market. So we are convinced that our direct interaction with the customer represent a significant competitive advantage and we are planning to protect these interactions and continue interacting there with customers on a daily basis. And again, I want to insist that in most of the markets, there is no any change in the infrastructure of our field force. What is something that is applicable not only to the field force but to the rest of the organization: we are also considering being much more efficient in terms of span of control. And this will imply some elimination of layers, also in the field force, but not in the people that have customer-facing interactions.
Operator: We'll take our next question from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.
David Risinger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: I just wanted to ask about the 2 segments of the company, companion and livestock. Could you just characterize the different margins for the 2 business segments? I don't know how much detail you can provide, but I was hoping that you could help to provide a baseline for us in terms of where the operating margins stand for each of the segments? And then looking ahead, which of the 2 is the 1 that will experience greater margin expansion over the next 3 years.
Juan Ramón Alaix: Thank you, David. So let me start by mentioning maybe the difference between companion animal and livestock in terms of gross profit. So in terms of gross profit, companion animal, it's generating the highest margins, and you know that we have a margin of -- a gross profit of 65%. The net companion animal is much higher than this 65%. And then livestock, we have a different margin depending on cattle, swine or poultry. Being in poultry, the lowest in terms of our gross profit and, cattle, the highest in terms of our gross profit in livestock. But then you also need to add what is the cost to win these products to the customers. And then in that case, I think the total margins are much more equalized. So companion animal require a significant much more field force and promotional activities because the number of our customers in companion animal it's much higher than in livestock. And then poultry is the most consolidated industry, so it require fewer individuals to reach the customers, while cattle still require a significant number of people to reach these customers. So even gross profit are different across different species. In terms of the total margin, the margins are much more similar. And we think that there are opportunities in both. We have been growing livestock faster than companion animal in the recent years. Now with APOQUEL, with Sarolaner, with Abbott, with IL-31, we expect that companion animal will generate a significant growth in our operations.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we can take our next question from Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray.
Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Just a quick follow-up here. I guess going back to the SKUs that are going to be eliminated. Paul, did I miss -- did you provide how much revenue those products are going to generate or what the impact would be from the SKU elimination in 2016? And then also in the press release, you talked about the feed additive for the poultry, Zoamix. Just wondering how big that could get. And I guess what's your thought, Juan Ramón, on the scrutiny and some of the restaurant companies eliminating using antibiotics in the chickens, especially -- oh, and also, thoughts on the avian flu.
Paul S. Herendeen: I'll start. Yes, the first question with respect to the period SKUs. We did not provide a specific amount or impact on our 2016 just to say that, by definition, we included the impact as we provided the detailed guidance for 2016. And then call your attention to 2017 where we call it out and it's really $280 million of top line that we expect, relative to our prior expectations, for 2017. And the way I would think of it is 100 is a curious thing with this $10 million of OpEx that maps the cost of goods sold. So the table, you'll see the $290 million versus $300 million, but with $300 million OpEx, you think like $280 million and $100 million, that's the impact on '17 when it's fully reflected in our re-based revenues and that's how I think about it.
Juan Ramón Alaix: And on the majority of this key SKU elimination will take place in 2016. So we should expect that there will be an impact in terms of revenues in 2016 that would be very close to this $280 million that Paul just mentioned. So we have not mentioned the exact revenues of Zoamix in the U.S. But what we mentioned is that this has been compensating the rotation of products that are in the industry. It's using it as a way to protect the animal health in the poultry industry. In terms of -- you also asked about the comments on poultry and antibiotics of a recent company that has been issuing a press release in the U.S. Definitely, we are fully aligned with the FDA objective to reduce the impact of -- or the resistance of antibiotics in animal health. These 2 companies have announced that they will eliminate the use of human health products in poultry. In some cases, like Tyson, we have been already working with Tyson some years ago to eliminate these products. And because we have, in our portfolio, alternative to the products which are important for human health, we think that we'll be able to supply to companies in the poultry in the U.S. that will be eliminating gradually the use of human health products, which are important or antibiotic which are important for human health. With all the alternatives that we have in our portfolio, that we also keep the poultry industry productive and also protecting animals against infections.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.
Christopher T. Schott - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Just was trying to just dig a little bit more into the motivating factor that's leading you to this broad restructuring. I guess my question, are you seeing the market changing? Or is this really that you've gotten out of Pfizer, you've had the chance to review the broader strategy, that you're just having time now to dig into these business units and really try to focus the organization overall? I'm just trying to understand, higher level, what led you down this path to begin with?
Juan Ramón Alaix: Okay, this program has been part of our plans since the beginning. So it means we have separated from Pfizer. We had, in our thinking, that we should generate greater efficiencies and also define cost-saving opportunities. We also knew that in the first 2 years as a public company, we needed to focus on standing up our infrastructure. Also making sure that we are meeting our objectives in terms of revenue growth, also our objectives in terms of profit growth. We also needed to have full control of our operations. And when I mean full control of our operations, have a full understanding of our corporate functions, also full understanding of manufacturing and, also very important, control of our IT systems. We also decided early in the process of separating from Pfizer to invest in the new ERP. And now that the ERP has been already implemented in certain markets in Europe and went live in the U.S. at the end of April, we see that we are in the process to finalize all these implementations in the first quarter of 2016. With all these elements, I think we are in the position to identify these opportunities to be more efficient, and not only opportunities to be more efficient, but the opportunity to be much more focused. And I want to seize the complexity that we have in some of our operations. It's a barrier to deliver value to our customers. And this is one of the objectives that we have as part of this program, to ensure that we deliver higher value to our customers by being much more focused on certain problems in certain markets.
Operator: And it appears we have no further questions at this time, so I'll turn the floor back over to Juan Ramón for any additional or closing remarks.
Juan Ramón Alaix: Well, thank you very much for joining us for today's call. We had the opportunity to share with you a lot of information, and we'll be pleased to have a follow-up conversation with you if you need some additional understanding of all the plans that we are announcing and also all the products that we are making as an independent company. Thank you very much.
Operator: This does conclude today's teleconference. A replay of today's call will be available in 2 hours by dialing (800) 723-0389 for U.S. listeners and (402) 220-2647 for international. Please disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2014 Financial Results Conference Call and webcast for Zoetis. Hosting the call today is John O'Connor, Vice President of Investor Relations for Zoetis. The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of Zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, and will not be forwarded automatically. In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call via dial-in or on the Investor Relations section of Zoetis.com. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for your questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to John O'Connor. John, you may begin.
John O'Connor: Thank you, operator. Good morning and welcome to the Zoetis fourth quarter 2014 earnings call. I am joined today by Juan Ramon Alaix, our Chief Executive Officer and Paul Herendeen, our Chief Financial Officer. Slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our Web site. Before we begin, I'll remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statement in today's press release and our SEC filings, including but not limited to, our 2013 annual report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q. Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures which were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our press release and the company's 8-K filing dated today, February 11, 2015. We also cite operational results which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. With that, I will turn the call over to Juan Ramon.
Juan Ramon Alaix: Thank you, John. Good morning to everyone. In my remarks today, I will discuss our 2014 performance, provide an update on the Zoetis revenue growth versus industry growth, review recent sponsor from the full portfolio and then with our outlook for 2015. 2014 was a year when we made significant progress in creating value. We are growing revenue faster than the market. We improved our margins despite absorbing additional costs required to operate as a fully independent company. We continue to advance our product portfolio through internal R&D initiatives. We communicated a 15% increase in our dividend and $500 million share repurchase program. This week, we announced that we completed the acquisition of Abbott Animal Health. We also continue to build a culture that delivers results, creates a high sense of ownership from our colleagues and focuses on generating short and long-term value for customers and shareholders. For the year, we delivered operational revenue growth of 7%, adjusted net income growth of 13%, and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 11%. Both revenue and adjusted diluted EPS exceeded the high end of our guidance. Here are some details of 2014 revenue by species on an operational basis. In livestock, total revenue grew 9% to $3.1 billion. This reflects favorable market conditions for our producers and a strong performance of key Zoetis brands across affective vaccines and medicated feed additives. Livestock markets benefited from strong meat and milk prices as well as less expensive animal feed. These generated strong producer profits and in these market producers increased the medical treatment of animals to preserve their value. This has benefited many premium Zoetis brands. Cattle grew in revenues by 10% to $1.7 billion, with exceptional growth coming from beef cattle markets like the U.S., Brazil and Canada, as well as from our China business. In some key markets we see signs that the process of cattle expansion has begun. In the near-term, the high value of animals will continue to support our growth as producers have placed their premium on the health of their herds. Swine revenue grew 9% to $695 million with strong growth in many countries around the world. New and recent protein production such as ENGAIN, DRAXXIN 25, Relan N and our PCV2 franchise continue to grow in the market that experienced challenges due to disease outbreaks and trade restrictions. Poultry revenue grew 6% to $568 million with the strong growth coming from the U.S. and Latin America. Our growth portfolio in poultry, integrated coccidiosis management programs, namely ropic brought value to producers and led to increased customer penetration in key markets.  Turning to companion animal, revenue grew 4% to $1.6 billion. Across all regions we saw strong growth of key brands, including APOQUEL, ProHeart 6, CONVENIA, CERENIA and feline REVOLUTION. These gains were partially offset by declines in the vaccines and RIMADYL due to increased competition. For 2014, APOQUEL achieved sales of 34 million in an environment of constrained supply. For 2015, we are on track to increase supply in [etrin] and we expect APOQUEL revenues to be between $150 million and $175 million this year. Building on several years of solid revenue performance, we continue to deliver stronger revenue growth in 2014. We are also pleased that Zoetis continues to outpace the animal health industry. According to the latest data, for the 12 months ending Q3 2014, Zoetis revenue grew 5.5% while the animal health market grew by 4.6%. This growth includes the negative impact of currency movements. The steady interaction of our new products and investment in life cycle management contributed to steady revenue growth. In 2014, Zoetis achieved more than 180 product approvals, representing new products, new indications, new formulations, new combinations and geographic expansion of our portfolio. We recorded several important product milestones in recent months. This past November Zoetis submitted to the FDA a filing for zoromandis, which is the active ingredient of our new flea and tick oral parasiticide for dogs. And last month, we completed the filing for the same product in the EU and Canada. The global market for flea and tick parasiticides is about $2.5 billion to $3.4 billion. And launching a new product in this category is an opportunity with broad bacteria potential for Zoetis. Although bacteria for the animal health industry is generally prone to generating more than $100 million a year. Now let me turn to another milestone that illustrates continued integration from our R&D investment. We are pleased to announce that Zoetis has submitted a filing to the USDA for a novel antibody therapy to treat atopic dermatitis in dogs. Based on the USDA guidance, we are expecting a conditional license this year. Our progress in this therapeutic area further reinforces our industry leadership innovation. We have been active in building a platform in monoclonal antibodies that will have a broad application across species and medical conditions. The first potential product from this platform builds on our knowledge base in the area of canine dermatology. We are excited to bring another treatment option to veterinarians. In addition to novel products, Zoetis continues to drive demand and strengthen its diverse product portfolio through investments in product life cycle development. This past November, the FDA got a new label claim for DRAXXIN 25 in the U.S. to treat smaller cats. This follows the approval of DRAXXIN 25 label claims for pigs in July 2015. We also achieved additional label claims for the FOSTERA PRRS and vaccine for swine which is now licensed in the U.S. for reproductive protection. This product was first approved for respiratory protection in 2012. Zoetis PEDv vaccine continued to expand geographically, receiving permission to import and sell in Canada. Zoetis also launched the vaccine in China which broadens our range of vaccines in the world's largest swine market. As I mentioned, we just closed the purchase of Abbott Animal Health. This business is focused on the veterinary surgical market. It will strengthen our pain and sedation product portfolio and expand our diagnostic business. This acquisition is aligned with our value creation strategy to enhance our portfolio. We are adding leading brands and we believe Zoetis is gaining industry leading field force. I know at present we’ll expand both the reach and penetration of the new portfolio. Zoetis also invests in animal health innovation through research partnerships. We recently announced that Zoetis was chosen to lead a research team to develop digital technologies for improved swine health and production efficiencies. Paul will address our 2015 guidance later in the call, but I would like to give you our perspective on the animal health industry on some factors that will drive Zoetis in 2015. The animal health industry is forecasted to grow in the 5% to 6% range operationally over the next five years, with growth in any given year above or below these rates. Looking to 2015, we expect operational revenue growth for Zoetis to keep pace with or outpace the animal health market. We also expect adjusted net income to grow faster than revenue as we leverage our business model and continue to focus on improving cost efficiencies. Now, our perspective by species; the outlook for companion animal is positive. Increased pet ownership and higher pet expense rates are driving the growth in emerging markets while specialty care is contributing to growth in more developed markets. For Zoetis, we must expect that the sales of APOQUEL will have a positive impact on growth in this segment. The outlook for livestock in 2015 is also positive. Producers will remain very profitable although at lower levels than in 2014. For Zoetis our premium products will remain an important factor to protect the health and value of livestock animals. And the line the ban for animal health products that remain strong, despite economic events such as lower growth in GDP, significant movements in the exchange rate, lower oil prices or international trade developments. We are monitoring the current business environment and all the exchange rates we don't see any significant impact on our business from these factors. As the past has shown again we'll have industry resilient to these and other microeconomic factors. Within the industry, Zoetis is highly diversify across many dimensions and this diversity has allow us to successfully manage through many market conditions in the past. The drivers of growth in animal health remain unchanged. Animal proteins and companionship from pets are basic needs, so we are confident about the future prospects and our ability to grow under volatile market conditions. So, I will now turn it over to Paul to talk about results for the fourth quarter, the year and guidance for 2015.
Paul Herendeen: Thank you, Juan Ramon, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I am going to review our performance compared with our full year 2014 guidance, provide some color on the fourth quarter results and update you on our full year guidance for 2015. I hope to do all that quickly so that we have plenty of time for Q&A, so here we go. Starting with full year 2014 results, the big stories here are revenue, revenue growth and revenue growth from a variety of sources. In 2014, we delivered 7% operational growth in revenue, the second consecutive year of 7% operational growth and second consecutive year of growth above the long-term industry trend. Pretty good, right? Even better, in the fourth quarter we delivered 9% operational growth versus Q4 of 2013, overcoming some significant FX headwinds to post 5% reported growth with positive operational trends that are heading right into 2015. Changes in FX rates reduced our Q4 reported growth rate, but we were able to overcome that and still put a solid growth number on the board. Good stuff indeed. Since mid-November FX rates have continued to move against us. I will help you think about the impact of FX rates on 2015 in a minute. Now for a look at our full-year performance versus guidance. As you can see on the Web cast slides, our revenue of 4.8 billion exceeded the high end of our expectations. The operating growth of 7% was driven by 9% growth in livestock and 4% in companion animal. On a regional basis, the U.S. accounted for almost half of our growth, up 8% compared with 2013. CLAR accounted for about third of our operational growth, up 13%. APAC was about 11% of our operational growth, up 5%, and EuAfME accounted for about 8% of our operational growth, it was up 2% versus 2013. But in going to belt, and all growth rates are on an operational basis.  Continuing with 2014 performance compared with our guidance, our adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue was 35.1%, a bit better than our guidance of 35.5%, and that's primarily due to the positive impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. Adjusted SG&A meanwhile, was 1.507 billion for the full year, approximately 27 million higher than the top end of our guidance range. There were a number of factors that contributed to the increase in SG&A above expectations. First, as we trended above our revenue forecast for the latter part of the quarter, we saw an increase in costs associated with higher revenue, such as sales incentive compensation and distribution expenses. We also authorized additional promotional spending in the quarter, spending that is expected to support revenue growth into 2015. Next, we accelerated some actions in Q4 that triggered additional G&A expense in the quarter, including for example, severance, software license expense and some additional business development expenses.  As successful as we have been in driving our top line, we are still a young Company, just finishing up our second year on our own. We have plenty of work remaining to build and fine-tune our G&A organizations and the systems needed to support our global business model. As that process continues, there will be opportunities to move forward and towards a more efficient cost structure. In other items, adjusted R&D expense came in at 393 million, in line with our full-year guidance. This continues to be an essential investment for both developing new products and managing the life cycle of the more than 300 product lines that provide us with our durable and growing revenue streams. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the full year was almost 27%, and 18% in the fourth quarter. This reflected the full-year impact of the R&D tax credit which, you will recall, was not anticipated in our guidance. Also contributing to the lower-than-expected tax rate was a resolution of prior tax matters and changes in the mix of our earnings. It's important to know that the elements that drove the rate down below our and your expectations were not structural and we continue to expect that our tax rate in 2015 will be approximately 29%. As with our 2014 guidance, our tax rate guidance for 2015 does not include the potential benefit of an extension of the R&D tax credit. We exceeded the top end of our guidance for adjusted diluted EPS by $0.03 a share, posting $1.57 per share for the full-year. This was due to the strong revenues and the lower-than-expected tax rate, offset in part by increased spending in the fourth quarter  And finally, we exceeded our range on certain significant items and acquisition-related costs for 2014. This was the result of costs associated with certain shareholder activities and some changes associated with our global manufacturing organization. As a result, our reported diluted EPS came in at $1.16, the lower end of our guidance range. Now let me switch gears and dive a bit more into the fourth quarter results. You can see our income statement and adjusted income statement slides on our Web cast. Repeating from my opening remarks, fourth quarter revenue grew 9% operationally and 5% on a reported basis. And while nine minus five equals four, there is some rounding in there so the negative impact of currency movements on our growth rate was roughly 330 basis points. Our U.S. and CLAR segments demonstrated strong double-digit sales growth, leading the way for Zoetis , while the APAC segment grew modestly and EuAfME declined 1% on an operational basis.  On the last call I talked about the hazards of reading too much into any one quarter in isolation. EuAfME illustrates that clearly. In Q1 revenue was down 4% operationally and in Q2 revenue was up 4% operationally. In Q3 was up 12% operationally in Q4 it declined 1%. But for the year, operational growth for EuAfME was about 2%, broadly in line with the long-term expected growth rate for that segment. Moving to SG&A. Our adjusted SG&A expenses in the fourth quarter were up 14% operationally due to the timing of promotional spending and other items that I called out earlier in my discussion of the full-year. Our adjusted R&D expense was up 4% operationally in the quarter. R&D, as I had noted before, can vary quarter to quarter due to the timing of clinical trials and other factors. For the full year we performed in line with our guidance.  And finally as I mentioned earlier, our catch rate in the quarter was 18%, due to a number of factors that got worked out in the fourth quarter. You also have a full set of regional tables and quarterly commentaries in the press release and Web cast slides. With that material available to you, let me just highlight a few takeaways on the revenue and profitability for each segment. Beginning with the U.S., fourth quarter revenue increased 14% driven by very strong livestock sales, which were up 19%, a truly stellar quarter for the largest segment of our business. The growth in livestock products, especially cattle in United States was based on higher demand for our premium products as producers continue to benefit from strong market conditions, some of which Juan Ramon just touched on. In companion animal products in the U.S., we generated growth of 7% driven by APOQUEL and other key brands, and despite continued competition for RIMADYL and competitive pressure in vaccines and parasiticides. Based on the U.S. segment strong sales and lower relative expense growth, their segment earnings increased by 20%. In Europe, Africa and Middle East, revenue decreased 1% on an operational basis compared with the fourth quarter 2013. This was the result of revenue increases in Southern Europe and Germany, driven by livestock as well as APOQUEL sales in the UK and Germany, with those increases more than offset by declines in other markets such as France and Russia. In France, we had anticipated some softness in the fourth quarter based on the fact that customers bought large amounts of anti-infectives in the third quarter ahead of more restrictive legislative changes that went into effect January 1st. The EuAfME segment earnings decreased by 4% operationally in the quarter, primarily due to declines in revenue and the timing of promotional spending. Moving to CLAR, which is our Canada and Latin American segment, we generated an increase of 16% operationally compared with the fourth quarter 2013. Brazil and Canada are the principal drivers in the CLAR region, given their relative size, and we saw growth in both livestock and companion animal products in these two countries. In Canada we saw significant cattle product sales due to strong market conditions for producers. Increased medicalization rates for companion animals in Brazil have been a driver of growth there as well. We also saw strong growth in Venezuela and other emerging markets in Central and South America. These high inflationary markets afford attractive growth opportunities that need to be carefully monitored. The CLAR segment earnings increased 20% on an operational basis, driven by the revenue growth and limited growth in operating expenses. Finally, in Asia Pacific we had an increase of 4% operationally compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. Sales of livestock products did well, particularly in Australia, Southeast Asia and across the board in emerging markets. A growing vaccine portfolio for swine and new parasiticide products continued to drive our performance there. Sales of companion animal products, however, declined 6% operationally, primarily due to the termination of a distributor agreement in Japan that we talked about last quarter. The APAC segment operating earnings increased 6% operationally due to the revenue growth and limited growth in operating expenses. Now let me turn to guidance for the full year 2015, which we first provided at our Investor Day in mid-November. We’re updating certain elements of our full year guidance today to reflect three things. First, a factor over which we have no control and that’s FX rates. We're adjusting our guidance based on the changes in foreign currency exchange rates from mid-November when we first reported our guidance for 2015 to reflect rates as of late January. In those roughly 70 days the U.S. dollar strengthened against almost all of the major currencies in which we transact. For emphasis and in round numbers, the dollar was up 9% versus the euro, 8% versus the Canadian dollar, 8% versus the Aussie dollar, 4% versus the British pound, 1% against the Japanese yen and against the Brazilian real it was flat. Those are our top six currencies. The movement in exchange rates since mid-November reduced our revenue expectations for full year 2015 by 125 million or 255 basis points, based on the midpoint of our initial guidance range. We now expect the full year impact of FX to be about 600 basis points or almost 300 million on our full year 2015 revenue as compared with our 2014 actual results. I want to repeat that for emphasis. Since mid-November the change in FX rate reduced our expectations for the full year 2015 by 255 basis points or 125 million, comparing our revised expectations for 2015 back to 2014 actual results, the changes in FX rates account for a 600 basis point reduction in our expected growth rate. So natural hedging from expenses denominated in foreign currencies reduces the dollar impact of the movements in FX at adjusted net income, where the negative impact of the change rate was roughly $30 million or roughly 360 basis points down from the midpoint of our initial guidance range. Something for you to be aware of, if the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen against our major currencies, that can put upward pressure on our effective tax rate. At this point, we are affirming our guidance for our tax rate at approximately 29%, not including the R&D tax credit. But for emphasis, I am going to repeat something I just said, continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar could cause us to have to revisit that guidance. So that's another part we can monitor but don't control. The part we can control are our operating expenses in 2015. In addition to the expense reductions driven by the change in FX rates, we revised downward our range of expectations for SG&A expenses by an additional $35 million. This reflects targeted reductions in spending intended to help offset the FX impact on 2015 adjusted net income. Additionally we completed the acquisition of the assets of Abbott Animal Health this week. With that done now, we will begin integration and expect a positive impact of approximately 75 million to revenue for our full-year 2015 results, an accretion of $0.01 per share to adjusted diluted EPS for the full-year 2015. Taking the FX rate changes and our reduction of expected SG&A into account as well as the Abbott transaction, our revised guidance calls for revenue in the range of 4.8 billion to 4.9 billion and results in our holding our guidance for adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $1.61 to $1.68 per share. The net $50 million reduction in the revenue range represents a roughly 125 million, or 2.5%, decrease driven by the change in the FX rates.  Meanwhile, the combination of the natural FX hedges inherent in our business and our targeted $35 million of OpEx reductions and the overall impact of Abbott, all those things combined enabled us to maintain our earlier adjusted diluted EPS guidance for 2015. While we provided out guidance in November, we expressed growth targets based on the midpoints of our 2014 guidance ranges. With 2014 now final, it won't be freshening the growth rates implied by our guidance.  The more significant revenue base that we delivered in 2014 and our guidance as revised today to include Abbott and the expected expense reductions, we are expecting revenue growth on an operational basis in the range of 6.5% to 8.5% and growth of adjusted net income in the range of 11% to 16%. All the other details of our guidance are included in the table attached to our press release. Please note that our guidance does not reflect any future currency devaluation in Venezuela. While we do not guide on a quarterly basis, I will remind you of a comment I made at our Investor Day in November about the trajectory of our overall performance in 2015.  We still expect the year to start low and end high. A key driver of our growth in 2015 will be the additional supply of APOQUEL, but we will not see that supply increase until Q2. I also want to note that the revenue impact of the Abbott acquisition in Q1 is nominal, less than $5 million. And that there will be a negative impact on reported Q1 results based on the changes in FX rates since my comments in November. To sum up the quarter and the year, we continue with very strong revenue and earnings growth, demonstrating the strength of our global business model. The diversity of our business across species, product lines, geographies and therapeutic areas is one of our core strengths. Our global footprint enables us to overcome weaknesses in some regions and deliver consistent revenue and earnings growth. We demonstrated an ability to drive gross margin improvements and operating expense containment in our regional statements, while continue to absorb some of the impact and buildup of costs for our corporate functions. Foreign currency was a significant factor on our reported results in the quarter and for the year, and we have updated our full-year 2015 guidance based on the rates in effect as of late January 2015. We expect to deliver strong revenue and profit growth on an operational basis in 2015, 6.5% to 8.5% for revenue and 11% to 16% for adjusted net income. While the currency headwinds are expected to be a drag on our reported results and growth rates, we have taken steps to mitigate some of those impacts and will continue to pursue means of protecting and growing our adjusted net income throughout the year.  That concludes my prepared remarks and we'll now open the line for your questions. Operator?
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Our first question is coming from Louise Chen, with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open. 
Louise Chen: My question here is since it's hard to find good companies to comp Zoetis's operating margin to, could you provide us a framework for thinking about where Zoetis's operating margin could improve to over the longer-term, beyond the 30% that you had forecasted at Investor Day?
Juan Ramon Alaix: Thank you, Louise, for the question. So we are convinced that now that we are finishing our work in standing up Zoetis on implementing new systems that will support our future operations, we can really identify opportunities for being more efficient in many lines of our P&L. That is something that we will continue in define business opportunities and seeing ways of improving our margins in the medium and long term.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alex Arfaei, with BMO Capital. Your line is open.
Alex Arfaei: Good morning and congratulations on a strong quarter. Juan Ramon, you mentioned strong market conditions and profitability in the livestock market. Clearly a key driver here, can you clarify on your outlook, when you say you expect this to continue in the near-term, what is the timeframe you put on that one-year or two-year? I want to get a sense of how long you think the cycle will last? And Paul, a follow-up if I may, you got a significant FX benefit on cost of goods sold this quarter. You lowered revenue guidance because of FX. I am just wondering why not raise gross margin guidance to reflect an FX benefit? Thank you.
Juan Ramon Alaix: Thank you, Alex. In my comment I refer to the outlook was in for this year. So, we mentioned that in 2014, the conditions in livestock were very positive; the price of milk and meat was very high. Also there were low costs on feeding the animals. We expect that most of these conditions will remain in 2015, although we see maybe in some of the species like swine, maybe a lot of more attention in terms of price because of more supply of product. Since some of the rates that were affecting 2014, maybe we’ll have a lower impact in ‘15 like the PEDv outbreak. So, we expect that the conditions will remain favorable, although for some of the species, maybe less profitable than in 2014.
Paul Herendeen: Thanks for the question, Alex. I'll take the question regarding the FX benefit that flowed through cost of goods sold. I want to point out that the timing of the way FX flows through our cost of goods sold is somewhat difficult to predict and also when you recognize it as we did in 2014 that does not necessarily translate into a continued benefit flowing through in 2015, point of fact that could very easily turn around on us on a reported basis.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. My apologies, we actually have Mark Schoenebaum. Line is now open with Evercore ISI.
Mark Schoenebaum: Also my congratulations to Paul on a great job since you've taken the reins as CFO and to John on the IR front. Just a question on, I'm intrigued by your comments around your antibody platform. I haven't heard you talk about that before. You gave a little bit of detail during your prepared remarks, but I'd be interested in knowing more if possible, like how broad this program really is. Are you pursuing antibodies outside of companion animal dermatology or should we think of this is mainly a derm program? And the impact, if any that you think this antibody program will have on your P&L once commercial. Gross margins on the human health side tend to be a bit lower on antibodies than they are for small molecules. And then also of course on a CapEx -- long-term CapEx projection, sometimes building plants capable of producing large quantities of biologics can be expensive. I am wondering if that's already something that you've got your footprint or if these products are going to be big, we should be altering our models to some degree? Thanks a lot.
Juan Ramon Alaix: Thank you, Mark. The monoclonal antibody that we mentioned today, it's a product that we neutralized the canine interleukin, which is also a key cytokine which is involved in the atopic dermatitis and also involved in sending the signs of itching to the brain of the animals. We have been investing in biopharmaceuticals for now several years. And we have been also introducing the products in these categories, not only on antibodies but on biopharmaceuticals. A good example is Improvac that was launched some years ago. And we also focus our attention to platforms that we also increase, the product portfolio that also will meet the demands of the market. We are very pleased that Zoetis is not only leading in pharmaceuticals, we have many examples like APOQUEL, that we've shown very strong leadership in that category, but also in vaccines. In 2014, we had the opportunity also to bring to the market a solution for an outbreak that it was a highly significant impact in the swine industry in the U.S., I am referring to the PEDv vaccine. And now we have used monoclonal antibody, we’re also showing that also we are leading in biopharmaceuticals. We're very pleased also that our model, which is combining investment in innovation with investment in the protecting of our current portfolio is showing a high level of productivity and leading the industry in all different areas of innovation.
Paul Herendeen: Mark, it's Paul. First, thank you for the kind words. Yes, I had the very good fortune to join an outstanding team here. So, while I’ll take the complement, I'd also say that it's a team game here. I also want to pile on a little bit on the R&D front, because from an investor perspective I kind of think of Zoetis is kind of like two-in-one. You have a large growing portfolio of existing business and we also have this robust R&D engine, that if it were on its own, would represent an attractive investment opportunity in its own right. So great question, thank you.
Operator: We will now take a question from Kevin Ellich, with Piper Jaffray.
Kevin Ellich: Given your strong operational growth, I was just wondering if you'd break out the difference between volume and what type of pricing increases you are pushing through. And then could you maybe talk about the performance of some of your new products like ACTOGAIN and ENGAIN, and if you'd noticed any significant market share. 
Juan Ramon Alaix: Paul will answer the first part of the question and then I will make some comments about the new product launches. 
Paul Herendeen: I will speak to the history because that's what we can do with respect to price and volume. Let's start with the quarter. We had total growth, as I said, operational growth 9%. Of that 9%, roughly 2% came from price and 7% came from volume. So strong in the quarter. Take that for the full-year, 7% operational growth. Again, 2% came from price and roughly 5% from volume. We got a lot more pricing leverage in emerging markets than in developed markets. I don't know if it's all that productive to go through the specifics of it, but I hope that, in general, answers your question. 
Juan Ramon Alaix: Then back to your question on ACTOGAIN or ENGAIN. Both products performance are doing well and exceeding our initial projections. One of the factors that has been also impacting the higher revenue than expected, it was withdrawn off of one competitor product one year ago. So very pleased, with also the acceptance of our two products from customers, and these two products, ENGAIN is for the swine producers and ACTOGAIN for cattle producers. Both performing above expectations. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Erin Wilson, with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. 
Erin Wilson: I was reading some of the literature on APOQUEL on the Web site and it continues to say that April's launch time frame or replenish supply. Will this be the same? Will it be fully ramped up that point? Or will there still be order limits in place over the course of the year? Is this all Incorporated into your guidance at this point? And then on new products, could you speak to the opportunity in diagnostics, any attraction you're seeing with your feline rapid assay? Is that an area you expect to build as to acquisitions? Do you anticipate any product launches in diagnostics overall? 
Juan Ramon Alaix: Thank you, Erin. On APOQUEL, definitely we expect that from April we'll increase significantly the production of the product, or the product availability to the veterinary market. We expect that from April we will be able to meet all the demands from the customers. And we expect also that through the year, demand will increase and then we will be able to supply all these demands with the product that will be available. As I said in my remarks, we are forecasting for 2015 revenues from $150 million to $175 million. And we are convinced that this will be a significant quality in our portfolio, and we are very pleased that all the constraints that we face in 2014 will be over in 2015 from April.  In terms of diagnostics, the diagnostics has been always -- since some years ago an area and where we have been also investing. We are convinced that this very complementary to our current portfolio and we also expect that with our internal efforts and also the acquisition of Abbott Animal Health, this will enhance our portfolio and definitely we will also consider any external opportunity and even further expressing our portfolio diagnostics. 
Paul Herendeen: It is Paul just a follow-up a little bit area. So the modelers out there and I know there are plenty, with respect to APOQUEL, we get through the first quarter and when we have supply we would expect a stair step for sales of APOQUEL and then with growth to follow. So I hope that provides a little better color.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Kreger, with William Blair.
John Kreger: Juan Ramon you mentioned the new oral flea and tick product that has been filed. Do think that will be in a position to be fully launched by spring 2016 season? And then a quick second question I believe on Investor Day you talked about efforts to optimize your manufacturing. Program, which I know is big and complex around the world. Can you just give us an update on the timing for that broader effort? 
Juan Ramon Alaix: We expect [indiscernible] to be available sometime in 2016, which will depend on the approval from the FDA as well as the approval from EMA in Europe. And also in Canada also we expect approval. And we are working to make sure that the product will be available for the next parasitic campaign in April or around spring next year. Something that it will depend on FDA, but we expect to provide to FDA all the information needed to get this product approved on time. In terms of manufacturing, we mentioned during our Investor Day that from now until 2020, we expect an improvement in our cost by 200 basis points. And plans are moving ahead. And there is no any reason to think that we’ll not be delivering on the objective that we have. Now also we mentioned that we have three phases of our plan. We are now on Phase 1, in this Phase 1, we’ll be delivering these 200 basis points, then we’ll go into the next phase that we’ll be going to further analyze our plan network and then finally the third phase will be how we need to invest in manufacturing to achieve higher profitability or lower cost and also making sure that we have the technologies that will be needed to support our future revenues. Next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Schott with JP Morgan. Your line is open.
Chris Schott: Just to two quick ones here. First following up an earlier pricing question, can you just elaborate a little more on the drivers of pricing particularly on the production side of the business? I guess specifically is there more opportunity to selectively raise or reset price when you see healthy market dynamics that we’re seeing for your customers in the current environment? And second with just a broader business development kind of question, in area I think we all have a little bit less visibility into, but when you look at these Abbott type transaction that seem to make a lot of sense for Zoetis. How broad is an opportunity effect do you see on the business development front and given some of the anti-trust issues in the space are there realistically larger targets that Zoetis could pursue or should we really think of Abbott type transactions being the real focus here? Thanks very much.
Juan Ramon Alaix: In terms of pricing, the approach that we have for both like livestock and companionable is to have steady and consistent price increases. We are not trying to get the opportunity of higher prices when the conditions are more favorable to livestock producers. And at the same time, we also apply pricing increases with these conditions as less favorable. So is -- and study that has been working very well and a study that has been extended to many markets around the world including emerging markets. And we had in 2014 very positive improvement in our prices in many of these emerging markets. In terms of really definitely Abbott was a great opportunity that it was meeting all the requirements that we have in terms of business development opportunities including the strategic field, including the synergies, revenues and cost, also the financial value and the anti-trust issues. Definitely we have significant market-share, you know that we have market-share which is close to 20% and these may have some intentions in terms of a larger acquisition. We’ll consider any opportunity that is available in the market. We have a team that is aware of any kind of potential transaction that can be an opportunity for Zoetis and we will continue assessing these opportunities and as part of the evolution, we include any kind of anti-trust challenge, but we’ll limit the value of the acquisition. Next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jamie Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jamie Rubin: Sorry about that, can you hear me? Sorry about that guys. Had a little technical difficulty on my end. Juan Ramon, can you tell you what do you think is on the agenda as a new Board member? Is the agenda more related to margin improvement or is it business development? And as a follow-up, can you remind us of the agreement with Pfizer and how it would impact a potential sale of the company, is Zoetis too large for an acquisition by a competitor or would it have to be acquired by company with essentially no animal health presence? Thanks.
Juan Ramon Alaix: Thank you, Jamie and let me start saying that we have very constructive dialogue with Pershing Square, since they became the largest shareholder in the fall. And they were -- they expressed interest in having a position in our board. And given that the Mr. Doyle has a lot of operational experience and again the position of Pershing Square in our company the Board agreed to incorporate him into our Board. So, what we -- all the Board will be working including Mr. Doyle and other members of the Board, increasing the value to our shareholders. And this value can come from many different ways. Including margins, growing revenues and any kind of potential transaction. And this is something that will be part of the discussions and maybe at this point may be stipulated is not creating any additional value to the discussion. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We can take our next question from Jeff Holford with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Jeff Holford: Hi thanks very much for take my question. Going back to APOQUEL. Your 2015 guidance and commentary does suggest much higher peak sales and you get to full penetration to this so one could think of this product potentially adding 5% to 10% against your current base of revenues over the next couple of years. And I'm interested also around the level of margin seem a much higher margin product than the rest of the business overall. Could the potential bottom line impact from this product be a most double what it is that the top line? 
Juan Ramon Alaix: Thank you, Jeff. On APOQUEL we mentioned our peak sales are predicted between 200 million of 300 million and these based on the current knowledge of the market. Definitely we will be updating these peak sales based on what will be the reaction and the consumption of the public once the product it is available. In over quantity to assess what is the full potential of this compound. In general, we are not providing gross margin by products, but as you know we have gross margin in our Company of 65% and we rank margins depending on the categories. The highest margins are coming from companion animal followed by cattle, swine, and poultry. So you can imagine that companion animal much higher than the 65% average that we have at the Zoetis . Paul do you want to add any other comments?
Paul Herendeen: Sure, just one that is the increased sales of APOQUEL certainly help. Of course we do have a mix of our portfolio for example the guidance table you all saw the addition of the Abbott assets to our total 2015 expectations. The Abbott assets are gross profit dilutive. Now I know they are only updated guidance for 75 million of sales but we do have a portfolio so even when things like APOQUEL help, there are other parts of our portfolio that can help smooth or help – they tend to smooth that out back towards our expected 35.5% to 36% -ish range of revenues in for 2015. 
Operator: And our next question comes from Liav Abraham with Citi. Your line is open.
Liav Abraham: I am just looking back to cost efficiencies you mentioned this a couple of times during the call. Can you go into little but more detail about the opportunities that you see here in which cost categories and over what time frame? 
Paul Herendeen: It is Paul. I will take a stab at that and Juan Ramon may want to come in as well. Louise asked a question earlier on about margin expansion and I just want to point out that so far, we've done a pretty good job over the course of the last several years if you have looked at our reported operating margins going back to 2011 and up to ’14 and it's been a nice progression from ’18 to ’21 to ’24 to ’25 and I was broadly by rolling the top line while having some expense discipline meaning holding the line on expenses. Now a wise man once said to me it’s not all that impressive to grow into an expanding margin but I would say it may not be impressive but it is a good thing. That said, that what sets the stage. Even with respect to think about our 2015 we saw some headwinds in FX and we took some actions with respect to our operating expenses in order to be able to as best we could without impacting our business model reduce our expected operating expenses for 2015. The areas where we are most likely to have long-term opportunity are those areas that are away from revenue production and R&D and manufacturing.  And manufacturing would be more efficient to that process as we would hope to disclose to the market at some point in the future. In the area really is around those into recall enabling functions in G&A, we are still in the process of our standup. I know that is frustrating to a lot of people where we just really completed our second year on our own. We continue to have challenges in implementing systems and building out the infrastructure that will enable us to grow and control and manage what is a very complicated global business. As we make progress along the lines of the implementation for example of our global ERP package SAP, it will give us opportunity to be more efficient in our enabling functions. Now, we look at all types of expenses and I would say -- I do say constantly in investor meetings, we can always do better. So, we want to look at ways that we can deploy our capital within our business to the areas where we think we’ll get the most bang for our buck, and to the extent that we are successful in doing that over the next several years, we expect that we can expand our operating margin potentially beyond what you would be -- or what would be implied by our current long-term guidance. And to refresh for everybody what we said on Investor Day was, you look out to 2015, '16, and '17 based on what you have in front of you, is you have a company that can grow from now roughly 25% operating margin and add 500 basis point so that by growing revenues and being disciplined with respect to expense. We see opportunities to be more efficient, that would survey be additive to that. Next question please.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) And we can take our next question from Kathy Miner with Cowen and Company. Your line is open.
Kathy Miner: Just two quick follow-ups if I may. First on the stand up cost and ERP spending that you were just discussing. I believe the last time you had talked about those costs winding down the early part of 2016 can you give us an update on the timing? And second one on the oral flea and tick products, when it does come out, should we expected to be differentiated in any key ways from the products that are already out there? Thank you.
Paul Herendeen: The timing on that was that we would expect to be fully up on SAP by the end of the first quarter of 2016. So 2015 is a busy year for us in that regard and we’ll still have some work in the early part of 2016, but we would expect to put that behind us in early 2016.
Juan Ramon Alaix: And about Sarolaner that is our compound, the active ingredient of our new oral parasiticides for ticks and fleas, we are still working on the label. The label is not yet finalized and not approved. And we’ll see how this is hit it's from competitors. And we know that there are already several competitors in the market, but as I said in my comments, it's a market of 2.5 billion to 3 billion. So it's a plenty of opportunities for Zoetis even in phase of several competitors. The other important point is that we have the access to the customers. We have a significant presence in all the markets, but the product will be available and the opportunity will be significant. And we are convinced that the vision of the model that we have which is our direct interaction with customers also will generate good revenues out of this product even with more or less differentiation in the market. Next question please.
Operator: We’ll now take a follow-up from Jamie Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jamie Rubin: Hi, you may have missed my second part of my question if you could remind us of the agreement with Pfizer and how it impacted potential sales to the company? Thanks.
Juan Ramon Alaix: Yes, thank you, Jamie. While this agreement it's an agreement that its part of the tax matter agreement for which there are some restrictions until June 24. After this time there will be no restrictions but even with these potential restrictions until that date, there also maybe opportunities for company's considering transactions which are not affected by this tax matter agreement. Next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Reisinger with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
David Reisinger: Thanks very much and congratulations to the team on the strong quarter. My question is on SG&A and I guess there are a few sub parts to it and it really relates to the cross currents. So, in the fourth quarter SG&A was above expectations, yet for 2015 SG&A will be below expectations. So with respect to the fourth quarter, were there any one-time or unusual items in the non-GAAP SG&A, Paul that will not repeat in the fourth quarter of 2015? And then second on the 2015 SG&A outlook coming down $35 million, does that include any sales force rationalization and if not, what are the areas of cuts?
Paul Herendeen: Yes sure, I’ll start with the SG&A in Q4, David. There were as I articulated in my prepared remarks there are some of those cost that were directly related to increase revenue. There were some dates when we get to a certain point in revenue, where we have released additional promotional spending that occurred in Q4 that might not be likely to complete unless we are trending well above our expectations again in Q4 of 2015. So I wouldn’t describe the items in there so much as one time. This is the ones that are within our adjusted SG&A. They were expenses that in large part were managed by us in the quarter, and reflect a robust revenue quarter for us and looking ahead to 2015. Thinking about the SG&A for 2015, full-year, we did reduce the range by some $35 million and no, it does not reflect any sort of a restructuring or anything. Evidence of that is if it had been a restructuring we probably would have called out in one-time cost and certain significant items restructuring charge. This was -- what I will call a normal course of business, looking at 2015, looking at where we are relative to where we want to be in us taking actions around categories that we do not think will influence that top line. So by definition, away from revenue generation mainly in enabling type functions. I hope that answers the question. Next question please.
Operator: There are no further questions. At this time I would like to turn the program back over to Mr. Juan Ramon for any additional or closing remarks.
Juan Ramon Alaix: Thank you for joining us today. On our fourth quarter results total year for 2014. And our guidance for this year. So thank you for joining us.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. A replay of today’s will be available in two hours by dialing 1 (800) 695-2185, for U.S. listeners and (402) 530-9028 for international. Please disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Welcome to the Third Quarter 2014 Financial Results Conference Call and Webcast for Zoetis. Hosting the call today is John O'Connor, Head of Investor Relations for Zoetis. The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, and will not be forwarded automatically. In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately 2 hours after the conclusion of this call via dial-in or on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to John O'Connor. John, you may begin.
John O'Connor: Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to the Zoetis Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. I'm joined today by Juan Ramón Alaix, our Chief Executive Officer; and Paul Herendeen, our Chief Financial Officer. Juan Ramón and Paul will provide an overview of our quarterly results, and then we will open the call for your questions. Before we begin, let me remind you that the earnings press release and financial tables can be found on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. We are also providing a simultaneous webcast of this morning's call, which can be accessed on the website as well. A PDF version of the slides used today will also be available on the website following the call. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statements in today's press release and our SEC filings, including, but not limited to, our 2013 annual report on Form 10-K and our reports on form 10-Q. Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP adjusted figures exclude the impact of purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs and certain significant items, such as the nonrecurring costs of becoming a standalone public company. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and in the company's 8-K filing dated today, November 4, 2014. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. I also want to remind you that beginning with the first quarter, we realigned our segment reporting with respect to our Client Supply Services organization or CSS, which provides contract manufacturing services for third parties. The revenue and earnings associated with CSS are now reported within Other business activities, separate from the 4 reportable segments. In 2013, CSS results were reported in the EuAfME segment. With that, I will turn the call over to Juan Ramón.
Juan Ramón Alaix: Thank you, John. And thank you to those joining today's call. Before beginning my comments on our third quarter performance, I would like to introduce Paul Herendeen. Paul joined Zoetis as our new CFO this past September to lead the company's finance and information technology organizations, in addition to being part of the Zoetis executive team. I'm delighted that Paul has joined Zoetis and is on the call today. Later, he will speak with you as we review the details of our third quarter performance. A key element of our long-term value proposition is our ability to grow in line or faster than the market. Based on most recent data, Zoetis continues to grow faster than the animal health industry. Over the trailing 12 months ending with the second quarter, the animal health market grew by 3% according to industry sources, while Zoetis grew by 5% with both percentages, including the negative impact of foreign exchange. Our ability to grow faster than the animal health market illustrates the fundamental strength of our business model. With the broadest product portfolio in the industry, the steady introduction of new products and our top-ranked field force, we are able to bring value solutions to veterinarians and livestock producers around the world. Now, let's turn to our operational performance during the most recent quarter. During the third quarter, we generated operational growth of 10% in revenue and 21% in adjusted net income, delivering adjusted diluted EPS of $0.41. Revenue growth during the quarter was strong in all regions and in both developed and emerging markets, with emerging markets delivering double-digit growth. These are result of favorable market conditions, the strength of our diverse product portfolio and the diversity of our global presence. Let me now comment on our livestock performance. In livestock, we grew 13% and growth was strong across all geographic segments. Producers are enjoying favorable market conditions in many parts of the world with high meat and milk prices, together with lower feed cost. On a global basis, the outlook for meat and daily proteins remains strong. A growing middle-class in China, India and other emerging markets continues to drive growth in worldwide demand for meat, eggs and daily proteins. Let's now take a closer look at our third quarter performance by species, starting with cattle. Cattle is our largest species and it grew 13% with all regions delivering strong growth. In the United States, we saw strong demand for our premium products, while we also generated gains gains in market share. Swine revenues grew 17% despite the challenge of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus or PEDv in a number of countries. All regions contributed to this growth and we continue to expand our swine product portfolio through the introduction of vaccines with new antigen combinations as well as registering and commercializing products in new markets. Poultry revenue grew 7% with strong contributions from the emerging markets within the European, Africa and Middle East region. Now, turning to companion animal. Companion animal grew by 5%, aided by sales of APOQUEL in the U.S. and several European countries. Strong growth of key brands in the U.S. and Europe was offset by the introduction of new products from competitors and the impact of the solution changes in Japan. While competition has affected our results in parasiticides and vaccines, we are confident in our ability to participate in this and other growing market segments as we introduce innovative products to the market. For example, we are preparing for European launch in 2015 of Versican Plus, a new line of canine vaccines. We will cover -- I will cover Versican Plus in more details when I discuss new products and milestones. We can also confirm that in April 2015, we expect to significantly increase APOQUEL supply. With greater supply, we expect to begin offering APOQUEL to new customers. We continue to receive very positive feedback from customers about this product. And based on current market conditions, we believe APOQUEL can achieve annual sales of approximately $200 million to $300 million at peak sales, which normally is 5 years after product introduction. Now, I would like to share with you several products and milestones that illustrate how our singular focus on animal health and our core capabilities allow us to put our customers first and bring our solutions to their most pressing animal health needs. Earlier in the quarter, we announced that we obtained a conditional license in the United states for our vaccine to help fight PEDv in pigs. Under a conditional license, we demonstrate safety in a field study and provide reasonable expectations of efficacy. We are now conducting additional studies to demonstrate efficacy and to obtain a full license from the USDA. The PEDv vaccine has been received very positively by swine customers and is available to them ahead of the cold weather when the virus is more likely to spread. We were able to bring this vaccine to market in only 14 months by leveraging our 3 interconnected capabilities. Our R&D capability and the expertise in biologics allow us to fast-track the development of PEDv vaccine. Manufacturing and scale-up capability enable us to produce enough of the vaccine to meet projected customer demand. And now that the product has been launched, Zoetis representatives and our field veterinarians are partnering with our customers on how to incorporate the new vaccine into their protocols and biosecurity programs. The development of these vaccine is an example of how we leverage our capabilities to bring solutions to our customers. This past quarter, Zoetis also received a full license for the first poultry vaccine targeting Georgia 08 type IBV. The full license followed the USDA conditional license that Zoetis received in late 2013. These are the first commercially vaccine to help reduce disease cause by the virus strain. In our companion animal business, we received European approval for Versican Plus. This is a combination canine vaccine that provides unmatched leptospira protection as well as a greater convenience and flexibility for veterinarians. It provides protection against obtained bacterial and viral infections in one vaccine dose. By offering multiple vaccine combinations, Versican Plus provides a comprehensive solution for European markets that accommodates a broad range of vaccination protocols. We are now preparing the launch of Versican Plus in the European Union in 2015. Also, we announced the formation of a new collaboration with Easter Bush Research Consortium that is focused on combating emerging infectious diseases in Europe. Zoetis will partner with others in this consortium to detect and identify emerging infectious diseases early and to develop medicines and vaccines to treat and control them. Zoetis is the only animal health company in this consortium. Collaboration like this one contributes to our ability to be first to know about emerging infectious diseases and aspires to be first to market with new products to diagnose and prevent diseases. And before I ask Paul to walk us through the financials and provide details on our 2014 guidance, I would like to remind you of our upcoming Investor Day. We are very pleased to be hosting an investor meeting on November 18 at the New York Stock Exchange. The goal of the meeting is to enhance understanding of the animal health industry, the key drivers of Zoetis market leadership and the strategies for future growth. I will be joined by the Zoetis executive team for a discussion of our regional businesses, R&D approach, manufacturing and supply chain operations and financial goals. And with that, Paul?
Paul S. Herendeen: Thank you, Juan Ramón, and good morning. It's been a very busy and productive first 2 months and I'd like to say that the more I learn, the more confident I am that the fundamentals of our industry, our team here at Zoetis and the strengths of our capabilities provide us with the opportunity to create value for our stakeholders. I'll speak more about all this in 2 weeks at our Investor Day, but now let me dive in and review the third quarter a little more deeply and to discuss our guidance for 2014. Turning first to the interest income statement slide. For the third quarter, revenue was approximately $1.2 billion, an increase of 10% year-over-year on both a reported and operational basis. Reported net income was $166 million or $0.33 per diluted share in the third quarter, an increase of 27%. And adjusted net income was $207 million or $0.41 per diluted share, representing reported growth of 20% and 21%, respectively. Adjusted net income from the quarter excludes the after-tax impact of $41 million or $0.08 per diluted share for purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs and certain significant items, the majority of which were related to standup costs. Now, let's take a minute to discuss currencies. In the third quarter, foreign exchange did not have a material impact on our revenue or income growth. It's important to remember that our 3 international business segments have an earlier quarter close than the U.S. segment. The third quarter for the international segments closed at the end of August with the U.S. segment closing at the end of September. Looking ahead, we expect to see a negative impact on revenue growth in the range of 250 to 300 basis points in the fourth quarter based on current rates and we expect to see similar magnitude of impact in 2015. Now let's turn to our adjusted income statement slide, which I'll discuss on an operational basis. Again, because FX was not a significant factor in the third quarter, operational revenue growth was 10%, the same as reported. Livestock comprised 65% of sales in the quarter and grew $88 million or 13% operationally. Companion animal comprised 34% of sales in the quarter and grew $20 million or 5% operationally. Adjusted cost of sales was 35.5% of revenue versus 34.7% in the year-ago quarter. And that's due to the buildup of central manufacturing supply chain operations. This buildup was completed by the end of 2013 and those higher costs are now flowing through our cost of goods sold. Adjusted SG&A, meanwhile, increased by 2% operationally in the third quarter. In other items, adjusted R&D expense was flat operationally and interest expense was flat at $29 million in the quarter. Our effective adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was 28.3%. I would not read too much into our tax rate in the quarter. What's important is that we expect our rate for the full year 2014 to be consistent with our guidance, which is approximately 29%. And again, our adjusted net income was $207 million, representing a growth of 20% or 21% operationally. Now let me talk for a minute about how we're tracking year-to-date on a few elements. This was a great quarter, but we always want to keep in mind the full year and that's because of the nature of our business, the cycles in the animal health industry and fluctuations in currencies in any given year. In looking at any quarter relative to the prior year, lot of noise can creep in. The longer the time period you look at, the more that noise cancels itself out and you can see a clearer picture of the underlying trends in our business. We focus on full calendar years and do not guide or manage to quarterly results. While it feels great to put a quarter on the board with such strong revenue and profit growth, the bigger picture is that we are on track to deliver on our guidance for the full year. That said, let's take a quick look at the 9 months year-to-date and compare that back to 2013. We're tracking in line with our revenue expectations for the first 9 months, growing revenue 6% on an operational basis. Our guidance range implies full year 2014 operational growth of 5% to 6%. Our adjusted cost of sales is at 34.9% of revenue on a year-to-date basis. As I said earlier, we continue to expect our cost of sales to increase as a percent of revenue for the year, bringing us in line with the full year guidance of approximately 35.5% of revenue. And finally, adjusted net income is also performing in line with our expectations growing at 13% on an operational basis year-to-date. This year-to-date performances are in ranges that are consistent with our expectations, and I'll discuss the implications on our full year guidance in a moment. Now let's turn to our operating segment results. Again, I'll discuss these on an operational basis, but I -- but it should be noted that the segment earnings are on a pretax basis and are presented on an adjusted basis. Beginning with the U.S. Third quarter revenue was $532 million, an increase of 7%. Sales of livestock products grew 12% with cattle and swine as the main contributors. Growth in cattle products benefited from higher demand for our premium product as producers continue to see strong market conditions. With higher prices for beef and lower input costs, producers are moving lighter animals into feed lots sooner to meet the market opportunity. These cattle can be more vulnerable to illness and disease, given their age and weight, and require more use of medicines and vaccines to maintain their health. These market conditions also mean our customers place more importance on using our premium products to protect animals and investments. Meanwhile, swine products sales were driven primarily by the success of several recent new product introductions such as our Fostera PCV M. hyo combination vaccine. The DRAXXIN 25 anti-infective product for swine and our ENGAIN ractopamine product for use in feed. This growth in swine was slightly offset by the continuing impact of PEDv, which Juan Ramón mentioned. In companion animal products, we generated an operational growth of 2%, driven by APOQUEL and other key brands such as ProHeart 6, Cerenia and Convenia. This growth was offset, however, by increased competition in vaccines, pain products and parasiticides. In summary, the U.S. segment earnings increased by 10% based on the quarter's strong sales and lower expenses. Now turning to our Europe, Africa and Middle East region or EuAfME. Revenue in EuAfME was $293 million, an increase of 12% operationally compared to the third quarter of 2013. The growth was a combination of double-digit growth in both developed and emerging markets. Sales of our livestock products increased 13% operationally as the region delivered positive results in France and the U.K., as well as in emerging markets. The livestock growth was driven by increased sales across all species with particular advances coming from cattle and poultry products. In France for example, we saw an increase in the sales of the anti-infectives as customers sought to buy product ahead of more restrictive legislative changes. And in the U.K., we saw strong demand for cattle products. Meanwhile, sales of companion animal products increased 11% operationally, primarily driven by sales of APOQUEL in Germany and the U.K. as well as growth in parasiticides such as the Stronghold brand. EuAfME segment earnings increased 28% operationally, primarily due to the revenue increase, improved gross margins and lower operating expenses in the quarter. Turning to our Canada and Latin America segment or CLAR. Third quarter revenue was $194 million, an increase of 17% operationally compared to the third quarter 2013. In this region, we saw a significant growth in emerging markets such as Venezuela, Brazil and Argentina and also in Canada. Overall for the segment, sales of livestock products grew 16% operationally and sales of companion animal products grew 19% operationally. Sales in Venezuela and Argentina grew significantly across all species. In Brazil, there was significant growth driven primarily by sales of cattle products, including new product launches and growth in key companion animal brands such as Vanguard, Cerenia, Revolution and Convenia, as this market continues to expand at a high rate. Meanwhile, growth in Canada was primarily driven by sales of companion animal products. This was the result of a later spring season than last year, which had a positive impact on parasiticides sales -- the growth of parasiticides sales for this quarter as compared to last year quarter. Strong volumes in cattle and swine products also contributed to growth in Canada. CLAR segment earnings increased 19% on an operational basis, driven by revenue growth, limited growth in operating expenses and partially offset by a decline in gross margin. In Asia Pacific or APAC, third quarter sales were $179 million, an increase of 7% operationally compared to the third quarter 2013. Sales of our livestock products grew 9% operationally, driven primarily by sales of cattle products in Australia and growth in Southeast Asia from recently launched swine products. In Australia, we are seeing more cattle moving into feed lots and requiring more treatment as Australia continues see the impact of drought on its cattle businesses. In the swine, we continue to see strong sales driven primarily by an increase in sales of our vaccine portfolio. Sales of companion animal products, however, were flat operationally due to an inventory buyback related to the termination of a distributor agreement in Japan. Excluding this event, operational growth would have been 8% driven by sales of parasiticides, equine vaccines in Australia and increased sales of vaccines in China. APAC segment operating earnings increased 24% due to revenue growth, improvements in gross margin and a decline in operating expenses. That's on an operational basis. Now let me turn to guidance for the full year 2014. As I mentioned earlier, we think about and manage our business in an annual basis and not quarterly. There can be a lot of variability in any individual quarter. For example, in revenue, the variability can be to due to changes in weather patterns or seasonality be associated with certain product lines. In R&D expenses, for example, the quarter -- quarterly variability may be based on project schedules and conditions needed to complete field trials. Our R&D expense, for example, tends to be heaviest in the fourth quarter. Over a full year, that variability, which you have seen in pockets this year, historically evens out, and we are able to deliver a steady and predictable performance when measured on an annual basis. We remain confident on our ability to deliver on our full year guidance for 2014 and we are reaffirming our adjusted earnings per share for the full year and narrowing our revenue guidance towards the high end of the range. We now expect reported revenue of approximately $4.7 billion to $4.75 billion for the full year. This guidance would imply full year reported growth of 3% to 4% for revenue and includes a negative impact of 2 percentage points from foreign currency. This also implies an operational growth of 1% to 5% in the fourth quarter, and that's when compared with a strong fourth quarter in 2013. After taking into consideration the current FX environment, reported revenue growth could be 250 to 300 basis points below the operational growth rate in Q4. Our guidance on adjusted cost of goods sold for the full year 2014 remains approximately 35.5% of revenue, roughly flat year-over-year. This reflects the anticipated benefit of price, volume and ongoing cost savings efforts, which is forecast to be offset by the full year impact of costs incurred to build our central manufacturing and supply functions as well as unfavorable mix. We understand this implies our fourth quarter cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue will be higher than what you've seen to date. However, we believe our 2014 full year guidance of approximately 35.5% of revenue is a better reflection of our underlying cost of goods sold. Adjusted SG&A expenses are now expected to be between $1.46 billion and $1.48 billion. We continue to see good OpEx discipline in the regions, which is helping to mitigate increased spending in our general and administrative functions, where we continue to build out the infrastructure to support our business on a fully standalone basis. Adjusted R&D expenses are expected to be between $385 million and $395 million. We continue to deploy resources responsibly in R&D as this investment is fundamental to the enhancement and protection of our existing portfolio through life cycle developments and the development of innovative new products to help fuel additional growth. We continue to expect our effective tax rate on adjusted income to be approximately 29%. This guidance does not reflect the potential extension of the U.S. R&D tax credit. And we continue to expect adjusted EPS of between $1.50 and $1.54 per share for the full year. This guidance would imply full year reported growth of 6% to 9% for adjusted EPS and reflects a negative impact of approximately 200 basis points coming from foreign currencies. Please note that our guidance does not reflect any further currency devaluation in Venezuela. Separately, we now estimate pretax charges for 2014 of between $180 million and $195 million, primarily related to standup costs and acquisition-related costs. These charges are excluded from our adjusted earnings guidance. Including the impact of these items as well as purchase accounting adjustments, our guidance for our reported diluted EPS for the full year 2014 remains between $1.16 and $1.20 per share. This annual guidance reflects our confidence in the diversity of our portfolio, the strength of our business model and our view of the evolving animal health market for the remainder of the year. To sum up the quarter, we had a very strong revenue and earnings growth quarter in all regions, demonstrating the strength of our business model. We demonstrated an ability to drive gross margin improvements and operating expense containment in our regional segments while continuing to absorb some of the impact of the buildup costs associated with our corporate functions. We saw no material impact from foreign currency on our growth this quarter, but anticipate more significant effects on our future results. And we are reaffirming our guidance for the year despite the expected currency headwinds in Q4. That concludes my prepared remarks. And now we will open the line for questions. John?
John O'Connor: Thank you Paul. Operator, we are ready to take the first question.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Chris Schott of JPMorgan.
Christopher T. Schott - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And then, Paul, congrats on the new role. Two questions here. First, can you elaborate on the U.S. companion business and competitive dynamics there? I think last quarter you mentioned you were increasing some of your promotional investments. I guess, any sign that those investments are having any impact? Or just when should we think about that business starting to maybe turn around a little bit more? And then a question for Paul, just as you're stepping into the CFO role, can you just elaborate a little bit more on your priorities? I guess, specifically, what are the biggest opportunities you see at Zoetis when you look at the company's margins, tax rate and capital structure?
Operator: It appears that the -- we're experiencing technical difficulties at this time. Please standby. [Technical Difficulty]
Juan Ramón Alaix: I hope now the line is fine and I will be able to answer your questions, Chris.
Operator: Sir, you may now proceed with your answer.
Juan Ramón Alaix: Okay. So Chris, it's Juan Ramón and I will answer the question on U.S. companion animal dynamics. So there are different factors driving the market in the U.S. in companion animal. The introduction of new products, mainly in parasiticides. The market is moving more to oral parasiticides compared to the previous, more topical ones with the introduction of 2 main competitors in this market. And we are participating in the market in the topical, but not on the oral. The other change that we have seen is that the introduction of new vaccines in the U.S. that also they are impacting our performance. And finally, in the pain market in where we participate with RIMADYL a very strong brand, there are also new factors affecting our performance. One, it's a competitor that was out of the market in 2012. It was back in '13 and now it's full revenues and also made it part of the shares that we gained when this competitor was not participating in this market. It's now back to the more normal situation. And also, the introduction of generic competition for RIMADYL on the chewable formulation, although this have not been representing a significant impact so far. Now, I will ask Paul to answer your question.
Paul S. Herendeen: Yes, thanks, Juan Ramón, and Chris, thanks for the questions. Yes, I've been here about 60 days now. I'll tell you that my -- the first thing I see is an opportunity or I say, more as a priority for me is to help us to get complete with the standup process. Until we get through that, I think that it's going to somewhat mask our company's cash flow generation capabilities because it, obviously, while it doesn't affect adjusted net income, it obviously is a cash flow item. And so in terms of priority, both getting us past those -- that standup activity and getting the G&A infrastructure built to the point where it can support this global business has kind of been very, very high on my list. Now that said, I mean walking down through the income statement, there are opportunities for us to continue to drive operating margin improvements over time, and I think these are themes that you've heard from the other members of the team as we go -- as you go back. I mean, we've got very good expense control in our commercial groups. That's been a little bit masked by the buildup of cost in G&A. And again, once we get through that, we'll get to more of a normalized run rate for our OpEx. There are opportunities in the gross profit margin when we look at ability to continually benefit from price increases. Second, from improvements in efficiency in our plant network structure. And those are things that although they will happen here in the near term, I think that it will take us some time to generate the most meaningful portion of those margin expansion opportunities. Part of your question was around the tax rate. We -- when we spun out from Pfizer, we started with a tax rate kind of -- or we could have had a tax rate sort of in the 40% range. We were able to put together a structure or put in place a structure that enables us to have that tax rate down in the neighborhood of about 29%. So good from the perspective of a structure that allows us to have a much lower tax rate. Thinking ahead, I think that our ability to manage that tax rate is based on opportunities to present themselves to us that fit within our structure. I would not expect to see revolutionary changes in our tax rate, although we will do our level best to manage that tax rate down over time. And I think your last question was around capital structure. In this company, we are -- we have expressed that we wanted to maintain a level of debt in our cap structure. I think you certainly know me from my prior employer and -- I like debt, we like debt. There's a role for debt in our capital structure. We've expressed a target of 2.5x trailing 12 months' EBITDA. That's an appropriate debt load, but I will say that's a target. It's a target, where if there were an opportunity in the call -- we were called upon to lever up a little bit, we would do that, and then we would endeavor to reduce our debt over time back towards the target. And I'll stop there. Can I get the next question please?
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin Ellich of Piper Jaffray.
Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: First one, Ramón, could you give us a little update on the competitive landscape. Sentinel Spectrum went to a competitor, wondering what your thoughts are? And also you talked about oral parasiticides, just wondering what's on the horizon for your product portfolio? And then for Paul, you've been with the company now for only a couple of months. Congratulations again. I'm sure it's been like drinking from a firehose, but just wondering if you could give us your puts and takes from when you decided to join the company until now. And also an update on the inventory issue in Japan with the distributor.
Juan Ramón Alaix: Thank you, Kevin. And I will answer the questions on Sentinel and oral parasiticides. Well, definitely as a leader in this industry, we see any transaction or any potential transaction in the market and also we are active assessing any opportunity. And definitely, Sentinel was an opportunity that we explored. And what -- as you see, we decided not to participate in this transaction. And we talked about what our programs or plan on oral parasiticides. Definitely, we see oral parasiticides an important part of preventing animals, dogs and cats against ticks and fleas and also heartworm. And we -- I would like to postpone the details of my answer to the Investor Day in -- when we have the opportunity to provide, to investors and to analysts, a more comprehensive view of our R&D approach and also some of the areas in where we are investing.
Paul S. Herendeen: And I'll pick -- Kevin, pick up from there. It's Paul. Your question was around puts and takes from prior to joining. So I've here, it's almost exactly 60 days, I think. As of today, it's 61 days. When I first looked at the opportunity, I think the thing that attracted me to it was, first looking at the industry, an industry that -- a global industry that grows consistently over time. So solid underlying macro trends. And then you look at the company, Zoetis. Here's the company that's a market leader with a broad portfolio, very durable revenue streams and remember, from my experience at Warner Chilcott, we sort of had the opposite of the durable revenue streams. Everybody was always concerned. And I looked at this and said, "Here's a company that has the opportunity to put consistent, revenue growth on the board by levering its broad portfolio and driving growth of those assets through application of sales force." It's very similar to what I was used to at Warner Chilcott, and also supporting those brands through productive R&D, both in terms of extending product life cycles, in terms of providing fuel to allow the sales forces to grow the overall revenue base and lastly, to add those truly innovative products that give you the opportunity to step up and accelerate your growth. So I look at this as being kind of a similar economic model to the pharma business, but with those important differences of longer duration, revenue streams, less reliance on IP. It's about the brands. Same levers to drive the business that's using your field sales resources, face-to-face with your customers to go out and drive revenue and then lastly, supporting that portfolio through productive investment in R&D. And I'd say that, that was my analysis coming in and 61 days later, I think this is a terrific company. And what I've been most impressed with is the ability of the company to execute consistently and drive revenue that exceeds the overall market growth. It's been quite an interesting couple of months here. And again, the most important thing was we've got a great team here that knows how to drive this business. I'll stop there. I'm sorry, you had a question about inventory in Japan. That was related to the termination of a distributor agreement. It's kind of a normal course. It came to the end and we were called upon to buy back some inventory, and that's what's going on there.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jami Rubin of Goldman Sachs.
Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Just a couple of questions. Specifically on the outlook for gross margins. I mean, Paul, you talked about gross margins getting hit in the fourth quarter. I imagine that's largely due to FX. But in light of global pricing pressure, maybe, Juan, you can touch upon that in terms of what you are seeing across all your different geographies. But in light of that competitive dynamic, how do you see the outlook for gross margins? Do you think that gross margins can expand in 2015, in 2016? Or should we assume that pricing pressures would offset volume growth and cost cutting or slimming down the manufacturing. But if you could just talk to, number one, pricing, global pricing pressures; and number two, impact on gross margins? And the other question was -- to Paul, was there any channel loading in front of the new vaccine launches? And Paul, congratulations on what sounds like a terrific opportunity for you.
Juan Ramón Alaix: Thank you, Jami. And we see -- we continue seeing opportunities of applying price increases across all geographies in where we operate. Definitely in 2014, we had been increasing prices in the U.S., also in Europe, in Canada, Latin America and Asia Pacific. We also apply quite an aggressive approach in some markets with high inflation rates, and this is something that we have seeing a positive impact in our revenues also because of these price [indiscernible]. In terms of the expansion of gross margin, definitely, we'll have the opportunity to cover that in our Investor Day and we'll provide more details on what can be our objective for the future. And maybe I would like to delay this -- well, the details until this Investor Day. And maybe -- and the last comment on the channel loading. So we're not loading the channel and this is something that -- the vaccine launches will be next year. And normally, we apply a very strict procedures to avoid -- that we are increasing inventory that is not needed to meet customer demands.
Paul S. Herendeen: Jami, it's Paul. I think you had a question regarding Q4 margin and so I want to make sure I address that because it's an important point. It's an FX impact. Yes, there's FX impact in -- across all of our line items through our P&L. However, it's -- the main reason for the expected increase in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue in Q4 is related to the timing of increased headquarters cost, which are flowing through our cost of goods sold in the second half of 2014. And I wasn't here when the folks articulated that, but I think that they provided some guidance that you should expect the cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue to rise as the year went on. But that the guidance range, which is -- well, actually the guidance level, which is I think the important statistic is, we do expect to be in line with our guidance for the full year, which was 35.5%. I think broadly, looking ahead without providing guidance, I think we have the opportunity to absorb those increased HQ costs in 2015 and beyond without having it have a deleterious effect on our margin.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alex Arfaei of BMO Capital Markets.
Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Regarding your Investor Day, you said that we're going to see some financial targets. I just want to clarify, are we going to -- are you going to provide some sort of medium to long-range guidance or targets beyond 2015? And the follow-up, there had been a lot of reports about potential buyers for your business. Obviously, in 2015 -- after June 2015, this will become more of a factor. Just could you comment on your overall strategic view about how relevant is that for you? How would you evaluate such opportunity? And just give us an overall sense of how you would think about that. Obviously, in the second half of next year, there's going to be a lot of focus on that. So how should we think about your position on potential -- on being a target of a potential acquisition?
Juan Ramón Alaix: Okay. Let me ask Paul to answer this question.
Paul S. Herendeen: Sure. I'll start with the Investor Day. We will provide a look, of course, what I'll call our normal sort of guidance look at 2015. And in addition, we will provide our thoughts around 2016 and 2017, not in the same level of detail, but in a way that would enable the market in large to get their arms around what our expectations are for the next several years. With respect to the second question?
Juan Ramón Alaix: And I think it's -- we cannot really respond on other company's strategy. We think we have a solid business that we can provide significant value to our shareholders. We are showing that we are meeting our objective in terms of revenues, in terms of adjusted net income and we are also, very important, growing faster than the market. So all this, in my opinion, is showing that this company is well managed. We also have a significant generation of cash over time, and then this will be additional opportunity for investors.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Kreger of William Blair.
John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Paul, I think you said your first priority was to kind of focus on the stand-up activities. Can you just elaborate on what's still left to do on that front? And second question, I believe you guys have said previously that you expect about maybe 20 basis points of manufacturing cost headwind as we move into '15. Is that still a decent expectation?
Paul S. Herendeen: Sure, and it's Paul. First, the primary task that remains to be completed is the completion of the implementation of a global ERP system, where we're installing SAP. It's very important to us to have that backbone for our company to support our decision-making and the management of our business on a global basis, number one. It's also important to us because it's important that we stand on our own away from Pfizer. So that is a top priority for me now. And that it's not just the implementation, it's also the build-out of the team. We call it Business Technology, so BT, but obviously the more familiar IT acronym. We're continuing to build out that function here in headquarters to support our business. And so that is the primary area where we continue to have some work to stand alone, away and apart from Pfizer. Second, with respect to the manufacturing headwind, I mean, you'll recall that we have an agreement with -- a supply agreement with Pfizer, which has some increases in cost that we need to absorb. I think we're doing a good job of wringing efficiencies out of our manufacturing process that have enabled us to offset a solid part of those increases that are in that contract. We're not going to provide guidance today on what it looks like into 2015, but I'll just give you the factoids that you should keep in your head: We have the opportunity to pull the price lever; we have the opportunity to manage our global supply chain and drive better efficiency; and there's always a favorable mix to the extent that our higher-margin product lines provide more of our overall revenue base. So I would say, yes, we're always facing headwinds -- or we are facing some headwinds looking into '15, but those are challenges that we have a solid opportunity to overcome.
Operator: Our next question comes from Louise Chen of Guggenheim.
Louise Alesandra Chen - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division: I have a few. So first question for Paul is since you've joined Zoetis, what are some new initiatives that you plan to implement at the company that could help drive earnings well above the sort of the $2 per share mark? And then secondly, as a company, do you have any interest in companion animal oncology or biologic drugs? As you know, a lot of smaller companies develop these products. I'm just wondering if that's true -- truly good opportunity or not. And then lastly just on APOQUEL, is there any way you can quantify what sales would've been in '14 had you had enough supply? And then in '15, how should we think about the sales ramp? I know you had said $200 million to $300 million in peak sales over, normally, a 5-year time frame, but could you get there faster?
Paul S. Herendeen: Yes, thanks, Louise. It's Paul. I'll take the first part of that. New initiatives to drive growth. Let's say the new initiatives, I get to step behind others who are already activating those sorts of strategies in order to drive longer-term growth, but as -- just referencing back to my past life, the similar sorts of levers that you would expect me to pull, and those include focus on value-generative business development activity. That would include using our existing tax structure to manage that tax rate in a downward direction. I think the things that I focus on also are the active management of our capital structure and thinking about ways that we can deliver value to our stakeholders really across-the-board, both from operations and from the management of our cap structure. So those are the initiatives that I've had. And then the second question was in companion animal?
Louise Alesandra Chen - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division: Yes, just curious if you think the oncology or biologics opportunities that some of the smaller companies are pursuing are actually real opportunities. Because I haven't seen the larger companies go after that, so just kind of curious.
Juan Ramón Alaix: I would take this question and let me say that in oncology, Zoetis was the first company launching a product that was fully developed to treat cancer for dogs. And this product was Palladia that we launched 2 or 3 years ago. So within that oncology, it's important in companion animal. It's, today, in many cases, veterinarians are still using products developed for human to treat cancer in dogs or cats. But we think that in the future, maybe there will be new products that will be better targeted for treating these kind of diseases in companion animal. And definitely, we will be assessing these opportunity and considering the internal or external opportunities to complement our portfolio. In terms of bios, I think it has been a key area for Zoetis. We have a very strong portfolio in both companion animal and livestock and we'll continue investing in bringing new products to our portfolio and also to strengthening our offer to our customers. And then finally on APOQUEL, so in 2014, we have communicated that our revenues will be around 1% of our total revenues and this has been because of the limitations in terms of product supply. Speculating how much will be the sales of APOQUEL with -- under restricted supply probably is not adding too much value. So what I think, in my opinion, it's -- important is that for 2015, we expect to generate more than $100 million in revenues and we expect definitely to generate these revenues, basically on that 9 months of full supply because we expect to have this product available to more customers from April. So you can -- that's why we are now communicating that we expect that this product has the potential of $200 million to $300 million at peak sales.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Douglas Tsao of Barclays.
Douglas D. Tsao - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Just to start, I think I'm trying to understand and I've got some questions trying to understand sort of the sequential guidance in terms of revenue. Obviously, they were really strong this last quarter. If I look at your historical seasonality, 4Q seems to be up a little -- to be up pretty meaningfully from 3Q. So just understanding some of those dynamics, as we move into the fourth quarter, that we should be aware of. And certainly the FX guidance seems to be a little bit more extreme than I would've expected. And then the other question is on terms of the PEDv vaccine. Just perhaps you can provide some perspective on how big an opportunity that can be for you and sort of the timing of that sort of coming -- or sort of the revenue sort of building on that product line because, obviously, very impressive how quickly you were able to get a product approved and to market.
Paul S. Herendeen: Yes, it's Paul. I'll take the fourth quarter. And how do you get there? I mean, we have 3 quarters on the board. So the year-to-date number is on the board. We have guidance. You can do the math and see what it implies with respect to revenue growth in the fourth quarter that's implied by that. Midpoint of the range, it's -- from a reported basis, it's sort of flattish and we did state that there's about a 250- to 300-basis-point negative impact to our revenues in Q4 versus Q4 of 2013. So fairly significant FX headwinds. And it does give me the opportunity to say, look, we feel like, from an operational perspective, we have a very strong quarter here and very strong guidance for the full year and that's pretty good when you're facing those sorts of FX headwinds that will -- almost certainly, in fact, I would say certainly will hit us in Q4 '14 compared back to '13. And frankly, as you think ahead to 2015 v '14 you have got to take this into account. For perspective, 45% of our revenue comes from our U.S. So we're U.S. dollar denominated, we're exposed to the euro, the real, Canadian dollar, Aussie dollar, sterling, yen. From the perspective of a U.S. dollar-denominated P&L, all those currencies I mentioned, there's not a lot of good news. There's a lot of headwind there. So we feel like our guidance for the full year and our guidance for Q4 is pretty strong, given that we're facing those headwinds going into -- or going into Q4. I think I'll leave it at that and Juan Ramón?
Juan Ramón Alaix: And I will answer the question on PEDv. And so just to provide a little bit of understanding of the market's potential. So first, this vaccine, it's targeting sows. And then by vaccinating the sows, it's transmitting the immunity to the piglet. So the number of sows in the U.S. is a little bit less of 6 million compared to 100 million of pigs of the total market. You see that the potential is related to the number of animals that will get this vaccine. That will be less than 6 million. The second fact that is also important is that we obtained a conditional license. Under the conditional license, we have some limitations in terms of the promotions. Actually, we can go to the customers and work with them to ensure protection for the sow, but there are some limitations in terms of promotion. What is important here is not the size of the revenues, but the confirmation that our business model is working very well. We have very strong capabilities in terms of R&D. Also, we have very strong capabilities in terms of our manufacturing to produce vaccine in a way that it's going to the market very fast. So in our opinion, we are bringing with this vaccine significant value to our customers, that they are facing a significant challenge with this disease, and we are confirming that Zoetis has all the capabilities that are needed to succeed in this industry.
Paul S. Herendeen: Sorry, it's Paul. I just do want to follow up. The one thing that I didn't say in my remarks about Q4 is also take a look at the quarter you're comparing to back in 2013. Our Q4 was quite strong. If you look at Q -- if you go back to '13 and you look sequentially, Q3 of '13 like $1.1 billion, Q4 '13 $1.254 billion, I think it was -- I've got -- yes, it was a little over $1.2 billion. And so, one is comparing back to last year's Q3, that certainly helped us in putting our good quarter on the board here in Q3 of '14. But that's a tough comparison quarter, Q4 of '13.
Douglas D. Tsao - Barclays Capital, Research Division: And so, Paul, just to clarify, so you don't think that necessarily that step-up of $115 million sequentially is sort of like a normal seasonal trend that we should think about?
Paul S. Herendeen: From '13 -- what I'd say is, I want to make this point over and over and over again, is because of the nature of our business and seasonality and how things can shift from September to October or across the month, the best way to look at it is the longest time period that you're comfortable with whether that's a year, a half year, whatever. If you look at the second half of 2014 versus '13, it's a good, solid second half of '14.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum of Evercore ISI.
Vlad Nikolenko: It's actually Vlad Nikolenko sitting in for Mark Schoenebaum. And so the question -- sorry for maybe beating a dead horse. But the question about the Q4, the current full year guidance implies that from Q3 to Q4 of this year, so year -- quarter-by-quarter growth, it's probably going to be a down quarter for revenue and for EPS. So I'm wondering if you can explain that in terms of expenses, what happens in Q4. Is it just seasonal stuff or something else? And in terms of revenue, I understand there will be a huge FX impact, but also just for FX, just to understand how it works for our models, I'm wondering if you can give more color about the type of hedging Zoetis is using for -- both for revenue, for the plan, as well as for EPS.
Paul S. Herendeen: Okay. Let me -- stay with me here because I want to make sure I understand your question. I think you started by asking about sequentially from Q3 of '14 into Q4 of '14. If you take the midpoint of our range, it would be up in Q4 versus Q3. Okay. So sequentially, I mean, at the midpoint of our range, you would have an increase in revenue Q3 '14 into Q4 '14. The other thing to point out is we talked about the impact in the quarter of the increased cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue, the implied is in the -- is going to be a high percentage and we called that out even in my prepared remarks. So you've got that. Then within SG&A, we typically do spend more towards the back half of the year. That's been a historically observed phenomenon within our business. And certainly within R&D, there is seasonality in our spend there and we talk about sort of the timing of trials that we can do in the field. You need the right conditions in order to be able to do that and the timing of projects, generally, ours have seemed to cluster and have us with more expense in R&D in Q4. You put all of those things together, yes, and then looking at Q4 on a stand-alone basis, yes, you could say, "Well, gee, the -- against whatever comparator you want to have, whether it's Q3 of '14 or Q4 of '13, it's a tough comparison." Again, strong full year expectation for the company. You were looking for reported growth in the neighborhood of 3% to 4% at the top line and that's on an operating basis taking FX out of the mix. Now this is revenue, expecting 5% to 6%. Think of that reported 3% to 4% range as -- but for FX, that's 5% to 6%, which is a very solid full year revenue growth '14 v '13. And I'm sorry, the second question?
Vlad Nikolenko: And the second question about the hedging. What type of hedging do you guys use to hedge top line and bottom line, if you do. Hedging instruments, if you're using specific instruments or rely on sort of natural hedging. And if there is natural hedging between regions, what is the delay between -- when the dollar moves or currencies move and the impact that we can see?
Paul S. Herendeen: Yes, a couple of things. I mean, we have natural hedges built in to markets where we have a significant presence because, of course, our costs are denominated in the same currency as our revenue streams. We do not hedge our top line nor our bottom line results. Like most companies, we don't. We are subject to, what they -- the changes in exchange rates. And frankly, if you look at them, again, my favorite phrase, over a long enough period of time, you'll see that those things sort of set -- sort themselves out. Where we do hedge is our net asset exposures in our subsidiaries. So that to the extent that we have risk when those balance sheets are translated, that we can hedge that and keep those costs within a relatively narrow band. We do, do that. Those costs as well as the FX gains or losses, would show up in our other income and deductions line within our P&L.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Risinger of Morgan Stanley.
David Risinger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: So I have, first, some questions for Juan Ramón and then for Paul. So Juan Ramón, first, could you just talk about animals moving into feed lots sooner in a little bit more detail on -- specifically what I'm hoping for you to address is how durable that is. So for how many quarters will that be benefiting Zoetis? Second, you've mentioned the APOQUEL revenue for '15 being over $100 million. Could you just help us benchmark that by providing a framework for what revenue you're going to be booking in 2014 for APOQUEL? And then third, for the PEDv vaccine. You mentioned 6 million sows is the opportunity. Could you just tell us the price of the vaccine? And I think it's given twice a year, but just remind us about that as well.
Juan Ramón Alaix: Thank you, Dave. And you are correct, it's 2x per year, maybe the first time, it's -- it can be an opportunity of 3 vaccines, but then the following years would be 2x. And the price of the PEDv vaccine, it's $7 -- about $7. The treatment choice, 3.5 each vaccine. In terms of APOQUEL for 2014, so we communicated that will be around 1% of our revenue. Our revenue, it's $4.5 billion or $4.7 billion. So we expect that we'll be around $40 million in terms of revenues. And this is only limited because of the supply availability. And then talking about the movement of animals and how long this movement will stay? Well, it depends on the price of the grain. So if the price of the grains are low, so the incentive of moving animals and keeping these animals in the feed lot with significant gains in terms of weight, I think, it will be an opportunity for maintaining this current situation. What we saw in 2014 is even the number of animals moving to the feed lot, maybe it will be slightly lower than the 2013 because they are less animals because they are keeping animals. Also to rebuild the herd, they have been moving animals at a younger age, which are lighter, more vulnerable to infections, more needs of vaccinations. And this has been having a positive impact in our revenues. We expect this situation of younger animals move to the feed lots will stay in the future, in 2015, because the price of feeding the animals remains very low and the profitability and the value of these animals is very high.
David Risinger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: That's great. And Paul, congrats again. My couple of questions for you are, first, when do you expect to get through the standup costs? Second, what is the FX hit to EPS that you're expecting in the fourth quarter? And then third, if the R&D tax credit is passed, what will the benefit be in the fourth quarter?
Paul S. Herendeen: Okay. In -- 2 out of the 3, I can answer. Thanks, David. Well, that question about when we'll be through the standup cost, I would expect to be substantially complete towards the latter part of 2015. Let's say, the end of 2015. We will continue to be flipping switches on our ERP implementation into 2016, but the lion share of the costs should be behind us after the year end 2015. The FX impact on -- at the net income line implied for Q4 is in the range of 100 to 150 basis points negative. And then the last question about the R&D credit in Q4, if it were to be passed, it will have an impact of approximately 50 basis points to the full year rate.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Holford of Jefferies.
Jeffrey Holford - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: I've got 2 for Paul, please. Firstly just on APOQUEL, just trying to think about contribution margins of this product as it gets towards the peak of $200 million to $300 million, which you just guided. I would assume that this is a very high margin product relative to the rest of the business, something more like a pharmaceutical contribution margin, probably -- possibly 50%, 60% or higher in terms of the operating level, if you can comment around that. And then just secondly, could you tell us if Zoetis has any kind of poison pill type measures as bid defenses? And if not, is the company intending to introduce these into 2015?
Juan Ramón Alaix: I couldn't get the second question. So it's...
Paul S. Herendeen: I'll get the second.
Juan Ramón Alaix: So let me answer the APOQUEL. So our gross margin, has risen to 65%. And we communicated that companion animal has the highest margins in our total portfolio, followed by cattle, then swine and the lowest is poultry. So even if we have not provided details of each species, you can extrapolate that with the 65% that companion animal, being the highest, it's -- APOQUEL has a good margin. And in terms of how much we need to invest to support these product launches. So what we said is that we have the infrastructure to support the promotional activities of any new products. And maybe in some cases, we need also to support this approach probably some additional advertising and promotion. But in our opinion, in the case of APOQUEL, the reaction of the market has been so positive that we don't think that we'll require any significant additional investment to support the objective that we have set for 2015 and also the long-term objective of $200 million to $300 million peak sales. And then Paul will answer the question on the poison pill.
Paul S. Herendeen: Yes. Yes, I'll answer the question by saying, with respect to your specific question around poison pill, no comment on that specifically. However, what I would say is, we're a public company. We're for sale every day and to the extend that someone were to come in and be interested and think they could do a better job with our collection of assets, there's certainly the opportunity for them to express that. What I would report back though is, we think we're the team to run this company. We're driving value for our shareholders. We're doing that by pulling all of the levers at our disposal which includes being maniacal about deploying capital both inside and, hopefully, outside of our business. And at the end of the day, if we deliver value, that's what we rely on to continue to be the fellows and ladies that run this company.
Operator: Our next question comes from Erin Wilson of Bank of America.
Erin E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Livestock growth was impressive. Can you break out what was attributable to volume, price and new products, such as the beta agonists? How sustainable kind of is that growth? And also with consolidating competitors, there could also be some opportunities to potentially fill some holes in your portfolio. What are areas that you would find particularly interesting for you, any specific therapeutic category?
Juan Ramón Alaix: Well, we, in my opinion -- thank you, Erin, for the question. I think, in my opinion, we have a very strong portfolio. I believe that, that is the strongest portfolio in the animal health industry. We have always opportunities to fill some gaps, but we don't have a strategic need to really cover areas, which are important for animal health, which are not part of our portfolio. We are very strong in vaccines. We are very strong in parasiticide. We are strong in also other therapeutic areas and definitely we'll be always assessing opportunities to add more products to our portfolio. But because we think that we have the infrastructure and we have the opportunity to achieve synergies in both revenues and also in terms of costs, by adding products or adding assets of our company, but not because we have a strategic need to fill any area where we feel that we are -- or represent a significant gap in our business. And in terms of the livestock growth, definitely it has been very strong growth. Volume has been the most important part of the growth. And price, we also mentioned that the price is in line with the industry. The industry in terms of price is growing around 3% and this is consistent with our growth in terms of price. So all the rest has been volume, so very strong performance in terms of volume. That is also the result of excellent portfolio and also excellent execution from our teams to bring this as well to the market.
Erin E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And as it relates to QUEL and the competing drug for Rimadyl, are there relationships with distributors that you could establish there and -- that would potentially help to win the competition there? And how big is opportunity for Versican? And is there an opportunity for that in the U.S.?
Juan Ramón Alaix: So we definitely partner with distributors that are also helping us to reach customers that we are not calling directly to our field force. And this partnership is working very well and I think it's something we are happy with the declaration that we are having with distributors. And we will continue really providing to them the products and also the kind of support that they need also to promote the products to customers that we are not directly targeting through our direct model.
Operator: And there are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Juan Ramón for any additional or closing remarks.
Juan Ramón Alaix: So thank you very much for joining today's call. And I'm looking forward to see you on November 18 in New York at the New York Stock Exchange, in where we'll have the opportunity to go into more details of our business model and also more details on our guidance for 2015 and also for the period of '15, '17. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. A replay of today's call will be available in 2 hours by dialing 1 (800) 723-2156, for U.S. listeners and area code (402) 220-2660 for international. Please disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Welcome to the Second Quarter 2014 Financial Results Conference Call and Webcast for Zoetis. Hosting the call today is John O'Connor, acting Head of Investor Relations for Zoetis. The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, and will not be forwarded automatically. In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately 2 hours after the conclusion of this call via dial-in or on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to John O'Connor. John, you may begin.
John O'Connor: Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to the Zoetis Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. I'm joined today by Juan Ramón Alaix, our Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn David, our Senior Vice President of Finance Operations and Acting Chief Financial Officer. Juan Ramón and Glenn will provide an overview of our quarterly results, and then we will open the call for your questions. Before we begin, let me remind you that the earnings press release and financial tables can be found on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. We are also providing a simultaneous webcast of this morning's call, which can be accessed on the website as well. A PDF version of today's slides and a transcript of the call will be available on the website later today. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statement in today's press release and our SEC filings, including our recent 10-K and 10-Qs. Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures which were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP adjusted figures exclude the impact of purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs, and certain significant items, such as the nonrecurring cost of becoming a standalone public company. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and in the company's 8-K filing dated today August 5, 2014. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. I also want to remind you that beginning last quarter, we realigned our segment reporting with respect to our Client Supply Services organization, or CSS, which provides contract manufacturing services for third parties. The revenue and earnings associated with CSS are now reported within other business activities, separate from the 4 reportable segments. In 2013, CSS results were reported in the EuAfME segment. With that, I will turn the call over to Juan Ramón.
Juan Ramón Alaix: Thank you, John, and thank you to those joining us for today's call. I would like to start by sharing high-level details of our performance for the second quarter. During this period, we delivered operational growth of 6% in revenues and 11% in adjusted net income or adjusted diluted EPS of $0.38. We also delivered operational revenue growth across each of our geographical segments in the quarter, reflecting the strength and balance of our diverse portfolio. This illustrates that our continued focus on building strong customer relationships, bringing new products to the market, while managing the product lifecycles and producing high-quality products and reliable supply, all remain fundamental strengths of our business and model. Let me now comment on the performance of our business by species. The performance of our livestock segment grew by 9%. Here, we see more favorable market conditions for many of our customers across the globe. Overall, worldwide demand for meat protein continues increasing, especially in emerging markets. In these markets, their objective is to increase their local production. But to meet their needs, they still depend on key export markets, such as the U.S. and Brazil, where we also have a significant presence. Additionally, feed costs continue to moderate for our customers. Nevertheless, conditions will remain difficult for some producers in certain markets in Asia Pacific and in Europe. And factors such as disease outbreaks and climate conditions are placing some limitations on how quickly our customers can expand protein production. These conditions reinforce the value of our medicines and technology for more efficient production. As producers work to supply greater volumes of meat protein by increasing cattle and swine slaughter weights, we expect to see continued strong demand for our products. Our global presence and breadth of portfolio positions -- so it is well to capitalize on these positive trends. Let me take a deeper dive into some of these individual species, starting with cattle, which grew 10% operationally. We delivered strong growth in all regions, most notably in the Canada/Latin American region, where we implemented new pricing strategies in a number of Latin American countries. Poultry delivered operational growth of 11%. All regions contributed to these, but particular in the U.S., where sales of our medicated feed additives and also vaccines delivered double-digit growth. In swine, PEDv has continued to spread, not only in the U.S., but also in Canada, Mexico, Japan, and a number of other countries. The virus is reducing the size of swine herds, and producers are working to offset these reductions by raising higher-weight animals. Additionally, our business has felt the impact of antibiotic regulations in Europe. In spite of these conditions, Zoetis is still the leader, based on growth of 5% in swine, thanks to introduction of new products. Moving now on to companion animal. We delivered 2% operational growth in the quarter. Sales of our canine product APOQUEL contributed to the growth in this sector, even as we continue to address our levels of supply for this product. I will talk a little bit more about APOQUEL later on this call. Overall, while growth fundamentals for companion animal remains strong in all countries, and particularly in emerging markets, we have seen an increase in competition in many of our larger developed markets. This is primarily from new product introductions in parasiticides and in vaccines. We are confident that the breadth of our portfolio, including new product launches, as well as the strength of our field force and our world-class capabilities in R&D, will enable us to stay competitive in this market. Across our business, we continue to see that the depth and the diversity of our portfolio plays a critical role in the overall performance of our company and also sustain our competitive advantage. The depth and diversity is demonstrated by our portfolio for multiple species across 5 therapeutic areas and by the 300 products marketed in 120 countries. As a result of this quarter's performance, and our forecast for the rest of the year, we are increasing the lower end of our guidance range for revenue, adjusted EPS and SG&A for the full year. Now, I would like to provide an update on our portfolio, and in particular, highlight our R&D progress and the latest for APOQUEL. Earlier, I spoke about the impact of PEDv on our business. Now, let me share with you some details of the progress that we are making on developing a vaccine for this disease, where we have 2 programs. Our most advanced program is for an inactivated or kill vaccine. On this, we are working closely with the USDA and expect to request approval for a conditional license in 2014. Following any approval, we anticipate that we will be able to supply the markets soon after. We also continued our work with Iowa State University on an additional vaccine approach. We are making good progress and will provide updates of this program as the research evolves. Finally, we continue working with the University of Minnesota for a PEDv diagnostic test and this type of test will help producers to rapidly identify potential infections in their herds. The result from these research programs will also have applicability outside of the U.S. We are exploring regulatory approaches to enhance the reach of these potential products in all the affected markets. This quarter, we secured regulatory approval and launched ACTOGAIN. This ractopamine product for the use in cattle, alone or in combination with other commonly used medicated feed additives. This in addition to our already-strong cattle portfolio. The approval of ACTOGAIN builds on the success of the launch of ENGAIN, also a ractopamine product, which was approved and recently launched for use in swine. Both ACTOGAIN and ENGAIN are performing better than expected. This performance is in part driven by the removal of a competing product from the market. And finally, to our progress with APOQUEL. As you will remember, this is an innovative medicine designed to relieve dogs from pruritus. We launched the product in the U.S. and in a number of European markets early this year and have seen significant levels of customer demand for the product. This has resulted in a supply shortage. Our priorities at this point are to ensure that dogs currently being treated with APOQUEL continue to receive their product without interruption and to normalize the product supply as soon as possible. As noted on our last call, the process to produce APOQUEL is complex. We are working to reduce the length of time it takes to manufacture the product and to add manufacturing capacity. By April, next year, we expect to significantly increase the supply of APOQUEL, and as a result, we'll be able to begin offering APOQUEL to new customers. Based on our current market demand, the introduction of the product in new markets, and our plans to increase supply, we now expect the product to generate in excess of $100 million in revenues next year. And before I ask Glenn to walk us through the financials, I would like to highlight our coming Investor Day. This will take place on November 18 at The New York Stock Exchange. We're very excited to be able to host this event and look forward to having the opportunity to share with you more details of our strategy, capabilities and value propositions, as well as the overall animal healthcare industry. And with that, Glenn?
Glenn David: Thank you, Juan Ramón. Let me start today with a review of the second quarter results and then discuss our guidance for full year 2015. Turning first to the income statement slide. For the second quarter, revenue was approximately $1.2 billion, an increase of 4% year-over-year. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of 2 percentage points on revenue, primarily due to the impact of currencies in Brazil, Australia, Argentina and Canada, which were partially offset by improvements in the euro and sterling. As a result, operational growth, excluding the impact of currency, was 6%. Reported net income was $136 million or $0.27 per diluted share, and adjusted net income was $189 million or $0.38 per diluted share, representing growth of 6% on a reported basis and 11% operationally. Adjusted net income for the quarter excludes the after-tax impact of $53 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, for purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs, and certain significant items, the majority of which were related to stand-up cost. Certain significant items this quarter also include a one-time charge related to a commercial settlement with customers in Mexico. This settlement is with several of our large poultry customers in Mexico. It is associated with certain shipments from specific lots of poultry vaccine products, and we have moved ahead with a recall of these lots. No other countries or lots are impacted. We have recorded a reserve associated with this issue in the second quarter of $13 million. I will discuss the impact of this settlement on our reported guidance in a few minutes. Let's now turn to our adjusted income statement slide, which I will discuss primarily on an operational basis. Again, operational revenue growth for the second quarter was 6%. In terms of the first half of the year, we reported revenue growth of 2%, with operational growth of 5%. This reflects an impact on reported revenue of approximately $55 million due to foreign exchange. Based on current rates, we expect the impact from foreign exchange for the remaining 2 quarters will be minimal. Turning to more revenue details in the second quarter. Companion animal sales were 38% of sales in the quarter and grew $7 million or 2% operationally. Livestock sales were 61% of sales in the quarter and grew $57 million or 9% operationally. Adjusted cost of sales grew operationally by 4%, 2 points lower than operational sales growth. Adjusted cost of sales was 35% of revenue, versus 35.9% in the year ago quarter, due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange and the benefit of price increases, which were partially offset by unfavorable mix. For the first half of the year, our adjusted cost of sales grew operationally by 1% and was 34.6% of revenue. As we said last quarter, we continue to expect our cost of sales to increase as a percent of revenue in the remaining quarters and bring us in line with the full year guidance of approximately 35.5%, which we are reaffirming today. This dynamic reflects the recognition of additional costs from building a global manufacturing and supply organization, which will be most evident in the second half of the year, as well as our expectation that foreign exchange will not have as favorable an impact on gross margin as it did in the first half of the year. Meanwhile, adjusted SG&A increased by 9% operationally in the second quarter. As we have said, in the first 2 quarters of 2013, we were still building out many of the corporate functions needed to support Zoetis as an independent public company. We largely completed this process in the third quarter of last year and this unfavorable comparison is a driver of SG&A growth in the second quarter of 2014. We also saw elevated growth in operating expenses in the U.S., EuAfME, and CLAR segments in the quarter as well. As part of our normal course of business, we continue to adjust investments and promotional activities to respond to market opportunities. Year-to-date, SG&A was 30.6% of revenue, consistent with our full year guidance, which is approximately 31% at the midpoints of both SG&A and revenue. In other items, adjusted R&D expense increased 1% operationally. Interest expense declined $3 million in the quarter and adjusted other income was $3 million in the quarter, similar to last year. Our effective adjusted tax rate for the second quarter was 28.4%. And again, our adjusted net income was $189 million, representing reported growth of 6%, and operational growth of 11%. Now on to our segment results. I will discuss these on an operational basis, but it should be noted that segment earnings are pretax numbers and presented on an adjusted basis. I will also highlight some of the more significant foreign exchange impacts in the regional results. Beginning with the U.S., second quarter revenue was $459 million, an increase of 5%. Sales of livestock products grew 10%, with contributions across cattle, poultry and swine. Cattle products showed a significant increase based on improved market conditions from the year ago quarter. Cattle prices have continued to rise, with feed cost remaining low. While we have seen the number of placements declining, customers are placing younger, lighter animals into feed lots. And these cattle are more vulnerable to illness and disease and require treatment. This dynamic, along with continued growth in market share, has contributed to growth in our U.S. cattle business despite lower overall placements in the quarter. We saw poultry product growth driven by new vaccines, such as the Georgia 08 vaccine, as well as growth in medicated feed additives. And in swine products, we benefited from continued growth in new products, such as our PCV M. hyo combination vaccine, DRAXXIN 25 anti-infective and ENGAIN feed additive. This new product momentum was tempered by the effect of PEDv, which Juan Ramón addressed. Sales of companion animal products grew 1%. This was driven by sales of APOQUEL, which was partially offset by declines from an increased competition in vaccines and RIMADYL. Meanwhile, U.S. segment earnings increased by 2%, as growth in revenue was offset by higher expenses, primarily due to promotional investments. For the first half of the year in the U.S., we had revenue growth of 5% and earnings growth of 10%. This is more indicative of the leverage that we expect in the U.S. than the second quarter results. Now turning to our Europe, Africa and Middle East region, or EuAfME. In EuAfME, second quarter revenue was $284 million, an increase of 4% operationally. Reported revenue growth was 7%, reflected a positive impact of 3 percentage points in the quarter due to the strength of the euro and sterling. Sales of livestock products increased 5% operationally, as the region experienced more positive results in Germany, the U.K. and Spain than in the first quarter, but this was slightly offset by declines in France. The livestock growth was primarily driven by increased sales in cattle and poultry products, which were slightly offset by a decline in swine products for the quarter. While weather conditions across Europe were generally more favorable than the prior year, growth in livestock was limited in the U.K. and Scandinavia by severe flooding, which affected seasonal herd movements. Meanwhile, sales of companion animal products grew 2% operationally, primarily due to sales of APOQUEL in the U.K. and Germany, and growth in emerging markets. This companion animal growth was somewhat offset by declines in France and Southern Europe due to increased competition in parasiticides. EuAfME segment earnings increased 9% operationally, primarily due to the revenue increase and higher gross margins, which were partially offset by higher operating expenses. Turning to our Canada and Latin America segment, or CLAR. Second quarter revenue was $214 million, an increase of 11% operationally. Reported revenue growth was flat, reflecting a negative impact of 11 percentage points in the quarter, primarily due to depreciation of currencies in Brazil, Argentina and Canada. Overall for the segment, sales of livestock products grew 13% operationally and sales of companion animal products grew 6% operationally. The CLAR segment results were largely driven by the region's 2 largest markets, Brazil and Canada, while price growth for livestock products in high inflation markets, such as Venezuela and Argentina, also made significant contributions to growth in the quarter. In Brazil, growth was driven primarily by sales of cattle and poultry products, as well as companion animal products. Meanwhile, the company generated increased sales of cattle products in Canada, as higher prices for cattle led to increased treatments. Canada also saw an increase in sales of swine products, such as anti-infectives and vaccines, while it posted a slight decline in poultry products. CLAR segment earnings increased 16% on an operational basis, driven by revenue growing at a faster rate than operating expenses. In Asia Pacific, or APAC, second quarter sales were $185 million, an increase of 5% operationally. Our APAC segment also felt a significant impact due to depreciation from currencies in Australia, Japan, India and other countries, which led to a negative 6 percentage point impact on revenue. Sales of livestock products grew 7% operationally, driven primarily by sales of cattle products in New Zealand and Australia, growth of swine products in China and growth of poultry products in Australia and India. This growth was offset by declines in Japan and Korea. In Australia, we saw an increase in the movement of herds to feedlots, which benefited our business as treatments increased. However, climate conditions remain difficult, and we expect the higher feedlot activity to lead to reduce herd sizes in the coming quarters. Sales of companion animal products increased 1% operationally, largely due to an increase in equine products in Australia, which was offset by declines in companion animal products in Japan. APAC segment operating earnings increased 11% operationally, due to revenue growth, a decline in operating expenses and slightly favorable gross margin. Now let me turn to guidance for the full year 2014. We have now reported 1/2 of the fiscal year and remained confident in our ability to deliver on our full year financial guidance. As a result, we are narrowing our financial guidance for revenue, adjusted SG&A, and adjusted EPS for full year 2014, and making an adjustment to our reported EPS guidance. We have raised the lower end of our revenue guidance, and now expect reported revenue of approximately $4.675 billion to $4.75 billion for the full year. Our guidance on adjusted cost of goods sold for full year 2014 remains approximately 35.5% of revenue, roughly flat year-over-year. This reflects the anticipated benefit of price, volume and ongoing cost-savings efforts, which is forecasted to be offset by the full year impact of cost incurred to build our global manufacturing and supply functions, as well as unfavorable mix. The incremental cost will be reflected primarily in the second half of 2014. Adjusted SG&A expenses are now expected to be between $1.44 billion and $1.48 billion. Adjusted R&D expenses are expected to be between $390 million and $405 million. We continue to expect our effective tax rate on adjusted income to be approximately 29%. This guidance does not reflect the potential extension of the U.S. R&D tax credit. And we have raised the lower end of our adjusted EPS guidance and now expect adjusted EPS of between $1.50 and $1.54 per share for the full year. Please note that our guidance does not reflect any further currency devaluation in Venezuela. This guidance reflects our ability to achieve our profitability targets as we absorb multiple headwinds in 2014, including: The incremental costs of standing up our global manufacturing and supply operations; unfavorable comparisons in corporate function expense; and an additional month of higher interest expense. Separately, we now estimate pretax charges for 2014 of between $175 million and $195 million, primarily related to stand-up and acquisition-related cost. This range has increased due to the commercial settlement charge related to Mexico that I mentioned earlier. These charges are excluded from our adjusted earnings guidance. Including the impact of these items, as well as purchase accounting adjustments, our guidance for reported diluted EPS for full year 2014 will now be between $1.16 and $1.20 per share, a change from the $1.15 to $1.21 range we had previously set. This annual guidance reflects our confidence in the diversity of our portfolio, the strength of our business model and our view of the evolving market conditions for animal health products this year. Our long-term value proposition remains anchored in 3 objectives: to grow revenue in line with or faster than the market; to grow adjusted net income faster than revenue; and to find investment opportunities with strong returns to our business and return excess capital to our shareholders. That concludes my prepared remarks, and now we will open the line for your questions. John?
John O'Connor: Thank you, Glenn. Operator, first question, please?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets.
Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: First, on your vaccine -- on your PED vaccine. Will you have a competitive advantage in getting this vaccine to the market? If you could just give us a better sense as to where the competitors are and what kind of commercial opportunity are we looking at? And a quick follow-up, if I may, I'm not sure if I understand it, Ramón, correctly on APOQUEL. Did I hear you correctly in saying that you expect to have supply to the market, increased supply to the market, later this year? Or is it still a 2015 expectation?
Juan Ramón Alaix: Alex, it's Juan Ramón Alaix. So let me start confirming that for APOQUEL, we expect that to normalize supply next year in April. And at that time, I will be able to supply more product to new customers. On the first question, on the PEDv, so we have a program now that we expect to complete soon and to submit that to the FDA, a conditional -- license for conditional approval. And there is one vaccine already in the market covering this disease. And we expect that our vaccine also will cover the needs of swine producers to protect animals against this outbreak and its high significant impact on their herds.
John O'Connor: Operator, next question, please?
Operator: Certainly. We'll next go to Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group.
Mark J. Schoenebaum - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: My question on the business is maybe on use of cash, if I may. In your last slide, where you kind of summed up the 3 big priorities, I suppose, for the next 5 years. The last one is to find profitable investment opportunities and return excess capital to shareholders. So I was wondering, we haven't seen a lot of M&A yet at Zoetis. So I'm wondering why that is? And if we should expect the pace to pick up? And then the follow-up on that is the dividend. I don't think we've seen much of a dividend raise since you guys have spun out of Pfizer. So I was wondering if just philosophically, you could talk to us and maybe help set expectations, what we should expect about the rate of dividend increases.
Juan Ramón Alaix: Mark, on the first question on M&A, so in 2013, that it was the first year of Zoetis as an independent company. We were focused on standing up our operations and then, we decided that maybe it was not the right time for us to consider on M&A activity. We are now that -- we have, in most of the cases, completed our infrastructure, with the exception of IT. We think that we can now consider M&A opportunity that the market brings to us. And we'll be active pursuing these opportunities. We know that because of our size and our market share, we may face some challenge in terms of antitrust. This will incorporate it in our analysis, but definitely, we will consider any opportunity that will match our strategic objective, and also will provide the return on the investment.
Glenn David: Mark, related to your question on dividends. So today, we have increased our dividend. And subject to board approval, we do expect to grow the dividend at a rate that is equal to or faster than our growth in adjusted net income.
John O'Connor: Operator, next question please?
Operator: Certainly. We'll take a question now from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.
Jessica M. Fye - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: It's Jessica Fye on for Chris. A question on gross margin, just as we're starting to think about next year. Can you just remind us how much of your manufacturing Pfizer still does? And how we should think about the impact of that, I think there's some manufacturing royalty kicking in for the product they supply you with next year? And then maybe also just following up on Mark's question on M&A. We're seeing a number of tax inversion transactions across the space and just would like to hear your views on whether that will be of interest to Zoetis.
Juan Ramón Alaix: So in terms of M&A, also, this tax inversion opportunity, we will continue to exploring any opportunity that will provide reduction in terms of effective tax rate, something that definitely we will see the opportunities the market -- that exist in the market. And we will decide based on these opportunities. On the gross margin, I will ask Glenn to respond to your question.
Glenn David: So in terms of gross margin for 2015 and specifically to the impact of the Pfizer MSA. So when we looked at the potential impact of the Pfizer MSA, that it might have in 2015. Based on 2013 costs and volumes, we expected it to have about a $30 million negative impact on cost of goods going into 2015. We've taken a lot of actions to minimize that impact, and those actions have resulted in reducing that exposure by about 1/2. However, since then, a number of those products, APOQUEL being one of them, have had growth in volume. So it will limit our ability to bring the $30 million down fully, but we have taken many actions to minimize the impact.
John O'Connor: Operator, next question, please?
Operator: Certainly. Our next question comes from Kevin Ellich from Piper Jaffray.
Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: First off, we've seen some pretty strong livestock trends, especially in the U.S. Just wondering if you can keep up kind of the high single-digit, low double-digit growth in the U.S.? And then second, regarding your operating cost, and you have a direct sales model, especially in the U.S. Just wondering if there's any ability for you guys to leverage the operating cost by maybe laying on distributors and using some of the national distributors more to minimize or drive some more leverage in the model.
Juan Ramón Alaix: On the performance on livestock, definitely on the second quarter, we reported very strong growth. We see that the demand for animal proteins remained very strong in the worldwide market. We also see that the profitability of livestock producers -- it's now very high. They have high price of the meat, low prices for input, which increases significantly the profitability. And this is also driving the willingness of livestock producers to increase the herd, to supply all the market demand. We don't see any change in the near future, so we expect that the livestock market will continue growing in the future. In terms of our direct sales model, so we are convinced that the demand generation model that we have, which means that our own field force and also our own group of veterinarians are interacting directly with customers. And this interaction is generating very strong demand and very strong support to our portfolio. In the U.S., we combined our direct efforts with partnership with distributors, for those customers that we don't have the reach because of economical conditions. And we see that this model is working very well, and we'll continue supporting our product portfolio through this direct interaction, and also with the combination and partnership with some of our distributors that will reach these smaller customers.
John O'Connor: Operator, next question, please?
Operator: Certainly. Our next question comes from Louise Chen with Guggenheim.
Louise Alesandra Chen - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division: So first question I had was on SG&A leverage. What is your ideal level of SG&A leverage and when do you expect to get there after you finish this Pfizer separation? And then second question I had was, we've seen a number of development-stage, companion animal health companies starting up. I'm just curious, your thoughts on the unmet needs these companies address and if there's potential partnership opportunities here?
Glenn David: So this is Glenn. I'll address the SG&A question. In terms of the SG&A leverage, so the way we think about this is, in 2014 in particular, we have indicated that we do have incremental expenses related to building up our corporate functions, and that is increasing the level of growth we expect in SG&A this year. However, over the long term, we do expect to grow SG&A in line with inflation, while being able to grow our revenue at a pace faster than the market, which will continue to improve our margins going forward.
Juan Ramón Alaix: Okay, the other question was about these biopharma companies and potential partnerships. Well, I think it's -- we have already the infrastructure, also the reach to customers. And we have developed, over time, a very strong model in terms of direct sales to customers. And we are convinced that this model also can benefit smaller companies that will have maybe problems that will be covering and managing [ph] the market, but without the infrastructure to reach customers. So we will consider this kind of partnership with these companies.
John O'Connor: Operator, next question, please?
Operator: Our next question comes from John Kreger with William Blair.
John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: I think you mentioned on the call that your parasiticide class within companion animal saw some pressure in the quarter. Can you just expand on that a little bit? Did it actually decline? And if so, maybe you could quantify it? And do you have anything in your pipeline that might cause this trend to be able to reverse in the coming year or so?
Juan Ramón Alaix: Well, our parasiticide franchise in companion animal didn't decline in the quarter, but the growth was affected by the entrance of new competitors. There have been 2 new competitors launching new parasiticides, oral parasiticides, and we have seen that the market dynamics in parasiticides are changing, and moving from the traditional parasiticides that there were topical to more attention to oral parasiticides. We also have programs in this area and we expect to launch these products, oral parasiticides for companion animals, in the future.
John O'Connor: Operator, next question please?
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Willoughby with Bank of America.
Erin E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: This is Erin Wilson in for Bob. Follow up to the SG&A expense question and the leverage of that metric going forward. What can be addressed or corrected near term or can be considered one-time in nature? And outside of some of those items, can you call out where you have made progress on this line as it relates to your separation from Pfizer? And I guess the second question then, similar would be -- can you just speak to the competition in U.S. companion animal in light of the increased promotional spending that you've called out. Why is it such a light trend in companion animal?
Glenn David: Sure. So in terms of the SG&A and items that might be considered one-time in nature, I think the key item is what we've been highlighting in terms of the buildup of our corporate enabling functions and the timing of which that ramped up and when those costs were most debited in the P&L. So in 2013, in the first half of the year, we were not running at our full cost base for our enabling functions and that corrected in the second half, and that's driving the difficulty in comparison year-over-year. Some of the areas that you have seen have significant improvement though year-over-year, I think when you look at the growth in our regions and our segments, you've seen very strong IBT growth or income growth in those regions, demonstrating continued focus on managing -- or on our expenses.
Juan Ramón Alaix: Maybe a comment on the competition in the U.S. and also details on the promotional activities that we conducted in the second quarter. Definitely, as I said during my remarks and also the remarks of Glenn, we have seen introduction of new parasiticides, also introduction of new vaccines and the introduction of generic competition to a product which is important in our portfolio, which is RIMADYL. And in terms of the additional investment in promotional activities in the quarter, I think it's only a question of pacing. If you take year-to-date, you would see that the investment in the year has been in line with our projections of growing promotional activities below the growth in terms of revenues.
John O'Connor: Operator, next question, please?
Operator: Our next question comes from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.
Christopher J. Benassi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: This is Christopher Benassi on behalf of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Since the IPO, investors have believed in the story of continued improvement in Zoetis' margins. However, we are curious as to where you might see room for further margin improvement, possibly in SG&A, R&D or maybe even across the board.
Glenn David: In terms of where we see continued improvement. So R&D, I think, is one item that you've highlighted. We've seen growth in R&D that's been sort of in the low-single digits, while we still continue to be very effective with our R&D productivity. From an SG&A perspective, as well as a cost of goods perspective, we do continue to see areas for improvement. So as I mentioned, SG&A, we do expect to grow in line with inflation. And cost of goods, we're clearly focused on continuing to find areas to improve our cost of goods and expect incremental improvements in COGS going forward.
John O'Connor: Operator, next question, please?
Operator: Our next question comes from Ross Taylor with CL King.
Ross Taylor - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division: I just had a couple of questions related to the PEDv vaccine you have in development. But for a conditional approval, what kind of efficacy data do you have to present to the regulators to receive a conditional approval? And I also wondered how much does a conditional approval limit appeal or uptake of this product once it does reach the market?
Juan Ramón Alaix: So in terms of the regulatory requirements for conditional approval for a vaccine, so we need to demonstrate safety of the vaccine and also efficacy in certain conditions. And the requirements for efficacy for a conditional license are lower than the efficacy requirements for a full license. In terms of the selling opportunities of a vaccine under conditional approval, I think it's something that, since the vaccine, in this case, will be responding to a real market need, we don't see that this will create any limitations. There will be some limitations in terms of promotional activities, but not limitations in terms of selling the product to the market.
John O'Connor: Operator, next question, please?
Operator: We now have a follow-up from Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray.
Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Following up on the PEDv comments, I'm just wondering, Juan Ramón, in your prepared remarks, you talked about how hog farmers are growing larger animals, even though we've seen, I guess, some pressure on the herd sizes. And I'm just wondering if your new product, ENGAIN, is helping to -- if you've seen some good uptake because of this? And if you could quantify that also? And then Glenn David, the tax rate was lower on a year-over-year basis. Just wondering what we could expect? And I also wanted to clarify, did you say your tax guidance does not include the R&D tax credits?
Juan Ramón Alaix: The follow-up question on PEDv, so definitely, ENGAIN, it's helping producers to have a more efficiency in terms of food. So they are reaching feed efficiencies because of this product. This product is also a product that already exists in the market, it's ractopamine. And we think that the product that are released [ph] in the market, together with ENGAIN, is helping the producers to achieve the targeted weight, with lowered cost in terms of food.
Glenn David: And in terms of the tax rates. So the tax rate was lower in the quarter at 28.4%. We have reaffirmed our guidance of approximately 29% for the year, and we still believe the full year is the best view of our overall tax rate. And just to emphasize it, that does not include the R&D tax credit, which would lower our rate by approximately 50 basis points.
John O'Connor: Operator, next question, please?
Operator: Next we have a follow-up from Robert Willoughby with Bank of America.
Erin E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: This is Erin again. A quick follow-up. There has been some recent changes, or recently announced upcoming changes, in the companion animal diagnostics market in the U.S., with IDEXX Laboratories moving to a direct distribution model. Do you see this as an opportunity for you? What -- and just generally speaking, what is your underlying growth rate for your diagnostics business?
Juan Ramón Alaix: So we remain committed to diagnostics. We see diagnostics as very complementary to our current business, in both R&D and also commercial. And we are trying to build our portfolio in terms of diagnostics. And the change on IDEXX in terms of direct model, it's something that we will not comment on the strategy of our competitors, but definitely, we'll explore any opportunity that will further penetrate our diagnostic depth into the market.
John O'Connor: Operator, next question, please?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll now go to a follow-up from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets.
Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Sorry if you addressed this earlier, had to hop off for a minute. But what can we expect for your November Investor Day? If you could just frame that for us. Can we look for something like a 5-year outlook? If you could just give us more color as to what we can see from you.
Juan Ramón Alaix: So we're working on the details of the agenda that we will communicate to you in the near future. So one of the objectives that we have during this day is to provide much more details on our strategy. Also have the opportunity to provide this information in terms of commercial, in terms of manufacturing, in terms of R&D, from members of my leadership team, that will go into some detail that may have not been provided until now. And in terms of the outlook, we are considering what should be the details that we will provide in terms of the outlook, and we are still considering different timeframes that will be information that we'll be sharing with you at that time. The other objective is also to go into some additional details on the animal healthcare market, to have much more clarity in terms of projections of the market and also the opportunities for both livestock and companion animals.
John O'Connor: Operator, are there any other questions?

John O’Connor: Thank you. Good morning and welcome to the Zoetis first quarter 2014 earnings call. I’m joined today by Juan Ramon Alaix, our Chief Executive Officer, and Glenn David, our Senior Vice President of Finance Operations and acting Chief Financial Officer. Juan Ramon and Glenn will provide an overview our quarterly results and then we will open the call for your questions. Before we begin, let me remind you that the earnings press release and financial tables can be found on the Investor Relations section of Zoetis.com. We are also providing a simultaneous webcast of this morning’s call which can be accessed on the website as well. A PDF version of today’s slides and a transcript of the call will be available on the website later today. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statement in today’s press release and our SEC filings, including but not limited to our 2013 10-K and 10-Qs. Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures which were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP adjusted figures exclude the impact of purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs, and certain significant items such as the non-recurring cost of becoming a standalone public company. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our press release and in the company’s 8-K filing dated today, May 6, 2014. We also cite operational results which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. Prior to the completion of our IPO last year, Zoetis was not an independent public company and the first quarter of 2013 includes results from periods that were derived from the consolidated financial statements and records of Pfizer, which can make comparisons difficult in certain instances.  With that, I will turn the call over to Juan Ramon.
Juan Ramon Alaix: Thank you, John. Hello everyone. Before moving into some of the details of our call today, I would first like to address a recent change in the company’s executive team. On April 22, we announced that Glenn David, Senior Vice President of Finance Operations was named the company’s acting Chief Financial Officer. I’m delighted that Glenn is here with me on today’s call and he will speak with you as we move through the details of our first quarter performance. But first, let me share some of the highlights from the quarter, beginning with our high level financials. We concluded the first quarter with revenue growth of 1% or 4% operational. Adjusted net income for the first quarter was $191 million or $0.38 per diluted shares, increases of 7% and 6% compared to the first quarter of 2013. As a result and due to our ability to successfully navigate multiple headwinds in the first quarter, we are reaffirming our guidance for revenue and adjusted net income for the full year 2014.  At the species level, we delivered 6% operational growth in companion animals and 4% operational growth in livestock. The 6% growth in companion animals was driven by a strong performance in Latin American countries due to the continued increase in the medicalization rates and the positive impact of our new canine product, Apoquel, in the U.S., U.K., and Germany. Companion animal sales in the quarter were affected by the cold weather in the U.S. which reduced the number of pet owner visits to veterinarian clinics. In livestock, sales of our swine portfolio grew by 6%. This growth was tempered by the continued spread of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, or PEDv, especially in the United States. Our poultry portfolio performed well, also growing by 6% in the U.S. Our Rotecc product which enhances our ability to deliver solutions focused on sound rotation principles for coccidiosis management, has been an important driver of this performance. Avian flu in some markets continued to impact the poultry industry. In cattle, we delivered operational growth of 13%. Performance in the U.S. and in Latin America was strong while performance in Australia and some European markets declined.  I would now like to share with you some of the performance highlights for our four regions. In Asia Pacific, we delivered operational revenue growth of 4%. Revenue for the region’s emerging markets grew by 14%, offsetting a decline in the more developed markets. We remain confident that for the full year, operational growth for the region will be faster than the average of Zoetis. Despite positive performance in Japan, New Zealand and China, sales of companion animal products declined by 2%. This was mainly due to the timing and price and promotional activities in Australia, a market that represents 36% of our companion animal revenue in the Asia Pacific region. In livestock, our business grew by 7%. The strong revenue growth in countries like China and India was partially offset by the negative growth in Japan, New Zealand and Australia. In Australia, it was due to the ongoing conditions of the weather in the market. Our business in Canada-Latin America delivered operational growth of 10% with companion animals and livestock growing 15% and 9%. Companion animal growth in the region was driven by the continued increase in the medicalization rates in the majority of the Latin American countries and the positive results in Canada. In livestock, we delivered strong performance in our poultry business in Brazil, Mexico, Venezuela, and Peru. Here demand for our medicated feed additives was particularly strong. We saw positive performance of our cattle business with strong contributions from Venezuela, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay.  Our business in Europe-Africa-Middle East declined by 4% operationally. This performance was primarily associated with the declines of our livestock product sales, which Glenn will cover in his remarks. During the first quarter of 2014, the companion animal business in EuAfME grew by 1% thanks to the successful launch of Apoquel in the U.K., Germany and certain other markets. In addition, we saw a positive response to our promotional activity for our parasiticide portfolio in France, Italy and several emerging markets in the region. We also saw additional competition for our vaccines and (indiscernible). Livestock sales in the region declined 6% operationally. Despite this decline, we saw positive performance of the cattle business in southern Europe and in some emerging markets in the region. Now to the U.S., where the business grew by 6%. This result was driven by a number of factors. First in companion animals, the business grew by 18%. Here we saw the positive impact of the launch of Apoquel which partially offset the impact of cold weather conditions that reduced the number of visits by pet owners to veterinarian clinics. Then in livestock in the U.S., we delivered 7% growth. This was positively impacted by the performance of our cattle business which was due in part to a higher number of feed lot placements, the higher price of (indiscernible), and the cold weather that increased demand for respiratory vaccines and antibiotics. We are encouraged by signs of the U.S. cattle being rebuilt after drought conditions (indiscernible). Poultry in the U.S. continued its strong performance. Many factors have contributed to this growth. These include our Rotecc program mentioned previously and the successful introduction of our conditionally licensed Georgia 08 vaccine, and in addition we have seen growth in our (indiscernible) poultry vaccine line.  Our swine business in the U.S. continued to be impacted by the ongoing spread of PEDv. As a result of the virus, the USDA forecasts a reduction in the size of the U.S. swine herd of approximately 10%. Despite this, we delivered growth due to the positive performance of the products that we introduced in 2013, such as Draxxin 25 and Engain.  As in previous quarters, the business of both our producers and veterinarian customers continued to feel the impact of a number of external factors such as weather and disease outbreaks. These factors have a degree of impact on our own performance given the nature of the direct relationships that we have with our customers. On climate, customers in the markets in the southern hemisphere such as Australia and New Zealand have continued to be adversely affected by the drought conditions. These conditions negative impact our livestock business due to the pressure they place on producers to feed and maintain large herds. In the northern hemisphere, a very cold winter has negatively impacted our customers. In our livestock business, these conditions created an increased need for anti-infective vaccines. In our companion animal business, it had reduced the number of visits being made to vet clinics in the quarter. While these conditions have been particularly harsh and extreme in some markets, they are the reality that our customers face on an ongoing basis. Moving now to disease outbreaks, the spread of PEDv that we have talked about previously continues. During the last quarter, PEDv has continued to spread into the U.S. as well as in Mexico and Canada. In the U.S., 30 states have now confirmed at least one case of PEDv and reports suggest that approximately half of the U.S. sow population has been infected. In Mexico, the virus has reportedly infected nearly a third of swine herds. The virus has also continued to be active in Asia Pacific with active cases present in a range of new markets, including Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. These add to instances of the virus having been reported in China, Thailand the Philippines. Herds are being hit hard by the outbreak and fewer piglets are surviving.  With higher prices being paid for swine herds when they go to the market, we believe that producers may now be investing more in keeping those still in their herds healthy. This means that they will likely turn to premium products to achieve a greater return of investment from growing pigs, especially as market prices for pork products continue to increase. At Zoetis, we have advanced our research efforts to understand the safety, efficacy and manufacturing of an effective vaccine candidate. This is in partnership with Iowa State University and we continue to make progress in pursuit of a diagnostic tool in collaboration with the University of Minnesota. We are actively monitoring the continued evolution of the PEDv outbreak on the swine industry as well as any impact in our revenues.  One of the core characteristics of our business is the depth and diversity of our product portfolio. This enables us to actively minimize the challenge created by any given species, geography, therapeutic area, or product. As we have shared with you previously, our R&D effort is focused not only on the development of new products but also the life cycle development and continuous improvement of all our brand assets. During the first quarter of 2014, we continued to secure regulatory approvals for existing products that have been introduced into new geographies or that have their indications or claim extended. Furthermore, during the first quarter we launched a number of new products. This includes Bovishield Gold Oneshot, Fostera PCV, Fostera PRRS in Canada, Latin America and Thailand. Also on the topic of new products, I will provide a brief update on Apoquel.  Apoquel is an historic product for Zoetis and also for the industry. It joins our portfolio of already gold standard products and industry-leading brands across species and will have a positive impact on our business moving forward. In the first quarter, we continued to see high levels of customer acceptance for this innovative new treatment. The product was launched in the U.S., U.K., Germany, and certain other markets. The strong demand we have seen for the product has exceeded our initial expectations and has been generated by customers switching faster than anticipated from existing treatment options to Apoquel.  The manufacturing process for Apoquel is complex and lengthy. This means that our ability to significantly ramp up production quickly to meet the high level of demand is limited. As a result, there are some restrictions on stock availability. To ensure that dog currently on Apoquel continue to receive treatment, we are allocating current product availability to those patients. Based on current reactions, we expect the situation to be normalized by the end of the first quarter 2015 and for Apoquel to represent approximately 1% of revenue by the end of 2014.  Moving now to the close of my remarks. First, let me say that I see our overall performance for the first quarter of 2014 as positive. This is because we delivered operational growth in revenue of 4% and in adjusted net income of 8% while absorbing multiple headwinds. Second, Zoetis remains committed to its full-year guidance number on revenues and EPS previously provided. Our revenue growth for the year is in line or faster than expected market growth, now that the (indiscernible) has reduced their industry outlook for 2014. They now expect growth to be at the rate of around 2% in nominal U.S. dollar terms and around 5% in constant currency terms. With that, thank you for your attention and I will now ask Glenn to walk us through the financial results. Glenn?
Glenn David: Thank you, Juan Ramon. It’s a pleasure to be here today and to join you as acting Chief Financial Officer. As some of you know, I have been working with Juan Ramon since 2011 when I joined the Pfizer animal health business, and I’ve been part of the Zoetis earnings process for the last year in my role as Senior Vice President of Finance Operations. Let me start today with a review of the first quarter results and then discuss our guidance for full-year 2014. Turning to the income statement slide, for the first quarter revenue was approximately $1.1 billion, an increase of 1% year-over-year including a negative impact of 3 percentage points from foreign exchange, so operational growth excluding currency was 4%. Reported net income was $155 million or $0.31 per diluted share and adjusted net income was $191 million or $0.38 per diluted share, representing growth of 7% and 6% respectively. Adjusted net income for the quarter excludes the after-tax impact of $36 million or $0.07 per diluted share for purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs, and certain significant items.  Let’s now turn to our adjusted net income statement slide, which I will discuss primarily on an operational basis. Again, operational revenue growth was 4%. Companion animal sales were 35% of sales in the quarter and grew $12 million or 3%. Livestock sales were 64% of sales in the quarter and grew $28 million or 4%. The remaining 1% of sales is attributed to client supply services which was realigned this quarter. I will explain more about that in a minute. Adjusted cost of sales declined operationally by about 2% due to the impact of unfavorable items in the prior year’s quarter. Adjusted cost of sales was 34.2% of revenue versus 36.5% in the year-ago quarter, reflecting the operational decline in cost of sales as well as a 50 basis point benefit in the current quarter from foreign exchange. We expect our cost of sales to increase as a percent of revenue in the remaining quarters, particularly in the second half of the year, and bring us in line with the full-year guidance we are reaffirming today. This reflects the recognition of additional costs from building our global manufacturing and supply organization which will be most evident in the second half of the year, as well as our expectation that foreign exchange will not have as favorable an impact on gross margin. Meanwhile, adjusted SG&A increased by 4% operationally in the first quarter. In the first two quarters of 2013, we were still building out many of the corporate functions needed to support Zoetis as an independent public company. We largely completed this process in the third quarter of last year and this unfavorable comparison is the primary driver of SG&A growth in the first quarter of 2014, accounting for approximately half of the increase in this expense. Adjusted R&D expense decreased 2% operationally. Interest expense was up $7 million in the quarter due to the completion of our debt offering at the end of January 2013. This reflects the impact of an additional month of interest expense versus the prior year which is greater than the one month of interest allocation we received from Pfizer in our carve-out financials. Overall, we did a good job on expense management in the first quarter. Our operating expenses grew at a slower pace than revenue, even when including the unfavorable comparison in SG&A that I mentioned.  Adjusted other income and deductions was negatively impacted by $5 million in FX losses related to the Argentine peso. In the year-ago quarter, we reflected the impact of the currency devaluation in Venezuela. In our segment reporting, you will find the impact from the Argentine peso in our corporate line item while the impact of the devaluation in Venezuela in 2013 is reported as part of our Canada-Latin America segment.  Our effective adjusted tax rate for the first quarter was approximately 31%. This rate is elevated versus prior periods due to the impact of a discrete item in the quarter, but we continue to expect an effective tax rate for the year of approximately 29%. Again, our adjusted net income was $191 million, representing reported growth of 7% and operational growth of 8%. This performance demonstrates our ability to grow adjusted earnings faster than revenue despite the challenges we have outlined. Now onto our segment results. I will discuss these on an operational basis, but it should be noted that segment earnings are pre-tax numbers and reported on an adjusted basis. I will also highlight some of the more significant foreign exchange impacts in the regional results. I want to mention that effective this quarter, we have realigned our segment reporting with respect to our client supply services organization, or CSS, which provides contract manufacturing services for third parties. The revenue and earnings associated with CSS are now reported within other business activities separate from the four reportable segments. In 2013, CSS results were reported in the EuAfME segment. First quarter results for 2014 and 2013 reflect the new segment structure.  Beginning with the U.S., first quarter revenue was $479 million, an increase of 6%. As Juan Ramon discussed earlier, sales of livestock products grew 7% with contributions across cattle, poultry and swine. Sales of companion animal products grew 3%. This was driven by the introduction of Apoquel which was partially offset by the effects of cold weather conditions in the first quarter. Meanwhile, U.S. segment earnings increased 19% due to revenue growth, improvement in cost of goods, and the delayed timing of promotional investments based on the unfavorable weather impact in the quarter.  Now turning to our Europe-Africa-Middle East region, or EuAfME. In EuAfME, first quarter revenue was $270 million, a decrease of 4% operationally. Sales of livestock products decreased 6% operationally. This decline was largely driven by the U.K. and is the result of two major factors: first, an unfavorable comparison to the year-ago quarter regarding rebates which should normalize throughout the year; second, in 2014 we have taken actions to more tightly monitor and manage customer inventory build-ups that normally occur in advance of price increases. These efforts negatively impacted our livestock product growth in the quarter. Meanwhile, poultry products were negatively impacted by regulatory issues which have since been resolved, and swine products were impacted by competitive pricing issues and a reduction in the use of anti-infectives. All of these items were tempered by the growth of cattle product sales in emerging markets. Meanwhile, sales of companion animal products grew 1% operationally primarily due to the introduction of Apoquel. EuAfME segment earnings decreased 2% operationally primarily due to the revenue decline which was mitigated by strong expense discipline.  Turning to our Canada and Latin America segment, or CLAR, first quarter revenue was $168 million, an increase of 10% operationally. This segment saw significant negative impact on revenue of 12 percentage points due to foreign exchange. The FX impact was primarily due to shifts in Brazil as well as Argentina and Canada. Sales of livestock products grew 9% operationally driven largely by poultry in Brazil and cattle and swine product sales across other Latin American markets. Livestock sales in Canada were relatively flat. Sales in companion animal products grew 15% operationally largely due to increased sales in Brazil, Mexico and Argentina. CLAR segment earnings increased 11% on an operational basis, driven by strong revenue growth as well as gross margin and operating expense levels that stayed in line with revenues. Reported growth of 23% is higher than the operational growth, which was primarily driven by the unfavorable impact of the currency devaluation in Venezuela in the first quarter of 2013 which we discussed earlier. In Asia Pacific, or APAC, first quarter sales were $169 million, an increase of 4% operationally. Our APAC segment also felt the significant impact from foreign exchange with the Australian dollar, Japanese yen and Indian rupee all contributing to a negative 7 percentage point impact on revenue. Sales of livestock products grew 75 operationally driven primarily by sales of swine products in China and Japan, poultry products in India, and cattle products in China. This growth was slightly offset by a decline in cattle product sales in Japan, New Zealand and Australia.  Sales of companion animal products declined 2% operationally largely due to declines in Australia driven by competitive pressures in parasiticides and declines in customer inventory levels related to the timing of price increases versus the prior year. APAC segment operating earnings decreased 2% operationally due to unfavorable mix as well as the timing of promotional investments.  Now let me turn to guidance for the full-year 2014. We have now reported one quarter of the fiscal year and remain confident in our ability to deliver on our full-year financial guidance. As a result, we are reaffirming all aspects of our financial guidance for full-year 2014. We continue to expect reported revenue of approximately $4.65 billion to $4.75 billion for the full year. This guidance also reflects an unfavorable impact of approximately 1.5 percentage points related to the year-over-year impact from foreign exchange. You would typically expect the foreign exchange impact on the bottom line to be relatively consistent with our overall margins; however, there are mitigating items in other P&L line items this year that largely offset this impact. Please note that our guidance does not include any further currency devaluations in Venezuela. Our guidance on adjusted cost of goods sold for full-year 2014 remains approximately 35.5% of revenue, roughly flat year-over-year. This reflects the anticipated benefit of price, volume and ongoing cost saving efforts which is forecasted to be offset by the full-year impact of cost incurred to build global manufacturing and supply functions as well as unfavorable mix. The incremental costs will be reflected primarily in the second half of 2014. Adjusted SG&A expenses are expected to be between $1.43 billion and $1.48 billion for the full year. We expect between 1% to 2% of operational growth in this line item to come from the unfavorable comparison in our corporate functions. Adjusted R&D expenses are expected to be between $390 million and $405 million for the full year. We continue to expect our effective tax rate on adjusted income to be approximately 29% for the full year. This guidance does not reflect the potential extension of the U.S. R&D tax credit in 2014.  Finally, we continue to expect adjusted EPS of between $1.48 and $1.54 per share. This guidance reflects our ability to achieve our profitability targets as we absorb multiple headwinds in 2014, including the incremental cost of standing up our global manufacturing and supply operations, unfavorable comparisons in corporate function expense, and an additional month of higher interest expense. Separately, we continue to estimate pre-tax charges for 2014 of between $165 million and $185 million primarily related to stand-up and acquisition-related costs which are excluded from our adjusted earnings guidance. Including the impact of these items, as well as purchase accounting adjustments, our guidance for reported diluted EPS for full-year 2014 remains between $1.15 and $1.21 per share. This annual guidance reflects our confidence in the diversity of our portfolio, the strength of our business model, and our view of the evolving market conditions for animal health products this year. Our long-term value proposition remains anchored in three objectives: to grow revenue in line with or faster than the market, to grow adjusted net income faster than revenue, and to find investment opportunities with strong returns to our business and return excess capital to shareholders. That concludes my prepared remarks, and now we will open the line for your questions. John?
John O’Connor: Thank you, Glenn. Operator, first question, please.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question is coming from Chris Schott with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
Jessica Fye – JP Morgan: Hey there, it’s Jessica Fye on for Chris. Two questions – one, can you just elaborate on the cattle trends in the U.S. this quarter. What inning are we in in terms of recovery from the drought, and maybe mention feed lot and positive herd size trends. And then secondly, recognizing that there are going to be some quarter-to-quarter variability in your business, are there any trends you’re seeing in the second quarter thus far that we should be aware of?
Juan Ramon Alaix: Thank you, Jessica. Let me answer the comment on cattle and then also the recovery that we can see on the second quarter. So on cattle, definitely the drought impact has been already solved, and the drought mainly impacted the price of the corn. The price of the corn now, it’s at a level which is in line with what we had before the drought impact. But we have seen in the U.S. is that the cattle has been declining in 2013. According to information that we have from external sources, the cattle herd declined by 2%, which compares the number of animals at the beginning of January of 2014 compared to the same period in 2013. We expect that now that the price of beef is very high, it’s really reaching record highs in terms of price, there will be an incentive for cattle producers to rebuild the herd; but this will take some years, as we expressed previously, because it takes two to three years really to have these rebuilt. We expect that at the end of 2014, the herd will have a small increase of a little bit less than 1%. Also, because of some of the cows will be kept to rebuild the herd, there will be less placement during 2014. We saw a significant increase in the first quarter in the number of placements by 5%. We expect that in the following quarters, this will have some moderated placement and at the end of the year will be in line with 2013 or slightly below. In terms of what we expect for the following quarter, I think we have some unique items in the first quarter. In the U.K., Australia, also the cold weather in the U.S., we expect these items not affecting our performance in the quarter, and if you see our guidance, we are maintaining the guidance which means we expect higher growth in the remaining quarters. Additionally, we have a significant impact on foreign exchange in the first quarter. Based on current exchange rates, we expect that in the second quarter the impact will be much lower. 
John O’Connor: Operator, next question, please.
Operator: We’ll go next to Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
Kevin Ellich – Piper Jaffray: Good morning. Two questions for you guys. First, Juan Ramon, could you give us your thoughts on the pig virus, what the impact was this quarter, and I think you guys had a new product, ractopomine Engain that was expected to launch in Q1. I’m wondering if it did and how it’s doing. And then the second question I had, had to do with the weather impact in the U.S. on the companion animal business. Could you quantify that for us, and what sort of growth have you seen coming out into the second quarter? Thanks.
Juan Ramon Alaix: Thank you, Kevin. So let’s start with PEDv. The PEDv, it’s affecting significantly the swine industry. The estimate of the total impact is 50% of sows have been affected by the virus, and this is translating into something like a 10% reduction on the herd in swine. The impact on the first quarter as well as the rest of the quarters is something that we are incorporating in our guidance, and we are also managing this situation because again, the price of pork is very high and this is also incentivating producers to use products that will protect better the animal that will have more value. So we have in one side, the negative impact of PEDv affecting a number of animals, but at the same time the high value of these animals which is increasing the use of premium price, which is the space where we mostly compete. So there are two elements that are in some way balancing, although the impact on PEDv will be higher. In terms of ractopomine, we launched Engain. This product is specifically for swine. The product has been introduced already and it’s—the results are in line with our expectations, and we expect Engain to compensate partially the negative impact of PEDv.  In terms of companion animals that you also asked what was the impact of the cold weather in the U.S., the impact was mainly related to two factors: one, it was a reduced number of visits to veterinarian clinics, and second there was a delay in terms of growing tics and fleas. Now the situation, it’s normalized and we expect that this temporary impact will be compensated in the second quarter. Definitely we have some revenues that will be lost because of these pet owners not visiting the clinics, but on the total year we don’t think that this will represent a significant impact. In any case, it is already incorporated in our guidance.
John O’Connor: Operator, next question, please.
Operator: We’ll go next to Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
David Redford – BMO Capital Markets: Good morning, this is David Redford on behalf of Alex Arfaei. I was wondering if you could add a bit more color to the discrete item that increased your tax rate this quarter and whether or not you’re open to a transaction that would lower your tax rate, such as a merger or tax inversion.
Juan Ramon Alaix: I will ask Glenn to answer this question, David.
Glenn David: Sure, so thanks for the question, David. Related to the higher ETR in the quarter, it’s driven by a non-recurring discrete item, as we discussed, and it’s related to an intercompany inventory adjustment. While the impact is fairly significant for the quarter, over the course of the year we believe it’s very manageable within the overall tax rate that we reaffirmed today of approximately 29%. In terms of our view of entering into any further transactions, we continue to evaluate all options to increase the value of our business. At this point in time, we do not see ourselves entering into a transaction like you mentioned, and I also want to mention that we are subject to certain provisions under the Tax Matters Agreement which might limit our ability to do that.
John O’Connor: Operator, next question, please.
Operator: We’ll go next to Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group. Please go ahead.
Wesley Nurss – ISI Group: Hi, this (indiscernible) sitting in for Mark today. I have one quick follow-up on the gross margins. Was there any impact to the gross margin related to geographic or species mix, and could that affect kind of the trend for the remainder of the year? I also had a question about Apoquel. You mentioned that supply was outpacing demand. Can you quantify that to any extent? And then also, I believe I heard for Apoquel there were some manufacturing issues related to that product. Isn’t Apoquel just a small molecule? Can you describe a little bit further some of the challenges there and why it will take until the first quarter of ’15 to resolve those issues? Thank you.
Juan Ramon Alaix: Thank you, Wes. I will answer on Apoquel and then Glenn will cover the question on the gross margin. Apoquel is still having big sales over time, reaching the status of (indiscernible), so more than $100 million, and we remain confident that this product will significantly exceed this $100 million. What we estimated for 2014 was a switch from current therapies, mainly steroids, to Apoquel at a different rate than we have seen after the introduction of the product, so this has created a higher demand than expected, and because of manufacturing it’s complex, we need to really produce all this product, which is a small molecule, but it takes something like 12 months from the raw materials through API – active pharma ingredient – and then finished good. We have the limitations of this lengthy manufacturing period to ramp up production and to meet all the demand of the market. As I said, we expect that the manufacturing will be normalized in 2015 and at that time we’ll be able really to supply all the demand for the product.  And now, Glenn will answer the question on gross margin.
Glenn David: Sure. So in relation to the question on gross margin and specifically to geographic mix, emerging markets did outpace revenue growth of the developed markets this quarter, so that was a negative driver on mix for the quarter; however, in terms of the favorable impacts of gross margin, we referenced the impact of foreign exchange providing about a 50 basis point benefit. That’s driven by the fact that FX at revenue had a negative impact of 3% but at adjusted cost of sales it had a favorable impact of 4%, so that drove the 50 basis point improvement. The other thing in terms of cost of sales is we do expect the cost of goods sold in the second half of the year to increase as the cost of building up our global manufacturing and supply organization will be most evident in the second half, and that will bring us in line with the 35.5% guidance we confirmed today.
John O’Connor: Operator, next question, please.
Operator: We’ll go next to John Krieger with William Blair. Please go ahead.
John Krieger – William Blair: Hi, thanks very much. Can you talk about any changes that you might be seeing among your customers in anti-infective usage? I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you saw some reduction in swine. Are you seeing any signs that that might be broadening out to other regions or other species?
Juan Ramon Alaix: Thank you for the question. Definitely the pressure to reduce the use of antibiotics in regions like Europe and more specifically in western Europe continues affecting industry revenues. In 2013, the use of anti-infectives in Europe declined by 7%. This was not only because of the pressure but also the introduction of some generic products into this space. If you will compare the 7% of the industry decline to our 2% decline, it indicates that we have been managing very well the challenge on antibiotics in western Europe and we have been able really, thanks to the breadth of our portfolio and the direct interaction with our customers, to maintain a strong position in antibiotics. The antibiotic pressure was mainly focused on northern Europe while in southern Europe or eastern Europe or Africa-Middle East, we don’t see a significant restriction on the use of anti-infectives. If I move to other regions, I would say that in the U.S., for instance, the focus has been on restrictions related to the use of anti-infectives in growth promotion. We agree with the FDA to remove this indication from our label to those products have this growth promotion indication, and overall we think that despite this pressure that definitely will continue in Europe, and we have seen new regulations in countries like Belgium or France. We expect the antibiotic to continue growing at a lower basis, although a lower pace than the growth of animal health.
John O’Connor: Operator, next question, please.
Operator: We’ll go next to Robert Willoughby with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Erin Wilson – Bank of America: Great, this is Erin Wilson in for Willoughby. On Apoquel, will there be significant incremental cost associated with normalizing supply by 2015, and can you speak to also the recent industry consolidation based on your experience following the Wyeth and Pfizer merger and other mergers as well? Could you benefit potentially from divestitures in specific product lines from some of your competitors? Does that represent an opportunity for you to benefit from sales force defections or other changes?
Juan Ramon Alaix: Thank you, Erin, and I will ask Glenn to comment on this question on the cost.
Glenn David: So Erin, specific to your question on Apoquel, we don’t see a significant increase in cost related to ramping up production. In general, increased volumes relate to additional efficiencies and should be a beneficial factor to cost in the long term.
Juan Ramon Alaix: Okay, and you also asked about M&A and the consolidation of—the impact in terms of the consolidation. So first, I think the recent news on this consolidation, in my opinion, are positive for the animal health industry because they are showing the high value of the assets in this industry. At the same time, I don’t see that this is changing significantly the competitive landscape, so in our opinion the model that we have, which is going to the market that we have a direct force, direct sales force, also supporting our revenue with innovation in terms of R&D, and high quality manufacturing is a model that has been showing significant strength. As a reference, in 2013 the market grew by 7%--4%, sorry, and Zoetis grew by 7%. This indicates that despite the challenge or despite consolidation and even the time that we were involved in the separation from Pfizer, so we were able to grow much faster than the market.
John O’Connor: Operator, next question, please.
Operator: We’ll go next to David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Chris Caponetti – Morgan Stanley: Hi, thanks very much. It’s Chris Caponetti for Dave. I was hoping you could tell me what operating cash flow was during the quarter, and then separately if you could just prioritize your uses of cash given what appears to be, I guess, a more limited interest in transformative M&A, at least over the near term. Thank you.
Juan Ramon Alaix: I will ask Glenn to go into the details of this cash plan, but let me have some general comments on our cash philosophy. Definitely Zoetis will generate predictable and steady cash flow. We will identify opportunities that will increase the value of our company, and one of the areas that we think that we can increase value is also accessing opportunities in terms of M&A. We will assess opportunities based on (indiscernible) and also the return on the investment, and definitely we have integrated many companies in the past. We have the knowledge and the capabilities to make these integrations successful and we will continue assessing any opportunity that the market will offer. And now, Glenn can provide some additional comments on cash.
Glenn David: Sure. So in terms of the cash flow statement for the quarter, as part of our earnings release process we don’t provide balance sheet or cash flow information. That information will be available in the 10-Q to be filed next week.
John O’Connor: Operator, next question, please.
Operator: We’ll go next to Louise Chin with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.
Louise Chin – Guggenheim: Hi, thanks for taking my question. So first question I had was on your pricing power. I know you’ve historically been able to drive a lot of pricing power, and I’m curious is that is particular to Zoetis or it’s sort of an industry-wide figure. And then secondly on cash flow, based on my modeling, it looks like you’ll be generating a lot of strong cash flow over the next several years, and I was wondering if you could comment if that is a correct assumption or not. Then lastly, we’ve gotten some pushback on your operating cost – you know, that you’re going to have to separate from Pfizer and that cost is higher than expected. I’m just curious how you’re going to meet your gross margin and operating margin expansion targets despite the near-term increase in costs. Thank you. 
Juan Ramon Alaix: Thank you, Louise, for the questions. Definitely we have pricing power and then we have increasing prices in most of the countries. Definitely in countries which are more developed, we have more opportunities to increase prices while in emerging markets, because of local competition, we see the opportunity in terms of volume higher than prices. In general in the industry, it’s also increasing prices, and according to external sources (indiscernible), they are indicating that on the total growth anticipated for 2014, this 5% will be balanced between price and volume. We are confident that because of our model and the strength of our portfolio, we’ll be able really to implement the price increases in most of the geographies. In terms of the question on separating costs, maybe Glenn can provide some comments on that.
Glenn David: Sure. So the guidance that we reaffirmed today does include some certain significant items and acquisition-related costs primarily related to standing up the organization that we’ll experience in 2014. In terms of the operating costs, the guidance also reflects some of the dyssynergies that we may experience this year related to being an independent company, and we highlighted some of those in terms of the incremental costs related to our corporate functions and some of the incremental costs in terms of building up our global manufacturing and supply organization, but we still believe in the long-term ability to be able to grow expenses at the rate of inflation.
Juan Ramon Alaix: And let me finish with your question on cash flow. Definitely this company will generate cash in a way that will be strong and also predictable and steady, and we will use the cash in a way that will maximize the value of Zoetis and also the value for the shareholders.
John O’Connor: Operator, next question, please.
Operator: We’ll go next to Liav Abraham with Citi. Please go ahead.
Liav Abraham – Citi: Good morning. Just a follow-up question on your tax rate. I understand from your commentary that you’re not focused on a tax inversion at this point, at least not in a material way. Can you talk to the opportunities that you have for potential reduction of your tax rate on a standalone basis over the medium term? Thanks very much. 
Glenn David: Sure. So in reaffirming our tax rate of 29%, we also indicated that that does not include the benefit of the R&D tax credit, which could provide an additional benefit of about 50 basis points. I’ll just reaffirm what the company has said in the past, that the rate of approximately 29% is generally the long range rate in which we think we could operate.
John O’Connor: Operator, next question, please.
Operator: We’ll go next to Jamie Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Ariel Herman – Goldman Sachs: Hi, this is Ariel Herman in for Jamie. So just a couple quick ones. Regarding Apoquel, how much did this contribute to your overall growth, so another way of asking this is what would the growth be ex-Apoquel? And then when you think about new products versus the current or base business, how should we think about the growth in each of the segments, so how fast are new products growing versus potentially the base business declining? Then separately just to follow up on the industry consolidation question, I believe you stated previously that scale is one of the strengths of Zoetis, so if competitors are getting bigger and consolidating, how could this potentially affect you? Thanks.
Juan Ramon Alaix: Thank you, Ariel. On Apoquel, Apoquel will represent in 2014 approximately 1% of our total revenues, so it means that in terms of revenue growth, it will represent also about this 1%. Our model is not based on bringing new products to compensate the loss of exclusivity or the duration of the old portfolio, but our model is to continue investing in our current portfolio in a way which is a balance with the investment that we make in generating new products. So because of generic competition has a different impact in our industry, we are able really to continue supporting our product with (indiscernible) life cycle management. We can continue investing in indications, we can continue investing in the current portfolio, moving a product from different species. We can also work on combining producers to maintain these products fresh and generating growth, and also we can invest in expanding our portfolio geographically. Definitely new products will represent a portion of our growth, and if you take our total growth, a portion will come from price- we mentioned that this will be approximately 50% of our revenue growth will be coming from price, and then in terms of volume two-thirds will be coming from our current portfolio and the way that we are maintaining our current portfolio life, and one-third will be coming from new products. These are general statements that can be different depending on the years and depending on the new product introductions or the success of being in also innovation to our current portfolio. In terms of what will be the impact of the consolidation since some of our competitors will increase scale, we are already competing with large companies, companies that already generate more than $3 billion, and we have been proving that our business model is extremely effective and efficient, and we based our model, as I mentioned, in our great introductions, bringing innovation in both new products and supporting our existing portfolio, and the quality and reliable supply. The combination of all these elements and the way that we are executing our strategies is what is making our differentiation in the market, and we are convinced that despite this consolidation we remain very competitive and growing in line or slightly faster than the market, despite having a market share of 20%. And very important, also our plan is to increase our earnings faster than revenues with the right focus on expenses and also the right focus on improving gross margin.
John O’Connor: Operator, we have time for one more question.
Operator: We’ll take our last question from David Krempa with Morningstar. Please go ahead.
David Krempa – Morningstar: Great, thanks for taking the question. If we look at the significant differences in margin compared to the international markets versus the U.S., would you say the biggest driving factor there is solely the pricing or are there still scale benefits you can realize there that should improve as you grow, or at nearly a billion dollars in these regions are you already taking advantage of all the scale opportunities there and we shouldn’t expect any significant increases in these margins going forward?
Juan Ramon Alaix: Well, margins are definitely affected by the product mix and also affected by species mix and geography mix. In smaller markets, we don’t have the same economies of scale that we can generate in the U.S. As these markets are growing, we’ll see also that the margin will improve because they will increase the absorption of all the expense infrastructure that we have been building to maximize the opportunities in these markets. I’m convinced that our margin will continue growing. As I mentioned, we’ll be growing revenues in line or faster than market, but margins or earnings will be growing faster than revenues. This will increase our margin opportunities. I don’t know, Glenn, if you want to add any additional comment on that?
Glenn David: No, the only thing I’ll add is to Juan Ramon’s point about the expectation to grow revenue—to grow income faster than revenue. We expect that across all of our regions, both the developed and the emerging.
Operator: I’d like to turn the conference back over to Juan Ramon for any closing or additional remarks.
Juan Ramon Alaix: So thank you, all of you for joining us on today’s call, and thank you for your interest in Zoetis and our first quarter performance. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today’s teleconference. A replay of today’s call will be available in two hours by dialing 1-800-677-6124 for U.S. listeners, and 402-220-0664 for international. Please disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2013 Financial Results Conference Call and Webcast for Zoetis. Hosting the call today from Zoetis is Vice President of Investor Relations, Dina Fede. The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, and will not be forwarded automatically. In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately 2 hours after the conclusion of this call via dial-in or on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for your questions following the presentation. (Operator Instructions) In the interest of time, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and then queue again with any follow ups. Your line will be muted when you complete your question. When posing your question, please pick up your handset to allow optimal sound quality. (Operator Instructions) It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Dina Fede, Vice President of Investor Relations. Dina, you may begin.
Dina Fede: Thank you, Zack. Thank you, everyone and good morning, and welcome to Zoetis Fourth Quarter 2013 Earnings Call. I'm joined today by Juan Ramón Alaix, our CEO; and Rick Passov, our CFO. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statement in today's press release and our SEC filings, including, but not limited to our 2012 10-K and 2013 10-Qs. Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures which were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and in the company's 8-K filing dated today, February 11, 2014. And finally, since Zoetis was not a standalone company in 2012, our financial statements covering periods prior to the IPO do not necessarily reflect what the results of operations would have been, had we operated as a standalone public company, which may make comparisons to prior periods difficult in certain instances. With that, I will turn the call over to Juan Ramón.
Juan Ramón Alaix: Thank you, Dina, and good morning everyone. On February 1st, we celebrated our one-year anniversary. And in this first year, we have made a significant progress in standing up as Zoetis has an independent public company, building the infrastructure to support our business and delivering on our financial and strategic objectives. We concluded the year with operational revenue growth of 7% and adjusted net income growth of 32%. At species level, we deliver 8% operational growth in companion animal and operational growth of 6% in livestock. Companion animal products now account for 36% of our total annual revenues with livestock progress accounting for 64%. In companion animal, sales of products for cats and dogs grew by 8% driven by a strong performance in the U.S., Latin America and Asia. And moderate growth in Western Europe and Australia with 4% decline in the sales of equine products. In some countries such as the U.S., there are signs of recovery in the equine market after five years of decline. With addition of APOQUEL in 2014 to our already strong companion animal portfolio we expect to continue the positive sales growth in this segment. And I will talk more about this product later on today's call. In livestock, sales of swine and poultry portfolio grew operationally by 12% and 10%. These industries have recovered faster than expected from the drought that affected the U.S. in 2012. These were due to feed costs and higher meat prices in 2013 and given the shortened production cycle allowing operations to more rapidly replenish the supply of animals. In cattle, where we deliver operational growth of 2%, in the U.S. had strong show in 2013, especially in the fourth quarter. We also saw a strong performance in India and Mexico. These performances continue to be balanced by the impact of ongoing drought conditions in a number of markets including Australia. Now, let me share with you the performance of our four regions. In Asia Pacific and on operational basis, the revenue grew in line with total Zoetis revenue. It is consistent with our expectations which have lowered during the year to reflect the continued impact of the drought in Australia and New Zealand. These two markets represent 1/3rd of revenues for the region. Significant growth in the region came from the emerging markets of China, India and Southeast Asia as well as good performance in Japan, another large market for Zoetis. This was tampered by the flat growth in Australia and the New Zealand where as I mentioned, dry weather conditions remain. In Canada, Latin America, as I have noted previously results of the region are primarily influenced by the performance of the two largest markets of Brazil and Canada. These countries account for over 60% of the region sales. For 2013, Brazil was the key driver of the regions growth. With the market as more companion animal business, growing at a significant pace. We deliver slower growth rate in livestock with a strong growth in poultry and swine offset by the flat growth in cattle. Despite relatively flat industry performance in Canada, Zoetis deliver growth in this market and this was driven by market conditions positively impacting our anti-infective portfolio and cattle virus and stronger than anticipated sales of flea-and-tick sale products. In Europe, Africa, Middle East, emerging markets contribute significantly to 2013 growth. In Russia, we see a longer term growth trend in the livestock industry where there is an increasing focus on sales efficiency in the food supply. In Western Europe, where we had our largest market, while economy challenge remained for our customers we grew modestly. We deliver by strong growth across all species in the U.S., our largest region. In companion animal, we saw the benefit of realigning our field force to more effectively cover our customer base. This was in addition to the positive outcomes of our new cross-portfolio pricing programs. In livestock strong growth in poultry and swine was offset by the two very different six month performance periods in cattle, the largest species in our U.S. livestock business, it was a year of two-half, if you like. In the first half of 2013, the cattle business saw the impact of higher corn prices affecting the producers demand for our products. Growth in cattle sales picked up in the second half of the year as corn prices fell. For 2014, we expect limited growth in our cattle business as ranches hold back heifers from slaughter for breading purposes. This action, while tempering growth in 2014 is a positive long-term trend for the animal health industry as it indicates the beginning of herd rebuilding. For total Zoetis, operational revenue growth of 7% comprised approximately 5% volume growth and 2% price. Now let me provide some recent business highlights from the quarter. This demonstrates the importance of the three core interconnected capabilities of our company. We continue to benefit from our best in class field force. The commercial team remains focused on partnering with our customers to make their businesses successful. We are deepening these relationships with our customers to development of aligned platforms, so they might easily access to our produce as well as to help them better engage their clients. According to the latest available external market data, Zoetis grew its revenues faster than the market for both the nine and 12-month periods ending September 30, 2013. This performance is based on the latest information available and we expect to continue to grow faster than the market on a total year basis for 2013. Our investments in R&D have been productive. Through the year we have delivered a number of minimal additions and enhancement to our product portfolio. In fact, in 2013 we received many approvals including those for new medicines, claim extensions or entrance into new markets. Some of our most recent approval has been for poultry and swine. In swine, we have continued to maximize our investment in the FOSTERA brand with the approval of FOSTERA poultry vaccine in new markets including Mexico, Korea and Thailand. Building on the success of FOSTERA and thanks to the continued innovation from our R&D team, we recently received U.S. approval of our FOSTERA PCV MH product. This is a new combination vaccine for swine and it's the first to offer one bottle, one dose convenience with the flexibility of two dose administration. Also in the swine portfolio and during 2013, we launched the first product for our China joint venture Rui Lan An. This product is performing very well. We believe that the product could account for a growing percentage of our revenues in China and become a top 10 product in our portfolio in the market in 2014. And now a few words on APOQUEL. This exciting new product was recently launched in the U.S., Germany, Austria and the U.K. APOQUEL is scheduled to launch in the rest of European Union as well as New Zealand in 2014. APOQUEL has been well-received by veterinarians and those of their client that participated in our clinical trials and in the early experience programs in the U.S. Customer demand to-date has already been very high and we are truly excited about its long-term potential. However, as an innovative probably a novel mechanism of action and with only a few weeks in the market it is hard to estimate what the ultimate rate of uptake will be in this product's first year. To help manage expectations at this earlier stage we currently believe that APOQUEL could contribute approximately 1% of our revenues in 2014. This is of course dependant upon customer acceptance levels. Changing gears, through the year I have spoken about how our customer's businesses have been impacted by a number of disease outbreaks. You would recall that we have talked previously about foreseen epidemic diarrhea virus or PEDv, which is affecting swine herds. This has been a serious impact on the industry in the United States and is now active in 23 states. Cold weather is contributing despite of the outbreak which is impacting according to recent reports up to 30% of sows in the U.S. With information available today, we expect a reduction of approximately 4% of the U.S. swine herd and this impact has been incorporated in our guidance range. We will continue monitoring the evolution of the outbreak in the swine industry and the impact in our revenues. As you may know, Zoetis recently announced research partnership with Iowa State University, to identify vaccine candidate to help control the virus. The partnership is one element of Zoetis ongoing effort to support swine veterinarians and pork producers in the control of PEDv. Also in 2013, Zoetis began correlating with the University of Minnesota to develop a diagnostic test for the disease. Another disease outbreak albeit on a smaller scale has been a new strain of bronchitis affecting poultry flocks. This is a virus that has been first identified by poultry producers in the U.S. State of Georgia in 2008. But one that had began to spread to other southern U.S. states. In 2013, in line of the continuing impact of the disease we formed an internal taskforce to deliver the USDA conditionally-licensed vaccine intended for this virus. This provides a valuable tool for our customers in reducing the affects of the disease. Efforts are currently underway to obtain a full USDA license for the vaccine. Our responses to both of these diseases outbreaks further demonstrate our partnership with our customers and the way in which our colleagues work to meet their needs. We have remained focused on issuing a steady supply of quality medicines to our customers and the market. In 2013, we deliver sustained improvement in our product availability metrics ensuring that we can more reliable meet the demands of our customers around the world. In 2014, our manufacturing and supply organization will include a full-year cost associated with central manufacturing functions that were build through 2013. We are also facing some product mix headwinds higher sales in medicated feed additives on poultry together with some products not fully meeting our expectations. One example of these products is Improvac/Improvest. This is an innovative global product that changes animal husbandry practices in the swine industry in a very important way. We have been successful with these products in Latin America, but not yet realized its full potential in Europe and U.S. All these elements will represent a challenge to gross margin improvements in 2014. Zoetis first year results as well as our 2014 guidance illustrate the importance of our diverse portfolio and the strength of our business model. We are committed to our long-term objective to deliver revenue growth inline with or faster than the market and realize adjusted earnings growth faster than revenues. I believe as we are well-positioned to bring added value to our customers, colleagues and shareholders. With that I will now ask Rick to walk us through the financial results. Rick?
Rick Passov: Thank you, Juan Ramón, and good morning. I will start with a review of the fourth quarter results and then I will lay out guidance for full-year 2014. Turning to the income statement slide, for the fourth quarter revenue was approximately $1.25 billion, an increase of approximately 7% year-over-year including a negative impact of 2 percentage points from foreign exchange. Adjusted net income was a $180 million and diluted earnings per share was $0.36. Adjusted net income for the quarter excludes the after-tax impact of $75 million or $0.15 per diluted share for purchase accounting adjustments acquisition related costs in certain significant items. As we mentioned on last quarter's call, our fourth quarter reported results include $13 million and one-time charges related to the integration of our branded generics R&D into our global R&D operations, the divestitures of certain assets in our agricultural business and our decision to exit the manufacturing of intermediate ingredients that we believe we can source more effectively from third parties. Also as I mentioned on our last call, during the fourth quarter, we continued to assess the carrying value of certain assets. As a result, we took a one-time charge of $17 million to reflect the impairment of one of our manufacturing facilities. And finally, in the fourth quarter, as we continued the transition to our own shared services operation, we wrote-off approximately $17 million of inventory and intercompany accounts that would be transferred to us as part of the separation from Pfizer. Because of these expenses relate to the periods prior to 2012, and prior to our initial public offering, we do not consider them to be reflective of our current operations and are therefore, excluding them from our adjusted earnings a non-GAAP measure. Turning now to our adjusted net income statement slide, which I will speak to on an operational basis. Again, revenue was up 9% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Companion animal sales grew $27 million or 7% and livestock sales grew $76 million or 10%. Adjusted cost of sales was 35.4% of revenue versus 36.3% in the year ago quarter, this reflects the impact of a favorable comparison to the year ago quarter, which included certain expenses associated with establishing our own compensation plans as well as other items related to separating from Pfizer. Adjusted SG&A decreased by approximately 6% in the fourth quarter, this reflects good expense control as well as similar to COGS a favorable comparison to the fourth quarter of 2012. Adjusted R&D expense decreased approximately 1%, adjusted other income and deductions decreased to $0 in the fourth quarter of 2013. This was primarily due to a royalty true-up combined with losses on foreign exchange exposures. Our effective adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter was approximately 29% reflecting the jurisdictional mix of income and the full year benefit for the U.S. R&D tax credit. And again, on an operational basis, our adjusted net income was $180 million. Now, on to our segment results, I will discuss these on an operational basis and it should be noted that segment earnings are pre-tax numbers and reported on an adjusted basis. Beginning with the U.S., fourth quarter revenue was $516 million, an increase of 7%. Sales of livestock products grew 8% with contributions across cattle's, swine and poultry. Cattle products showed stronger than expected growth particularly during the later part of the quarter driven by the continued improvement of market conditions in the U.S. Swine and poultry products continue to benefit from customer acceptance of recently-launched vaccine products. Sales of companion animal products grew 5% and U.S. segment earnings increased by 11% due to revenue growth and improvements in gross margin driven by price and volume. Now turning to our Europe, Africa and Middle East region, in EuAfME fourth quarter revenue was $330 million, an increase of 9% operationally. Sales of livestock products grew 9% driven primarily by recently launched swine and poultry vaccine products particularly in Germany and Russia. Sales of companion animal products also grew 9% and benefited again this quarter from increased sales associated with third-party manufacturing agreements. Excluding these sales, companion animal products sales grew 5%. EuAfME segment earnings increased 24% operationally driven by revenue growth and expense efficiencies in the quarter. Turning to our Canada and Latin America segment or CLAR, fourth quarter revenue was $223 million, an increase of 8% operationally. Sales of livestock products grew 7% driven largely by improved market conditions for cattle in Brazil and by increases in sales of medicated feed additives in poultry. Sales of companion animal products grew 14% largely driven by sales in Canada due to favorable weather conditions and increasing medicalization of pets in Brazil. CLAR segment earnings increased 24% operationally driven by revenue growth and expense efficiencies as well as a favorable comparison to the year ago quarter. In our Asia Pacific or APAC region, fourth quarter sales were $185 million, an increase of 14% operationally. Sales of livestock products grew 16%, India had strong poultry and cattle products sales. For poultry, this was in part due to the resolution of a prior year product registration issues for several of our vaccines. In Japan, swine sales benefited from recently launched vaccines and China was also a leading contributor mainly in swine products. Growth in these markets more than offset the negative impact of drought conditions in Australia on sales of cattle and sheep products. Sales of companion animal products grew 8% led by good performance for recently launched products primarily in Japan. This was partially offset by a decline in sales in Australia, reflecting the benefit in the year ago quarter of equine vaccine sales from the launch of our Hendra vaccine. APAC segment operating earnings increased 70% operationally benefiting from revenue growth, expense efficiencies, the timing of promotional spend as well as our favorable true-up and pricing for certain purchases. Now let me turn to guidance for full-year 2014. Our guidance for 2014 reflects foreign exchange rates from late January. For full-year 2014, we expect reported revenue of approximately $4.65 billion to $4.75 billion. This reflects an unfavorable impact of approximately 2 percentage points or approximately $100 million related to the year-over-year impact from foreign exchange. Our guidance on adjusted cost of goods sold for full-year 2014 is approximately 35.5% of revenue roughly flat year-over-year. This reflects the anticipated benefit of price, volume and ongoing cost saving efforts offset by the full-year impact of cost incurred to build our global supply functions as well as among other things headwinds from unfavorable mix. Adjusted SG&A expenses are expected to be between $1.43 billion and $1.48 billion. Adjusted R&D expenses are expected to be between $390 million and $405 million. For the full-year 2014, the midpoint of our guidance implies an improvement in the ratio of a total adjusted SG&A and R&D to revenue of approximately 50 basis points. We are targeting this improvement despite the fact that 2014 will reflect a full-year of expenses for the standalone corporate functions that were ramping up throughout 2013. Also as we pointed out during the first two quarters of 2013, total adjusted SG&A and R&D expense was less than the full-year run rate. As a result, year-over-year growth rate comparisons for the first two quarters of 2014 are expected to be unfavorable. Our effective tax rate on adjusted income is expected to be approximately 29% for the full year, this guidance does not reflect the potential renewal of the U.S. R&D tax credit in 2014. And we expected adjusted EPS between $1.48 and $1.54 per share. In addition to the FX impact and revenue discussed earlier, our EPS guidance also includes approximately $0.01 impact in OID from the recent evaluation of the Argentine peso. For 2014, we estimate pre-tax charges between $165 million and $185 million which primarily relate to stand-up and acquisition related cost including the impact of these items, our reported diluted EPS for the full-year 2014 is we expected it to be between $1.15 and $1.21 per share. Our annual guidance reflects our confidence in the diversity of our portfolio, the strength of our business model and our view of the evolving market conditions for animal health product this year. In closing, now that we have a year behind us, I would like to provide an update on our perspectives on capital allocation. First, we remain committed to maintaining an investment grade rating and feel that we would be able to do this while targeting a leverage ratio debt-to-EBITDA of approximately 2.5x. In the near term, we remain focused on completing this stand-up of Zoetis, and were incurring our recurring costs in 2014, which I discussed earlier. For 2015, we expect stand-up and acquisition related costs to be less than half of what we expect to occur to incur in 2014. And we will continue to selectively invest in opportunities to profitably grow our business. Beyond that we will look to return capital to shareholders. In our first year of operations as a public company we increased our dividend by 11%. As we move past the elevated spend associated with standing up our infrastructure, we believe our free cash flow should support increasing our dividends at or above earnings growth for some period of time. Of course, this is based on current expectations and any future increase would be subject to Board approval. That concludes my prepared remarks and now we will open the line for your questions. Dina?
Dina Fede: Operator, we are ready for questions.
Operator: The floor is now open for questions. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Our first question is coming from Chris Schott of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Chris Schott - JPMorgan: Great. Thanks very much for the question. The first question, you reported two consecutive very strong top line results with roughly 9% constant currency growth because I was a bit surprised by the 3% sales growth guidance in 2014, I guess more like 5% constant currency. Just elaborate a little bit more what's happening here that you are seeing a slower growth. The second question was on operating margins. I think you mentioned 100 to 150 basis points of expansion this year despite some unfavorable year-over-year expense comps. How do we think about long-term leverage in the model, when we look beyond 2014 and some of these one-time factors kind of getting behind the company? Can we think about maybe more on the 150 end or even larger operating margin expansion opportunities over time? Thanks very much.
Juan Ramón Alaix: Let me take the first question on our revenue position for the 2014. And in 2013, we had significant growth in two species, swine and poultry. Swine grew by 12% and poultry by 10%. We also and we think that this two species will have more moderated growth in 2014 much more in line with the market growth. The second element that we also included in our projections for 2014 was in companion animal, we expected the entrance of new classes of molecules in parasiticide. We also expect some additional competition for Rimadyl, generic competition for Rimadyl in the U.S. and of course this will be balanced with the launch of APOQUEL that also will generate a significant growth. In cattle, which is the largest livestock species, we expect that in 2014, the cattle ranches will rebuild the herd and as a consequence of that there will be less animals place in the feedlots and this will have an impact in terms of – and the sales of our products. Considering all these elements, we think that the projections that we are making for 2014 are realistic and also in line what we can expect also from the market growth. May be Rick can provide some details on gross margin?
Rick Passov: All right. Yes. Chris, I just want to make sure that my numbers were heard correctly and that I understood the numbers that you discussed. So on operating margin in 2013 roughly there is a 300 basis point improvement. What I said in my comments was that the ratio of SG&A to R&D in 2014 based on the midpoint of our guidance is going to be roughly 50 basis point improvement there about. And then as we also spoke on the call, gross margin had a modest improvement in 2013 and our outlook there is flat for 2014 and we described some of the reasons that are driving that. So and in terms of a longer term perspective, again, we go back to the basic premise, we believe we will grow at or in line with market. We believe over the long-term our expenses will grow considerably less than that. And we think that margin from there kind of cancels out.
Dina Fede: Operator, next question please.
Operator: And we will go next to Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
Kevin Ellich - Piper Jaffray: Good morning. Just following up on kind of the underlying market growth assumptions, are you seeing greater use of medications by hog farmers with PEDv going around the country and also with 9 million pounds of beef recalled out in California and a plant shut down, doesn't that make the existing cattle herd even more valuable so that could also drive increases in medications?
Juan Ramón Alaix: Thank you for the question Kevin. And you are right. We expect that with fewer animals, these animals will have more valuable to the cattle businesses and we expect that also they will ensure that they have the right healthcare protocols to keep these animals for that business. But this will be compensated in someway because of the fewer animals that will be available for placement in 2014 based on the assumption that the ranchers will probably rebuild the herd and this will keep these animals for this purpose. In terms of greater use of medicines because of PEDv what we have seen is that definitely the PEDv it's reducing the number of animals available. I mention that the sows affected by the PEDv in the U.S. it's about 30% and it is expected to have an impact of reduction of 4% in terms of total animals available in the market. What the producers are indicating is that the way that they expect to compensate these fewer animals it will be to have these animals longer in terms of reaching higher weight that will also contain the number of pork available to the market. This may represent an opportunity if they keep these animals longer also to keep these animals under certain healthcare protocols. Although when they reach certain weight they are less vulnerable to infections or other diseases.
Dina Fede: Operator, our next question please.
Operator: And we'll go next to Louise Chen with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.
Louise Chen - Guggenheim: Hi, thanks for taking my question. So, we had a quite a few calls this morning from investors regarding the guidance that you gave for 2014 and maybe some more explanation behind it, but I'll just delve back on that again. So I'm kind of curious how we should think about modeling your top line and bottom line growth longer term. I understand some of the headwinds this year and, should we just be patient the 2013, 2014 there are some meaningful headwinds and then after that we should kind of get to the kind of growth rate that people had expected at the time of the IPO, which is more 6% to 7% top line and double digit bottom line growth?
Juan Ramón Alaix: And in terms of revenues, we see that Zoetis will be growing in this five years companion animal growth in line with the market and the market is expected to grow around 5% to 6%. We also expect that our expenses will be inline with inflation and we also expect that we will generate gross margin improvement over time. Let me provide may be some comments on why we are not meeting our objective for 2014 in terms of gross margin. So one element it's the mix of products. So in 2013, we have the significant growth in swine and poultry especially in poultry that the margins are lower and these also creating some mix challenge in terms of gross margin. We also had some geographies that also impacting the mix of geographies are also impacting our geography, we are growing faster in some of the major markets and these are major markets they still have lower margin that than more developed markets. The third element is that in 2014, we are facing some unexpected synergies like freight. Again, so it's something that definitely we are working and we expect this something that will not have a long-term impact since we will be able really to achieve our target in terms of this kind of cost. We see that also some of this additional impact in cost will be offset by cost reductions also will be offset by pricing but there are some elements that also are affecting our gross margin improvement in 2014. We were expecting to generate significant growth out of a product that has a significant potential, it's a product that it's called Improvest/Improvac this product has been extremely successful in Brazil and we were expecting the same kind of success in Europe and the U.S. Unfortunately the market acceptance is taking longer in these two important regions and these are having an impact in terms of revenues but also in terms of volume that it will be absorbing significant cost in our operations. We still remain convinced that this product is really providing a significant opportunities not only in terms of replacing surgical castration in pigs to eliminate boar tint but also having feed enhancement that will result also in higher productivity for the swine producers. These products have a significant opportunity and we expect that this product will generate revenues and also a positive impact in our gross margin in the future. We expect that our actions that we are taking in 2014 will result in cost, of course improvement in 2015 and 2016 and also beyond. So we are committed to improve our gross margin and we see that this situation in 2014 is a temporary situation that we expect to solve in the future.
Dina Fede: Operator, next question please.
Operator: We'll go next go to Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets: Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. Could you please talk about your business development strategy and whether you are primarily focused on livestock and companion animal businesses, it would seem there are number of promising companion animals which add new assets out there? And if I may follow up, your revenue this quarter benefited from again from third party manufacturing agreement, how should we think about this opportunity in 2014? Thank you.
Juan Ramón Alaix: Okay. Let me start with the business development and also Rick can provide comments on the third party manufacturing agreements. In terms of BD, we will remain focused on ensuring that we maximize the opportunities that we have in our portfolio and also the opportunities that will generate through our investments in R&D will not exclude opportunities in terms of adding products for a certain species or certain therapeutic classes in where we can really fill gaps or also expanding our presence in some of the markets. But definitely, it's something that we will consider opportunities as they come. And there will be two conditions that always will be in our analysis, one the strategic feed and the second the financial to support that acquisition. We are not really focused on either livestock on companion animal, I think something that we will be open to any opportunity that will meet these two conditions.
Rick Passov: And then Alex on the question on the third-party manufacturing to remind us again of what that is, we're obligated to provide supply for some of the divested products plus we also now have a small component of third-party manufacturing that we do on behalf of Pfizer. We do expect that the amount of this volume for us will decline around 15% year-over-year probably in the early 50 millions to somewhere in the early 40 millions and we haven't made a long-term decision about the extent to which we'll decide to continue on some of these contracts as they decline or what kind of partnership will remain with Pfizer we're on – in the long-term where this fits into our overall manufacturing operations.
Dina Fede: Operator, next question please.
Operator: We'll go next to Robert Willoughby with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Erin Wilson - Bank of America: Hi, it's Erin Wilson. Juan Ramón, I guess going back to the revenue growth questions in the press release and then in the prepared remarks do you see that the 2014 outlook supports your overall long-term goal of faster than market growth? But the guidance seems to call for at least in line if not below the industry trend, what's the disconnect there in light of kind of the new product launches and recent strength you've see? My second question would be just broadly speaking to the slower growth in livestock markets and inherently lower margin business positively impact the product mix on a gross margin standpoint, so could there be upside to your estimates there?
Juan Ramón Alaix: Okay. In terms of our performance against the market, while the information available today its the third quarter year-to-date where we have been growing significantly faster than the market in 2013. And we expect also the fourth quarter to confirm these results. If, what we always communicated, it's our commitment to grow inline or faster than market on a companion animal terms. And if you take our growth in 2013, and also with the projections that we are making for 2014, we think that this growth in companion animal growth will be faster than the market. We expect that the new products will add some additional revenues and APOQUEL is a very good example. But you need to also to keep in mind that in 2013, we also launched a significant number of products, so we generated very positive growth of new products in 2013. And I think it's something that definitely we are convinced that at the end of the year, so the growth that we will be generating will be supporting this growth faster than the market or inline with the market. The second question was slower livestock growth and positive for gross margin. While there are many different elements in this statement, so one its -- I mentioned that we are growing now faster than in poultry and swine than in cattle. And this is having an impact in our gross margin. Second element, we have also been growing at least in 2013, so we have now a higher base of medicated feed additives also with the lower margin than pharmaceuticals or vaccine. And the third element is the growth in emerging markets and this growth in emerging markets it's – well, there are two components definitely the companion animal but also they are growing very fast in terms of livestock. All these elements are driving our gross margin performance in 2014. Rick, I don't know if you want to add any other comment?
Rick Passov: The only small amount of color, I would add is just that if we look also Erin, I think you had said that the lower growth that we might be anticipating on a relative basis year-over-year in livestock would be an improvement in margin. I think Juan Ramón answered that I think also its worth pointing out that in companion animal we have new products and we also have some new competitors and those things are balanced in our forecast for the companion animal growth in 2014 as well.
Dina Fede: Operator, next question please.
Operator: We will go next to Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group. Please go ahead.
Mark Schoenebaum - ISI Group: Hey, guys thanks for taking the question. Also thanks for all the quick very clear commentary. I just, hey, Rick, I just want to make sure I've got some math correct. You mentioned I think I heard you say something like $100 million currency impact to your 2014 guidance, just clarify that should we basically just be adding if you wanted to do constant currency should we just be adding $100 million to your revenue guidance. And if I were to do that to try to create more of a like-for-like comparison it looks to me like your operating margins in 2014 will expand not 50 basis points, but about 130 basis points. Is my math correct or was there also some kind of offsetting impact on the OpEx line from the fluctuations you expect in currency? And then just a follow up is, if your revenue guidance proves conservative, if it were as analyst investors should we still look at your SI&A (sic) SG&A and R&D dollar guidance as the number that you are going to shoot for? Even if you get lucky and say your revenue growth is 2% or 3% higher than what you're projecting? Thanks again for all the detail.
Rick Passov: Mark, no problem. Let me just start back at the very beginning of the question. So at the average rate of FX for us over the course of 2013, we're giving you this range of about $100 million of lost revenue. If we were to apply the average rates in 2013 across how we expect the numbers to roll-out for us in 2014, exactly how that falls through the P&L there are a lot of different ways that you can do it, we haven't really worked out that math for us but you can use the P&L is an indicative model or hair cut that in a number of different ways. And in terms of -- to the extent that we get more or less revenue what is going to be the impact on SG&A as a percent of sales. I think it depends on a lot of factors, we can find ourselves in periods of time where revenue growth is also being accompanied by more promotional activities. So it's hard for me to give you a fixed line there. And also want to make sure that I'm not misquoted on the 50 basis points that I spoke to. Again, in my prepared remarks, I was simply saying that if you take the midpoint of the guidance for just SG&A and just R&D as a percent of revenue, you'll see that they were targeting in that midpoint range roughly 50 basis point improvement. I'm simply pointing out that in a year when we are facing peak to synergies as part of the standup from – in our standup efforts, we're still showing you at least in this ratio cost improvement benefits. And then I'd also point out that we had negative SG&A growth in 2013. So, if you add up 2013 and 2014, I think you get a year representative of what Juan Ramón has described as an average year that's representative of what Juan Ramón has described as our longer term goals.
Dina Fede:  Operator, next question please.
Operator:  We'll go next to John Kreger with William Blair. Please go ahead.
John Kreger - William Blair:  Hi. Thanks very much. Just a couple of quick follow-ups on the underlying assumptions for the 2014 guidance. Are you assuming any improvement in the economic environment particularly on the companion side? And what about the price versus volume mix that underlies that 2% to 4% revenue growth expectation? Thank you.
Juan Ramón Alaix: Probably the answer to that, it's not completely straight forward. So we expect some economic improvement in some of the European markets. At the same time there are uncertainties at this point in some of the emerging economies. And in these economies, I think it's something that at this point we are taking some questions in terms of growth that these economies will generate and also the impact that these growth will have in the animal healthcare industry. That's why we're still providing this range that is reflecting these uncertainties that we still have not only related to the economies but also related to some environmental factors that can be affecting our business. On the second question, it's what about the --
Rick Passov: Pricing.
Juan Ramón Alaix: The pricing volume in – so in 2013, we generated higher volumes than price in our total revenue growth. I mentioned that on the 7% operational growth, 5% was volume, 2% was price. We expect that in 2014, the growth will be balanced between price and volume. And definitely we see opportunities of price increases in both livestock and also companion animal and also both in developed animal healthcare markets. Although, we see that emerging markets we will have a much more moderated price increases than a developed markets.
Dina Fede: Next question please.
Operator:  We'll go next to David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
David Risinger – Morgan Stanley: Yes. Thanks very much. Good morning, Juan Ramón and Rick. I have a couple of questions mainly about the financials. So, first with respect to FX, Rick, could you just talk about the impact of FX on the bottom-line in 2013? And then obviously, FX benefits your operating expenses in 2014. Is there any way to characterize the FX driven reduction in operating cost for 2014? And then separately with respect to corporate costs, could you just remind us where your corporate costs are, where they were in 2013 and how we should think about that number trending over time and whether there are any meaningful cost reduction opportunities or not? Thank you.
Rick Passov:  Thank you for the question, David. Let me start with the FX piece. The FX impact for 2013 was considerably less than what we're seeing in 2014. And yes, there is an FX component that would be somewhat of a benefit to SG&A but less so than you might think depending on which geographies we're making investments for growth and as well less so from an R&D perspective. And then – I'm sorry what was the – the second question was the kind of -- how to look at our corporate costs. So, one thing that is between 2012 and 2013 is a reallocation between what's in R&D which is part of our corporate function and what was in unallocated overhead bucket in our carve out financials that helps you sort of see 2012 and 2013 change. And then as we spoke in the other parts of what we call our corporate costs are a couple of things the build up of essential organization for manufacturing, so we built our own global supply points. And then as well those functions that resided in Pfizer where there was no analog in Zoetis. So, tax, treasury P&A to a large degree, internal audit and so on and as well the IT function. And the majority of the standup delta if you will, maybe I could use the word synergies have been occurred to-date and I think we've done a very good job of offsetting them. They don't on a – where you'll see the largest impact if you will is comparing the rate of growth in SG&A for example in Q1 of 2014 to the rate of growth in Q1 of 2013 and that's because in Q1 of 2013 and in Q2 of 2013 we called out that – the SG&A plus R&D as a percent of revenue was below what we expected the run rate would be for the full-year or even our indicative run rate. And so, when you make those quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year comparisons, you'll see somewhat unfavorable growth but it will certainly balance out pretty well as we get through the rest of the year. And then going forward, again, I think that the operating leverage is going to come from that basic tenant that we keep going back to growing at or faster than the market and controlling operating expenses to be roughly in line with inflation and modest gross margin improvement.
Dina Fede: Operator, next question please.
Operator:  We'll go next to Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Ariel Herman - Goldman Sachs:  Hi, this is Ariel Herman in for Jami. So, wanted to follow up on two things. First, is there an updated view on your thoughts around M&A and further industry consolidation? And do you guys see yourself as participating with that and if so do you guys need M&A to sustain margin expansion. And then just separately going back to the revenue outlook, so I understand there is some one-time events in 2014 such as the moderate growth in swine and poultry, but 2013 also had some one-time event such as drought that I would have thought would have made good comps for 2014. So just thinking longer term, how do you get back to that 5% to 6%? And how should we think about growth in each regional segment within that overall company growth? Thanks.
Juan Ramón Alaix: Thank you, Ariel, for the question. Let me answer first the second question on the projections for 2014 and the different impact of the drought. The drought of the U.S. in 2012 had different impact depending on the species. Definitely on swine and poultry, we saw that the impact in these two species in 2013 was much softer than we expected. In fact these two species recovered very fast even in the first half of 2013 from the drought, because of mainly at that time, the meat price grew significantly. And then in the second half of the year, the prices remained high, but also the prices for corn were much lower than 2012. So, in these two species the drought had a very little impact, in fact swine and poultry for us grew by 12% and 10%. It is a different – the situation for the cattle industry. So the cattle industry in the first half of 2013 was affected by the drought but had a significant recovery in the second half of the year. So in total as I mentioned these species grew by 3% in our revenues. What we expect in 2014 is to have full-year of normalized weather conditions. But, because of the projections on cattle are now positive, the ranchers have decided that to increase the herd. The result of increasing the herd as I mentioned will be less animals place in the feedlot where the majority of the process are used and then the better situation in terms of weather conditions will be in some way offset by the fact that there will be fewer animals to treat in the feedlot. If I move to the first question in terms of my views in terms of M&A. So definitely, it has been a lot of news recently from other animal health companies, I think we will not enter in speculating what will be the outcome of all these strategic reviews that other competitors are making. We are convinced that our internal growth will be supporting our objectives of growing in line or faster than the market in this companion animal growth in middle to long-term. And we see maybe opportunities on some of the complementary spaces or some of the process that will be filling gaps in our portfolio. And one important element is that we already have our market share which is close to 20%, 19%. This can create some challenge in terms of antitrust. And it is something that we will really -- understanding and monitoring all the different decisions that our competitors will be making and then we'll decide depending on what will be available in the market.
Dina Fede: Operator, next question please.
Operator:  We'll go next to Liav Abraham with Citi. Please go ahead.
Liav Abraham – Citi:  Good morning. Just one quick question on your tax rate. Rick, did you see any opportunities to reduce your effective tax rate going forward and is this a focus for you at all? Thanks very much.
Rick Passov: Thank you, for the question. We get that a lot. Tax is obviously, for a number of reasons, are out in the– somebody has their line open -- are in front of us quite a lot. I would say that we're seeing the opportunity for some marginal lowering of the effect of tax rate just based on the good cash flow generation in the business and what we see our future needs are. And in terms of what the ultimate degree of freedom is for us to change our tax rate. We're pretty much where we're going to be plus the benefit of the R&D tax credit which we'd like to see at some point during 2014 and perhaps could add the opportunity to lower the 29% by up to about 50 basis points. And then I think there that's going to be good long-term estimate of what the effective tax rate is for Zoetis.
Dina Fede: Operator, I think we have time for one more question please.
Operator:  We'll take our last question from David Krempa with Morningstar. Please go ahead.
David Krempa – Morningstar:  Thanks for taking my question. Just quick follow-up on that tax question, would you guys ever be open to an inversion that would significantly lower that tax rate but might also bringing in some human health products?
Rick Passov: That's an interesting question. I can understand the reason why it's asked. And obviously, a number of companies have found something in that strategy that works for them, but it's not something that we're contemplating.
Dina Fede: Thank you. That concludes our call. Have a good day.
Juan Ramón Alaix:  Thank you very much.
Operator:  Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. A replay of today's call will be available in two hours by dialing 1800-688-7945 for U.S. listeners and 402-220-1370 for international. Please disconnect your lines at this time. And have a wonderful day.

Operator: Welcome to the Third Quarter 2013 Financial Results Conference Call and Webcast for Zoetis. Hosting the call today from Zoetis is Vice President of Investor Relations, Dina Fede. The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, and will not be forwarded automatically. In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately 2 hours after the conclusion of this call via dial-in or on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Dina Fede, Vice President of Investor Relations. Dina, you may begin.
Dina Fede: Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to the Zoetis Third Quarter Earnings Call. I'm joined today by Juan Ramón Alaix, our Chief Executive Officer; and Rick Passov, our Chief Financial Officer. Juan Ramón and Rick will provide an overview of results, and then we'll open the call for your questions. Before we begin, let me remind you that the earnings press release and financial tables can be found on the Investor Relations section of the Zoetis website. We're also providing a simultaneous webcast of this morning's call, which can be accessed on the website as well. And a PDF version of the slides representing and a transcript of the call will be available on the website later today. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of the certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statement in today's press release and our SEC filings, including, but not limited to our 2012 10-K and our 2013 10-Qs. Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP adjusted figures exclude the impact of purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs and certain significant items, such as the recurring costs of becoming a stand-alone public company. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and in the company's 8-K filing dated today, November 5, 2013. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. We believe that providing these views of our performance, which are used by management to evaluate the business, will enhance your understanding of our financial results. Finally, let me remind you that since Zoetis was not a stand-alone company in 2012, our financial statements covering periods prior to the IPO were derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of Pfizer. These financials include allocations for direct costs and indirect costs that were attributed to the animal health business of Pfizer. As such, the combined financial statements for these periods do not necessarily reflect what the results of operations would have been had we operated as a stand-alone public company, which can make comparisons to the prior periods difficult in certain instances. With that, I will turn the call over to Juan Ramón.
Juan Ramón Alaix: Thank you, Dina, and hello, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Today, I will walk you through the continued progress Zoetis is making and share my perspective on some of the trends impacting our company, our industry and the customers that we serve. Let me start saying that I am very pleased with our third quarter results, 9% operational revenue growth and diluted adjusted EPS of $0.34. Once again, our diverse portfolio of products across geographies, species and therapeutic areas was a key factor in delivering results during this quarter. This performance also illustrates the value of the contribution that Zoetis colleagues around the world bring, and the strong and meaningful partnership we have developed with our customers. I will outline the highlights of our business segment performance, and then Rick Passov will provide some additional comments on our financial results. At the segment level, Zoetis continues to see the benefits of our business model, and we saw growth across all regions. Some of this growth reflects more normalized weather patterns for our customers in North America, continued market acceptance of our products, new launches such as vaccines for swine and poultry in certain countries, the continued focus of pet owners on the health of their animals and our focus on emerging markets. These more than offset the challenges in some of our markets related to competitive market dynamics, changing regulatory environments and economic conditions. Now for a few highlights of this performance. In Asia Pacific, we saw strong growth in markets like India, China, Thailand and New Zealand. These were somewhat offset by the ongoing impact of drought conditions and livestock problems Australia. On a year-to-date basis, the APAC region grew 5% operationally versus total company growth of 6%. However, we expect the region to deliver growth for the year largely in line with the total company growth rate, as conditions in these diverse markets are expected to improve. In Canada, Latin America, we saw growth in our 2 largest markets in the region, Brazil and Canada, as well as Venezuela. In Brazil, we saw strong growth in poultry while cattle sales were relatively flat. In Europe/Africa/Middle East, we delivered strong growth from livestock products in emerging markets such as Russia, Turkey and South Africa, and growth in companion animals business, mainly in Western Europe. And finally, in the U.S., we saw growth across all segments of our business. In particular, cattle products experienced significant growth compared to the same quarter last year, which was hurt by the severe drought conditions. Although cattle placement declined in the third quarter compared to 1 year ago, September trends were positive, and the market anticipated favorable trends to continue into October. The expectations of increased cattle movement have resulted in higher demand for animal health products in the third quarter. From a global perspective, livestock sales grew by 8% operationally and companion animal sales grew by 11% operationally. Again, through these results, we see the strength of our portfolio, scale, global presence and business model. Weather conditions continue to improve for many of our livestock producers. This is, of course, positive news for those who have been managing their businesses in often very difficult circumstances during the last 12 months. But challenges remain for our customers in Australia, where the drought is having a significant impact. In the third quarter, we also saw continued disease outbreaks in both the livestock and the companion animal sectors. These outbreaks can have a serious impact on the health of animals, and in the case of livestock producers, in their profitability. You may recall on our last earnings call that I talked about the outbreak of the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, or PEDv. The virus typically affects pigs in the nursery and it has sadly continued to spread. The disease has been reported in at least 17 U.S. states. There is no vaccine at this time, and producers and veterinarians remain on high alert. Of note, researchers of the U.S. Department of Agriculture say that PEDv does not pose a threat to human health or to food safety. We are closely monitoring the situation and its impact on our customers. We do not currently expect this outbreak to materially impact our 2013 financial results. Zoetis continues to support the University of Minnesota with the development of a rapid diagnostic test for the disease, and collaborating with the university is just one way in which Zoetis is investing in finding a solution to combat the virus. Also, in the Asia Pacific region, we have partnered with authorities in Taiwan to respond to their first confirmed cases of rabies in more than 50 years in the country. We work with the Taiwanese government to import 700,000 doses of rabies vaccine, Defensor 3, and this enabled the government to implement its emergency vaccination program and mitigate the spread of the disease to animals and humans in the country. This quarter's performance has been achieved while we continue our efforts to stand up our company and to build out our infrastructure. This includes, as examples, opening Zoetis offices in a number of European locations and establishing our own financial shared services teams. This and other projects are all focused on enabling Zoetis to operate independently. We continue to partner with regulatory agencies around the world to bring new, innovative animal health products to the market, as well as new formulations and indications, combination of products and geographical extension of our existing portfolio. During this quarter, and of particular note, we saw that APOQUEL has now received approval from the European Commission. Total market approval for this product include the United States, New Zealand and 27 countries in Europe. APOQUEL is indicated for the treatment of certain types of pruritus in dogs at least 12 months of age. In the U.S. and EU, roughly 8.2 million and 5.2 million dogs, respectively, are treated for itchiness. There are a number of factors that can trigger an itchy reaction such as infections, dermatitis and parasites. The length of treatment using current products varies from days or weeks for acute cases of each, to months for chronic allergic dogs. Options to address itchiness in dogs, including the type and length of any product prescribed or suggested, will vary based on diagnostics and the treatment philosophy of the veterinarians and the preference of the pet owners. We also recently received approval in the U.S. of 2 generic formulations of ractopamine, a beta-agonist. The 2 products will be marketed as ENGAIN, which has been approved for swine, and ACTOGAIN, which has been approved for cattle. We currently expect these products to launch sometime in 2014. As you may know, ractopamine is a feed additive that helps cattle and pigs direct their food energy towards producing high-quality lean meat rather than fat. The product has been safely used for more than a decade and widely adopted in the U.S., Canada, Australia and Brazil. We are excited to bring these products to Zoetis, and most importantly, to our customers. In addition, through our approach to managing our existing brands, we are actively pursuing claims extensions for launching existing products into new geographies. We receive multiple approvals around the world each quarter. This enables to enhance our brand portfolio of products, and a few examples from this third quarter include BOVI-SHIELD GOLD ONE SHOT, which has been approved in Canada for use in cattle. Canada decisions builds on the recent approval for this combination of product received from the U.S. in the second quarter. FACTREL has been approved for use in the U.S. with LUTALYSE for fixed-time artificial insemination of dairy cattle. Its approval allows producers to improve the reproductive performance of their herds. Also in the U.S., we saw approval of EXCENEL RTU EZ for cattle and swine. These are the formulation of one of our existing products, EXCENEL RTU, with an improved delivery method making the product even easier to use. We will launch this enhanced product to U.S. cattle and pork markets in the fourth quarter. All these activities enable us to deliver our innovation and capabilities to both existing and new markets, and leverage our global presence and scale to benefit customers around the world. I would now like to mention another topic we have discussed in the past. We are expecting the U.S. FDA to issue final guidance 2013, which will establish the procedures for eliminating growth promotion indication for medically important antibiotics. Zoetis supports the U.S. FDA's efforts, and we are committed to working with our veterinary and livestock producer customers through this process. As we said previously, we don't expect this to have a material impact on our future financial results. With 3 quarters now reported in our first year, I am very pleased with how we are meeting our commitments to customers, delivering financial results and setting a solid foundation for our future. External benchmark data shows that during the first half of the year, Zoetis revenue grew faster than the market. Data for our current quarter is not yet available. I continue to see great potential in our business and our industry over the coming years, and look forward to continuing our discussions. And with that, let me thank you for your attention and your interest in Zoetis. And I will now hand the call over to Rick and ask him to walk us through the third quarter financial results and guidance for 2013. Rick?
Richard A. Passov: Thank you, Juan Ramón. I'll now provide some additional details on our financial results for the third quarter. Revenue was approximately $1.1 billion, an increase of approximately 8% year-over-year, including a negative impact of 1 percentage point from foreign exchange. Excluding this FX impact, revenue grew 9%, and I will discuss the key drivers in a minute. Turning to net income. Reported net income of $131 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.26 decreased by 19%, primarily driven by certain stand-up costs associated with our full separation from Pfizer. On an adjusted basis, net income of $172 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.34 showed an increase of approximately 12% and 10%, respectively. The adjusted net income excludes the impact of $8 million of purchase accounting adjustments and $33 million of certain significant items, including stand-up costs associated with our separation from Pfizer. Turning now to our adjusted net income statement. Revenue was up 9% operationally, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. As Juan Ramón indicated, our operational increase was supported by higher sales across all species. Companion animal growth was driven primarily by higher sales in large developed markets, while livestock growth benefited from more normalized weather patterns in North America and good growth in many emerging markets around the world. However, we continue to see a negative impact on cattle revenues in Australia from ongoing drought conditions, while cattle revenues in Brazil are being impacted by increased local competition. Adjusted cost of sales was approximately 34.7% of revenues versus 35 -- excuse me, 34.5% in the year ago quarter. This reflects the impact of product mix and faster growth in emerging markets, partly offset by the benefit of relatively higher growth in the U.S. Adjusted SG&A increased 9% operationally, in line with our revenue growth, while adjusted R&D expense decreased 1% operationally. Adjusted net interest expense was $29 million in the third quarter of 2013, reflecting our debt issuance in January of this year. Adjusted other income and deductions in the quarter decreased to income of $7 million in the third quarter of 2013 from income of $10 million in the third quarter of 2012. Our effective adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was approximately 29.5%. And again, our adjusted net income increased approximately 12% to $172 million for the third quarter or 16% operational growth. Now on to our segment results, which I will discuss on an operational basis. Segment earnings are pretax numbers and are reported on an adjusted basis. Beginning with the U.S. third quarter revenue was $495 million, an increase of 10%. Sales of livestock products grew 11%, driven by cattle, poultry and swine. Results reflected increased volumes and the benefit of price increases taken in the first quarter. We saw strong growth in sales of cattle products, the largest contributor to livestock growth, which benefited from an unusually weak year-ago quarter, when the impact of the drought was most evident. Sales of poultry products were driven -- were strong as well, primarily due to medical feed additives. Swine products increased, driven primarily by continued customer acceptance of new products. Meanwhile, sales of companion animal products grew 10%. This increase was driven by sales of small animal products, reflecting the benefit of price increases taken in the first quarter, as well as the positive impact of promotional efforts. And equine sales were relatively flat. U.S. segment earnings increased 23% due to strong revenue growth, favorable product mix and timing of certain promotional spend. Now turning to our Europe/Africa/Middle East region. In EuAfME, third quarter revenue was $270 million, an increase of 9% operationally. Sales of livestock products grew 7% operationally. This reflects an increase in cattle product sales across many emerging markets, tempered by a continued decline in sales of cattle products in Western Europe due to challenging market dynamics and the competitive environment. Sales of swine products continue to benefit from customer acceptance of a new vaccine across many markets. Sales of companion animal products grew 15% operationally and benefited again this quarter from increased sales associated with third-party manufacturing agreements. Excluding these sales, companion animal product sales grew approximately 5% operationally. This growth was driven by sales of anti-infective and parasiticide products for small animals. EuAfME segments earnings increased 1% operationally. The benefit of increased revenue was largely offset by the unfavorable impact of product and geographic mix. In addition, results in the year-ago quarter were favorably impacted by certain adjustments, which can make comparisons to prior periods difficult. Turning to our Canada and Latin America segment or CLAR. Third quarter revenue was approximately $171 million, an increase of 9% operationally. Sales of livestock products grew 6% operationally, driven by sales of cattle and poultry products. Cattle product sales increased primarily due to growth in Venezuela, Canada and Mexico, while sales in Brazil were relatively flat, reflecting the impact of increased local competition. Sales of poultry products were driven by medical feed additives, primarily in Brazil. Meanwhile, sales of companion animal products grew 19% operationally, largely due to growth in Canada based on the timing of the parasiticide season, our ability to maintain market share gained from a competitor supply issue in the year ago quarter and the timing of price increases. In addition, we continue to benefit from increased demand in Brazil. CLAR segment earnings increased 24% operationally. This increase was primarily driven by revenue growth and favorable product mix. In addition, results in the year ago quarter were unfavorably impacted by certain adjustments, which can make comparisons to prior periods difficult. In APAC, third quarter sales were $167 million, an increase of 7% operationally. Sales of livestock products grew 8% operationally, driven primarily by growth in emerging markets across swine, poultry and cattle. Increased swine product sales came from continued customer acceptance of new products in China. Poultry product sales benefited from ongoing customer acceptance of products in emerging markets and the resolution of a license registration issue in India. Cattle product sales growth was primarily driven by performance in New Zealand, partially offset by the impact of prolonged drought conditions in Australia. Sales of companion animal products grew 3% operationally, driven by increases in developed markets, such as Japan and Taiwan, and in emerging markets such as China. This growth was partially offset by declines in Australia due to increased competition. APAC segment operating earnings increased 3% operationally. This reflects unfavorable product and geographic mix and increased investment in promotional activities. Now let us turn to guidance for full year 2013. We have reported 3 quarters in the fiscal year and remain confident in our ability to deliver on our full year financial guidance. As a result, we are narrowing our adjusted financial guidance for the full year 2013 to reflect our performance year-to-date. We now expect adjusted EPS of between $1.38 and $1.42 per share. In addition, we remain on track to the guidance we gave for non-recurring costs related to stand-up activities and the remaining integration costs associated with prior acquisitions. Year-to-date, we have booked $147 million for these non-recurring costs. These costs, along with purchase accounting adjustments, are excluded from our adjusted numbers. Subsequent to the third quarter, we have taken the following decisions that will result in onetime charges of up to approximately $20 million and which will be reflected in fourth quarter reported results. We recently integrated research and development for our branded generics business into our global R&D operations. We are exiting assets associated with manufacturing intermediate ingredients for certain products that we believe we can source more effectively from third parties. And finally, we have decided to divest certain assets in our aquaculture business. Including all of these items, which will be excluded from our adjusted numbers, we now expect the range of total non-recurring costs to be between $200 million and $240 million for fiscal 2013. So including the impact of these items, our reported diluted EPS for the full year is now expected to be between $0.98 and $1.02 per share. Finally, we continue to evaluate opportunities to improve our operations and assess the carrying value of certain assets based on changes in events and circumstances. At this point, I don't expect any ongoing reviews to materially impact the range for non-recurring costs that we are providing with this update. Our annual guidance reflects our confidence in the diversity of our portfolio, the strength of our business model and our view of the evolving market conditions for animal health products this year. That concludes my prepared remarks, and now we'll open the line for questions. Dina?
Dina Fede: Thank you, Rick. Operator, we're ready for our first question, please?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.
Christopher T. Schott - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Just had a couple parted question here. So we saw a strong recovery in the U.S. kind of livestock and cattle market this quarter. How do you see the market growth playing out from here as we look out the next year or 2, as grain prices have normalized? I guess, what are you hearing from your customers on herd recovery? I'm just trying to understand how that dynamic plays out as we annualize these drought comps. And the second question was on expenses. We saw a step-up in SG&A this quarter. Is this a sign of higher spend going forward? Or are we just seeing some promotional spend as this livestock market recovers?
Juan Ramón Alaix: Thank you, Chris. Let me answer the questions and maybe Rick also will add some comments. On the U.S. livestock, a significant portion of the U.S. is related to cattle. We saw this quarter that cattle performed extremely well. But again, compared to last year, where the drought conditions were affecting the business significantly, we expect the last part of the year normalized in terms of movement of animals to the feedlot. It is true that we have fewer animals than last year. We expect also that the cattle business will take 2 to 3 years to rebuild the herd. And this is what we had been already communicating, that in cattle it takes longer to rebuild the herd, while in swine and poultry we have seen that this recovery has been much faster. And this is also reflected in our revenues, because in the first 9 months, poultry and swine in the U.S. have performed very well. In terms of expenses as SG&A, so we had in the last quarter the delay on the parasiticide season. And also related to that, we decided also to postpone some of the promotional activities until the time of the parasiticide season. This occurred in the third quarter, and the third quarter has been impacted in terms of promotional expenses that were mostly delayed from the second quarter. In terms of expenses, we are reconfirming our guidance. And you can see that we have also lowered the upper range of our guidance on expenses, SG&A as well as R&D. Rick, you want to add any other comment?
Richard A. Passov: The only thing I would add is that if I look at total operating expense in Q3 versus Q3 of last year, we're slightly better. If I look at total operating expense year-to-date through this year versus last year, we're more than slightly better. Also year-to-date, we're under where we expect to be for the full year and that gives us the ability to continue to support promotional spend into the fourth quarter. And the last thing that I would say is that, in addition to the timing of promotional spend in the third quarter that Juan Ramón described, there is also the increase in enabling functions spend, which is higher, Q3 versus Q2, than it has been in the prior quarters. So when I look at total SG&A, this quarter being basically where it was last quarter and better year-to-date, including the enabling functions spend, we're definitely on track to where we expect to be.
Juan Ramón Alaix: Operationally, in terms of revenues, we are growing year-to-date by 6%, while expenses are growing year-to-date only by 2%.
Operator: And we'll go next to Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray.
Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: I guess, first off, on the new products that you talked about, Juan Ramón, APOQUEL, EXCENEL and the beta-agonist, just wondering if you could give us some color on how you expect these products to ramp into 2014? And then also, we saw a small acquisition this quarter -- or after the quarter closed in October, Advanced Food Technologies. Wondering if you could give us some more color on the size of that deal, and what else you guys are looking at on the M&A front?
Juan Ramón Alaix: On APOQUEL. So definitely, APOQUEL, it's a product that is expected by the market. It's covering unmet need to treat dogs suffering from itchiness. The current treatments are corticosteroids and also some other products that are available to the veterinarians. Also, in some cases, the veterinarians are also using many different alternatives, different pharmaceuticals to treat these dogs. We expect that in 2014, when the product will be launched, the adoption will be gradual, switching current treatment to APOQUEL. We are convinced that, in the long term, APOQUEL will be an important product in our portfolio. In terms of beta-agonist, so we are also entering into this market with 2 generic formulations: one for swine, the other one for cattle. The swine product will be launched in the first quarter. The cattle product will be launched in the second half of 2014. Again, so it's something that we think that will be an opportunity for Zoetis to incorporate 2 products which are used by livestock producers in the U.S, and also will fill a gap that we have in our portfolio, that we'll be able really to offer to our customers a larger range of products and solutions to treat and to prevent diseases. In terms of the acquisition of -- that we also announced in this quarter, it's a small company. Definitely, it is small, but it's following the strategy that we already started some years ago to really complement our portfolio, our core business, vaccines and pharmaceuticals, with complementary spaces. And we entered in devices, in poultry devices, with the acquisition of Embrex some years ago. We also have now in diagnostics with the acquisition of Synbiotics. We're also offering services to our customers, and these food safety products also will complement our portfolio. And we will enter in a space that it's growing importance because its consumers and also governments are demanding higher food safety, and we think that we can bring our commercial strength and also our expertise in R&D to really leverage this acquisition. That, again, is a small one and we have some revenues in 2014, but not significant earnings.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll move next to Louise Chen with Guggenheim.
Louise Alesandra Chen - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division: My question was if you had any thoughts on some of your competitors who have been talking about spinning out or selling their animal health businesses. And I was just wondering how that may affect you, or what do you think about that?
Juan Ramón Alaix: Well, I must say that -- thank you for the question, Louise. We are focused on making sure that we are meeting our objectives in 2013 and at the same time that we are standing up Zoetis. As you can imagine, this has significant complexity that we need to manage, but I think we are showing that we are able to manage the complexity and delivering strong results. I think it's something that -- speculating on other companies, I think, is probably something that we should not really enter, but continued focus on delivering the value to our customers and our shareholders.
Operator: We'll go next to Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group.
Mark J. Schoenebaum - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Just -- maybe just building on the last question. If Novartis or Merck were to decide to part with their animal health company, would that something you guys would consider bidding on? Or should we, as investors and analysts, really think about that as outside the scope of your capabilities right now, given some balance sheet constraints, as well as maybe some F -- perhaps FTC issues? And then given the SG&A in the quarter, over the long term, Rick, is it reasonable that investors should still expect the SG&A, as a percent of revenues, to decline over the long term?
Juan Ramón Alaix: Well, I would -- thank you, Mark, for the question. And maybe I will repeat that it's -- this is something that other companies are really considering a strategic option for their animal health business. We are convinced that we have the critical mass and also the diversity in terms of our geographies, species and therapeutic areas to be successful. Definitely considering M&A will be part of our model. But at this point it's something that we need to really to ensure that we are meeting our commitments in 2013 and '14. And in terms of M&A, I would say that, at this point, we are focused on areas that will be smaller, will be complementary, filling gaps in our portfolio or adding some complementary spaces, like the acquisition that we just announced. In terms of SG&A, maybe, Rick, you want to answer this question?
Richard A. Passov: Sure. So Mark, as you can see, in 2013, there's very good operating leverage in the business. In 2014, as we've spoken about in the past, we're going to continue to build out our own infrastructure, look across all of our processes and gain operating efficiencies, and we think that continues to drive operating leverage. And beyond that, I'm not going to make a long-term prediction. But I do think that the leverage that we see in '13 can be sustained, especially as we get into 2014, to some degree.
Operator: And we'll go next to Tony Butler with Barclays Capital.
Charles Anthony Butler - Barclays Capital, Research Division: The question's around the initiation of your eCommerce business earlier in the spring. You made reference to a number of customers that had signed up and a number of customers that had used it, and I wondered if we could get an update? And then on the same thought, Rick, is there some reason that, that, certainly in the U.S., I recognize, can -- or is it already demonstrating some improvement in overall operating margin?
Juan Ramón Alaix: In terms of the eCommerce, it's true that I provided some details on the last call. I don't have in front of me what is the number of customers that are already signed off on this eCommerce. What I had is the feedback of the U.S. team has been positive, and the feedback from our customers is also very positive. So I think it's something that we are adding to the way that we are interacting with customers, and we see as additional way of really providing support and services to our customers. In terms of the improvement in operating margin, you mean for the U.S. or in general. I think it's -- definitely, we are committed and is something that we mentioned many times that we are committed to grow our revenues in line or faster than the market. And we are also committed to improve margin faster than revenues. And we'll achieve that over time by the right actions in terms of gross margin, the cost of the products sold, the right strategy in terms of pricing and control on our operating expenses. And we are convinced that this is something that we'll be able to deliver in the future.
Operator: And we'll go next to Robert Willoughby with Bank of America.
Erin E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: And this is Erin filling in for Willoughby this morning. First question on SG&A expense again. So should we think about some of your cost structure initiatives as essentially being pushed out into 2014? Can you discuss those dynamics, just flesh it out a little bit? And then my second question is in U.S. companion animal. It was also very strong. Are these trends sustainable going forward? And how should we think about the underlying utilization trends for the companion animal segment, in the U.S. in particular?
Juan Ramón Alaix: We'll have the opportunity to discuss about our 2014 guidance next year. We don't see, at this point, any reason why what we have been describing in the past will change, and we are confident that we will continue with discipline in terms of SG&A and having the right level of investment to support our revenue growth aspirations. The U.S. companion animal business, as you said, it's doing very well in the U.S., and we are growing in all the different categories. Definitely, with the launch of APOQUEL, we expect also to generate growth in the future in 2014. And we think that the level of our business model, which is, as we said many times, direct interaction with customers; deliver innovation; at the same time that we deliver innovation, also making sure that we protect our existing portfolio with new formulations or combination of products, new combination of vaccines; and also the quality of our manufacturing are very strong elements really to sustain our growth in the companion animal business in the U.S., as well as in other markets.
Richard A. Passov: Erin, I'll just add a little bit to the comment that you made on SG&A. There's nothing kind of off-track or that's changing in terms of how we see spend evolving this year. In the guidance that we're giving you now, we are actually narrowing our full year guidance for SG&A, as well as R&D. So with respect to our expectations as we gave them to you in April, we're performing at or better than how we expected there. Quarter-to-quarter, there are variations in spend, partly, as we had said earlier, in Q1 and Q2, the pace of spend on the enabling functions was somewhat slower than we expected, and then also, as Juan Ramón pointed out, higher promotional spend in the second half. But the guidance that we're giving you now, if I can point out again, is narrowed versus April. That includes our expectations of spend for the full year. And as I pencil through that guidance, I get to the performance, the operating leverage that we expected and therefore, the kind of expense control that we believe exists in the model.
Operator: And we'll go next to Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.
Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And Rick, I don't mean to beat a dead horse. I think the surprise this quarter was the nice top line beat, which didn't translate into an earnings meet. And if I look out at models, we are assuming improvements in operating margins. And I'm just, again, trying to understand if there's still significant juice enough just by achieving synergies or efficiencies as a stand-alone company, or eventually will we have to see further consolidation with, specifically, your business model in order to see improvements in operating margins going forward, sort of beyond 2014, if you could kind of speak broadly?
Richard A. Passov: Well, again, I mean, I think I would just, again, reaffirm the guidance that we're giving you. The way I look at this is at the beginning of this year, we set out to achieve the operating leverage that we've discussed, and we're basically on track to do that. And the narrowing of our total year spend, I think, reinforces that. And again, quarter-to-quarter, there are going to be variations in spend to either support various promotional campaigns, or in this particular quarter, the growth in enabling functions year-over-year. And when I include the total cost of supporting our own infrastructure and compare the Q3 of '13 to the Q3 of 2012, and basically were on top of each other, I think, in my view, that's actually a good sign coupled with reaffirming the full year guidance. So I don't -- I wouldn't read anything into this particular quarter in terms of changing what we believe the operating model is for this business, this year or going forward.
Juan Ramón Alaix: And Jami, let me add to what I mentioned on the previous question, that our financial model for the next 5 years is to grow in line or faster than the market. The market is expecting to grow compound annual growth of 6%. We expect our margins growing faster than revenues and there will be, with the right control of expenses, that we expect to grow in line with inflation and also control on our cost of goods and also the pricing strategy. This will result in really improving long term, in this 5 years of period, improvement in terms of our margins. We don't need, at this point, any further consolidation. We have already the critical mass that we need. And that's really, with the critical mass and with the investment that we made already in most of the markets that we operate, we are confident that this will generate synergies in the future.
Operator: We'll go next to David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.
David Risinger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: So with respect to the M&A outlook, it seems, Juan Ramón, that you downplayed the opportunity to do larger acquisitions. But as you think about the business and creating shareholder value and the opportunity to boost the value of Zoetis' stock, could you just talk about whether you would consider stepping up the company's market share through a larger transaction to take the market share globally from, let's say, 20% currently to maybe 25% or 30%? I would think that, that would boost the value of your share significantly, even if you were to issue equity to do such a deal. So I guess, maybe my 2 questions are: Why shouldn't that be an opportunity? And second, how do you see M&A building shareholder value if you won't consider medium- to large-sized deals?
Juan Ramón Alaix: Thank you, Dave. And I think, as you can imagine, so nothing should be excluded, at least from the internal analysis of exploring opportunities. What are the conditions that we need really to meet for any acquisition, small, medium or a large? A strategic fit and the financials really are supporting the investment. The experience that we had when we acquired Fort Dodge, at the time, we were a company of $2 billion, Fort Dodge was a company of $1 million -- $1 billion. We divested 10% of the combined companies, a little bit more than 10% because of antitrust issues. Now with a market share of 20%, you can imagine that the challenge in terms of antitrust will be even higher. And this is something that we need also to include in any analysis, because we know that paying a premium price for integration[ph] and divesting at a lower price because of FTC regulations or European Union regulations will be probably not the right decision for our shareholders. We'll continue analyzing, exploring and definitely, if it makes sense, so then we'll make that call.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray.
Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Just 2 quick follow-ups. First, I assume this really didn't happen, but did you see any benefit with Zilmax coming off the market? I know, obviously, you didn't have a beta-agonist. Just wondering if there was any other product that could have seen a bump in growth? And then second, do you have plans to ramp production of any specific product category? It looks like medicinal feed additives or maybe implants, I believe, has been a weaker category over the last few years. Wondering now if you have the ability to increase production as a stand-alone company?
Juan Ramón Alaix: Let me probably start with answering the first question with a general comment. I don't think it's positive for the animal health industry that any product is facing regulatory issues or customer issues. And this is something that definitely all companies are exposed to this kind of risk. And I think it's something that, in some cases, this can benefit some of the competitors operating in this space. We decided to launch a generic of ractopamine independently of any kind of issue related to Zilmax. And we are convinced that the product that we are launching had really something that will help producers to enhance productivity, and also to achieve the quantity of meat and affordability of meat that is required by consumers. In terms of plans to ramp any specific category, I think one of the advantage that we have in our portfolio is the diversity in terms of many multiple dimensions, including therapeutic areas. We are convinced that there are areas that are generating some opportunities short term, while others will generate opportunities in more longer and medium term. We want really to make sure that our strategy is really covering these opportunities in all short and long term and definitely we have products in medicinal feed additive. We also have products in implant. And we continue really ensuring that we offer to our customers a complete range of products and solutions to treat or prevent diseases in their animals.

Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and descriptions of certain factors that could cause the result to differ I refer you to the forward-looking statement in today's press release and our SEC filings including, but not limited to our 2012 10-K and Q1, 2013 10-Q. Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures which were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or U.S. GAAP. Our reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S GAAP measure is included in the financial table that accompany our earnings press release and in the company's 8-K filing dated today, August 6th, 2013. With that I will turn the call over to Juan Ramón.
Juan Ramón:  Thank you Dina and hello everyone. Welcome to our earnings call. I’ll share highlights of the progress Zoetis is making now that we’re a fully independent company but to start let me go right to the numbers. I’m very pleased with our 4% operational revenue growth and diluted EPS of $0.36. I believe this performance further illustrating the continuous strength of our company and what we’re creating. I’ll now share some of the highlights of these results and then Rick Passov our Chief Financial Officer will provide further details of our performance. So first to the results, in Asia-Pacific the drought conditions impacted our livestock business in Australia and New Zealand. While we’ve seen growth in Asia markets. In Canada, Latin America we saw positive growth driven by a companion animals in Brazil and Mexico and we also saw growth in our swine business across the region. In Europe, Africa, Middle-East, the performance in the Western Europe continue to be affected by a tough economic conditions and along cold winter that impacted the parasitic campaign for companion animals and also cattle. Our poultry and swine business has performed well during this quarter in this region. And finally in the U.S. we continue to see a good momentum. Driven by a companion animal poultry and swine, we also have seen recovery in our cattle business based on the improvements on the 2012 drought conditions. In terms of species and on operational basis companion animal are livestock both contributed to the 4% second quarter growth in revenues. We saw operational growth of 5% in companion animal largely driven by the performance in the U.S. and major markets and operational growth of 3% in livestock driven by swine and poultry. While weather conditions and economic challenges in certain countries were a factor in our overall results, the financial performance for the quarter continues to demonstrate how our global scale, local producers (ph) and diverse portfolio can help us deliver steady revenue growth across the year. With all these factors we reaffirm our full year guidance for 2015. Economic and business are related factors for some of our customers are improving. For example we’re excited to see some encouraging signs of the easing of the drought impact in the U.S. With the price of the pork now lower than in 2012 we anticipate that positive evolution in the livestock industry. We expect to see the impacts of this improvement over the second half of the year and for the market to start to return to pre-drought activity in the coming 12 weeks (ph). We’re also aware of new factors which are emerging and negatively impacting our customers. Swine produces in the U.S. are experiencing an outbreak on the Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus. A similar virus impacted the swine industry in China in 2012. We’re committed to support the U.S. pork producers in standing and controlling PEDV and we’re partnering with the stakeholders including a various academic institutions such as the University of Minnesota (ph). The performance of this quarter has been achieved while we’ve been working through many of the challenges of becoming independent. Since our last call Zoetis formerly separated from Pfizer. The separation was officially completed as of June 24, generating a significant number of new investors in our company. This operation was also the culmination of two years journey to create the world’s largest independent company solely catered at animal health. And while Pfizer continues to provide a number of services to our business to a range of transitional service agreement and (inaudible) manufacturing and supply agreement, we’re actively building resources we need to operate on our own and at a cost base that is appropriated for our business. We’re equipping Zoetis with a right size infrastructure to meet our global business needs, for example we’re making progress on the implementation of our own global share services and our HRA systems. We also relocated our global headquarters and in doing so reduced the cost associated with these office space. I’m proud of what the team has achieved and the way in which we’re managing the recent transitions with appropriate levels of rigor and discipline and I’m particularly proud that through all this work we’ve remained focus on keeping our commitments to our customers. We continue strengthening our business model, with this commitment to our customers and also through innovation, for example in April of this year we launched an e-commerce site for our U.S. customers. The new shopping site enables our customers to order process they need directly from Zoetis 24/7. We have seen strong customer feedback on the convenience and performance of the site and a steady increase in volumes through these channels. As of the end of the July we have more than 3250 U.S. base customer register and more than 2700 of them have already ordered through the site. We continue to make progress on bringing innovation to marketers through new products and the productive life cycle management of our existing brands. In this quarter there are many examples of this approach and I’m please to share with you some of these. All our, the outcome of the process that delivers strong results and continues to deliver innovation for our customers and in the animal health industry. We make our strategic investments in research and development based on four criteria, strategic fit and important to our current portfolio. Technical accessibility of development and manufacturer. Return on investment and the need of customers and the market, colleagues in commercial manufacturing and R&D work together to ensure that all needs are considered in our investment decisions. This approach provides sustainable productivity and enable us to deliver an industry leading portfolio, for example an investment decision we made six years ago was to develop a noble product. We have first in class (inaudible) of action. This product is APOQUEL. The U.S. FDA approved these asset in May of this year and in July European Committee for veterinary medicinal products or CVMP adopted a positive opinion recommended the granting of a market authorization for APOQUEL. This represents an important step in the produce approval process in the European Union. APOQUEL is indicated for a console of pruritus associated with allergic dermatitis and a control of atopic dermatitis index who are (inaudible) pruritus or itching is the most common sign of allergies index. Developed by Zoetis researchers APOQUEL is the first Janus kinase inhibitor approved for veterinary use that target the itch and inflammation pathway and also provide fast acting relief, (inaudible) there are an estimated 8.2 million dogs that suffer from short or long term allergic skin conditions. We understand that these are serious issues for dogs and very frustrating and distressing issue for pet owners. APOQUEL was recently the topic of a symposium at the American Veterinary Medical Association Annual Meeting. The reaction we saw from the veterinarian was very encouraging and there was a lot of engaging discussions about the product and the very real benefit it will bring once they launch. We’re not only investing in industry leading that research but also in the life cycle management of our existing portfolio. This enable us to achieve the greatest value for both Zoetis and for our customers. For example in this quarter BOVI-SHIELD GOLD ONE SHOT a vaccine for cattle who help prevent respiratory diseases was approved in July for the U.S. market. Life cycle investment over the past 30 years (inaudible) have contributed. A significant percentage of the total revenues for the BOVI-SHIELD product growth. (Inaudible) secured a meaningful claim extension in Japan making the product available to protect (inaudible), DRAXXIN 25 injectable solution and anti-infective are really used in cattle and swine was approved in the U.S. at the new lower concentration that is more suitable for pigs. Again our commitment to grant license management with this franchise has contributed a meaningful percentage to total DRAXXIN revenues over the years. And we have successfully registered pull back IVQX in a number of new markets this quarter including Germany, Romania, Bulgaria and South Africa. This vaccine was first approved in France in 2010 and this indicated to reduce respiratory infections in pork. And finally I’m pleased to confirm an important milestone with our joint venture in China. July saw the approval for RUI LAN AN a new high standard of innovation against a highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome. The vaccine combines the global expertise of Zoetis and a strong local vaccine and developmental program to address the needs of swine produces in China. They have also leading the pork production nation. Each of these examples further demonstrate our ability to leverage the three core interconnected capabilities of Zoetis. Our direct sales and marketing model, our leadership in product research and development and high quality produces and rely on supply. So as we look ahead we remain confident in our ability to demonstrate profitable growth and now as a full independent company. I’m excited about the opportunities and also the challenge that lie ahead and I know we’re prepared for them. With that let me thank you for your attention and your interest in Zoetis and I will now hand the call over to Rick and ask him to walk us through the financial results.
Rick Passov:  Thank you Juan Ramón, as you mentioned we’ve become a fully independent company since the last earnings call and with more than 400 million shares exchanged in the Pfizer offer we have many new shareholders in Zoetis and hopefully many of you are joining us today. This is just our second earnings call so let me take a minute to recap the basis of how we will be presenting our financials before we get into the results. While the results are reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP our commentary will largely speak to financial results on an adjusted basis these adjusted figures including adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share are non-GAAP measures, they exclude the impact of purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition related costs and certain significant item such as the non-recurring cost are becoming stand-alone public company. We also sight operational results these figures exclude the impact of foreign exchange and demonstrate the underlying performance of our business. Operational results are used by management to evaluate the business and we believe that providing these use of our performance we will enhance your understanding of our financial results. And in addition to the company’s overall income statement our financial reports and discussion also reflect how we manage our business on a regional basis as you can see in the tables accompanying our press release we provide revenue and pretax earnings for our four regional operating segments as well as our consolidated results. We also provide supplemental revenue breakdowns by livestock and companion animal categories for the regions to provide additional insight into our quarterly and year-to-date results. And as you know Zoetis was not a standalone company in 2012 so our financial statements for 2012 in prior years in our public fillings happen to heighten the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of Pfizer. These include allocations for direct costs and indirect costs that we’re true to the animal health business at Pfizer and as we noted the combined financial statements for 2012 do not necessarily reflect what the results of operations would have been had we operated as a standalone company. As a result this can make comparisons to the prior year difficult in certain instances. Turning to our financial results for the second quarter now, revenue was approximately $1.114 billion and increase of approximately 2% year-over-year including a negative impact of 2 percentage points from foreign exchange, excluding this FX impact revenue grew 4% and I’ll discuss the key drivers in a minute. Let me turn to net income, reported net income of a $128 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.26 both decreased by approximately 26%, this decrease was primarily driven by certain standup cost associated with a full separation from Pfizer as well as a non-recurring onetime benefit in the year ago quarter related to our allocated portion of our Pfizer tax settlement. On an adjusted basis net income of a $178 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.36 showed an increase of approximately 1% and 3% respectively. The adjusted net income excludes the impact of $9 million of purchase accounting adjustments, $6 million of acquisition related costs and $35 million of certain significant items. Turning now to our adjusted net income statement revenue was up about 4% operationally excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Adjusted cost of sales was approximately 35.9% of revenues versus approximately 34.9% in the year ago quarter. Cost of sales was negatively impacted by approximately 50 basis points related to increased sales associated with certain third party manufacturing agreements. These agreements are related to mandated divestures from prior acquisitions and the sales are reported in our Europe, APME, Middle-East segment. Adjusted SG&A and R&D expenses decreased operationally 2% and 1% respective. Adjusted interest expense was $32 million in the second quarter of 2013 a significant increase from the year ago reflecting our debt assurance in January of this year. Adjusted other income and deductions in the quarter decreased to income of $3 million in the second quarter of 2013 from income of $7 million in the second quarter of 2012, our effective adjusted tax rate for the second quarter was approximately 29.4% and our adjusted net income increased approximately 1% to a $178 million for the second quarter. On to our segment results which I would discuss on an operational basis. Segment earnings are pretax numbers and are being reported on a adjusted basis as I described earlier. Beginning with the U.S. second quarter revenue is $437 million an increase of 4%. Livestock revenue growth in the U.S. was 6%; growth was achieved across all species with contributions from cattle, swine and poultry products. Sales of cattle products returned to growth this quarter primarily based on the favorable impact of annual price increases taken in the first quarter of 2013 while volume was relatively flat reflecting the continued impact of last year’s drought. Meanwhile sales of swine and poultry products grew at a faster rates than cattle due largely to continued customer acceptance of new products and targeted marketing programs. Companion animal revenue growth was driven by a combination of annual price increases and marketing programs which were partially offset by the favorable impact of weather in the year ago quarter and the return of a competing product to the market. U.S. segment earnings increased by 12% due to revenue growth, product mix and operational efficiencies. In EuAfME, second quarter results were $278 million an increase of approximately 1% operationally. As we expected second quarter sales in EuAfME were impacted by the unseasonably cold spring weather which delayed the start of the parasiticide season for both livestock and companion animal products. Livestock revenue in EuAfME declined 2% operationally rightfully due to the clients in cattle and sheep products which offset growth in swine and poultry. Companion animal revenue grew 6% operationally this growth however was largely driven by the third party manufacturing sales I mentioned earlier without these sales underlying companion animal product sales were relatively flat and the timing of price increases year-over-year which had a positive impact in the first quarter of 2013 resulted in a negative impact in the second quarter due to purchases being made in the events of price increases. And then overall market conditions primarily in seven year remain challenging due to continued weak economic environment. And finally EuAfME segment earnings increased 1% operationally based on lower expenses in the third quarter. In CLAR, second quarter sales were 213 million an increase of approximately 4% operationally. Livestock revenue growth grew 4% operationally driven by swine and poultry products while cattle product sales declined primarily in Brazil. Companion animal revenue grew 6% operationally driven by increased demand and successful marketing programs in Brazil and Mexico partially offset by the favorable impact in Canada of a competitive supply issue in the year ago quarter. CLAR segment revenue, CLAR segment earnings increased by 7% operationally. This increases was primarily driven by revenue growth while expenses were relatively flat. In APAC second quarter sales were a 186 million, an increase of 7% operationally. Livestock revenue grew 5% operationally driven primarily by higher demand and the continued acceptance of new swine products. This growth was achieved despite challenging market conditions for pork producers in Southeast Asia. Companion animal revenue grew 13% operationally due to the increased penetration of key brands as well as the successful launch of new products in the region. APAC segment operating earnings increased 11% operationally this reflects revenue growth in flat operating expenses which were partially offset by unfavorable mix. Now let us turn to guidance for full year 2013. We remain confident in our ability to deliver on the financial guidance and are reaffirming all aspects of our 2013 financial guidance for the full year which calls for just EPS of between a $1.36 and a $1.42 per share. As part of certain significant items we continue to expect non-recurring cost largely related to standing up the company between approximately $200 million and $240 million in 2013 which will be excluded from adjusted numbers. A reaffirmation of our guidance for onetime cost of $200 million to $240 million includes two largely offsetting items in the second quarter. First is noted in our prior filings the completion of our separation from Pfizer triggered the accelerated vesting of certain equity awards generating an additional expense of $31 million in the quarter. In addition of this quarter we have changed our restructuring plan that have been reserved for in 2012 while we were part of Pfizer. The reversal of this reserve of $27 million was accounted for as part of the restructuring charges related to our non-recurring costs. Due to evolving local requirements we believe we can achieve our objectives in a more cost efficient manner. As a result of these two offsetting items our guidance for non-recurring costs also remains unchanged. So including all of these items our reported diluted EPS for the full year is expected to be between $1 to a $1.06 per share. While our quarterly results are subject to variability related weather patterns and herd management decisions among other things our annual guidance reflects a confidence in the diversity of our portfolio, the strength of our business model and our view of the evolving market conditions for animal health products this year. That concludes my prepared remarks and now we will open the line for questions. Dina?
Dina Fede : Operator we’re ready for our first question please.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Robert Willoughby with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Anne Wilson - Bank of America: 
 :
Juan Ramón: So we define our expenses based on marketable committees and also the activities that we think that are needed to support our revenues. That’s why in these second quarter you saw some decline of expenses but is the result of really identify the opportunities that we need to really maximize during the quarter and then allocate the resources based on these opportunities. Maybe Rick you can expand on some additional comments.
Rick Passov: Sure, first of all and thank you for the question. A couple of things to note in our expenses to-date there are a couple of what I would call program changes as we went into 2013 to lower compensation and other costs as a percent of revenue and you will see the benefit of that throughout the year. In addition as one Ramón said there has been good expense control into this year and also spend on advertising and promotional campaigns not occurring as a result for example of the parasiticide season in Europe being delayed. And then finally for the second half of the year we expect the same seasonality in our expenses as a percent of revenue in 2013 that you saw in 2012 aside from some carve out anomalies particularly in the fourth quarter of 2012.
Dina Fede:  Next question please.
Operator: Yes. Our next question comes from Louise Chen with Guggenheim. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Louise Chen – Guggenheim:  I was curious as to if you could give more color on when you will expect recovery for your cattle sales and what do you incorporated into your 2013 guidance for that. Thank you.
Juan Ramón: And definitely we anticipated that in 2013 we will see the impact of the drought, the drought has been having lower impact than expected in poultry and swine and cattle is inline with the industry expectations and sure for the growth impact. Positive signs on the cattle industry is that the price of the grain and especially the corn is now much lower than in 2012 and also projected to be lower in the last part of the year. So this is a good indicator that we will see significant movement of animals from pasture to (inaudible) large and this will increase the opportunities for animal health care products. So we see that the recovery of cattle will be happening in the second half, definitely the number of animals it's lower than in 2012 but at the same time because of the price of beef is still positive the value of these animals also is higher we expect that the producers will invest really to keep these animals healthy and productive.
Rick Passov: I’ll just add two points to that, with respect to your comment on this has baked into our guidance, I’ll just point out that Q3 of 2012 was the quarter where we really experienced the impact of the drought especially in the cattle market and so in Q3 of 2013 we are expecting relatively good growth quarter-over-quarter and then in Q4 of 2012 you saw I don’t want to say an anomaly but the decisions that livestock producers are making to call herds made Q4 relatively a good quarter for us so if you balance those two things across 2012 and compare them to 2013 that’s included in our guidance that we’re reaffirming today.
Dina Fede: Operator next question please.
Operator: Yes, this comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Chris Schott – JPMorgan: Just a bigger picture question here, you’re seeing some nice leverage in your P&L over the past few years, as we think about the longer term model for Zoetis is there any reason we should anticipate that your margin progression or improvement slows, we’re going to stabilize this at any point in the next few years if in fact the company is able to let’s say grow inline with a mid-single digit type of top-line growth or maybe see more broadly for the industry.
Juan Ramón: Well we have provided guidance for 2013, we have not provided yet guidance for 2014 definitely we will provide at the end of the year these guidance. So in 2013 the guidance that we’re providing is showing a significant improvement in our margins and we are convinced that the price leverage we will have a positive impact in our growth margin, our efforts in attempts of being more efficient and for our manufacturing also have positive impact and the discipline in managing our expenses and going by our expenses lower than our revenues. We have a positive impact in our earnings per share. So in summary we’re convinced that we have the elements to make products in terms of margin and we will provide guidance for 2014 at the end of the year.
Dina Fede: Operator next question please.
Operator: Absolutely. This will be from Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Kevin Ellich - Piper Jaffray:  I guess could you may be talk about capital allocation and potentially what you guys could be looking at on the acquisition front and then I was also wondering if you could also mention what’s driving that weakness in Equine and when you expect that to recover?
Juan Ramón: Let me answer this question in general and maybe Rick will provide some of these from other comment. So in the next couple of years we will be funding a certain onetime cost which are related to a standing up (inaudible) company including new systems, including the infrastructure also including the separation of our some plants that were also co-located with Pfizer. We also have some obligations in terms of our debt, these debt it's come in due between 2015 and 2018 for more than $1 billion that really after all these couple of years or three years will be a really discussing that what will be the allocation of capital. That’s really in terms of long term we will follow a prudent cash management philosophy to assure that we meet our commitments and also we balance the needs of our key shareholders. We expect to be a company that strikes the right debt balance when allocating that capital for long term growth and returning cash to investors. Rick maybe some additional comments on the onetime cost or maybe the debt situation.
Rick Passov: Well I think Kevin you also asked about the Equine? So the only thing I would add to the point one Ramón made is just to say that yes after we get through a period of elevated cost we would like to be a company that demonstrates very strong capital discipline in how we allocate capital. And the Equine market we’re seeing couple of factors first of all in Canada very significant slowdown in Equine sales due to perhaps a cyclical or maybe a longer term impact in the horse-racing industry, economic and similar factors also impacting on sales on the U.S. and generally in few other regions as well. So, it's a profitable business for us but we’re certainly watching what happens in that market to understand the permanence of some of the trends that we’re seeing now.
Dina Fede: Operator next question please.
Operator: Yes, this will be Jeff Holford with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Jeff Holford - Jefferies: So now that you’re separate from Pfizer are you able to comment a bit more about 2015 and some of the service agreements and step-ups for the (inaudible) just how you’re thinking about how you might be able to mitigate some of those increases in charge kind of those agreements? Thank you.
Juan Ramón: I guess that you’re relating to the service that we have up for manufacturing?
Jeff Holford – Jefferies: On manufacturing, SG&A and R&D I think there is some levels particularly in manufacturing.
Juan Ramón: Okay let’s then focus on manufacturing, so the manufacturing we’ve agreement there for which Pfizer is producing for us certain products at cost for the next two years from the separation. After these two years their aim is also including a margin increase of 15% and these at the time of the separation we also evaluated about 30 million, the team has been already working on reducing these 30 million and I’m pleased to see that this amount has been reduced by half already and we’re working at really to reduce even further before 2015. So you see that is something that we’re working hard really to minimize the impact and the impact has already reduced significantly.
Rick Passov: And maybe I will just comment on some of the areas, the other areas that you mentioned. On R&D, R&D has been standalone in animal health since about 2003. I mean I think that the majority of the relatively small amount of transitional services that Pfizer was providing to the animal health organization are pretty much behind us and on SG&A there is a good amount of work, a significant amount of work that remains to move us to our own transaction or financial service organizations as well as to move us off of the IT, the information technology services that Pfizer is providing to us. I mean that will be generally complete by the end of 2015 for the IT services and generally by mid to late 2014 for transaction finance services.
Dina Fede: Operator next question please.
Operator: Absolutely. This is from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets: First on the U.S. companion animal business, it appears a bit slower than we expected I think only 2% operational growth. I was wondering if you can comment on that further and whether it was related to the entry of the competitive product and your outlook for that business and if a follow-up if I may how much improvement do you see in manufacturing and could you comment on your longer term product mix expectations. Thank you.
Juan Ramón: I will answer the first question and then Rick will answer the improvement in manufacturing. In companion animal I will describe that in the second quarter we had two impacts, the most important one was related to the cold weather and we already described these cold weather also effecting Europe companion animal parasiticide campaign. The cold weather also in the U.S. delayed the implementation of parasiticide products to protect animals against ticks and fleas and this had an impact in our companion animal segment. We also saw that our competitor was back to the market and for our closed revolution (ph) these had an impact on the dog segment although on the feline segment the impact was insignificant. So overall I think with the performance of the companion animal has been in our opinion positive and we expect also that in the second half of the year will remain positive evolution. The companion animal we have seen that the number of adoptions it's inline with expectations, we also have seen that the number of visitor to clinics it's growing and also the amount that pet owners are spending on animals is also increasing. So all these indicators are providing are good projections for the second half of the year.
Rick Passov: On your question on manufacturing and our outlook going forward, I will just say a couple of things, there is good progression from Q1 to Q2 but I think that shows good continuous improvement, good cost containment, we continue to outlook opportunities to increase the load on our network as we make decisions on how we will transition product made for us by Pfizer today either to a third party manufacturer or to ourselves and then it's these capabilities that we’re demonstrating now that will apply to our long term goals beyond 2015 which we haven't numerated at this point.
Dina Fede: Operator next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Liav Abraham of Citi.
Liav Abraham – Citi:  Just a question on the Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus that has recently emerged in the U.S. Can you comment on your exposure to swine within your U.S. livestock revenues and whether you anticipate the impact of this virus to have any, to be material at all on your U.S. livestock business in 2013? Thank you.
Juan Ramón: Definitely these PEDV outrage is concerning situation for many of our producers. There are a couple of elements which are important to understand that from these, so first it's not effective the (inaudible) it's affecting only the piglets and second there is no known food safety issue that also can be a concern from consumer. So these are two elements that are important to consider when we discuss about PEDV. The PEDV is not a new disease, has been already in many markets and in China had an impact in 2012. We don’t project any significant impact in our revenues in 2013 and the impact has been already incorporated in our guidance but definitely we will continue working with our customers, with producers. We ensure that we minimize the impact of this disease in their operations that can have in some of them an impact in terms of profitability and in terms of really making sure that the operation is generating the revenues and profit that they are expecting and second we’re working with different stakeholders including academic institutions and one of these institutions is the University of Minnesota. We’re partnering with University of Minnesota really to identify ways to protect animals and ensure that this disease is not affecting our producers. But I want to really confirm that all these impact has been incorporated in our 2013 guidance and we do not expect a significant impact in our revenues and profits.
Dina Fede: Operator next question please.
Operator: Yes, this question is from Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: I have two questions on the revenue side, first is based on the mid-point of your 2013 guidance you’re forecasting higher revenues in the second half versus the first half. You mentioned a recovery of cattle sales and I just want to know what are the other key operational reasons for the pick up or if it may just be due to seasonality. Second question I had is you continue to see as you mentioned weakness in Europe, when did you see that abating and what strategy including potential M&A do you have in place to grow the European business.
Juan Ramón: According to our guidance for 2013 definitely the second half will go faster than the first half and the main reason for these growth is that in 2012 we had a significant impact because of the drought, the third quarter and also the fourth quarter was impacted by the drought and the drought affected not only cattle but also affected swine and poultry in 2012. So we have seen already that poultry and swine are responding very well to these market conditions and we expect cattle to recover in the second half of the year and we have positive signs the price of the corn and also the our interaction with customers are indicating that cattle will be performing better in the second half than in the first half. All these elements are really included in our guidance and are projecting stronger growth in revenues in the second half. In Europe definitely the economic conditions in Southern Europe are affecting Western Europe but in our reporting segment we’re including Europe/Africa/Middle East at least and while in Western Europe we’ve seen the negative impact of the economic crisis and also the cold conditions in the second quarter that affected companion animal and also cattle in terms of parasiticide campaigns, we have a market in this region that are growing very nicely so countries like Russia or Middle-East or countries in Africa, South Africa especially are growing very fast. So we’re confident that the combination of markets in Europe also will provide positive growth in the future. Maybe a comment that is related to what are the projections that the analysis (ph) are making for Europe for the next five years, so they are projecting that Europe/Africa/Middle East will be growing around 4% to 5%. So again so we expect that Europe/Africa/Middle East will be positive region for Zoetis.
Rick Passov: Let me just add just a couple of points on your comment about seasonalization. So just going back to what Juan Ramón said Q3 in 2012 was the first quarter where we felt the significant impact of the drought and Q4 to a degree we rebounded from that based not on any easing of the drought but on the decision that livestock produces made to call their herds, there is in addition to that a degree of natural seasonality in the business where Q4 tends to be a stronger quarter and to some degree Q2 as well. So hopefully that helps as well.
Dina Fede: Operator next question please.
Operator: Yes, this question is from Tony Butler with Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Tony Butler - Barclays Capital:  If I may stay with seasonality because parasiticide in the U.S. and Europe have been delayed in Q2, would you expect them or are you seeing signs that those are actually helping Q3 again in the U.S. and Europe and if you expect that to be robust in Q3 relative to last year, does that actually cause a mix shift especially in the U.S. and hurt profits yet help profits in Europe. Thanks very much.
Juan Ramón: We have seen that weather conditions in terms of warm conditions both in the U.S. and Europe are robust (ph) to normal situation and (inaudible) protecting now animals with antiparasiticide in a normal way. So this means that definitely we will see that Q3 will be a normal quarter in terms of the use of parasiticide products. And maybe you can answer in terms of the second question of Tony.
Rick Passov: I will just add a little bit in the sense that say in Europe to the extent that you have an absolutely shorter season because cold weather did last longer, you may not make that up over the course of the year and then the mix impact it's not significant enough to really drive anything at all level, yes, relatively speaking there has been a little bit of a mix impact because we’re not getting the sales in parasiticides we’re getting them somewhere else but not enough at the combined level to really change the flow of the numbers.
Dina Fede: Operator next question please.
Operator: Our next question is from David Krempa with Morningstar. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
David Krempa – Morningstar:  Can you talk a little bit more about what was causing the decline in gross margin, I know you called out one factor causing the 50 basis point decline but what was causing the other decline especially after you raised prices in the first quarter?
Rick Passov : Sure. I think the decline that you’re referring is to versus the prior year, so if I just start progression Q1 versus Q2 you see a nice improvement in gross margin over 50 basis points and now it's on track with our expectations for the full year and we believe gets us to our guidance for the full year which is between 35% and 36% and then as I called out in my comments we have a third party manufacturing business that almost exclusively relates to our having to supply product for divested products to those companies that bought those products these were mandated divestures as part of the our Wyeth, Pfizer acquisition of Wyeth and our acquisition of Fort Dodge which was a part of that and the seasonalization of those orders versus the prior year causes a year-over-year comparison that’s unfavorable and then finally the carve-out financials in the prior year have some anomalies in them in part the progression of just better understanding how to allocate center cost and Pfizer to animal health and some onetime impact from changes in mark-up and system programs that were reflected more in the second quarter than in the other quarters which make the number that we show you in Q2, 2012 and our carve-outs some of the anomalies versus the progression in 2012 and cost of goods sold for the full year. So hopefully that helps. I think the main point from my perspective is looking at Q1 to Q2 we’re still on track for our targeted 35% to 36% for the full year.
Dina Fede: Operator next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open. 
Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs: 
 :
 :
Juan Ramón: Based on industry projections and I have said this also they are projecting that the animal health will be growing between 5% to 7% as you mentioned. We’re confident that the fundamentals of these growth are valid, the production (ph) growth and also the emerging markets increasing significantly the consumption of animal proteins will drive these growth that will be a positive in livestock but also more adoption of pets in emerging markets that will increase companion animal. So we’re confident that this growth it's realistic and we’re also confident that we can be growing inline or slightly ahead of this growth depending on the years. On 2013 as we mentioned even if the first quarter has been affected by the drought conditions we have seen positive sign that make us confident that the second half of the year will be much positive for the industry and we’re affirming our guidance for 2013.
Dina Fede: Operator we have time for one more question please.
Operator: And our last question is a follow-up from the line of Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Kevin Ellich - Piper Jaffray:  I just have two quick follow-ups here, I’m curious about the cattle growth in the U.S. and then down in Latin America just wondering if you have any explanation what’s going on in those two markets and one Ramón I just was wondering on the e-commerce business what’s your expectations and maybe if you can provide a little bit more color that is going to be something like VetStreet in the industry?
Juan Ramón: Let me start with the e-commerce and then I’ll go to the question on cattle. So definitely the e-commerce it's not like VetStreet, it's different tool so what we’re doing it's really we’re providing customers they go through there really to place orders and directly through the system and rather than sending the orders on paper now they can place their order through this e-commerce and this is really accurate in much easier way to really order from Zoetis. The other advantage is that the systems its open 24/7 so they can place orders anytime they need. Definitely this is something that we see as a complimentary with all the interactions that we have with our customers so we will remain having face to face interactions but in terms of these administrative work of orders we can do it in a way that it's easier and more efficient for them and also for us. In terms of cattle in the U.S. and in both regions the drought has affected because even in the drought was related to the U.S. the drought in the U.S. drove the price of grains and drove the price of corn which is a key element for feeding the animals and also achieving the quality of the meat that the consumers are demanding. Definitely in the U.S. we had some additional opportunities in the second quarter and that’s why you may see some difference in terms of growth in these two regions but overall I think the market for both U.S. and CLAR. In our opinion it's showing positive signs and we will see also growth in the second half in CLAR and also in the U.S. Also the U.S. has been very having positive evolution in terms of exports and this has also have a positive impact in the revenues of the U.S.
Dina Fede: That concludes our call. Thank you for your participation and interest and have a good day.
Juan Ramón: Thank you Dina. And to those who are joined us on today’s call we appreciate your questions and time spent with us today. So, thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. A replay of today's call will be available in two hours by dialing 800-688-7945 for U.S. listeners and 402-220-1370 for international. Please disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Welcome to the Zoetis First Quarter 2013 Financial Results Conference Call and Webcast. Hosting the call today from Zoetis is Vice President of Investor Relations Dina Fede. The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relation sections of Zoetis.com.  In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of the call via dial-in or in the Investor Relations section of Zoetis.com. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only-mode and the floor will be open to your questions following the presentation. (Operator instructions) It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Dina Fede. Dina, you may begin.
Dina Fede: Thank you. Good morning everyone and welcome to the Zoetis First Quarter 2013 Earnings Call. I am joined today by Juan Ramón Alaix, our Chief Executive Officer; and Rick Passov, our Chief Financial Officer. Juan Ramón and Rick will provide an overview of our business, our financial results for the quarter and our 2013 guidance. We will then open the call for you questions. We are also providing a simultaneous webcast for this morning's call. For your reference a PDF version of the slides we're presenting and a transcript of a call will be available on the website later today. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and descriptions of certain factors that could cause the result to differ I refer you to the forward-looking statement in today's press release and our SEC filing including, but not limited to our 2012 10-K. Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures which were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or U.S. GAAP. Our reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S GAAP measure is included in the financial table that accompany our earnings press release and is a company's 8-K filing dated today, April 30th, 2013. With that I will turn the call over to Juan Ramón.
Juan Ramón Alaix: Thank you, Dina, and hello everyone. Thank you for joining today's earning call. I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak with you about our results for the first quarter of 2013. Since our IPO in February, the entire Zoetis team has been focused on establishing our new company. The 9,000 plus Zoetis colleagues are on the world have demonstrated their passion for building on our six decade history and singular focus on animal health to continue to bring our customers quality products, services and commitment to their business. It has been a crucial time as we continue to establish our new company, and I am very pleased to share that the work we are doing is already paying up. In the first quarter 2013, we reported revenue growth of 4%, 5% operational and adjusted net income growth of 18%. The performance demonstrate our commitment to continue to grow earnings through right allocation of resources and the pursuit of our growth strategies. We believe that our diversity across many dimensions is our competitive strength. These dimensions include region, species, product and therapeutic area. One example that reflects this strength is the performance of our U.S. business. Here, the drought continued to impact sales of our cattle products. This was balanced by a growth in companion animal sales and strong performance of our poultry and swine products. As Dina mentioned, Rick Passov, our Chief Financial Officer, will provide more details of information associated with each of the regions related on the call. He will also provide our full-year 2013 net guidance. Let me first highlight the three interconnected capabilities of Zoetis which I believe continue to contribute to the overall performance of our company. The first of these is our direct sales and marketing model. Our worldwide geographic footprint enables Zoetis to have a field force present in about 70 countries, in both develop and emerging markets. We are active in 120 plus countries and we are leader in nearly all of the main regions in which we operate. We work constantly with our customers to provide them innovative products, services and support that will make a difference for their businesses. We also strive to make doing business with us easy, efficient and meaningful. The second capability is leadership in product research and development, which is best evidence through our expenses and the diverse product portfolio. In addition to our R&D program for new products, we also apply a focus on brand lifecycle management. These involve efforts to improve the performance and delivery of our current product lines, the expansions of product indications across species and the pursuit of approval across new geographies. For example, in Japan, we recently achieved registration of Fostera PCV, a vaccine for swine respiratory diseases. Also, in Japan, we recently launched DRAXXIN, an injectable antibiotic for cattle and swine. That is one of our top-selling products globally. And in China, we saw a launch of Convenia, an antibiotic for cats and dogs, first launched in European and European Union in 2006, which is now one of our premier companion animal products. And finally, on our capabilities, our high quality products, which are delivered by our world-class manufacturing operations. We continue to play some important emphasis on our internal factoring and supply capability. It provide us with key advantage in the animal health care market.  We are continually looking to enhance our operation effectiveness and bring innovation to our processes. These will increase our manufacturing efficiencies and expand production margins. Most importantly, these have been achieved while delivering high levels of the quality and consistent levels of supply. In spite of economy crisis, weather-related challenges around the world and even disease outbreaks in some countries, we believe the fundamentals of our animal health industry are very strong. What we are seeing today on longer term provides continued opportunity for our company. The population of our world continues to grow. By 2050 it could be more than 9 billion people. In addition, emerging markets are seeing growth in the middle class sectors of their societies. These factors are creating increased levels of consumption of animal protein at a time of limited natural resources including at our land and water. These are significant opportunity for animal health companies that can bring the innovation to face the challenge to produce more with less. Furthermore, improved standards of living are leading the high levels of pet ownership and more spending on the medical care of these animals. These creating opportunities to grow trend in similar expenditure within the pet care sector both in established and emerging markets. Here, at Zoetis, we are continued to partner with veterinarians and livestock producers across the globe to better understand the ways in which we can support them. For example, last month in Argentina we signed an agreement with a large dairy partner to perform genomic tests on their herds using Clarifide, a genetic marker. Through the use of these products, Zoetis is helping these partners to make informed decisions and manage their livestock more efficiently. As well as work under taken to maintain our market leading position and support our customers, we are also delivering on our plans to stand up the company. I’m pleased with the proudest we have made on this important work since the IPO and the plant we have in place to progress this. And with that, let me thank you for your attention and your interest in Zoetis. I will now hand over to Rick Passov, our Chief Financial Officer, and ask him to walk us through the financials. Rick?
Rick Passov: Thank you, Juan Ramon, and let me add my welcome to everyone joining us today. When we conducted our pre-IPO road show a few months, we enjoyed the opportunity to introduce the financial community to Zoetis. With today’s conference call, we look forward to beginning a regular cycle of communication with you. Let me begin by explaining the basis of how we present our financial this year. While our results are reported in accordance with US GAAP, our commentary will largely speak to financial results on an adjusted basis. These adjusted figures including adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share are non-GAAP measures. They exclude the impact of purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs and certain significant items such as the non-recurring costs of becoming a standalone public company. We also cite operational results, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange and demonstrate the underlying performance of our business. We believe that providing these views of our performance, which are used by management to evaluate the business, will enhance your understanding of our financial results. Our financial results reflect how we manage our business on a regional basis. In addition to the company’s overall income statement, we provide revenues and earnings for our four regional operating segments, the United States, Europe, Africa and Middle East or EuAfME; Canada and Latin America or CLAR; and Asia Pacific or APAC. While we manage the business by regional segments, we are also providing supplemental information about each segment's total revenue broken down by livestock and companion animal categories. These and other additional details are included in the tables accompanying our press release, which are also located on our website. Given we were not a standalone company in 2012, let me briefly discuss the basis for our year-over- year comparisons. As indicated in our recent 10-K filing, our financial statements for 2012 and prior years have been derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of Pfizer. These include allocations for direct costs and indirect costs, which were attributed to the animal health business of Pfizer. Some of these allocations, for example, were for certain support functions that were provided on the centralized basis within Pfizer such as expenses for certain aspect of business technology, facilities and other corporate functions. Pfizer will continue to provide some of the services to Zoetis under transitional service agreements or what you may hear us call TSAs. As we noted in prior filings, the combined financial statements for 2012 do not necessarily reflect what the results of operations would have been had we operated as a standalone public company. As a result, this can make comparisons to the prior year difficult in certain instances. First quarter 2013 financials will include allocations from Pfizer through our IPO. For all periods going forward, our results will be based on a direct cost associated with the standalone operations, not allocations. Those results will include costs related to services we receive from Pfizer under the TSAs that I mentioned. Turning now to our financial results for the first quarter of 2013, our first quarter 2013 revenues were approximately $1.09 billion, an increase of approximately 4% year-over-year including a negative impact of 1% from foreign exchange. We reported operational growth across each of our regional segments led by increased revenues in the US segment. Reported net income of $140 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.28 increased approximately 26% and 26% respectively. On an adjusted basis, net income of $179 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.36 showed an increase of approximately 18% and 20% respectively. The adjusted net income excludes the impact of $9 million of purchase accounting adjustments, $4 million of acquisition related costs and $27 million of certain significant items. We believe this first quarter results represent a solid start of the year showing the diversity of our business across products, species and geographies, and demonstrate an ability to grow earnings faster than sales. Turning to our adjusted net income statement, revenues were up about 5% operationally excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Adjusted cost of sales was approximately 36.5% of revenues versus 37.1% in the year ago quarter. Adjusted SG&A and adjusted R&D expense both decreased approximately 3%. Since we continue to build our infrastructure, our SG&A expenses this quarter do not yet reflect our expected full run rate of expenses for 2013. Adjusted interest expense increased to $22 million in the first quarter of 2013 from $8 million in the first quarter of 2012. This increase reflects our debt issuance in January of this year. Adjusted other income and deductions in the quarter declined to a deduction of $2 million in the first quarter of 2013 from income of $6 million in the first quarter of 2012. This decline is primarily driven by the non-recurring impact of the Venezuela currency devaluation. Our effective adjusted tax rate for the first quarter was approximately 29% including the non-recurring benefit of a US R&D credit which was retroactively extended in January of 2013. And finally, our adjusted net income increased approximately 18% to $179 million for the first quarter. Now, on to our operating segment results which I will discuss on an operational basis. These segment earnings are pre-tax numbers and are reported on an adjusted basis as I described earlier. Beginning with the US, first quarter revenues were $454 million, an increase of 7%, and earnings grew approximately 8%. Companion animal revenues increased by approximately 13%. This growth reflects, among other things, continuing demand for products and the positive impact of the competitor supply issue which has now been resolved. Livestock revenues in the US grew 2% versus the year ago quarter. Strong sales of both poultry and swine products were largely offset by a decline in product sales for cattle due to the negative impact of ongoing drought conditions in the US. In EuAfME, first quarter sales were $290 million, an increase of approximately 4%, while earnings increased about 16%. These results were driven primarily by herd companion animal product sales increased to approximately 6% and by 3% growth in sales of livestock products especially in swine and poultry. Results were also favorably impacted by the timing of price increases in certain European markets. In EuAfME, we continued to see challenging economic conditions particularly in Southern Europe and we expect an unseasonably cold weather across much of Europe will likely delay the start of the parasiticide season, which normally begins early in the second quarter. In CLAR, first quarter sales were $171 million, an increase of approximately 4%, while earnings increased about 9%. Results in this region are largely driven by performance in its two largest markets Brazil and Canada. Livestock product sales increased 6% primarily due to these two markets. Sales growth of cattle products in Canada was driven a strong fall calf season, while in Brazil we saw growth in both swine and poultry product sales. Sales of companion animal products decreased 5%, primarily due to the favorable impact in the year ago quarter of a competitor supply issue in Canada. In Latin American market, this quarter particularly in Brazil we continued to see growth in companion animal product sales. Finally, in APAC, first quarter sales were $175 million, an increase of 2%, while earnings in the region increased 6%. Livestock product sales increased to approximately 3% driven largely by our sales of swine products particularly in Australia, while drought conditions in Southern Australia continue to impact the dairy industry, and Japan continues to be impacted by the ongoing economic challenges in that market. Finally, companion animal product sales in APAC increased by approximately 2% operationally. Now, let us turn to guidance for 2013. This guidance assumes a blend of actual exchange rates in effect during the first quarter of 2013 and mid April exchange rates for the remainder of the year. We expect reported revenues of approximately $4.425 billion to $4.525 billion for the full year. We expected an adjusted to cost to sales as percentage of revenue to be between 35% and 36%. Adjusted SG&A expenses are expected to be between $1.385 billion and $1.435 billion. Adjusted R&D expenses are expected to be between $385 million and $415 million, and we expect the tax rate on adjusted income of approximately 29.5% for the full year. We also expect to incur non-reoccurring costs largely related to standing up the company of between approximately $200 million to $240 million in 2013. These costs will be excluded from our adjusted numbers. While our quarterly results are subject to some variability related to weather patterns and herd management decisions, our annual guidance reflects our confidence in the diversity of our portfolio, the strength of our business model and our view of the evolving market conditions for animal health products this year. That concludes my prepared remarks and now we'll open the line for your questions. Dina?
Dina Fede: Thank you, Rick. Thank you, Juan Ramón. Operator, we are ready for our first question.
Operator: Operator instructions. Our first question comes from the site of Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Go ahead, your line is open.
Chris Schott - JPMorgan: Great, thanks very much and congrats on the first quarter out here. I just had two quick questions. The first one is just if this is your initial guidance call, can you just walk through some of the factors that could put you at the high or low end of your revenue range this year? And I guess that you were discussing that specifically what's reflected in these numbers in terms of a recovery from the drought in the US? My second question was SG&A, the guidance looking like a second year in a row here of expenses that are kind of flattish. Do you have a longer term model, I know you're not providing guidance beyond 2013, but is it fair to think about SG&A that that's flat or that we could see inflation like growth in SG&A as we think about the model evolving over the next few years? Thanks very much.
Juan Ramón Alaix: Thank you, Chris, and let me provide some comments on the two questions and probably Rick will explain some of my remarks. So, first, I think there is still some uncertainties related to the drought, and depending on the impact of the drought we will be able to really to go higher or lower in the range that that we have provided. Also, we expect some recovery in European market that also can drive some of the revenues that we expect for the year and, again, this will impact the total revenues that that will be really reported at the end of the year. In terms of SG&A, I think definitely our model is to grow revenues faster than expenses, and it is something that definitely we achieve that in the past and we will continue really growing revenues much faster than expenses. So, Rick, do you want to add some other comments?
Rick Passov: No, I think all I would add just in particular with respect to Q1 is that SG&A does reflect the pace of building up infrastructure here, and I think as you will see when you do the math, the number is a little bit less than what we expect it to be on a run rate to revenue for the full year.
Operator: We will go next to Robert Willoughby with Bank of America. Go ahead, you line is open.
Ann Wilson – Bank of America: Hi, this is Ann Wilson in for Bob today. I understand I guess the lingering effect of the drought or rain on the US livestock business near term but could you comment on the impacts of a later or possibly reduce corn planting expected this year? Would that be, potentially have a meaning for impact and how should we think about that going forward?
Juan Ramón Alaix: At this point, there are still uncertainties about the corn production in the US for 2013. We know that we moved from a drought last year from now a flood in some parts of the corn belt that is really delaying seeding corn in the US. At the same time, we know that some of the markets they saw the opportunity of the high prices of corn last year really to increase the production of corn. So, at this point, it's a little bit complicated to know what will be the level of price of corn in 2013. What we see today is that the price is lower than the record price in 2013, that it was close to $9 the bushel, and now we are around $6 and $6.5 or so. I think this is something that will create probably a better opportunity for our livestock producer in terms of the input cost.
Ann Wilson – Bank of America: Okay. Great and what was -- 
Operator: We will go next to David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead, your line is open.
David Risinger - Morgan Stanley: Thanks very much and congrats on the results. I wanted to ask two questions please. The first is a high level question about Europe. (inaudible) had said a week ago that meat supply is exceeding demand ex-US and that is slowing livestock industry growth. Could you please offer your comments on that? And then, second, a financial question for Rick. Could you talk about tax rate reduction opportunities to take the tax rate below 29% in the out years? Thanks very much.
Juan Ramón Alaix: Thank you, David. One of the strengths of Zoetis is the diversity of our portfolio in terms of the geographies, in terms of species, in terms of (inaudible) carriers. And what we have seen in the first quarter has been a reduction on sales of cattle products. But we increased significantly revenues generated by swine and poultry in many different geographies. We also had a very strong performance in companion animal. In terms of the price of the meat, I think it is -- we think that in some parts of the geographies where there where extra supply of meat and then this drop price down. But this is something that we expect some -- well, these are temporary adjustment and we do not see that this will have a significant impact in the rest of the year. We are still committed to our numbers that has been provided to here to-date. And what we will see is that among different quarters are some fluctuations in terms of the results. But definitely our industry should be really accessed on yearly basis and this were we think that we are focused on delivering our numbers at the end of the year. Rick, do you want really to maybe expand of these question and also to answer the tax rate?
Rick Passov: I will just turn to the tax rate actually and, David, just say that the tax rate that we are providing in our guidance is a good estimate of what we think our tax rate will be over the long-term, it may vary somewhat around the estimated rate but that it's clearly our intended target. And when you look at the rate comparative similarly situated multi nationals it's a rate that I think you would expect to see.
Operator: We will go next to Louise Chen with Guggenheim. Go ahead, your line is open.
Louise Chen - Guggenheim: Hi, good morning. Thank you for the question. I was curious, if you could provide more color behind the specifics that would drive down your cost of goods sold and SG&A over time? Thank you.
Juan Ramón Alaix: Okay. Thank you, Louise. And I will just provide a general comment and I will ask Rick to go into the details. Definitely, we will see in terms of cost of goods that will benefit on probably two or three important factors. One will be price increase. And I like to really confirm that in the first quarter we increased the prices across species and across geographies. And second, we also continue focus on cost improvements in our manufacturing network. In terms of SG&A, I think definitely we will continue having the right discipline in terms of allocation of resources. And we expect SG&A growing lower than revenues and this is something that has been done in the past and we will continue in the future. Rick?
Rick Passov: I will just repeat, Louise and again thank you for a question. Volume, price increase, some products moving back into our network and very good cost discipline across the country -- the company.
Operator: We will go next to Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray. Go ahead your line is open.
Kevin Ellich - Piper Jaffray: Good morning. Thanks for taking questions. I guess just wanted to ask about the strong companion animal growth in U.S. Curious as to what you think the sustainable growth is in that segment and what opportunities you see in terms of using your balance sheet and cash flow, so I guess also what are your thoughts on capital allocation may be extending it to diagnostics or something like that?
Juan Ramón Alaix: Well, thank you, Kevin. And we are very pleased with the performance of companion animal in the U.S. We are enjoying a very good momentum in terms of sales. But in the first quarter, we also had the positive impact of one competitor facing supply issues. This supply issue has been solved and this competitor is already back into the market in the U.S. But still, we think that our companion animal is very strong in the U.S. We also apply price increases in the U.S. in the first quarter, and this was well accepted by our customer which is showing the right partnership that we are having with them. And we are optimistic about the future performance of companion animal in the U.S. because I think we have right strategies, the right programs and also the interaction with the customer, direct interaction with the customer that is allowing really to maximize our product portfolio. And Rick will answer on the capital allocation.
Rick Passov: Kevin, again, thank you for the question. Our priorities for capital allocation are going to be as follows. Over the next few years, we are going to complete the stand up of our own infrastructure which will call for elevated levels of spend that we discussed both on this call and in our 10-K. We'll position ourselves for certain amount of deleveraging as we come closer to our first debt securities. We will pay the dividend that we've declared. And we will pursue some M&A bolt on acquisitions that leverage our core strengths. And then, beyond that, an ongoing capital allocation discipline is going to be hall mark of Zoetis.
Juan Ramón Alaix: Let me add one comment on companion animal in the U.S. We have seen that the visit to clinics are now increasing in the U.S. And also the expend of pet owners per pet is also increasing. So, this is good trend and our presence in many different (inaudible) areas in companion animal really providing to us quite opportunity for performance and we expect that this performance will be sustainable over in 2013.
Operator: The next to Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group. Go ahead, your line is open.
Mark Schoenebaum - ISI Group: Hey, guys, thanks a lot for taking the question and congratulations on well managed, a very well managed quarter. I had, first question is a housekeeping one. I didn’t hear on the prepared remarks. Would it be possible for you to give us price versus volume growth in both the congenial segment and the livestock segment on a worldwide basis? Also, if you could provide a regionally in the U.S., that would be really helpful price versus volume. And the second question is more like along term speculative thing, your question, but the avian flu in China. I know your China business right now is very small, but has this had any, any material impact to that small business segment for you, and maybe you can give history lesson the impact that prior avian flus have had on the business, if any? Thank you very much.
Juan Ramón Alaix: Thank you, Mark, and our prices strategy is really depending on many same factors including species, including also geographies, including also competition. So it is difficult really to provide a global comment on our price strategy. That's really in emerging markets volume is much higher than price while in developed markets price is higher than that volume. In the U.S. that's really a in, we have seen that many of the species, price has been growing at a higher rate than volume. But it is something that is part of our model and we don't see that as a negative. On the contrary, it's a good opportunity for really to apply price strategies that will maximize our margins across many different geographies and species. In terms of the avian flu, well you mentioned that it still something that it's not a significant impact. So China for us represent a little bit less than that 2% of our total revenues, and the majority of this revenues as rated in the swine business. So the poultry business, it's definitely a future growing opportunity, but it's really having a minimal impact in our total revenues. What we are concerned is really how we can really provide the support to our customers in China and also how we can minimize the impact of the avian flu in many people in China. And definitely we will see that the avian flu that, in my opinion will also be temporary, will have significant impact in our future revenues.
Operator:  We'll go next to Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Go ahead, your line is open.
Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs:  Thank you, just a couple of questions. First, as it relates to sales in Asia Pacific, it did seem to be a little light especially when you adjust for foreign exchange up only 2%, and this is the business that's been growing sort of high single digits, low double digits. I'm wondering if you can talk about how we should think about that business going forward and the factors that have put some pressure on that. And also just generally speaking, while I'm interested in your views on your company's companion animal exposure to some of your peers or some of your competitors pushing store brand OTC companion animal products and just where you see exposure in your companion animal business? Thanks.
Juan Ramón Alaix:  Thank you, Jami. On the revenues for APAC, so we grew by 2%. APAC is a combination of two different group of countries. So we have highly developed markets like Australia, Japan, Korea, and emerging markets India, China, South East Asia. In the developed markets, we saw in this quarter very strong growth in Australia. We faced some challenge in Japan and Korea and in emerging markets India also faced some challenge because of some regulatory issues that we expect to solve in the next following quarters and also some time -- one time in China. We are convinced that APAC will be significant on that growth generator in our total revenues and we expect also in 2013 APAC growing faster than the average for the rest of the regions in Zoetis. And --
Rick Passov: Jami, I just want to add that the regulatory issues pertained to product delays and are not related to manufacturing or any other part of the network. It's just taken us a little longer to get some products registered in that market in India.
Juan Ramón Alaix: Thank you, Rick. In terms of our exposure in companion animal in OTC, so we see that this segment it's mostly effecting anti-parasitic, and in our case even our anti-parasitic portfolio, its prescription portfolio. So our revolution in the U.S. it is a problem that requires a prescription of a vet. So it's not something that is really affected by the OTC. Definitely the OTC will be a challenge that we'll continue growing, mainly in anti-parasitic and anti-parasitic that will not require the precision of a vet. The majority of our portfolio, say 95% of our portfolio requires the prescription of a vet. So, in our opinion, our portfolio is not really affected by this shift from vet clinics to the OTC channel.
Operator:  We'll go next to Tony Butler with Barclays Capital. Go ahead, your line is open.
Tony Butler - Barclays Capital:  Good morning, thanks very much. Two brief questions. One is in the U.S companion Animal is quite strong, you made reference to product coming back on the market. I assume that's Sentinel related to the Revolution. Is it fair to assume that's correct? And more importantly would it also be fair to assume that that competitor would have some sort of promotional campaign underway and I'm interested more importantly about how you counter that, if you will counter that. And second, in the European market certainly culled out on the 10-K there was very strong growth for parasiticides primarily in the France and U.K. Rick, you made some comments about the delay due to weather patterns in Europe, and I just like to stress that out a little bit more. Would that imply that parasiticides would actually be -- so we have less growth on a year-over-year basis, but more importantly how do we think about that for the remainder of the year? Thanks very much.
Juan Ramón Alaix:  Thank you, Tony. And our companion animal business in the U.S., I think on top of this issue of, from some of our competitor, I think it's enjoying very strong momentum. Definitely we have seen that the competitor now is back in the second quarter and they are applying some promotional strategies and we feel comfortable that our strategies and also our presence and our direct interaction with our customers are the right way really to defend our portfolio. And that's really it, it will have an impact in the second quarter compared to last year because last year also this competitor was not in the market, but definitely it's something that has been included in our yearly guidance. So all these elements have been a part of our projections for 2013. Rick, do you want to make any comment on that?
Rick Passov: Not on that, no. 
Juan Ramón Alaix: Okay, so then in Europe, in France and the U.K. So in U.K we had the price increase in the first quarter compared to price increase in the second quarter last year. This can also have an impact in terms of the results of the first quarter. And what we see also in Europe, not only in France and U.K., in all Europe that the weather has been very cold and has been a delay on the season for ticks and flees. And definitely this can happen in the second quarter and this can also happen in fact in the total year. But this has been already incorporated in our projection for the total year. And any delay in terms of decision for parasiticides seems the animals are normally treated the mostly. This is something that will have an impact in our quarter, the second quarter, but we expect that the total year projections are the one that is going to be provided to you. Rick
Rick Passov : The only thing I would say Tony again is your right that the parasiticides season is important in Europe. You and we can all see that there's a much colder season in Europe and its delaying the start of the season and we're taking our best guess now of what the impact will be in the guidance that we're providing to you.
Juan Ramón Alaix:  One comment that is also important to remember, it's the international markets. They're closing in February and so the quarter will start March, April, May. So these are the quarter for international. While for the U.S. is the natural quarters.
Operator:  And we'll go next to site of Liav Abraham with Citi. Go ahead, your line is open.
Liav Abraham - Citi:  Hi, good morning. Two questions please, first, I'd appreciate if you could expand a little on the weakness in the Canada, Latin America region and how you anticipate that paying out for the rest of the year and when you anticipate an acceleration in growth? And then, secondly, following on from Chris's question earlier on SG&A costs, I have a question on R&D costs and these are also looking relatively flat this year with versus last year. How should we be thinking about this line item going forward? Thank you?
Juan Ramón Alaix: Thank you, Liav, and the business in Canada, Latin America grew by 4%, and this 4% I think it's something that you see in line with our expectations. So Canada, Latin America, its two big countries. Canada and Brazil they represent almost two-thirds of the total revenue of the region, and they are both countries which are highly developed in livestock and Canada highly developed also in Companion Animal. So definitely Brazil, although it's defined as an emerging market is not an emerging market for livestock because it's highly sophisticated in terms of production of animal produce. So we expect  So, we expect this region growing in line with our expectations, and again it will be some fluctuations among quarters, but at the end of the year this region -- and some of the marketing in the region will be generated in stronger growth and maybe Rick you want to cover the question on SG&A and R&D.
Rick Passov: Sure, I think the question was R&D and all I'll say is that's an important part of the value paradigm here that we do think that we can grow revenue faster than all of our expenses. I would include R&D and that generally be the effect of the this R&D is in part shown by the fact that revenues growing and earnings are growing at a faster pace.
Operator:  We'll go next to Alex Arfeai with BMO Capital Markets. Go ahead, your line is open.
Alex Arfeai - BMO Capital Markets:  Good morning, thank you for taking the questions and I'll add my congratulations as well. Two questions, are you seeing increased scrutiny by regulators as a result of recent issues in China, specifically are you seeing increased or do you see the potential for increased restrictions on use of antibiotics in livestock feed? And then as a follow-up, could you comment on the sustainability of price increases. My understanding was that a significant portion of your portfolio is subject to cheaper competition. Is pricing leverage something that we can expect going forward? Thank you.
Juan Ramón Alaix: 
. : In terms of the anti-infective, well, these are the discussions that has been on since many years. We have a portfolio in anti-infective which is excellent and its gold standards for treating sick animals in all the different species. And definitely we see that the we will continue collaborating that with many regulators around the world to ensure the right use of anti-infective. And one example of this collaboration, it’s the recent discussions and agreement with FDA to withdraw the indication for growth promotion of some of our products in the U.S., products which are medically important for human on for this indication. We expect that that this will have minimal impact in our revenues. In terms of the sustainability of price increases, 80% of our portfolio is really not patent protected, and this has been the case for many years. And even with this situation we have been able to increase our prices in a constant way in all different geographies and different species. So, we are confident that the business model that we have, which is combining direct interaction with customers and high quality of our products and reliable supply will allow us to really to continue applying in price increases in the future.
Operator: We will go next to David Krempa with Morningstar. Go ahead, your line is open. 
David Krempa - Morningstar: Thanks for taking the call. I was just wondering if you could elaborate on why you are able to drive such strong operating leverage in Europe with just a little revenue growth but big operational income growth.
Juan Ramón Alaix: Thank you, David, and I will ask Rick to answer this question. 
Rick Passov: Well, first of all, thank you for the question. Basically, from two basic factors, the fact is gross margins in Europe are healthy. So we get a little bit of leverage in the P&L from growing the top-line and as well there is good expense control on that market. And then, I would only add that quarter-over-quarter there may be some variability in the rate of earnings growth versus revenue growth. So nothing really special or outstanding there.
Operator: We will go next to Robert Willoughby with Bank of America. Go ahead your line is open. 
Ann Wilson – Bank of America: Hi, this is Ann again. What was cash flow and cash balance for the quarter, and do you have targets there for the year also on CapEx? And how is inventory management? Can you give us an outstanding balance and what you consider I guess of this big area of improvement for you going forward?
Juan Ramón Alaix: Thank you, Ann. And I will ask Rick to answer these two questions. 
Rick Passov:  Ann, as you know in our release today, we did not release balance sheet or cash flow, you will see that when we publish our 10-Q. Otherwise, we have said that in 2013 our priorities are going to be completing the separation, the elevated spend associated with that, paying our dividend. And that I do not expect significant working capital improvements this year in part because our primary focus is again all of those activities to complete the separation. And those activities include, a significant amount of product transfers and that affects our ability in this particular year to make a sole concentration on reducing inventory levels. But in general, I think you would see not a deterioration of working capital and that become a focus for us in the out years. 
Operator: And we have a follow-up form David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead your line is open.
David Risinger - Morgan Stanley : Yes, thank you. Actually, my additional question has been asked and answered. 
Operator: We have a follow-up from Chris Schott with JP Morgan. Please go ahead your line is open. 
Chris Schott - JP Morgan: Great. I think (inaudible) here. Just -- I think you are not giving quarterly guidance but anything you can talk through on quarterly progression from here just so we have kind of no surprises. I guess even at the high level, how are you thinking about stronger of weaker quarters the rest of this year based on what you can see today? Thanks.
Juan Ramón Alaix: And Chris, thank you for the question. And what we want really it's to insist that our business should really assess on a yearly basis, that there will be some fluctuations on quarters. We have stronger quarter in Q1. There was some one-time items in this quarter. And we will see that some of these items will also have a impact in following the quarter. But rather than providing a specific guidance by quarter, we prefer that you consider or assess our business on a yearly basis, because of so many factors that it can really have an influence in our quarters but that can be compensated at the end of the year. Rick, you want to answer any other question.
Rick Passov: No, I think, Chris, we have done the best job we think we can do in the comments we made on the call, as well as and what is in our press release.
Dina Fede: Operator, time for one more question perhaps. 
Operator: We have one last question it is a follow-up from Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray. Go ahead, your line is open. 
Kevin Ellich - Piper Jaffray: Hey, guy just one quick follow-up. Not to beat a dead horse here but with the drought impact in US, I was wondering if you would give us any specifics as to what is embedded in your guidance? Last year, we were hearing that herd sizes were down about 5%, now may be 7% of 9% is that what is embedded in our guidance? 
Juan Ramón Alaix: I think definitely the drought has been having the highest impact in the cattle business that the herd has been reduced compared to previous year, but it has been also -- now, it is the lowest inventory of animals in the cattle ever. And these are definitely having an impact in our reactions that has been incorporated in our guidance today. The cattle will take longer to recover because it takes two to three years to really build the herd, but at the same time, poultry and swine will have a much faster recovery because swine is six month, the cycle, in the case of poultry 45 days. So, we expect that in the second part of the year, these two species swine and poultry will be back to normal situation and for cattle it will take longer. But at the same time, we expect that the because of the low inventory also the value of the animals will be higher and the amount that producer will spend for animal will be also higher to protect the health of these animals. So everything has been included in our guidance and we expect that at the end of year we will have -- we'll be back to normal situation. So with that I like to thank you everyone for joining us today. And on behalf of the entire Zoetis team I appreciate you joining us for this today call, and I hope that we have been able to share with you some of the highlights from our first quarter and reinforce why we are positioned to continue to lead in our industry. Thank you very much.
Operator: This does conclude today's teleconference. A replay of today's call will be available in two hours by dialling 800-283-4783 for US listeners and 402-220-0859 for international. Please disconnect your lines at this time.
