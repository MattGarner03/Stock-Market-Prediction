===== 2025 Q1  (2025-05-01 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and welcome to the Everest Group, Ltd. First Quarter of 2025 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Matthew Rohrmann, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Matthew Rohrmann: Thank you, Jason. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Everest Group, Ltd. first quarter of 2025 earnings conference call. The Everest executive leading today's call are Jim Williamson, President and CEO; Mark Kociancic, Executive Vice President and CFO. We're also joined by other members of the Everest management team. Before we begin, I'll preface the comments by noting that today's call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements. Management comments regarding estimates, projections, and similar are subject to the risks, uncertainties, and assumptions as noted in Everest's SEC filings. Management may also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Available explanations and reconciliations to GAAP can be found in our earnings release, investor presentation, and financial supplement on our website. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim.
Jim Williamson: Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. Let me first acknowledge the significant catastrophic events from the first quarter. Beyond their financial impact, Everest recognizes the human toll. My team and I are proud to work in an industry and for a company that exists to support communities and businesses in their time of need. As expected, given the California wildfire and aviation losses in the quarter, our combined ratio is elevated at 102.7%. Our actual losses from these various events are within our expected ranges. In the case of California, particularly, our share of loss given Everest's size and scale in the U.S. market demonstrates superior underwriting and risk selection. Total group written premium was $4.4 billion, similar to Q1 2024. You will hear a consistent theme across our divisions. We're growing at healthy rates where risk-adjusted returns meet or exceed our thresholds. Where pricing is weak relative to risk, we are intentionally shrinking, in some cases rapidly. Excluding the cat and aviation losses, our attritional loss ratios are on track, reflecting disciplined underwriting with conservative risk margins layered on top of our loss picks in both businesses. Moving on to reinsurance. Total premiums increased from prior year, driven by approximately 16% growth in property lines or 8% excluding reinstatement premiums, offset by ongoing actions in our casualty book. As I mentioned in the Q4 call, at the January 1, 2025, renewal, our overall book shrank marginally, reflecting 6% property growth, offset by cutbacks in casualty. At the April renewal, the book grew by 5%, again led by property growth of 15%. Of note, given our strong value proposition, we continue to grow with our valued Japanese clients at attractive margins despite many programs being oversubscribed. We expect moderate cat pricing pressure for the remainder of 2025, but anticipate ample opportunities to deploy capital at attractive expected returns. We said it before, and it bears repeating, rate of price change is important, but expected returns determine our willingness to deploy capital. In property cat, expected returns are excellent. Moving on to casualty, pro-rata written premium was down almost 22% in the quarter, driven by the portfolio actions we've taken since the January 1st, 2024, renewal. Capacity in the casualty quota share market is abundant, with many markets taking up risks we view as unprofitable. We believe seeding commissions have been unjustifiably sticky. Barring a change in the environment, our book will continue shrinking. Our aviation losses in the quarter were consistent with our expectations. Out of prudence, we added 2.4 points to our overall reinsurance division loss ratio in the quarter to account for our full expected loss. Excluding that, our attritional loss ratio would be 57.4%, in line year-over-year. This reflects improvement as our book shifts towards property, offset by the conservative risk margin assumptions I noted earlier. Cat losses net of recoveries and reinstatements were $461 million, driven by $440 million from the California wildfire. This is consistent with our original expectations and does not account for potential subrogation recoveries. Moving on to insurance, written premium in the quarter was down 1.3% from prior year. Property lines grew 19%, while our specialty businesses grew 16%. This was offset by a 15% decline in our third-party book, driven by the remediation of our U.S. casualty portfolio. That remediation is proceeding according to plan and as I laid out on prior calls. In Q1, 50% of casualty written premium with renewal dates in the quarter was not renewed. This is more than prior quarters, but we are not budging on the changes needed to reach target profitability in one renewal cycle. Casualty rate increases averaged approximately 20% across commercial auto, GL, and excess umbrella, consistently above our conservative assumption for loss trend. Q4 2024 through Q2 2025 are what I would consider peak remediation. As I said on prior calls, this process will be completed by Q4. Property pricing in the U.S. is declining from previous highs. Despite this, we believe market pricing is adequate and will continue to be for the foreseeable future. Our international insurance business is developing in line with our expectations with strong growth in key markets at attractive loss ratios. The international business turned a modest profit in the quarter despite continued meaningful investment in people and technology. Excluding the aviation loss, our attritional loss ratio in the insurance business was 67.9% in the quarter, similar to our Q4 results. This was driven by an improving underlying loss ratio due to mix, offset by the ongoing prudent risk margin we apply to our picks. Moving on to reserves. Everest's overall reserve position improved since the end of 2024. It's still early days in insurance, but our international business shows clear signs of strength, driven by excellent underwriting and prudent loss picks. In North America, our loss experience is in line with our actuarial central estimate. As I said earlier, our 2025 loss picks will include a significant risk margin above actuarial central estimates, which should yield additional reserve strength over time. In reinsurance, our analysis suggests robust, favorable loss development in property lines. In casualty, loss activity remains in line with expectations. As I've said before, we will not take credit in our loss picks for underwriting actions until we know those actions are having the intended result. Respecting group capital management, we repurchased $200 million of shares in the quarter at an average price just over $348 per share. This is consistent with the comments we made on the fourth quarter call and with Everest commitment to delivering value to shareholders. Given our excess capital position, growth rate, and valuation, share buybacks are a priority and will continue to be if those conditions persist. I'll end with a brief word on the external environment. Everest has completed a thorough assessment of our exposure to the new tariff regime, and we believe prolonged tariffs at current levels would put modest upward pressure on loss cost trend. Our frequent analysis of trend assumptions will allow us to respond quickly, should inflation creep upward. And with that, I'll turn it over to Mark.
Mark Kociancic: Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Everest delivered $276 million of operating income despite significant industry catastrophe loss activity in the first quarter. Our reinsurance franchise continues to perform strongly, with successful January 1st and April 1st renewals. As expected, returns remain very attractive. We continue to progress on our one-year one-renewal strategy in U.S. casualty lines within our insurance division, and we remain on track to complete this strategy later this year. Starting with the group results, Everest reported gross written premiums of $4.4 billion, representing a 2% decrease in constant dollars, and excluding reinstatement premiums, the combined ratio was 102.7% for the quarter. Catastrophe losses contributed 13.9 points to the combined ratio, largely driven by the California wildfires. And I would note the prior year quarter had a much lower level of cat activity. The Group attritional loss ratio was 62.2%, a 330 basis point increase over the prior year's quarter. The increase was largely driven by aviation losses of $70 million, net of recoveries and reinstatement premiums, which contributed 2 points to the attritional loss ratio. As well as our conservative approach to setting initial loss picks in U.S. casualty lines, primarily within our insurance segment. The Group's commission ratio was 21.4%, consistent with the prior year. The Group expense ratio was 6.2% in the quarter as we continue to invest in talent and systems within both franchises. Moving to the segment results and starting with reinsurance, reinsurance gross premiums decreased 1.1% in constant dollars when adjusting for reinstatement premiums during the quarter. Consistent with prior quarters, double-digit increases in property lines were offset by continued discipline in growing casualty lines. The combined ratio was 103.3% in the first quarter of 2025 and included 18 points of catastrophe losses. The prior year first-quarter combined ratio of 87.3% included 2.9 points of catastrophe losses. This quarter's CAT losses were largely driven by $442 million of losses from the California wildfires, net of recoveries and reinstatement premiums. Reinstatement premiums were $62 million in the quarter, while the prior year first quarter was not impacted by reinstatement premiums. The attritional loss ratio increased 260 basis points to 59.8%, which includes aviation losses of $61 million, net of recoveries and reinstatement premiums, contributing 2.4 points to the increase. The attritional combined ratio increased 270 basis points to 87.1%. The commission ratio and underwriting-related expense ratio each improved slightly to 24.3% and 2.4%, respectively. Moving to insurance, gross premiums written were relatively flat in constant dollars at $1.1 billion as we continue to improve the balance of the portfolio and shed underperforming U.S. casualty business. We made meaningful progress this quarter with property and specialty lines, each growing in the high-teens, and this growth was offset by the aggressive underwriting action we are taking in specialty casualty lines centered around U.S. GL commercial auto, and excess liability. As a result, Specialty Casualty gross premiums written represent 25.1% of the insurance segment mix, a decrease of nearly 5 points from the prior year quarter. The attritional loss ratio increased to 68.8% this quarter. Aviation losses of $6 million contributed 0.9 points to the segment's attritional loss ratio. As we discussed last quarter, we are being very disciplined in setting and sustaining prudent loss picks based on underlying loss trends and our view of the U.S. casualty risk profile. In U.S. casualty lines, rate increases of nearly 20% on average remain well in excess of trend. Our Q1 U.S. casualty loss experience is consistent with our actuarial central estimate, which, as a reminder, is meaningfully below management's best estimate. Overall, we remain comfortable with the reserve position of our insurance division, and we're on track to publish our global loss triangles in June of this year. The combined ratio also included 1.1 points of catastrophe losses, primarily driven by the California wildfires. The prior year fourth quarter benefited from a relatively benign level of cat losses. The commission ratio increased 40 basis points, largely driven by business mix. The underwriting-related expense ratio was 18.1%, with the increase largely driven by the continued investment in our global platform and slower earned premium growth as we rationalize our U.S. casualty portfolio. Our recently formed other segment is performing in line with our expectations. The segment's gross written premiums reflect a limited number of renewed and new policies written on Everest paper by the acquirer of the sports and leisure business, which will continue for a finite period post-closing. We booked this business very conservatively and expect the segment's contribution to the Group's results to be de minimis. Moving on, net investment income increased to $491 million for the quarter, driven primarily by higher assets under management. Alternative assets generated $55 million of net investment income, a decrease versus the strong returns from the prior year quarter. Overall, our book yield was relatively stable at 4.7%, and our reinvestment rate remains north of 5%. We continue to have a short asset duration of approximately 3.3 years, and the fixed-income portfolio benefits from an average credit rating of AA minus. As economic uncertainty has increased globally, our high-quality conservative portfolio remains well-positioned for the current environment with a relatively small exposure to investments that are meaningfully impacted by tariffs. For the first quarter of 2025, our operating income tax rate was 16.1%, which was slightly lower than our working assumption of 17% to 18% for the year, driven by the jurisdictional mix of our profits in the quarter. Shareholders' equity ended the quarter at $14.1 billion or $14.7 billion, excluding $561 million of net unrealized depreciation on available-for-sale fixed-income securities. The unrealized change was a decrease of $288 million as compared to the end of the prior year fourth quarter, and this was driven by interest rate decreases. Cash flow from operations was $928 million during the quarter. Book value per share ended the quarter at $332.39, an improvement of 3.5% from year-end 2024 when adjusted for dividends of $2 per share year-to-date. Book-value per share, excluding net unrealized depreciation on available-for-sale fixed-income securities, stood at $345.57 versus $342.74 per share at year-end 2024, representing an increase of approximately 80 basis points. Our annualized total shareholder return was 5.6%. Net debt leverage at quarter-end stood at 15.4%, slightly lower from year-end 2024. Everest's strong capital position and earnings power continue to provide us the ability to pursue profitable growth and opportunistically repurchase shares. We repurchased 574,000 shares in the quarter, amounting to $200 million or an average of $348.43 per share. Assuming normal catastrophe activity, we expect to continue meaningfully repurchasing shares throughout 2025. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Matt.
Matthew Rohrmann: Thanks, Mark. Jason, we're now ready to open the line for questions. We do ask that you please limit your questions to one question plus one follow-up, and then rejoin the queue if you have additional questions. Jason, over to you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Andrew Andersen from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Andrew Andersen: Hi, good morning. You mentioned some modest cat pressure for the rest of the year. Could you maybe just talk about the opportunity within Florida at midyear and how you're thinking about growth from either Florida domestics or more nationwide carriers?
Jim Williamson: Sure. Andrew, it's Jim. Thanks for the question. Yes, I mean, our expectation is that the 06/01 renewal should be pretty attractive. Obviously, we'll have to see what terms and conditions look like, but I wouldn't be surprised if we take the opportunity to grow. And I think that would cut across both the demo tech companies, where we've had really terrific results, and we have great relationships as well as our more nationwide partners. We are seeing, I will note, some pretty meaningful increase in demand. And so a number of our clients are talking to us about buying more limit, which I think should be a favorable move around price, and obviously that's offset by the fact that people have done incredibly well in property cat, and people want to keep growing into the market. So I think it will be overall quiet attractive.
Andrew Andersen: Specific to reinsurance? And can you maybe just talk about the competitive market there, because it seems like it is getting increasingly competitive within Lloyd's.
Jim Williamson: Yes. Well, so on the reinsurance side, and by the way, I think, specialty lines are attractive across both of our divisions, both in reinsurance and insurance. For reinsurance, you did see just such a strong correction to most of the specialty lines after the beginning of the war in the Ukraine. Some of that's definitely come off, and you've seen people who have earned outsized profits are now looking to write more of that business. So it's becoming incrementally more competitive, but the bottom line is we still see tremendous opportunity across a number of our specialty underwriting areas. And I would say, areas like engineering, our parametric business look terrific, marine and aviation still look pretty good. So I think we have incremental growth opportunities there at really attractive margins. And then I think the same thing applies to insurance, and certainly both in North America and in our international markets, we've seen strong growth in our specialty lines businesses. And it looks like although there is a little bit of pricing give back in a few areas, overall, rates are still well-above what we would consider adequate, which is our trigger point for deciding to continue to grow.
Andrew Andersen: Thank you.
Jim Williamson: Got it.
Operator: The next question comes from Alex Scott from Barclays. Please go ahead.
Alex Scott: Hi, good morning. You talked a bit about growth just there and -- but you also mentioned the buyback and it being a bit of a priority and maybe meaningful for the rest of the year. And I just wanted to understand, you know, at a high-level, like how do you think about your capital capacity you have available to what degree can you do -- to which you want in terms of growth in the midyear, but also repurchase at the level you did this quarter or should we think about that escalating upwards maybe?
Mark Kociancic: Yes. Alex, it's Mark. I think we have the capacity to do both. When you take a look at how we're growing in the company, we're pretty much unconstrained with what we'd like to do in the operating plan for 2025. You've seen us grow meaningfully in property, in particular on the reinsurance side, pulling back in treaty casualty and growing in certain spots of our insurance division, and obviously shedding on the casualty side. So, no issues there in supporting the growth or any of the opportunities that we see. We also view the share price as quite attractive in terms of share buybacks. So Q1, we printed $200 million of buyback, and we think that's a meaningful number for the quarter, and I continue to see opportunities to deploy meaningful amounts of share buyback for the remainder of the year.
Alex Scott: That's helpful. Second one I had is on the casualty reinsurance business. And the question is more about the underlying primaries. Are they, in your view, taking enough action in terms of pricing that you're going to see that flow-through on what you're retaining, and it will be adequate? I just -- as an outside observer, looking at some of the indices out there, I mean, it's remained up while a lot of other lines are down, but it hasn't kind of sped upwards or something like that. So I just was interested in that perspective from the standpoint of, will you potentially have to take more action than you were originally considering if there's not enough price coming through the primaries?
Jim Williamson: Yes. Sure, Alex, it's Jim. It's a good question. I mean, look, if you look at what's happening in the underlying market, pricing is obviously strong. I don't really see anybody slowing down in terms of price achievement, but it's way more than price, right? It's portfolio management, it's claims handling, it's distribution strategy. I mean, all of those things contribute mightily to expected results. And so when we're evaluating the books of our quota share partners, we're looking across all those dimensions. And where we feel like the stars aren't aligning and where we think expected loss ratio exceeds the available economics in a deal, that's when we're walking away. Now I think we've done a lot of the heavy lifting. I mean, this process, as I've indicated a couple of times, started back in January of '24. We've moved away from about $800 million in casualty premiums that are exposed to North America. We've also, by the way, grown in some areas where we see people doing a really terrific job. And so my expectation for the outlook is probably more of the same with continued underlying discipline, rate achievement, I think will stay at elevated levels as long as people are concerned about social inflation. And for us, it's really then about how do you pick the best cedents to ensure that your loss picks hold and hopefully reveal margin over time.
Alex Scott: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: The question comes from Gregory Peters from Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Gregory Peters: Good morning, everyone. I'm going to go back to your comments on the moderate pricing pressure you're seeing in cat versus your comment about expected return. Yes, I guess, I'm trying to reconcile your targets with what you're hearing in the marketplace, especially like on the larger property schedules, excuse me, where we're hearing about pretty substantial rate rollbacks. Maybe it's embedded in what's going on in the facultative market versus excess of loss market. But just trying to reconcile the pricing pressure we're hearing about versus your desire to grow. So, I know you've already provided some answers to it, but maybe some additional clarity would be helpful.
Jim Williamson: Yes. Sure, Greg. This is Jim. Before I answer your question, I just want to clarify because it feels a little bit like you're talking reinsurance, but also insurance. So, which one are you focused on in your question?
Gregory Peters: Actually both, but primarily reinsurance.
Jim Williamson: Okay. So, look on the reinsurance side, you know, starting at the 1/1/2023 renewal, we saw a sharp upward correction in pricing. I mean, we achieved a 50% rate increase at 1/1/2023 in our U.S. treaty property book. And so the fact that rates are now coming off, and you would have seen the 4/1 renewal in Japan, maybe that was down 10%, 1/1/2025 was down a bit. Yes, it's coming off a little bit. There's a lot of interest, I think, among a number of carriers to grow in that business because rates corrected to such a point that expected returns are still very, very healthy. And so as long as that's true, those return expectations sustain themselves. I'm willing to continue to deploy capacity and capital to our best clients, and we've done very well with that strategy, and I expect that to sustain itself through 2025. I mean, there's no sign in my mind that property cat in the reinsurance business is decreasing at a rate that would make it less attractive. It's still the ROEs are still well in excess of my threshold for wanting to continue to deploy capital there. In the insurance market, so I would say sort of a similar set of facts insofar as we're coming off multiple years of rate-on-rate increases in property. So when you start to see decreases, you can still have situations, and I think we were there now where, yes, rates are down, but it's still very attractive. So you want to continue to grow. The only other thing I would add, if you look at our growth in the insurance business in the first quarter, we grew in both North America and international, but our growth is weighted toward international. And while property there's some property pricing pressure internationally, it is not to the same extent as what you're seeing in some of the U.S. market. So, bottom line, everywhere we're growing, all the points that I made in my prepared remarks around growing short tail, we're doing it because expected returns are exceptional, and that's really the only decision factor that is in our mind when we make those choices.
Gregory Peters: Okay. I guess I'll I could have a follow-up on that, but I'll just delay and just pivot to the wildfire loss you reported. The Edison International is pretty much acknowledging that they're going to have some capability in the event of the Eaton Fire. So I'm just curious how reimbursements from the California wildfire fund might flow through and ultimately come through Everest Financials if it were to happen.
Jim Williamson: Sure. I mean, our -- the vast majority of our wildfire loss, I mean, almost all of it is in reinsurance. And so to the extent that our clients receive recoveries, subrogation recoveries, what have you, that would flow back to -- that would inure to our benefit. You'll note in my prepared remarks, I was very clear that we are taking no credit for that. These processes tend to take a long time, and subrogations often will take -- in some cases, many years to unfold. So we're taking a wait-and-see approach even though we do see some opportunities or some avenues where you could see subrogation and recoveries over time.
Gregory Peters: Just to clarify, you would never sell your subrogation rights, correct?
Jim Williamson: Who wouldn't say we would never do it? I'm not really thinking about it for this particular situation. We have in the past, it really depends on the circumstances.
Gregory Peters: Great. Thanks for the detail.
Jim Williamson: You got it.
Operator: The next question comes from Josh Shanker from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Josh Shanker: Yes, my first question in the insurance segment, flat premium year-over-year. Obviously, you're doing the one renewal plan to correct the book? A lot of that was price offset by some policy losses, but what about new business? Are there areas where you haven't had a big role before that you're taking a share in right now?
Jim Williamson: And Josh, this is Jim. Are you talking specifically about casualty or the whole panoply?
Josh Shanker: I'm just talking -- talk about -- I mean, the insurance growth flat given your one renewal strategy is a very good outcome, I think. And so I'm wondering what the mix of business is that's allowing you to maintain a flat premium?
Jim Williamson: Yes. Got you. No, it's a fair point. So a couple of things. One, just focusing on U.S. casualty, as I indicated, half of the premium that came up for renewal in the quarter wasn't renewed. I mean, that's -- call it $150 million of premium, so very meaningful. That's going to get offset by both significant rate and I cited a number of around 20%, and then we did write some new business, new business in U.S. casualty is definitely lower than it was a year ago. And I think that's okay because we're writing really excellent accounts, they're loss-sensitive. They're in the right industries, they're well-priced with great clients who were usually selling multiple lines of business to. So that's a good outcome. And then if you look at the rest of North America, specialty lines growing really well over 20% in the quarter. Property growth was strong. I see longer-term, our Accident and Health business is performing really well. And so that's been a great story. And then our international business really across all dimensions. We're getting incredible traction, particularly in the U.K., Europe, and Asia, where we're writing best-in-class accounts, and that's property, accident and health, specialty lines, and casualty. So it's really, I mean, when you look at the area of the book that's really shrinking, it's all about U.S. casualty. A little bit in other pockets, workers' comp is sort of a push, financial lines coming off a bit, but pretty much everything else, we're seeing great opportunities. We're getting support from our broker client -- broker partners to continue to write new business despite the remediation, and feeling good about the quality of the business that we're putting on the portfolio, maybe most importantly. So lots of good things happening in insurance.
Josh Shanker: And then on the repurchase, there's nothing wrong with $200 million, but it's only about 2% of the daily volume in your shares over the past quarter. You could be doing more. It looks like you made a hard stop at $200 million. Can you talk about the math and given where the shares trade right now, about how you came to that number, and what you're thinking?
Mark Kociancic: Josh, it's Mark. So a couple of things. I think when we look at the share buybacks, obviously, in January, we were under -- we had the reserve charge, so we had material non-public information. So we were dealing with a shorter period of time within the quarter to perform the buybacks. That's something that impacts the level. But overall, I'd say the $200 million was a figure we were comfortable with in the first quarter. I think that's a start -- a starting point for the remainder of the year. As I indicated before, the growth rate of the company has subsided largely because of different reasons on casualty and reinsurance and insurance, but it's something that should allow us to generate additional retained earnings that can free up for buybacks. We still enjoy a very good capital position, but we're also wary of the cat season, the hurricane season that's forthcoming. So I still see us being quite proactive on buybacks for the year, and taking a look at where we are with the growth rate and overall payout ratio for the company, and taking into account any potential volatility we might get from hurricane season. So, I can see us continuing with the buybacks, maybe pausing somewhat in Q3, but still a very meaningful amount for 2025.
Josh Shanker: Okay. Thank you for the candor.
Operator: The next question comes from Meyer Shields from Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Please go ahead.
Meyer Shields: Great. Thanks so much and good morning. I wanted to ask a quick question about tariffs because I think you mentioned the ability to respond. And I just want to understand the mechanics of responding in time. Like if tariffs kick in on Day X, you're still exposed to policies that were written in contracts that were written before that. So is there another piece of that that are missing just in terms of the timing? I understand that it can be resolved over time.
Jim Williamson: Yes, Meyer, it's Jim. Good question. You know, during the last bout of inflationary pressure that we saw, and this is both the social inflation and material inflation during the last administration, we obviously saw an uptick in that. And one of the things that we did to enhance our disciplines in response to that was we increased the frequency with which we assess our loss trend assumptions. And so now it's very much quarterly and in some cases, we're testing within the quarters to make sure that if there's any sign that you're seeing an uptick in expectations, you respond immediately to it. I mean, that's what I'm really talking about when I talk about response. Now to your point, you know, obviously, inflation can affect really any open claim, including a prior year open claim. And that's one of the reasons why we've been so focused on when we talk about how we book our loss picks, how we made reserve decisions for 2024 in prior years, how we're thinking about the go-forward business with respect to layering on a very robust risk margin to our picks. All of that is in service of the idea that you could see some inflationary pressure, whether it's because of tariffs or any other factor, and you need to be able to absorb that. So I feel pretty good. Everything that I've seen relative to what's been announced so far, what expectations are, I think we're in a really good spot relative to both the back book as well as how we manage the go-forward.
Meyer Shields: Okay. Fantastic. That's very helpful. And then shifting to the mid-year renewals, you talked about anticipating an uptick in demand, and between depopulations and maybe existing companies that are growing. Is there any way of sort of ballparking how much of the increase in demand is at the lower layers, where I guess pricing is holding up better, and higher layers, where returns are still good, but we're not seeing the same pricing dynamics?
Jim Williamson: Yes, Meyer, it's Jim again. I mean, it's a good question. It's -- I think it's difficult to answer that question with any degree of certainty because it's dynamic. So, how much people want to buy at any particular level will be heavily influenced by how much it costs. And so all things being equal, I think a lot of our cedents, whether it's in Florida or in the Midwest or other parts of the country, would love to buy a lower level, but the required pricing to get those deals done is more than most people are willing to pay. So you usually don't see that incremental demand get fulfilled there. Based on all that, I would suspect, as we've seen in prior renewals, that more of the demand will be in the top-end, where people want to guard against coming out the top side of their programs, but obviously, time will tell.
Meyer Shields: Okay. Great. Thank you so much.
Jim Williamson: Got it.
Operator: The next question comes from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. My first question was just on the aviation loss in the quarter. I was hoping to get a sense of the industry loss. And then what kind of premium did you guys write associated with that loss?
Jim Williamson: Sure, Elyse, it's Jim. Most of the industry loss estimates that I've seen are sort of in the neighborhood of $1 billion. There's not obviously -- it's not like a major hurricane where you have multiple companies modeling it, et cetera, that's more of a ground-up analysis. So I would kind of calibrate to that. Our portfolio in our reinsurance book, where we took the vast majority of that loss, is -- it's a few hundred million dollars. And as I had indicated in my prepared remarks, it has performed extremely well for us over the last several years, post the Boeing losses, which is really when we started growing as the market corrected sharply. And knocking wood here, I think we still have a path to turning a profit for that portfolio in 2025, despite the fact that we had this pretty meaningful loss at the beginning of the year.
Elyse Greenspan: And then thanks. And then my follow-up question is, I guess, on both insurance and reinsurance, with the attritional loss ratios. And I guess, you know ex the aviation losses, are those the levels that we should think about in terms of modeling you know for the rest of the year in both insurance and reinsurance? Just given your view of price as well as the loss trend?
Mark Kociancic: Elyse, it's Mark. We obviously we're not providing guidance on a go-forward basis. What I will say is that, as you know, we are putting in a meaningful risk margin on the U.S. casualty lines in our insurance division in particular. One phenomenon that I would just highlight for everyone is, and it doesn't come clearly in the financials, you can see a meaningful reduction in casualty premium in the -- on the reinsurance side, for example. So it's quite a significant drop of gross written. However, the gross or the net earned on the casualty pro rata is trailing. So while you see something approaching, 25%, 26% reduction of top-line premium, the net earned reduction is much slower. So it's a larger component. We have something approaching a 11% reduction of the net earned from casualty pro rata. So what that does is it mitigates the impact of the mix relative to the written overtime. So that's going to be something that just slows the mix of business improvement that we foresee based on the gross writings of the company.
Elyse Greenspan: That's helpful. And if I can just squeeze one more in, because I did have a follow-up on the aviation. So you guys, I think the math comes to like a 7% to 8% share. Is that typical where you guys obviously, it's like a little bit of an extreme event. Are you guys just maybe a little bit overexposed there?
Jim Williamson: Yes, Elyse, Jim again. I don't -- I would first of all, I wouldn't say we were overexposed. I mean, I think we have the best aviation underwriters. They're both based in London on both the reinsurance and the insurance side. These guys are really good. The book we write in reinsurance, we've been very careful to build mainly an excess of loss book, and we really focus on that part of the equation. And we are a relatively leading reinsurer in a market that is heavily reinsured. So when you have a catastrophic aviation loss like a major -- you know, an airline, you know, a crash with 60 plus passengers killed, that is going to be a reinsurance event, and it's going to be an excess-of-loss event. So as I had indicated in my prepared remarks, there is nothing about our loss that surprises us, and barring any major changes in the market, there's nothing about our loss that would have us rewrite our book or approach things differently. This is what you would expect from an event like this.
Elyse Greenspan: Thanks. Appreciate the color.
Jim Williamson: Got it.
Operator: The next question comes from David Motemaden from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
David Motemaden: Good morning. I had a question, Mark, maybe just following up on the reinsurance attritional loss ratio. So, get -- I hear your point on the written lagging or leading the earned a bit, but I think on the margin still, the mix to short-tail should have accelerated this quarter, and the attritional loss ratio has been improving, and that sort of stalled out, excluding the aviation loss. So I'm wondering if you could just unpack what else is going on in that reinsurance attrition? Is it just conservatism on the casualty side?
Mark Kociancic: Yes. That's the lion's share of the issue there. There's really no other meaningful losses we highlighted the aviation, that's obviously, when you normalize for that, you get to the 57% and change attritional, but it's really the risk margin on the casualty side that's driving any difference.
David Motemaden: Got it. Understood. And then Jim, I heard you loud and clear that the property cat business, even though the pricing is moderating, it's not moderating at a rate that would make it less attractive. I guess, I don't even know if I'm thinking about this right, but what sort of reduction do you think the market can bear while still generating attractive returns on the property cat side?
Jim Williamson: Yes, David, look, I don't think I want to answer that question because I don't want to give anybody any ideas. I mean,, we -- there's really excellent return profiles on offer here. And I think the reinsurance market has learned over the last several years, from really the end of '22 until today, that if we want to earn a reasonable overall return over the cycle with the volatility that we have to accept and you need no -- look no further than the California wildfire. I mean, that's a major loss right at the beginning of the year. We need to sustain prices in order for our market to work the way it needs to. We need discipline. And my message to all my peers in the industry would be at current pricing levels, I think we do reasonably well. And I think our clients are well-served and sustainable. It can deal with, you know, the economic development, it can deal with climate change, et cetera. So my hope is that we don't have to test the limits of the underlying fundamentals of your question, but instead, we sustain pricing at levels that are reasonable and sustain the industry.
David Motemaden: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Michael Zaremski from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Michael Zaremski: Hi, good morning. Thanks. A follow-up. I think, Jim, in response to a question earlier, you talked about doing reserve reviews on a -- I thought I heard a different cadence than ever since then, historically. I thought historically, you do a ground-up on each line-of-business once per year. I wasn't sure if you were in your response earlier to Meyer's question, you kind of were talking about changing that for certain lines of business, or am I thinking about it incorrectly?
Jim Williamson: Well, I think you may have just misheard where Meyer started with his question. He was asking about updates to our loss trend assumptions in response to tariffs and what gave us confidence, et cetera. And we had indicated that we've increased the frequency of reviewing loss trend assumptions. Our reserve deep dives are still conducted on an annual basis, with obviously our quarterly process still in place. And I don't know, Mark, if there's anything you would add on --reserve process, but that's where we began.
Mark Kociancic: There's no difference in the cadence of the reserve reviews. I would just say there's a heightened awareness and alertness on the U.S. casualty lines, in particular for all sources of data that can go into helping us on a quarterly basis of establishing best estimate liabilities. So I feel comfortable with that. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, in the first quarter, we're quite comfortable with our insurance reserves considering the issues we had in 2024.
Michael Zaremski: Okay. Thanks for the clarification. And my follow-up is on the higher-than-expected share repurchases. Is that being funded at all with the -- this federal home loan bank borrowings, which has increased a bit over the past year? And maybe you can -- what are the FHLB borrowings being used for? Thanks.
Mark Kociancic: Yes. So, no, that's the funding for the buybacks is strictly out of excess capital. That's just the FHLB is just a spread trade that we established pretty much after I started back in 2021, or 2020, actually, the fourth quarter. And so that's essentially borrowing for a fixed-rate term, investing at a higher set of yielding securities, posting the collateral, and earning a spread. And that's something that we've been doing for several years. It's a modest amount of the FHLB for capacity that we have, and the two are mutually exclusive, nothing to do with each other, the buyback or the spread trade.
Michael Zaremski: Okay. So that's running through investment income, correct?
Mark Kociancic: Yes, that's right. Yes.
Michael Zaremski: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Katie Sakys from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.
Katie Sakys: Hi. Good morning. I wanted to circle back on the property cat portfolio. I think last quarter, you folks mentioned that you're seeing the need to charge a little bit more for the European cat exposures and increase your average model loss cost by about 10%. Just kind of curious, realizing that we're only a quarter in, how that's holding up, and if you could perhaps extrapolate that shift in loss trend assumption to the global property cat portfolio.
Jim Williamson: Sure. Katie, it's Jim. It's, you know, well, first of all, our view on European cat was specific to Europe, and it's really just a phenomenon of - put insured and reinsured losses aside. The actual frequency and severity of the underlying weather pattern has changed dramatically and consistently over the last several years. And so our view was that whether it's the available models or market pricing hadn't responded to that correctly, we are not going to take risk, we're not getting paid for. And so we raised the bar on what we wanted to get paid for European cat, and the net result of that is our European cat business got smaller, and that's okay. And so that was a European phenomenon. I don't think that necessarily applies to other parts of the world, other than to say that, it's just so important in our business that we stay on the forefront of any developments in the underlying, whether it's weather or development patterns, which is why we maintain and invest in such a robust internal and proprietary modeling capability. And so we're making sure that we always have the latest view of loss costs, expected losses, so that we can price our business appropriately.
Katie Sakys: Okay. So to clarify, like no significant changes you guys are seeing to modeled loss expectations going into mid-year renewals?
Jim Williamson: No, nothing dramatic. I mean, we're always, I mean, it's an always moving reality. I mean, we're always adjusting our models based on the latest data. But in terms of a dramatic move like what I described in European cat, there is nothing that comes to mind in other parts of the world.
Katie Sakys: Okay. Thank you. And then to follow up on the question about sort of the timing of reserve reviews. I mean, I appreciate that Q1 isn't necessarily a significant time for reserve studies, but I mean, anecdotally, is there any additional color that you guys can give us as to how you think the charges from last year's reserve review are holding in?
Mark Kociancic: Yes. Katie, it's Mark. So I think the bookings that we made are holding well. I made the point in my prepared remarks that we're performing well versus the actuarial central estimate. So the risk margin that's on top of that is extra at the current time, and we're seeing the performance of other lines of property, for example, in particular, or some of the other shorter-tail lines building some nice margin within the portfolio. So at the present time, one quarter later, I'd say, we're quite -- very comfortable with how we've progressed three months later after the charge.
Katie Sakys: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: The next question is a follow-up from Brian Meredith from UBS. Please go ahead.
Brian Meredith: Hi, Jim. Just a quick question here. As you look at the mid-year renewals, maybe any changes you're anticipating or seeing with terms and conditions on any of the property reinsurance, and maybe attachments points slowing down or anything?
Jim Williamson: No, I don't expect any changes that way, Brian. One of the things that I've been gratified to see, I referred earlier to the need for discipline, and maybe the area where we've seen the absolute most discipline has been on terms and conditions. That's been a major contributor to, I think, creating a more sustainable market, and people are not giving up on whether it's hours clauses, attachment points, other contractual terms, and I don't expect any at the mid-year renewal.
Brian Meredith: Great. That's helpful. And then just one follow-up. I know there's been a lot of questions about declining property rates and a bunch of stuff, lot of moving pieces right now at Everest. If I think about your book of business, and as you look at it, factoring in all that's going on, would you say that the returns on capital in your business are getting better, getting worse, or staying the same? Just thinking about the whole picture as we kind of look out here.
Jim Williamson: Yes. I mean, look, I would say, if you look at the economic fundamentals, put aside the risk margin for a minute because obviously that's going to affect the printed financials. I would say that the return on capital of both our businesses is improving. And I think that's a very good thing, and that's driven both by really attractive things that we can do in the market, as well as just the fundamentals around mix, which is sort of where you started your question.
Brian Meredith: Yep. Absolutely. Thank you.
Jim Williamson: Great. Thank you.
Operator: There are no more questions in the queue. This concludes our question-and-answer session. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q4  (2025-02-04 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and welcome to the Everest Group Limited Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Matt Rohrmann, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Matthew Rohrmann: Thanks, Dave. Good morning, everyone and welcome to the Everest Group Limited fourth quarter of 2024 earnings conference call. The Everest executives leading today's call are Jim Williamson, our President and CEO; and Mark Kociancic, Executive Vice President and CFO. We are also joined by the members of the Everest management team. Before we begin, I will preface the comments by noting that today's call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially and we will undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements. Management comments regarding estimates, projections and similar are subject to the risks, uncertainties and assumptions as noted over SEC filings.

Management may also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Available explanations or reconciliations to GAAP can be found in our earnings release and financial supplement on our website. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim.
Jim Williamson: Thanks, Matt and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by addressing 2 recent tragedies: the wildfires in California and a plane crash in Washington, D.C. last Wednesday. The human toll of both events is devastating. Our thoughts and prayers are with the people, families and communities affected. We are particularly grateful to the first responders who worked tirelessly during and in the aftermath of these events. Everest stands ready to put its financial resources to work and fulfill its societal mission of aiding recovery. Both of these events remain ongoing from a loss assessment perspective. Regarding the L.A. wildfires, I would expect Everest to take a pre-tax net loss for the group of between $350 million and $450 million, equating to a 1% market share. Most of this loss will impact our Reinsurance division. We are confident in the underwriting of this exposure by both our insurance and reinsurance teams and our share of loss reflects careful client selection. Most cedents are unable to provide expected loss ranges, except in those cases where a total loss to their reinsurance program is nearly certain. As a result, this loss estimate remains a broad range based on the most widely used industry loss figures. Specific to the aviation tragedy, it's too early to provide a loss estimate for the event but we expect it to be well managed in our Q1 results. Moving on to our fourth quarter results. As we discussed last week, Everest's decisive reserve action added $1.7 billion to net reserves including over $200 million of additions to our 2024 loss picks. It's worth emphasizing that despite the impact of our reserve strengthening, Everest earned $1.3 billion in operating income for the year and achieved a 9% operating return on equity. While these results are not consistent with the goals for our company, they speak to the resilience of our business as strong income streams in reinsurance and investments more than offset needed reserve strengthening, predominantly in U.S. casualty lines. Putting aside the reserving action for a moment, let me unpack our current period business performance, starting with reinsurance, where results were once again excellent. Despite an elevated cat year, including a major hurricane in the fourth quarter, we earned $286 million and $1.2 billion of underwriting income for the quarter and year, respectively. Fourth quarter all-in combined ratio, excluding the impact of prior year favorable cat development and profit commissions due to reserve releases in our mortgage book is 91.5%. This result clearly demonstrates Everest's ability to absorb significant cat activity and still deliver. Premium growth in the quarter, excluding the impact of reinstatement premiums, was 12.6%. This is a result of strong execution with our core clients, particularly in property lines as well as selective expansion in some of our specialty underwriting areas and international business. This growth was offset by the effects of the discipline we're exercising in U.S. exposed treaty casualty. Our casualty pro rata book was down more than 7% in the quarter which really understates the extent of our disciplined actions which were offset by growth in non-U.S. casualty. Everest has been an early and consistent voice regarding the changes needed in the U.S. casualty quota share market. Ceding commissions are too high and capacity is generally available regardless of the quality of the cedent. Faced with those conditions, we've maintained our singular focus on underwriting discipline and cedent selection. To highlight the point, since the January 1, 2024, renewal, we walked away from nearly $750 million in North American casualty quota share business. Our approach in this line is simple, we conducted thorough ground-up underwriting and loss cost review of each treaty and we cut back anything that doesn't meet our return expectations, period. Moving on to the January 1, 2025, renewal where our team again executed at the highest levels. Overall, our total Reinsurance division bound premium was down by about 3% during the renewal driven mostly by the aforementioned casualty discipline which was offset by growth on the very best deals in the market, mostly in property and specialty lines. Although property cat prices were down generally between 5% and 15% for loss reprograms, overall rate levels remain above what we need to be willing to deploy capacity in most markets. An exception to my view on the property cat market is Continental Europe. European cat activity in the form of severe conductive storm, hail and flooding is clearly a rising trend. Those events drove significant annual losses. France, Germany, Italy and Eastern Europe have all been particularly affected over the last several years. After a thorough review of our modeling and analytics for these perils, we reached the conclusion that we needed to charge more for European cat exposure, in some cases, significantly more. As a result, our average modeled loss costs increased by about 10%. We fully exited over 20 deals, significantly cut back on many others, while increasing moderately on the most profitable layers and programs. Going forward, we expect the California wildfires to serve as a reminder as if one was needed to all property reinsurance underwriters of the need to maintain pricing discipline and achieve adequate rate. The global property cat reinsurance market overall remains attractive for Everest capacity. As I have said, our customers prefer to do more business with Everest when they can which means we will continue to enjoy the option of choosing where to put our capacity to work. Moving to insurance. Overall gross written premium was down marginally due to our casualty remediation, offset by growth in short tail and specialty lines. Of course, the published combined ratios for the quarter and year are unacceptable. But if you look at it purely on a current period basis, our 2024 combined ratio is 100.7%. That is certainly not good but it gives us a launching point for our portfolio remediation that we can work with. Our international operation continues to grow with a strong overall written premium increase in key short-tail and specialty lines. Despite substantial investments in people and infrastructure, the international insurance business earned an underwriting profit in 2024. Our loss ratio in that business is excellent and consistent actual versus expected data in what is largely a short-tail portfolio gives us confidence in our loss picks. In 2025, we're focused on increasing scale in the 12 markets we're operating in. We do not expect to enter additional markets this year which will result in greater premium leverage against expenses as we move forward. Finally, our North American insurance business is making great strides in remediating our casualty portfolio. Consistent with our actions in Q3, 40% of our casualty premiums in the fourth quarter were not renewed, including actions in our Everest Sports portfolio now captured in our other segments. In our ongoing insurance business, this results in a premium reduction in our U.S. specialty casualty business of approximately 23%. This is despite accelerated rate achievement in GL, auto liability and umbrella access, ranging from 14% to 27%. Loss cost inflation remained steady at an elevated level. And as we discussed last week, we will be assuming 12-plus points of average trend across those lines. Also, the last quarter affected by the runoff of our medical stop-loss business, impact in the quarter was $75 million. Our team in the field has done a good job pipelining and underwriting a number of large risk management accounts. These are well structured with sophisticated clients who understand the need to manage exposure in a heavy social inflation environment. Recent wins in this business include a multiline solution for a leading global industrial firm, property cross-sell to an existing casualty account in the public advocacy arena and a large deductible casualty program for a consumer products company. We set ourselves apart from the competition on these deals through the quality of our relationships, breadth of our offering and specialized services. Results of our portfolio remediation, coupled with the targeted growth are already being reflected in our data. Our Specialty Casualty business made up 25% of our global insurance premiums in Q4 down from over 30% 1 year ago and the quality of the accounts has improved dramatically. As I said on our pre-release call, we will take no credit in our loss picks for this but I certainly expect it to yield increasing margin over time. And now, I'll turn it over to Mark to discuss the financials in more detail.
Mark Kociancic: Thank you, Jim and good morning everyone. As we discussed last week, 2024 was a pivotal year of transformation for Everest. We took decisive action to fortify our U.S. casualty reserves following a comprehensive reserve review and it's reflected in our fourth quarter 2024 results. Looking at the group results, Everest reported gross written premiums of $4.7 billion, representing 7.2% growth in constant dollars and excluding reinstatement premiums. The combined ratio was 135.5% for the quarter. This includes unfavorable development of prior year loss reserves of $1.5 billion or 37.6 points on the combined ratio. We also strengthened current accident year losses by $229 million with total strengthening of $1.7 billion for the full year and fourth quarter 2024. Net losses in the quarter contributed 5.3 points to the combined ratio, largely driven by Hurricane Milton. We also had releases on prior year events, largely driven by Hurricane Ian which partially offset cat losses this quarter which, as a reminder, run through the catastrophe line in the segment P&L. I would also note that the prior year quarter had much lower than average cat capacity; the group attritional loss ratio was 63.9%, a 490 basis point increase over the prior year's quarter. This reflects the current accident year strengthening I mentioned a few moments ago, primarily within our insurance segment. The group's commission ratio was 21.2% when excluding the impact of 1.8 points from the profit commissions associated with favorable reserve development in the reinsurance segment related to the mortgage business and consistent with the prior year. The group expense ratio was 6.2% in the quarter as we continue to invest in talent and systems within both franchises. Moving to the segment results and starting with reinsurance. Reinsurance gross premiums grew 12.6% in constant dollars when adjusting for reinstatement premiums during the quarter. The strong growth was primarily driven by strong double-digit increases in property pro rata and property cat XOL, partially offset by continued discipline in casualty lines. For the full year 2024, property cat XOL grew approximately 26.2% versus the prior year. Combined ratio was 90.4% in the fourth quarter. The prior year fourth quarter combined ratio of 78.9% included 15.3 points of favorable prior year reserve development. As you saw in our press release last week, favorable development in property and mortgage lines fully offset reserve strengthening in U.S. casualty lines. Catastrophe losses contributed 5.4 points to the combined ratio in the quarter consistent with the prior year. This quarter's cat losses were largely driven by $275 million of losses from Hurricane Milton and were partially offset by $125 million of releases on prior year events, namely Hurricane Ian. Attritional loss ratio improved 90 basis points to 56.9% which was primarily driven by mix as we continue to grow strongly in property cat XOL and reduce our casualty pro rata business. Attritional combined ratio improved 140 basis points to 83.7% when excluding the impact of $68 million in profit commissions associated with favorable mortgage reserve development this quarter. The prior year quarter included $94 million of profit commission related to loss reserve releases in mortgage lines. Normalized commission ratio was 24% when you exclude the 2.3 points attributed to the profit commissions associated with favorable development in reinsurance. The underwriting related expense ratio was 2.5%, consistent with the prior year. Moving to Insurance; gross premiums written decreased 1.6% in constant dollars to $1.4 billion, driven by our decisive actions to shed underperforming U.S. casualty business. We are targeting growth in the most accretive lines to improve the portfolio quality and further diversify the book. We made meaningful progress this quarter with property and specialty lines each growing above 30% in the quarter. This growth was offset by the aggressive underwriting action we are taking in specialty casualty lines centered around U.S. casualty lines as well as the runoff of our A&H medical stop-loss business which was completed in Q4. As you saw in our press release last week, we strengthened U.S. casualty prior year reserves in our recently redefined insurance segment by approximately $1.1 billion in the quarter. We also strengthened current accident year losses by $206 million which is reflected in the increased attritional loss ratio of 84% this quarter and 68.1% for the full year 2024. Combined ratio also included 5.3 points of catastrophe losses, primarily driven by losses from Hurricane Milton, while the prior year fourth quarter benefited from a relatively benign level of cat losses. Commission ratio increased 100 basis points, largely driven by business mix and the underwriting related expense ratio was 17.9% with the increase largely driven by the continued investment in our global platform and slower earned premium growth as we rationalize our U.S. casualty portfolio. We recently formed our other segment to enhance disclosure around non-core lines of business, strengthened reserves by $425 million in the quarter which includes an increase of $22 million to current accident year losses. The other segment includes $1.1 billion of net reserves. Moving on, net investment income increased to $473 million for the quarter, driven primarily by higher assets under management. Alternative assets generated $41 million of net investment income which was in line with the prior year. Overall, our book yield was stable at 4.7% and our reinvestment rate is just north of 5%. We continue to have a short asset duration of approximately 3.1 years and the fixed income portfolio benefits from an average credit rating of AA-. Our investment portfolio remains well positioned for the current environment. For the fourth quarter of 2024, our operating income tax rate was minus 16.6% which was lower than our working assumption of 11% to 12% for the year due to the net operating loss this quarter. However, the full year operating effective tax rate was 9% which is closer to our expected range. Shareholders' equity ended the quarter at $13.9 billion, or $14.7 billion, excluding net unrealized depreciation on available-for-sale fixed income securities. At the end of the quarter, net after-tax unrealized losses on the available-for-sale fixed income portfolio equates to approximately $849 million, an increase of $629 million as compared to the end of the third quarter and this was driven by increases in the treasury yield curve. Cash flow from operations was $780 million during the quarter and approximately $5 billion for the full year. Book value per share ended the quarter at $322.97, an improvement of 8.7% from year-end 2023 when adjusted for dividends of $7.75 per share year-to-date. Book value per share, excluding net unrealized depreciation on available for sale fixed income securities stood at $342.7 and versus $320.95 per share at year-end 2023, representing an increase of approximately 6.8%. Our full year 2024 total shareholder return was 9.2%. Net debt leverage at quarter end stood at 15.6%, modestly lower from year-end 2023. Everest continues to have a strong financial position. We are focused on achieving our mid-teens total shareholder return over the cycle. We are well positioned to execute our strategic initiatives and we will look to continue to opportunistically repurchase shares this year and this quarter specifically. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Matt.
Matthew Rohrmann: Thanks, Mark. Dave, we are now ready to open the line for questions. We do ask you please limit your questions to 1 question plus 1 followup, then rejoin the queue if you have additional questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Gregory Peters with Raymond James.
Gregory Peters: For my first question, I'm going to focus on the insurance segment. And I'm wondering if you could give us some additional detail on how you plan to manage volatility considering that you're non-renewing all this casualty business and you'll have rising exposures to the property short-tail business in the international segment.
Jim Williamson: Greg, this is Jim. Thanks for the question. Look, it's pretty straightforward. I mean, we're very diligent around P&L management in each of our divisions and we're very careful about how we plan for the coming year, for example, on where we're going to deploy capital and at what terms and conditions. We also very strategically, as you can imagine, in our insurance business, leverage the use of outbound reinsurance to manage per risk as well as overall volatility. And so while the short-tail book in the insurance division is growing very nicely as you would have seen in this quarter and we're happy about it. We're happy about the pricing levels and the quality of the accounts we're writing. In terms of moving our overall group risk profile; it's really not moving the needle at this point. And as it continues to grow, we'll just manage it within our general PML framework. So not something that is outside of our ability to very thoughtfully approach.
Gregory Peters: Okay. My follow-up question is on the capital management comments. Mark, you -- well, in the press release, you acknowledged that you didn't buy any stock back during the quarter. I assume that's because of the review issue. Can you give us sort of some framework about what your budget looks like for capital management activities? Should we think about it in terms of a payout ratio with dividends and share repurchase on total income for the year? Or perhaps just give us some framework on how we should be thinking about that.
Mark Kociancic: Greg, it's Mark. Thanks for the question. I think there's a lot of factors that go into it. So if you start with, obviously, the fact we have, I think, still a strong financial position coming out of year-end 2024 despite the significant reserve charge and we've got a very good earnings engine in the company. Last week, we made the guidance of mid-teens full shareholder return over the cycle. We feel confident about that as an immediate objective and something that's set for 2025. A few other points. I think the growth rate of the company is one factor that goes into the equation, being able to execute our organic plan. That's something we feel confident you're seeing us being cautious with casualty on the reinsurance side, disciplined, in particular, on the insurance side and property remains very attractive as to other specialty lines. But I do think you'll see less overall growth than in some prior years. And that will free up resources, I think, for more capital management type actions. And then lastly, I think when you get into the equation, obviously, the attractiveness of our share price at the present time creates a very compelling incentive to buy back so as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, I fully expect us to be active this quarter.
Operator: The next question comes from Meyer Shields with Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods. Please go ahead.
Meyer Shields: Jim, I want to drill down a little bit in terms of, I guess, what, on the outside, we can expect in terms of Insurance segment loss ratio progress. In other words, I understand the sustained 12% plus loss trend for casualty lines. But should we expect things like the runoff of the weaker portfolios or other business mix issues? Is that going to show up in 2025?
Jim Williamson: Yes. Meyer, it's Jim. Thanks for the question. So we definitely provided a little bit of insight around this during the pre-release call and I think there are 2 key points. Number one, the prudence that we applied in the construction of the reserve actions that we took as well as the topping off of the 2024 loss fix is a level of prudence that we plan on continuing in 2025. And you'll see that in how we select our casualty loss picks during this year. But we also indicated, I think it is very important that mechanically, mix is moving quite quickly. And of course, that's -- as I indicated in my prepared remarks, that aspect of it in terms of the shift of mix is already showing up in our data. And so yes, as mix improves, the total loss ratio, obviously, that's a very positive tailwind for us to think about as we move through 2025.
Mark Kociancic: Meyer, this is Mark. Just one point on Jim's remarks. So if you look at our financial supplement on the Insurance segment, you'll see a current year loss ratio -- attritional loss ratio of 68.3%. And that obviously takes into account the current year strengthening for 2024. And that's with remediation underway in the casualty segment and a mix of business that is moving towards a more balanced portfolio as we shed some of the casualty numbers. So I think that's kind of the starting point for where the portfolio was. Now to your point, obviously, there are still unearned premium that is earning out into 2025 with some of the older casualty business that we likely will not renew and that will be a bit of a drag in 2025 but that's something we've expected, we forecasted and we clearly have 2 other pieces that I would say are favorable. So one is the mix of business aspect that Jim mentioned. And then the second is really the approach we're taking to the casualty account renewals and new business in general in terms of rate. So I see those as favorable -- two favorable impacts that will help that loss ratio development improve year-over-year and still respect the loss trend assumption we gave last week, plus the prudence actions that we indicated that are going to be taking place in U.S. liability in particular.
Meyer Shields: Okay, perfect. That's very helpful. Second question, it sounds like some casualty lines are improving rapidly. When you look at that, there may be a business you don't want to write in 2025 but maybe by 2026, it's good enough. So are you maintaining, I guess, full run rate expenses in anticipation of eventual profitability? I just -- I'm not sure how that aspect of expense management plays in.
Jim Williamson: Well, yes. So if your question is, are we continuing to invest in our business very thoughtfully, the answer is yes. Now we're also very prudent expense managers, as you clearly see in the overall group expense ratio in our Reinsurance business. Obviously, insurance expense ratio is elevated slightly because of the investments we're making as well as the impact the remediation has on earned premium. But as we go forward, I'd expect that phenomenon to sort of persist for a while because there are great opportunities for us to make prudent investments in the business and the remediation puts a little bit of a lid on some earned premium. But we're going to manage it very carefully, Meyer, on a quarter-by-quarter basis to ensure that the level of investments we're making is consistent with our ability to generate the margin we need.
Operator: And the next question comes from Josh Shanker with Bank of America.
Josh Shanker: In the prepared remarks and whatnot in addition to the sports book being sold, you're also exiting the medical stop loss business. Why or why not is the medical stop loss business a business that I can't be taking care of in a one renewal type methodology like the rest of the businesses? Why can you just raise the price in the business that sticks sticks and what leaves leaves?
Jim Williamson: Yes, Josh, it's Jim. Thanks for the question. We essentially non-renewed a major block, the block that was causing us difficulties in our medical stop-loss business at the beginning of 2024. And it is a block but it has renewal dates that occur throughout the year. So it wasn't a matter of getting increased price. We didn't want to be on the business, we non-renewed it and it just takes the year for the full impact to the financials to run through which is now done. So we won't be talking about the runoff of medical stop loss in 2025.
Josh Shanker: All right. And another quick one. Obviously, I think it's very clear, your thoughts about the wildfire as it regards you were booked. And as a general rule, should we think about Everest as being a 1% market share loss of major global events? Or is there more ground up sort of analysis in how you're thinking about your exposure to California wildfires?
Jim Williamson: Sure, Josh. Jim again. Good question. Look, this is this 1% market share that we've indicated for this event is the result of exceptional underwriting. The simple fact is there are a number of large contributors to what will be an industry loss of -- pick whatever number you like, we're kind of in the 35% to 45% range. Some others like different numbers, that's fine. But a number of the major contributors to that industry loss are not clients of Everest. And the reason they're not clients of Everest is because we assessed the programs on offer and did not believe they offered us an adequate risk-adjusted return for the exposure involved. So we said no and others said yes. And so you'll see different market shares, et cetera which is a ground-up result of the underwriting actions that get taken. There could be an entirely different loss in an entirely different market where we get different opportunities and it will result in a different market share of the loss. It's not about trying to create peanut butter and outcome. It's pursuing the best quality deals for all of the perils we take and all the different geographies we compete in all day, every day. I mean, that's what we do here.
Operator: The next question comes from Alex Scott with Barclays.
Alex Scott: I thought I'd ask you what your view is of the impact of the wildfires just on reinsurance pricing and as you kind of head into midyear, what do you anticipate -- I mean, maybe also any comments you have on how it affects your aggregate treaty setting in the wind season?
Jim Williamson: Yes. Alex, it's Jim. So look, I think obviously, this is a pretty -- this is a big event. And whether you like the $35 billion number or $45 billion number or you prefer a number bigger than that. This is a major event. That certainly -- you would expect it to have a positive impact on prices. What I tend to hear from people is that if there was a move to decrease rates in a reasonable fashion at 1/1 which I indicated, we've seen 5% to 15% of loss-free programs, that's probably ameliorated. Obviously, it will take time for that to play out. But look, I think you add that with the fact that a lot of our clients are looking to buy more overall cover. There's a lot of increased demand in the market. And then you further look at the fact that those clients, if they have their choice, would rather do more of that cover with Everest. I think that means there's a terrific opportunity for us to continue to be very, very selective in the deals we're writing and to get terrific economics which I think is a very favorable thing. You mentioned aggregate deals. I don't know if you mentioned just our total exposure or you meant aggregate specifically, we're not a writer of aggregate covers for the most part. In terms of our total deployed capacity, if pricing is very attractive, we're ready, willing, able to do more for sure. If pricing is not as attractive, we do less. I mean that's -- again, that's how we manage our renewal cycles as they come.
Alex Scott: That's really helpful. Second one I wanted to ask was just around as we approach the Schedule P type disclosures that you all provided in your 10-K and also just thinking through some of the conversations you probably had with your investor base coming away from the initial pre-announcement of the reserve actions. I mean, is there anything that you would point to us that we should focus on beyond just some of the basics around paid to incurs and trying to understand some of those things. As we go in and we're comparing contrast and all of that, what do you think is the key to focus on and sort of, I guess, proof points around the actions that have been taken being enough?
Mark Kociancic: Alex, it's Mark. So look, I think there are several factors to take into account. We tried to outline a bunch of them last week in our pre-call presentation and narrative. So several metrics on IBNR, the ultimate loss ratios. Ultimately, the global loss triangles, I think, supply the best granular data that you can use to compare. So for me, I mean, that's the best place to start. You'll get probably a bit more out of the cake but that part is going to give you, I think, what you ultimately will need. The second thing is really the commentary we've given on highlighting how that book has developed. So specific classes of business that we're problematic how we've gone about shaping the portfolio going forward. And I think that discipline and the commentary we're giving on a quarterly basis that reinforces the execution of our plan here on the remediation is critical to getting the confidence. And then when you get these quarterly measurements such as the K or the Q or the GLTs on an annual basis, you'll be able to see more clearly how the IBNRs outstanding stack up, how the ULRs are looking, just the overall business performance. And so, I think that will give you -- that combination will give you the confidence level you're going to need over time.
Operator: The next question comes from David Motemaden with Evercore ISI.
David Motemaden: I had a question, it sounds like we've heard as well from some of your peers, just the conditions in the casualty re market have caused you guys to step back which makes sense. I guess I'm wondering, it sounds like you guys non-renewed $750 million throughout the course of '24. It sounds like that's continued here at 1/1. I'm wondering if you can help us think through just holistically, what sort of cat load we should be thinking about for Everest now that there's been a more -- a bigger shift towards property and short-tail lines from casualty?
Mark Kociancic: So David, it's Mark. The cat load is still broadly consistent in the multiyear approach we've taken since 2020. What we have done and we started a couple of years ago is really trying to make more of our gross exposure net. And so we had a fairly large reliance or impact from our cat bond issuance over the last several years and prior to 2020 and so we've reduced our reliance on those and we're taking more of the gross on a net basis now. So you're seeing that appetite expand naturally because we believe the expected returns are still very attractive. I don't think the growth is growing very much. It's really more of a net that is expanding primarily because of the cat bonds.
Jim Williamson: Yes, David, this is Jim. I think that's spot on. Let me just step back for a moment, though and approach it a little bit in terms of how we think about the cat book itself because the way we do this is really straightforward. I mean we're trying to build a cat book that is high margin and also very resilient to loss. So that in the event that there is an outsized cat loss somewhere in the world or you have a pretty big cat like a California wildfire that you don't necessarily expect a wildfire to be $40 billion or $50 billion, et cetera, you can still have a book that can earn a profit. And in my mind, yes, the fact that there's less casualty in the denominator can move the percentage of how you think about the cat load. But the fact is what we're trying to do is build a cat book that can manage its own losses and still turn a profit. And we've had multiple years now where there have been really outsized industry losses and the year of Ian is a good example where we essentially in that year which was a big year for cat losses, we got to a breakeven piece in our cat book. And that's at the core of what we're doing here. So I get the modeling aspects and the earned premium aspects but it's about cat management to get to the outcomes we want.
David Motemaden: Got it. Understood. I appreciate that color. My follow-up question, also just on the casualty reinsurance book. And it sounds like some of your peers have made an effort to enhance the flow of information and data capture with their cedents. Have you guys been doing something similar and stepped up your engagement with your cedents? If so, how far along in that process are you? Any findings you can share would be helpful.
Jim Williamson: Yes. I mean, absolutely. That's been a discipline of ours very consistently over the last several years, ensuring best quality data from all of our customers. And look, I think it goes well beyond just making sure that the renewal submissions are complete. For us, it's about having direct actuary to actuary discussions with incremental data sharing so that we can really understand the trends that are affecting our cedents books. Its claims to claims, conversations during the course of the year so that we understand how they're managing their claims volumes, what they're seeing in that underlying data. We obviously study all publicly available data very carefully. So it's multifaceted. It's been a consistent discipline of ours. Obviously, we welcome our competitors joining in that approach because it just will further enhance the data available to everyone. But I think fundamentally, if we really want to move the needle on data quality and availability further, it's going to be about making sure that we're only deploying capacity to those clients who can demonstrate in their data that they're doing a good job managing their portfolios. Where we don't see that, we're moving away, whether that's the data itself doesn't look good or the data doesn't exist, that's not for us. So that's very fundamental to the discipline we're exercising.
Operator: The next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS.
Brian Meredith: Mark, any updates on what you think the tax rate will look like in 2025?
Mark Kociancic: Yes. So I would estimate a range. Clearly, that's higher than the 11% to 12% as we have a 15% rate coming into Bermuda. I would estimate our range -- working range to be somewhere in the 17% to 18% effective tax rate for the group as a whole. And that would assume kind of a normal distribution of geographic income. Obviously, cat fall or any other kind of large loss type impacts can skew it but I'd say it's something like that. And that's the overall tax rate.
Brian Meredith: Appreciate it. That's helpful. And then a second question also, just any thoughts on what cash flow could look like this year given some of the actions you're taking with the portfolio? We expect it to be below 2024?
Mark Kociancic: I think we'll be in a similar range. We have outperformed our expected cash flow forecasts for the plans for the last few years. So I've been pleasantly surprised with that. I'd say one of the biggest factors is really natural catastrophes. I think our reserve or loss payment patterns are pretty good in that respect for what we're projecting in 2025. And it's probably the cat fall that will determine whether or not we hit something close to the $5 billion this year.
Operator: The next question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.
Elyse Greenspan: My first question is on the California fire losses, right? So you guys came out with a range that a little bit less right from what we saw from some other rangers that have gone as high as $50 billion. I'm just trying to get a sense of what would be like the discrepancy between your insured loss estimate and others. And I thought -- I'm assuming you guys -- I think you said you don't have a lot of losses from cedents right now. So can you just verify that last comment? And then just help us reconcile why your insured range might be a little bit less than what some other reinsurers are seeing?
Jim Williamson: Yes. Elyse, it's Jim. Well, I don't know how other people get to their numbers, so I can't really reconcile it for you. But what I can say is if you look at the industry loss estimates that are floating around, there is a pretty broad range on it. I think we're kind of on the upper end of the types of numbers I've seen, if you like, $50 billion better than our loss, I would expect it to be roughly $500 million. The reason why I'm feeling pretty good about the range that I described earlier and I feel great about the performance of our team vis-à-vis that market share number is because of the quality of the underwriting that took place. And I can't emphasize this enough. We passed up deliberately for very specific reasons on a number of deals that got completely clobbered in this event and that's how you ladder upgraded underwriting over time. So very proud of what the team has done that way. And look, obviously, we're in conversations with our teams. I think the issue is loss adjusting an event like this is very challenging. There have been public access issues that are pretty well described, I think it will take time for people to hone in their own numbers which is why we're still working with a range and not a point estimate. But I'm pretty confident given what we are on and what we are not on in the numbers that I shared with you earlier.
Elyse Greenspan: And then my follow-up is on reserves. Looking at the presentation that you guys provided last week on your reinsurance casualty reserves and then also on your insurance casualty reserves. And it does look like the accident year loss pick for recent years in your casualty reinsurance book are being booked substantially better than casualty insurance. Can you just kind of talk through what would be causing the difference between those? Maybe it's business mix? Just trying to reconcile, right, why you'd be booking U.S. casualty reinsurance significantly better than insurance. And then have you guys said what loss cost you're assuming for your casualty reinsurance book?
Jim Williamson: Yes. Elyse, it's Jim again. Look, I mean, the explanation is pretty straightforward and I'm going to be blunt. Our clients for our reinsurance portfolio, we've been very selective in our cedent selection process. They are top quartile underwriters of casualty and they've demonstrated very consistently that they outperformed the average loss ratio in the market by a substantial margin. We've seen that in our data. We see that in the submissions for the renewals. And obviously, wherever we don't continue to see that, we move away which is why we've moved away from $750 million of business. And that's why you get to a loss ratio that looks the way it does. And then you contrast that with our insurance business was not top quartile, overconcentrated in certain classes, et cetera, that get you to a much worse outcome. So there's really not a linkage between the 2 that you should have in your mind. It's 2 entirely different portfolios. In terms of expected trend level, I mean, we are very prudent across both divisions and, I would say, consistent across both divisions. That doesn't mean the number will always be the same but the approach is very consistent. It's based on the data. It's based on, I think, a very conservative view of the development of the casualty market.
Mark Kociancic: Yes. Elyse, just a couple of points on that last piece on the loss trend. So we gave a figure last week in the pre-call on Tuesday, roughly an average of 12% for excess umbrella, GL and commercial auto. So depending on the mix of business, it's something approaching that for both sides of the equation, reinsurance and insurance.
Operator: The next question comes from Michael Zaremski with BMO.
Unidentified Analyst: It's Dan [ph] on for Mike. Just maybe going back to the insurance loss ratio, we could see looking at the deck last week, it was running about low to mid-90s now. Just wondering if you could maybe quantify how much worse of a loss ratio is associated with the non-renewed business versus the retained business.
Mark Kociancic: Mike [ph], it's Mark. It varies -- it really varies by line. I will say, let me break it down into a few components for you. So I would start with the other segment which contains that sports and leisure book that we essentially put into runoff. That for us, I think, was the most disappointing and you're looking at a triple-digit type of loss ratio. It's predominantly excess and GL lines of business. And then when you get into some of the other classes of business having the insurance segment, you've got a varying range of ultimate loss ratios. So in some cases, you're dealing with the triple digits, the 100, 110, 120 type levels. You've clearly got other classes of casualty that are performing much better than that. It really varies. And clearly, we're focused on rate adequacy there. So in terms of the renewal process going forward, we're on this with just a laser focus and making sure that it's either non-renewed or it's renewed with the rate that's necessary.
Unidentified Analyst: Then maybe could you walk through that same dynamic maybe for the $750 million you walked away from in reinsurance casualty?
Jim Williamson: Yes, sure, Dan [ph]. It's Jim. Look, it's going to be -- it's going to very much ideal. And I'm not going to characterize it in terms of a number. But I will tell you -- in some cases, because remember, we started with a pretty high-quality book of ceding. So we're not dealing with the types of challenges that Mark described relative to our insurance business. It's more of just when you evaluate the whole portfolio, there's clearly cedents who in our -- from our perspective, maybe they're not keeping up with trend, or there's something in their claims process that we feel is not fit for purpose at this moment in the casualty cycle and with the challenges of social inflation. It could be they have expanded their appetite in a way that we don't think is favorable. So it's not always that there's this major distinction or inferior loss ratio relative to our average portfolio. It's the underwriting that indicates to us that we're not going to have the confidence we want to have going forward but not nearly the same deltas and performance as what Mark described.
Operator: The next question comes from Wes Carmichael with Autonomous Research.
Wes Carmichael: In your commentary on capital management, Mark, I think there was a high-level comment on less growth overall which, I guess, is understandable currently. But is there any framing you can do on how you're thinking about top line going forward, especially if you're thinking about the potentially non-renewed business, what's the kind of underlying growth you're thinking about going forward?
Mark Kociancic: Wes, so we're not providing guidance. I think from a qualitative standpoint, you've seen us be pretty disciplined on the casualty shedding or underwriting in terms of the reinsurance segment, that's going to continue. Clearly, there are pockets of casualty. I expect us to add in the normal course of business. It's not all a shedding story, both sides, reinsurance and insurance. And property remains very attractive. I mean, the rate adequacy is clearly there and that's something we definitely want to lean into where it makes sense. I just don't see the same level of growth that we had, for example, a couple of years ago in both sides. Last point, our international insurance business has been growing double digits for quite some time. Broadly speaking, lion's share of it is a short-tail book and it's been performing very well. And I would expect that type of natural growth to continue as we're relatively small in the market and starting from a small base. And so that's something that I would expect to be a positive for us in 2025.
Wes Carmichael: That's helpful. And I think there was a release last [indiscernible] for Everest. Can you just talk about how strategic it is for Everest to maintain its current ratings?
Mark Kociancic: Sorry, you cut out for a second. Wes, a release you said?
Wes Carmichael: Yes. I think S&P changed its outlook to negative. I'm just wondering how maintaining its -- maintaining ratings right now is to Everest strategically?
Mark Kociancic: Well, it's fundamental to offer the A+ financial strength rating and that's clearly secure, not in danger at all. The S&P negative outlook is something we respect. We'll work with them not something that concerns us very much but clearly something we have to manage. But the overall financial strength is in a solid spot.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-10-31 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Everest Group Limited Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] And after today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Matthew Rohrmann, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Matthew Rohrmann: Good morning, everyone and welcome to the Everest Group Limited third quarter of 2024 earnings conference call. The Everest executives leading today's call are Juan Andrade, President and CEO; and Mark Kociancic, Executive Vice President and CFO. We are also joined by other members of the Everest management team. Before we begin, I'll preface the comments by noting that today's call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially and we undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements. Management comments regarding estimates, projections and similar are subject to the risks, uncertainties and assumptions as noted in Everest's SEC filings. Management may also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Available explanation reconciliations to GAAP can be found in the earnings release and financial supplement on our website. With that, I will turn the call over to Juan.
Juan Andrade: Thank you, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. We delivered another successful quarter with strong operating income, driven by healthy underwriting results and investment income. This resulted in an annualized total shareholder return of 19.4% and an annualized operating return on equity of 18.7% year-to-date. These results reflect our underwriting discipline and prudent risk management, which position the company to generate leading returns despite what has already been another year in, which industry catastrophe losses were higher than normal. Our thoughts are with all the people affected by these catastrophes across the globe from Hurricane Beryl's impact in the Caribbean, the Storm Boris in Europe and most recently in the US. First, hit hard by Hurricane Helene in late September and then by Hurricane Milton in early October. It has been an active third quarter and the impact of these natural catastrophes further strengthen our conviction that we have the right strategy. Our reinsurance franchise is generating excellent results and it's differentiating itself as a lead market. We are well-positioned to benefit from attractive market conditions in a number of lines of business as we approach the January 1 renewals and beyond. In our insurance segment, we made progress on a number of fronts including improving the portfolio mix by growing in lines of business with higher expected profit trajectories and pulling back in less attractive lines, and continuing to gain traction internationally. Our primary focus in insurance remains on building an increasingly profitable, resilient and diversified portfolio. Additionally our investment portfolio continued to outperform, generating nearly $500 million of net investment income in the third quarter. With that backdrop, I will now turn to our third quarter financial highlights beginning at the group level. We grew the company with a focus on property and specialty lines where we see the highest expected risk-adjusted returns. Growth in these lines is well into the double digits for both segments. Currently we are pulling back in certain casualty lines and subclasses in North America that are less attractive and are more prone to social inflation pressures. These disciplined cycle and portfolio management actions contributed to an improvement of 50 basis points in our attritional loss ratio. The combined ratio included approximately eight points of catastrophe losses from three hurricanes, Canadian storms and wildfires, and a major flood event in Europe. Over the past few years, we have proactively exited or reduced our exposure to the largest seasons in Florida. We have lowered our share with Florida specialists and we have optimized our diversification throughout the state and we have reduced our overall exposure to US accounts that are heavily exposed to secondary perils, including flooding. These actions have allowed us to grow our property catastrophe portfolio with higher levels of expected profitability and drive strong results even when events happen. The success of these portfolio management efforts is illustrated by our Helene loss of $78 million, net of recoveries and reinstatement premiums. Based on our preliminary assessment to date, we estimate that losses from Hurricane Milton, which made landfall as a Category three in early October, will impact Everest's fourth quarter results in the range of $300 million to $400 million on a pre-tax basis, net of recoveries and reinstatement premiums. Our estimated range is based on information that is preliminarily available, which projects a total insurance industry loss of $25 billion to $35 billion. This again, reinforces the importance of our actions to manage natural catastrophe volatility and build a resilient portfolio. Turning now to our reinsurance business. Our third quarter results were once again, excellent. We continue to execute on our portfolio and cycle management initiatives to maximize risk-adjusted returns. This was evident in growth in the quarter, driven by property catastrophe excess of loss and property pro rata, which remained attractive and where we grew in the mid to high teens. Conversely, as a result of our prudence in casualty lines, casualty pro rata and casualty excess of loss premium, growth rates decreased to levels in the mid-single-digit range. This is a result of the actions, we have discussed in prior calls all year. So far year-to-date, we have actively shed over $400 million of casualty renewal premiums as we see these lines as less attractive and in need of further correction in terms of underlying pricing and ceding commissions. We continue to see strong opportunities to expand the portfolio in those lines with the best expected returns, primarily property and specialty. Both the attritional loss and attritional combined ratios improved, resulting in $245 million of underwriting profit. The quarter included catastrophe losses of $239 million, net of recoveries and reinstatement premiums again, reflecting the resilience we have built into this business. Our strategy to focus on top-tier seedings, further enables us to produce consistent returns throughout the cycle. In the aftermath of Milton and other international events, we expect property catastrophe pricing in North America and Europe to firm heading into the January one renewals. Demand for our capacity has also increased. Following recent catastrophe events and high-quality cedents continue to expand their relationship with us. In addition, Everest underwriting strategies have allowed us to build what we believe to be meaningful embedded margin in our reinsurance reserves. Our reinsurance segment is well positioned to continue generating strong margins. Now turning to insurance. Our increasingly diversified insurance platform, positions us to be agile as evidenced by our discipline this quarter. For example, we have favorable market conditions in well-priced short tail and specialty lines, and strong capabilities in our expanding international business. So we leaned into this and we grew by double digits. Conversely, we are increasingly cautious in certain casualty lines in the US, as the environment remains challenging. This is the long-term value of the increasingly diversified platform that we have created. We can play offense and defense to pursue the most economically attractive opportunities. With regards to North America, we achieved an average rate increase of 11% across the portfolio excluding workers' compensation and financial lines. Rate in the aggregate, remains above expected loss trend. In casualty lines, such as general liability, commercial auto liability and excess liability, rate accelerated well into the high teens. These rate increases are necessary to respond to the elevated loss activity that we're experiencing as an industry and as a company. Everest continues to closely monitor the persistent problem of social inflation and legal system of use in the United States. In US casualty lines, we are focused on continuing to take action in classes exposed to this trend. For example, real estate, habitational and leisure accounts and we are taking decisive underwriting actions. Our teams are selective on new business, achieving strong rate increases and non-renewing underperforming accounts. As a disciplined underwriting company, our goal is to ensure we are writing business only where pricing is adequate to earn our target risk-adjusted return. We expect the combination of these actions to result in a higher margin and more consistently profitable book. In addition to our standard quarterly reserve review process, we will conclude our annual long-tail deep dive reserve studies within the insurance segment in the back half of the fourth quarter and we will continue to take a conservative approach to the findings. In conclusion, let me step back and summarize the status of our businesses. Our reinsurance business is firing on all cylinders. We are the lead treaty market for most of our global clients and we have a nimble and profitable facultative business with a global footprint. In insurance, our short-tail and specialty underwriting in the US is strong and we are increasingly local and relevant to our key brokers in markets across the country. We have upgraded important talent and we are investing in people and automation to keep driving that business. Similarly, our international insurance expansion is exceeding expectations. We have hired the best leaders in the business to drive that initiative. They've built an excellent book of business and all of our performance indicators are pointing in the right direction. That leaves one area of the portfolio where we are taking ongoing and aggressive actions, segments of our insurance casualty book in the US that are exposed to the real issues of legal system abuse. So looking ahead, we will remain disciplined and opportunistic in our underwriting, while building franchise value through best-in-class execution for our clients. Our diversified businesses and our high-performing investment portfolio coupled with our very strong balance sheet and our significant capital strength give us the flexibility and the optionality to position Everest for the long-term, as we focus on delivering industry-leading returns through the cycle. With that I'll turn it over to Mark to review the financials in more detail.
Mark Kociancic: Thank you, Juan and good morning, everyone. Everest had another strong quarter delivering solid growth in operating income and net investment income. This drove operating earnings per share of $14.62 and an annualized total shareholder return of over 19%. Our Reinsurance division continues to differentiate itself in the market delivering another strong underwriting quarter. The Insurance division continued to gain traction in key markets internationally, while at the same time growing materially in short-tail lines and remaining conservative in certain casualty lines as we continue to recalibrate the North American portfolio and focus on improving underwriting profitability. Looking at the group results. Everest reported gross written premiums of $4.4 billion, representing approximately 1% growth in constant dollars and excluding reinstatement premiums. The combined ratio was 93.1% for the quarter, driven by an improvement in the attritional loss ratio, offset by higher CAT losses when compared to the prior year figures relatively benign third quarter. CAT losses of $279 million in the quarter, net of recoveries and reinstatement premiums were driven by several events globally including Hurricanes Helene, Beryl and Debby, as well as weather events in Europe and Canada. The group attritional loss ratio was 58.5%, a 50 basis point improvement over the prior year's quarter and the group's commission ratio decreased to 21.1%. The group expense ratio improved from the prior year to 6%, while at the same time we continue to invest in talent and systems within both franchises. Moving to the segment results and starting with reinsurance. Gross written premiums grew 1.7% in constant dollars when adjusting for reinstatement premiums during the quarter. Growth in the quarter was driven by property and specialty lines, while we continue to remain disciplined in casualty lines. Property Pro Rata and Property Cat XOL grew 19% and 15% in the quarter respectively. And when normalizing growth in Property CAT XOL on a 12-month basis growth increases to 22%. Casualty Pro Rata and Casualty XOL decreased in the quarter by 7.2% and 5.9% respectively. As Juan mentioned, we expect pricing to firm heading into the January one renewals and are well positioned to capitalize on favorable market conditions, particularly in property and specialty lines. We continue to see the written premium mix shift towards property and short-tail lines which stands at 56% property and 44% casualty a six point shift from the prior year. The net earned premium mix stands at approximately 55% property and 45% casualty. Consistent with prior quarters, growth will continue to favor short-tail line businesses which will become more pronounced on an earned basis. The attritional loss ratio improved 60 basis points to 56.9% during the quarter. The attritional combined ratio improved 140 basis points to 83.5%, as we continue to improve the scale and durability of the portfolio in addition to the business mix benefits. The commission ratio improved 90 basis points to 23.9% and underwriting expense ratio was in line with the prior year at 2.5%. Combined ratio was 91.8% and includes 9.1 points of CAT losses, driven by the storm activity previously mentioned, while the prior year third quarter included 6.4 points of catastrophe losses. Moving to insurance. Gross written premiums decreased approximately 2% in constant dollars to $1.2 billion. As stated in prior calls, we are proactively shaping the portfolio mix towards the most accretive lines of business and we made further progress in the quarter. We also continued to scale our primary franchise globally. While the North America business was down overall, we continue to generate strong growth in retail property and specialty lines each increasing in the double-digits. This growth was offset by reductions in certain casualty lines in North America, which were down in aggregate by almost 20%, driven by our intentional portfolio actions as Juan described earlier. Our international business continues to grow well into the double digits. And we also continue to be conservative in monoline workers' comp, medical stop-loss and public company D&O. As we stated previously, we expect the drag associated with the runoff of our A&H medical stop-loss business to be completed by the end of the year. We will continue to focus on prudent risk selection, rate adequacy and holding the line on terms and conditions. Following the third quarter, we announced an agreement for Ryan Specialty to acquire our EverSports and Entertainment Insurance business. The deal is a win for all parties and is well aligned with the strategic objectives of both organizations and this transaction will be accounted for in the fourth quarter. The attritional loss ratio was 63.3% in the quarter and this is consistent with the prior year and reflects our actions to shape the portfolio, while remaining disciplined particularly in casualty lines. The commission ratio increased by 40 basis points to 12.2% in the quarter. The underwriting related expense ratio increased by 80 basis points, as we continue to make investments in our global platform, drive underwriting discipline in North America and scale our international operations. The segment combined ratio increased to 97.1% in the quarter which includes 4.2 percentage points of catastrophe losses. The prior year third quarter benefited from a relatively benign level of CAT losses. And moving on to investments. Net investment income was $496 million in the quarter, an increase of $90 million versus the prior year third quarter. The increase was driven primarily by higher assets under management and higher new money yields versus maturing assets. Alternative assets generated $72 million of net investment income, a slight decrease from the prior year. Overall, our book yield improved from 4.2% to 4.8% year-over-year. We continue to have a short asset duration of approximately 3.1 years. Given the attractive level of short rates, the investment portfolio remains well-positioned for the current environment and the fixed income portfolio benefits from an average credit rating AA-. For the third quarter of 2024, our operating income tax rate was 10.7% modestly lower than the second quarter and driven by the mix of jurisdictional profits in the quarter. Our capital strength continues to provide us the ability to pursue profitable growth and opportunistically, repurchase shares and we repurchased 272,000 shares in the quarter amounting to $100 million or an average of $367.3 per share. Year-to-date we've repurchased 536,000 shares amounting to $200 million. We will look to continue to opportunistically repurchase shares. Shareholders' equity ended the quarter at $15.3 billion or $15.6 billion excluding net unrealized depreciation on available for sale fixed income securities. At the end of the quarter, net after-tax unrealized losses on the available-for-sale fixed income portfolio equaled approximately $220 million, a decrease of $716 million as compared to the end of the second quarter resulting from interest rate decreases. Cash flow from operations was $1.7 billion during the quarter and book value per share ended the quarter at $356.77, an improvement of 19.1% from year-end 2023 when adjusted for dividends of $5.75 per share year-to-date. Book value per share excluding net unrealized depreciation on available for sale fixed income securities stood at $361.87 versus $320.95 per share at year-end 2023, representing an increase of approximately 12.7%. Net debt leverage at quarter end stood at 14.3%, modestly lower on a sequential and year-over-year basis. In conclusion, Everest had another strong quarter generating a total shareholder return in excess of our target. Our diversified franchises, well-positioned investment portfolio, and our meaningful excess capital positions us well going forward. And with that I'll turn the call over back to Matt.
Matthew Rohrmann: Thanks Mark. Operator, we're now ready to open the line for questions. We do ask that you please limit your questions to one question plus one follow-up then rejoin the queue if you have additional questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Yaron Kinar with Jefferies.
Yaron Kinar: Thank you. Good morning everybody. So, first, I realize that liability lines are not monolithic. But I think that's the cut in premiums in the face of high teen insurance rates and embedded margins in reinsurance may cause some confusion. So, I guess what would you say to investors who may be concerned that the cuts and casualty premiums are a sign of higher accident year loss picks to come and/or for the need for reserve strengthening?
Juan Andrade: Hi Yaron, it's Juan Andrade. Thanks for the question. Let me start and then I'll ask some of my colleagues to jump in as well. One of the things to keep in mind about our strategy is that diversification is one of the cornerstones. We're very nimble and we're very opportunistic. You see that in that 6% operating expense ratio for the quarter and that we consistently deliver. So, we're able to move when we see the opportunities. So, for us, cycle management and portfolio management it's what we do and it's what we do to ensure that we get the best possible returns. You've seen us do this before. We've done it in workers' compensation. We've done it in public D&O. We've done it with our medical stop-loss book and we certainly did it in our property book back in 2022 before rates firmed up prior to Hurricane Ian. So, we see the best opportunities today as I just said in my remarks in property and specialty lines. And while there's still some casualty lines out there that we like, there's also others that we don't given the environment. The environment remains elevated. We've stated our intentions previously to achieve a more optional balance in our portfolio, particularly in North America insurance. We've also talked about before, the fact that in our reinsurance portfolio, we're starting to skew the mix more towards property catastrophe in property in general because of the rate and the terms and conditions that we like. And so when you think about pricing being enough, particularly in the casualty lines in the primary business, loss trend is also elevated, right? And it has been elevated for quite some time. And we do expect social inflation to remain an issue. That's why we're being cautious in these lines of business. And this is one of the reasons why we've stated in the past that we're changing the mix of our portfolio to be more focused on those lines of business that we find more accretive. So, really none of this is new news. I mean it's information that we've talked about publicly in the past. And it's really about constantly examining the portfolio to create the highest quality book.
Yaron Kinar: Got it. And then maybe shifting a little bit here. Do you still expect to achieve the updated 93% to 94% reported combined ratio guide for insurance that you offered in the last quarter and in the second half of this year?
Mark Kociancic: Well, Yaron, it's Mark. Good morning. So I think the 93% to 94%, it really depends on where we are with the CAT. I think the fundamentals underneath that are still there probably more importantly where we were guiding towards was the 92% in the back half of 2025. And I think we still feel confident about getting to that target. Ultimately, you're going to see several pieces move us towards that direction. So, starting with increasing the scaling of the premium in the insurance franchise; the mix of business, I think will provide us with a favorable combined split; and then obviously, focus on expense leverage.
Yaron Kinar: Thank you.
Mark Kociancic: Thanks Yaron.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Gregory Peters with Raymond James.
Gregory Peters: Hey. Good morning, everyone. So I just wanted to, have you provide further detail on your answer there Mark. Increasing scale you commented on the higher expenses inside the insurance segment. Can you frame for us how we should think about the expense ratio, both commission and other underwriting expenses in the insurance segment, when we model out in 2025 and 2026?
Mark Kociancic: Yes. So Greg, I think on the commission ratio, you're going to see something that is broadly stable with what you're seeing in the third quarter, maybe slightly elevated as we shed -- as we complete our shedding of A&H business in 2024. But the mix of business, I think will keep it relatively stable towards that 12%-ish type level. The general expense, it's really two pieces. There's -- we continue to invest in our franchises both North America and internationally. And so those dollars get spent upfront in terms of people, systems and so on when we're setting up our locations for further development. And the earned premium that we expect thereafter is really what's going to drive that ratio down. So we're still in somewhat of a growth or investment phase in certain areas of insurance. So I can see the expense ratio being somewhat elevated now but fundamentally moving down as we get that premium scaling. And we've seen the benefits of some of the additions we made a couple of years ago, especially internationally in terms of hitting those teams to develop their premiums in their markets. And so we know that can be done. We feel good about it. It's really more of a timing issue than anything else.
Gregory Peters: Okay. That makes sense. I guess I'll pivot to pricing and reinsurance. It feels like following Monte Carlo, following relatively benign year-to-date CAT experience that, at least through September price talk in property CAT was trending down, maybe 10% give or take, maybe a little bit more. Maybe the recent Hurricane Milton may stabilize a little bit but we're approaching year-end. And I know the reinsurance market always talks up price. And I know that the cedents always talk down price. As we go through the next two months, I know you said in your comments Juan that you expect pricing to hold maybe stable, but it feels like the pricing trend is down. So maybe you could give us some updated perspectives on pricing and reinsurance as we go into the January 1st renewals?
Juan Andrade: For sure, Greg. Thanks for the question. I hope everything was fine with your homes down in Florida given the impact of the hurricanes. Look what I said in my remarks is that we expect firming to take place at the 1/1 renewals. And we see that. And I think you're right that when we were all in Monte Carlo not too long ago, the talk was probably that pricing could come down somewhere around minus 5% minus 10% for US property CAT et cetera. But I think there's a few things that have changed since Monte Carlo similar to what happened in 2022 post-Ian. We had two major storms hit the United States in Milton and Helene within essentially a week of each other. And I think that certainly sets the perspective on what's happening out there. I mean, we're seeing rapid intensification. We're seeing very powerful storms, et cetera. So that's the US component. The other part of it is Europe. So the thought process in Europe was also likely that things were going to be probably down minus 5%, et cetera. But you have the floods in place this year last year. Now we have Storm Boris in the third quarter, et cetera. So our thinking is that pricing is likely to go up plus 5%, plus 10% both in the US as well as in Europe. And ultimately we'll see at the end of the day when the dust to settle. But I know our teams are actively quoting right now and we're actively engaged in that renewal process.
Gregory Peters: Got it. Thanks for the answers.
Juan Andrade: Sure. Thanks, Greg.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Josh Shanker with Bank of America.
Josh Shanker: I definitely want to follow-up on that comment. So is this a negotiation going on right now? Is there a tough argument? If you talk to brokers, I think everyone says pricing should be down 5%. I think it used to be down 5%, maybe down 5% now. You're saying -- this is confident you're saying plus 5% plus 10% here. Is this a January -- December 31st negotiation that's going to bear out? Or are there firm orders that are telling you positive pricing is in the offering?
Jim Williamson: Sure. Josh this is Jim Williamson. I mean, we're not at firm order terms yet. It's very early in the process. I do expect this to be fairly down to the wire in terms of the negotiation. But if you step back for a minute and think about some of the fundamentals, some of the things Juan touched on first of all, it's been a very active CAT quarter. Now it has been a little less active if you're a reinsurer than if you're a primary, but the fact is the losses are in the system. It's over $100 billion a year. Again we've had several major hurricanes and the most recent one, while I think not as bad as people had feared I don't think it takes a lot of imagination to recall that if it shifted to the north and hit Tampa, it would have been a much larger, maybe 2x or more type of event. So that's in everyone's mind. The other factors that I think are critical and it is against the backdrop of elevated loss and climate change and capital management. As our clients are looking to buy more capacity, demand is rising quite substantially. We've already had a number of conversations with core clients who are looking to buy more. So that is certainly a factor. And then lastly I would say our clients in particular are looking to buy more from Everest. I mean the quality of our capacity is second to none. And I think that just -- that peaks that demand for our paper. And I mean it's something north of one-third of our North America CAT deals have nonconcurrent terms, which I think will be very favorable for us as well. So I think all of that ladders up to a situation when we think rates will be firming and we think expected returns will be very strong.
Josh Shanker: And just quickly you mentioned this potential loss that Milton put on. That's really about 6/1 more than its about 1/1 or do you think that has a 1/1 impact?
Jim Williamson: No. I think it has -- absolutely has a 1/1 impact. Now clearly it's going to have more of a 1/1 impact on diversified US CAT programs than it would on a program in Europe. Europe's got its own problems obviously. So there is going to be some differentiation based on where in the world the program is. But I think for all US programs, they all have a variety of Southeast exposures. And I think the fact that there is this intensified hurricane activity and the near miss, I absolutely think it will weigh on pricing.
Josh Shanker: Right. Thank you. And then on Mark's comments you talked about the changes in the mix in the reinsurance business and how that's going to affect the loss ratios. Just to clarify both should we expect that as the larger portion of short-tail business works that weigh in we should see the loss ratio decline year-over-year with a modestly higher CAT load to it?
Mark Kociancic: Josh, it's Mark. I just want to clarify you're talking about insurance or reinsurance? I missed that part.
Josh Shanker: Reinsurance. The pullback from longer-term lines and the short tail lines.
Mark Kociancic: Yes. Look generally speaking yes. But the only caution I would provide is we obviously review the loss picks for relevance particularly on casualty now that we're in a what I would call a higher risk environment given the elevated loss trends. But generally speaking I would say yes.
Josh Shanker: Okay, very good. Thank you.
Juan Andrade: Thanks, Josh/
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Alex Scott with Barclays.
Alex Scott: Hey, good morning. I was hoping we could come back to the reserve study in that you're going through in 4Q. I mean just from the pullback and it becoming seemingly much more significant this quarter in some of the comments it appears that your view of loss trend maybe changed more substantially since the last time you looked at this. And I just want to understand that dynamic and how impactful could this be for capital? I'm just trying to understand in the context of the share buybacks that were a bit higher and capital that maybe gets deployed towards property next year?
Mark Kociancic: Good morning, Alex. It's Mark. I think the short answer is I really don't see scenario that impacts share buyback or excess capital strength that we currently have. So I mean that's the short answer on that part. I think the other pieces are we continue to build a well-diversified business. And so we're seeing strong margins particular in property and shorter tail lines of business. It's really North American casualty that is the elevated risk factor for the industry and that would include us and that's what we'll keep our eye on as we complete our studies.
Taylor Scott: Got it. That's helpful. And then we've heard commentary from some other primaries that have suggested competition in property at least at the primary level has been very intense actually in the third quarter. I mean -- can you talk about what you're seeing there and maybe the change in behavior that you're seeing post some of these storms?
Jim Williamson: Sure, Alex. This is Jim Williamson. Yes, a couple of comments. One I mean obviously that's the headline. I would say, if you look at the US, for example, and you peel that back most commercial property in the retail channel is actually still taking rate increases. And I think that is often overlooked. But we still see that in our middle market portfolio for example we're still in a positive rate environment. What is more competitive I would say is the wholesale market where you had just significant rate taking over the last few years I'd say risks are priced very adequately. And so you're going to see increased competition as people want to -- would they want to write those deals. And similarly in large shared and layered programs of the best quality risk the highly engineered global accounts again significant rate increases over the last few years very attractive opportunities. You're going to see some heightened competition there which is going to take headline rate levels down I think still very attractive. And then obviously we're seeing a little bit more competitiveness out of the London market. And again I know I'm repeating myself but we still think it's very, very attractive. So I think it's very much mix. Now, I do think recent events will help to ameliorate some of those trends. I don't necessarily expect some of those more competitive areas to suddenly flip to taking rate increases. But I do think, it will give folks pause and maintain adequate pricing levels for longer than you otherwise would have had.
Alex Scott: Got it. Thank you.
Jim Williamson: Thanks, Alex.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Meyer Shields of Keefe Bruyette & Woods.
Meyer Shields: Great. Thanks and good morning, all. I guess, going back to the reserve issue it sounds, if I'm interpreting your comments correctly like there's much more confidence in the reinsurance segment reserve than in insurance. I was hoping, you could walk us through the differences there that leads to that differentiation?
Mark Kociancic: Yeah. Meyer, it's Mark again. So maybe just to expand the commentary set the stage with where we are industry at large here. So I think we're clearly seeing North American casualty lines with elevated loss activity that's been persistent for several quarters for quite some time. And so that gives generally higher risk environment for US casualty. So you don't know what the outcomes are going to be and you don't know the ultimate length of time. So it creates higher risk. When you look at our reinsurance portfolio, you've got a very well-diversified portfolio short-tail financial lines casualty international business and so forth, a very mature organization multiple lines geographies. And we track cedent data. We've done I think a very good job of constructing the reinsurance portfolio over the last few years in particular, with an eye on casualty as well as other lines. And so preemptively, we've been more cautious, I would say on casualty in terms of ceding selection terms, ceding commissions and pricing discipline. So when you think about all that and what I would argue is a pretty clear embedded margin in a lot of the shorter tail and financial lines that, we have we feel good about that strength as we deal with the higher risk environment that US casualty is creating. Now, if we move to insurance we don't have that same level of diversification yet. We are heavier on US casualty proportionately in the portfolio. Now, we're moving into a more diversified portfolio. I think you're seeing a meaningful shift year-over-year in terms of the composition of US casualty relative to the overall insurance portfolio. And so we have similar findings in terms of elevated levels of loss activity during the year from US casualty lines, and that's the kind of data that we're taking into account on the reserve studies. Generally, speaking, we're still seeing good performance from the property and shorter tail lines in insurance. No question about that. But Juan highlighted earlier in his script that, we do have specific casualty lines that we're recalibrating. And that's one of the fundamentals of managing in a higher-risk casualty environment. You've got to ensure that you've got price adequacy, you're getting paid for the risk, and that you're also managing cycle management appropriately, which means shifting your resources to more towards more attractive lines ultimately. And when you reach that stage, I think you're better able to manage the volatility that can come from these types of macro factors like the social inflation that's a legal system abuse that's quite pervasive over the last several quarters.
Juan Andrade: Meyer, this is Juan. I would add just one comment to what Mark said, particularly on your question regarding reinsurance. Please keep in mind that, our reinsurance teams are pricing actuaries. They set their own loss picks. And those loss picks are often different from the picks that we get from our clients for the same portfolios. So adverse development, particularly -- in a particular client's book doesn't necessarily mean or translate into adverse development in our reinsurance book. And I think, it's important to keep that in mind.
Meyer Shields: Yeah. That is very, very helpful. Thank you, both. Just a quick question, I was looking for an update on the status of licenses in the countries where you're building out the insurance I guess, growth target?
Juan Andrade: Yeah. No great question. I'm happy to say that everything is up and running now. I think in the last quarter I mentioned that we had a couple of delays. Since then, those operations are up and running. A matter of fact I've been in four continents in the last two three months with all our local teams. We're writing business. Everything is up and running. And so we're good to go with all the countries that we set out to open up to this point.
Meyer Shields: Okay. Fantastic. Thank you very much.
Juan Andrade: Thanks, Meyer.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Brian Meredith, UBS.
Brian Meredith: Yeah. Thanks. A couple of them here, first, I'm just curious, given the shift you're seeing right now to more property from casualty is the six-point cat load still kind of a good one to think of? Or could it potentially trend a little higher given the shift you've got going on?
Jim Williamson: Yeah. Brian, this is Jim Williamson. Yeah, look, I think the way we've described our expected cat losses is still relevant. We are writing a very diversified portfolio of property. We're not -- particularly when you look at our insurance business we're not overextending ourselves in peak zones. We're also being very thoughtful about how much cat exposure we're taking on a per risk basis. And I would say that we tend to write larger more highly engineered property accounts in our insurance business which by their nature are going to be less cat exposed and have less cat volatility associated with them. So while we do monitor obviously accumulation very closely it's not moving the needle on a macro basis for the company.
Brian Meredith: Make sense, thanks.
Mark Kociancic: Brian, sorry it's Mark. I was just going to add a couple of points to what Jim started with. So one is in the hedging program or the capital shield that we're managing in our cat program we're doing things that really emphasize better gross returns minimizing basis risk all within our risk appetite. And so I think you've got a more fulsome diversified set of PMLs by zone as Jim was mentioning. And then second probably more importantly is I think when you look at the actual performance especially relatively speaking versus peers you're going to see that our cat losses are proportionately smaller. I would argue they are meaningfully better performance than some of the others. And just take a look at our Helene loss this quarter. I think that's a good proof point. And I would also point to the 2023 performance of our reinsurance cat loss ratio relative to peers.
Brian Meredith: Yeah. Make sense. Thank you. And then just one other quick one here Juan, and kind of an add-on kind of what Meyer's question was the international build-out. As we think about the insurance business going forward here we're obviously seeing the year-over-year operating expense growth slow right now obviously as that build-out is getting closer to completion. Should I think about operating expenses in the insurance units perhaps growing faster still than kind of your premiums are growing given that build-out and given what's going on with the casualty kind of call it retrenchment but just disciplined?
Juan Andrade: Yeah. Brian, so this is Juan. Let me start with that. I think one of the points that Mark made earlier in his response is that you still have a little bit of a J-curve effect in the investment in the international business. But we see that earned premium starting to come online. And frankly the earned premium is coming a bit better than what we had anticipated in our own plans. So I think that's something to keep in mind. The other thing for us is that we've opened up the countries to what I've answered just to Meyer that we wanted to open at this point in time. So what you're going to see us doing particularly in 2025 is really dig in deeper into these countries that we've already made investment. And so that should help -- certainly help the growth rate the earned premiums come in from that perspective.
Brian Meredith: Got you. And then assuming it's international it's largely property?
Juan Andrade: It's mostly short tail. So it's -- the majority is property. We write also a lot of specialty type business, think about marine those kinds of things. But there is a component of international casualty and a component of financial lines. But you're right, depending on the region in the country, that's going to be the minority. So that's one of the points I've made in prior calls that part of the strategic reason for doing this is we do get a mix benefit on the loss ratios from this business. They tend to run significantly better because it is more property. Some of it is less CAT exposed, et cetera.
Mark Kociancic: Brian, it's Mark. Sorry, just to add one point, similar to what Yaron was getting at in his second question upfront. Combined ratio guidance towards the lower end of where we are right now for the second half of 2025, that's clearly one of the factors that we foresee. So I can see a bit of stubbornness as this J curve works its way through for the next couple of quarters. But then I would expect the premium side, the net earned and the scaling to start to kick in with more impact than the actual expense growth. And that's where you would see the ratio -- expense ratio subside.
Brian Meredith: That's help. Thank you.
Juan Andrade: Thanks, Frank.
Operator: The next question comes from Michael Zaremski with BMO.
Michael Zaremski: Hey, good morning. A lot of questions and focus on kind of the deep dive you'll be doing on casualty in 4Q. Just curious, so if you put out the global triangles, but they're just -- they're not as helpful to most investors versus the statutory type of data that investors can see in your U.S. portfolio because on the U.S. side, you can see the loss picks by vintage and IBNR and et cetera, et cetera. So I guess it's more of a request or maybe a question too. To the extent you are doing this big deep dive, would you be willing to eventually show us your reserves on a statutory disclosure basis on a company-wide level for casualty? Is that something you consider?
Mark Kociancic: Yes, Mike, it's Mark. I think we took a step forward in the 2024 disclosures in late July, early August to improve the granularity and the transparency of the reserves, and that's something that I think we'll continue to do, hopefully take another step in 2025. We definitely want to have that level of understanding in the marketplace with what's going on. And we'll obviously take this kind of feedback into account as we pursue that objective.
Michael Zaremski: Okay. And maybe just a clarification on the -- I think -- I'm thinking about this correctly, but on the insurance segment, kind of the back half of 2025, guidance of closer to 92%, that is including a CAT load. But you're saying that you've been beating on CATs, right? You expect to have a small market share of catastrophes going forward. So I just want to make sure that is inclusive of CAT load, right?
Mark Kociancic: That's correct.
Michael Zaremski: Okay. Thank you.
Mark Kociancic: Thanks, Mike.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from David Motemaden with Evercore ISI.
David Motemaden : Hey, thanks. Good morning. I wanted to just come back to the reserves on the casualty insurance side. And just maybe just get a quick check in on how actual to expected has trended on that book here through the third quarter, just because it seems like something has changed this quarter compared to the first half. So I'm just wondering if there's anything new that you guys are seeing in the underlying book this quarter?
Mark Kociancic: Hey, David, it's Mark. I would say we are seeing elevated loss activity in Q3. The loss trend itself, I think we made some general comments that it's been clearly elevated and a minor increase in the trend over the last several quarters, but the loss activity itself in U.S. casualty lines has definitely spiked somewhat in Q3. And we're seeing that principally in excess casualty, GL commercial auto. Now on the flip side, we would also -- we have a lot of other lines in insurance never mind reinsurance. And so when you're looking at things like property or even workers' comp or some of the financial lines, we're clearly seeing some favorable loss activity on that side. And so the loss activity is one factor. The reserve studies go into a whole bunch of aspects that take that into account and that's what we would expect to come out of our Q4 process.
David Motemaden: Got it. Okay. So yes, I guess, I do see that the mix did shift more to short-tail on the insurance book. And then I guess -- so that should have had a benefit I think on the underlying or the attritional loss ratio there. But I guess it sounds like the reason why that was flat is just higher loss ratios on the casualty side. Is that the correct interpretation of the moving pieces just in the flat attritional loss ratio in the insurance book?
Mark Kociancic: Yes. Generally speaking, so a couple of points. I think the mix is intentional for a couple of reasons. One, it's more accretive or economically attractive business. We're definitely trying to improve the overall diversification of our portfolio mix. That was something we've been moving towards for quite some time and we're -- we've been able to do that with meaningful momentum both in North America, as well as adding the international portfolio. And so you're getting some favorable impacts from that mix of business shift from the reduction of the A&H portfolio actions that we've referenced throughout the quarters. And then taking into account, the impact of casualty expected loss ratios being more prudent or in line with our expectations there and that's why you don't see that much of an improvement in the combined ratio versus the comparatives despite this shift in the mix of business.
David Motemaden: Understood. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Hristian Getsov with Wells Fargo Securities.
Hristian Getsov: Thanks. How long do you think it will take for casualty this is reinsurance specific to firm enough in terms of just given its long tail nature for you to become more constructive? I know, it's not going to be like a huge pricing shift like we saw in property. But I guess, what do you need to see there for you to kind of return to growth in those segments?
Jim Williamson: Yes Hristian, this is Jim Williamson. One thing to keep in mind, most reinsurance casualty is on a quota share basis and so what's really going to drive our view of any individual account is a couple of things. It's how much rate obviously is our client achieving? What is the composition of their portfolio? And then, what ceding commission does that deal demand to close? And so, what we've seen is obviously not all portfolios are created equal. We price each and every deal ground up. There are many deals we like. We leaned into some of those deals in 2024 and actually expanded share with core clients and then other deals just sort of don't make the grade and that's why in total our portfolio has come down a bit. So what I would expect that we need to see in order to get to a better spot would be a broader-based improvement in underlying economics. So that's more rate acceleration, which we are starting to see in some places. I think we need to see some amelioration, some of the social inflation factors that are occurring in the market. And then we need to see more improvement in ceding commissions which have come down a bit, but those take backs have been relatively modest.
Hristian Getsov: Got you. Thank you, And then I know you guys said that you expect prop CAT pricing to be up call it 5% to 10% at 1/1. But could you provide a breakout of your expectations for US business versus international?
Jim Williamson: Yes. Hristian, it's Jim again. Yes look, I think we're relatively -- it's relatively consistent across territories. I do think US will be up slightly more than Europe. We expect Europe to recover some pricing given, what Juan had commented on earlier, which is just this persistent issue of pretty widespread severe conductive storm, flooding, hail, et cetera is what we saw with Storm Boris. So we think a correction is needed there. There are other international markets though, that I think are in a pretty good place, where you may see more of a flat pricing environment and I would point to markets like Australia and Japan. So, it's mixed. I think the key point to take away though is, those markets that have experienced loss, we expect to be firming. And I think -- and this is a general global comment, I think Property CAT pretty much around the world, is well priced and attractive to us and we're going to continue to lean into it.
Hristian Getsov: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Andrew Kligerman with TD Cowen.
Q – Andrew Kligerman: Hi. Thanks for sneaking me in there. Maybe I'll just ask a quick question. It has been interesting with the commentary we're hearing on the property markets, and Jim pointed out earlier, it's in wholesale, large global and lending. So I'm wondering of the reinsurance portfolio where you're seeing, I guess like close to 40% of your book is excess of loss, non-CAT and pro rata and then maybe in insurance about 23% -- about a quarter of the book is property short-tail stuff. Could you give us a sense of, what the proportion of the book relates to those three areas that are seeing more competition, not necessarily a specific number, but just the materiality of that business to Everest.
Jim Williamson: HI, Andrew. It's Jim Williamson. So I mean, first of all when it comes to the Property CAT XOL which is a core part of our reinsurance business, you really have to separate that from the rest, because it has its own competitive dynamics and we talked about that. The pieces of the business that I would unpack for you would be, property pro rata and then our insurance property book. In property pro rata, our reinsurance portfolio, we've leaned very heavily in the US into what I would describe as more of that core casualty business I've described more E&S, where I think pricing is very strong. It's a little less susceptible to some of the factors that we described. And so ,yes, there's a portion that will be more competitive. But by and large, I think we've got the right portfolio mix. And then in insurance, I would say, it's mix. We do write middle-market property where I think prices continue to rise. We're also writing those highly engineered shared and layer deals that I talked about, where you are seeing a little more price pressure. But what's most important, is not necessarily the direction of rate. It's where we are relative to adequacy. And I would say, uniformly in all of the areas where we're writing property, we are at or in many cases well above what we consider to be adequate pricing. And so we can write all of those areas and feel good about the profit that we'll earn.
Q – Andrew Kligerman: Excellent. And maybe along the same line cyber, how are you seeing pricing there, in insurance and reinsurance? And are you leaning in?
Jim Williamson: Yes. So cyber pricing is sort of in a place where it continues to come down a bit. It's a very small portion of our overall portfolio in both businesses. We write a little bit more in reinsurance, where terms and conditions particularly, for cyber quota share treaties have been excellent, in particular our ability to achieve pretty tight loss ratio caps. So we still think it's attractive. We're not necessarily growing that book, but it is very attractive still. On the insurance side, prices are coming down. I think there's a little bit more sensibility around that. We did experience a period where I think prices have obviously, come up very strongly more than adequately priced. You see a little more competition. So, we're being very cautious about that though. And as I said, it's a very small portion of our insurance portfolio.
Q – Andrew Kligerman: Thanks so much.
Jim Williamson: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Juan Andrade for any closing comments.
Juan Andrade: Thank you all for your questions and the excellent discussion today. I look forward to meeting again to discuss our fourth quarter results. Thank you and have a great day.
Operator: Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-08-01 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and welcome to Everest Group Limited's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Matthew Rohrmann, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Matt Rohrmann: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Everest Group Limited second quarter of 2024 earnings conference call. The Everest executives leading today's call are Juan Andrade, President and CEO; and Mark Kociancic, Executive Vice President and CFO. We are also joined by other members of the Everest management team. Before we begin, I'll preface the comments by noting that today's call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Management comments regarding estimates, projections and similar are subject to the risks, uncertainties and assumptions as noted in Everest's SEC filings. Management may also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These items are reconciled in the earnings release and financial supplement available on our website. With that, I'll turn the call over to Juan.
Juan Andrade: Thank you, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Everest had another strong quarter and an excellent first half of the year. We delivered solid second quarter underwriting and net investment income, resulting in both an annualized total shareholder return and operating return on equity of 20%. We grew in lines of business and geographies with superior profit trajectories while remaining focused on disciplined risk selection. We continue to build a well-diversified portfolio designed to produce leading financial returns. Our reinsurance business continued to generate strong results and expected risk-adjusted returns remain very attractive. Our preferred lead market position continues to be a differentiator for Everest. This was once again evident through the mid-year renewals as there was strong demand for our participation on treaties from a broad array of top-tier customers. We also made progress expanding our primary insurance franchise with investments in talent and capabilities to scale the platform globally. We opened new operations in Mexico, Colombia and Australia. Both of our underwriting businesses are capitalizing on opportunities where market conditions are most attractive and where we can achieve sustained profitable growth. At the same time, our investment portfolio is delivering strong and consistent earnings. We are executing on our strategy with significant momentum heading into the second half of the year. Most importantly, we are delivering on our primary objective of generating industry-leading financial returns as measured by total shareholder return. Our strategy provides significant operating flexibility with multiple paths to achieving our primary objective in 2024, 2025 and 2026 as outlined at our last Investor Day. With that backdrop, I will now turn to our second quarter financial highlights, beginning at the Group level. Everest second quarter performance resulted in an annualized total shareholder return of 20% and net operating income of $730 million, an increase of more than $100 million year-over-year. We grew gross written premiums by 13% in constant dollars and excluding reinstatement premiums, while remaining disciplined in casualty lines, particularly in North America. We generated $358 million in underwriting profit in the quarter and $767 million year-to-date, an increase of $94 million as compared to the first half of 2023. The Group combined ratio of 90.3% included $135 million of pre-tax catastrophe losses net of recoveries and reinstatement premiums from several mid-sized international and U.S. events. This is a good result, particularly given that the elevated level of global industry catastrophe losses is now estimated at approximately $60 billion year-to-date. In the quarter, we improved our attritional loss ratio by 70 basis points year-over-year, driven primarily by mix contributions from both segments, sustained pricing momentum and disciplined underwriting. Terms and conditions also remained favorable. As I mentioned earlier, our investment portfolio continued to perform well, producing over $0.5 billion of net investment income in the quarter and nearly $1 billion year-to-date. Turning now to our reinsurance business. Second quarter reinsurance results were excellent. The business delivered underwriting profits of more than $300 million. The attritional loss ratio and attritional combined ratio improved to 57% and 84.4%, respectively, as we continue to proactively shape the portfolio. Consistent with our execution at the January and April renewals, Everest had excellent midyear renewals. We expanded our portfolio with top-tier cedents growing across property and specialty lines, including marine, aviation and engineering at excellent expected margins. As the June 1 renewal progressed and overall reinsurance capacity became scarce in the final days, Everest secured a number of shortfall covers at superior terms. On many Florida deals, we successfully negotiated non-concurrent terms, including higher minimum premiums and lower ceding commissions. Our property book grew more than 25% at the June 1 renewal. In addition, cat exposed premium continued with a double-digit growth trajectory at the July renewal with higher expected margins compared to last year. Importantly, across the mid-year renewals, we achieved preferential signings, drove differentiated terms and conditions on a number of property catastrophe deals, and we were signed in-full on virtually every transaction we chose to participate on. Overall, we grew the business by 17% on a constant dollar basis, excluding reinstatement premiums in the second quarter. Growth in our property pro rata book increased significantly, up 31% from last year as we took advantage of the strong underlying property market, particularly in commercial E&S. Property market conditions continue to be favorable. Rates have persisted at attractive levels and terms and conditions and attachment points have not wavered from the significant improvement made over the past two years. In casualty, we remain disciplined in lines that did not meet our underwriting criteria. While casualty pro rata premiums grew in the second-quarter, this was primarily driven by strong rate increases as opposed to exposure growth. We have shed over $300 million in casualty renewal premiums so far this year as a number of programs did not meet our underwriting standards. The quality of our book is excellent and the strength of our franchise continues to set the business apart. We expect risk-adjusted returns to remain very attractive. Our outlook for 2025 remains bullish. Now turning to insurance. We grew the insurance business by 6% in constant dollars, generating $1.5 billion in premiums in the second quarter. As we continue to optimize our mix of business, overall growth was driven by a 31% increase in property short tail and 26% in specialty lines. Our international business continued to gain traction as we were rapidly becoming a go-to market for our distribution partners. The overall growth in the quarter was partially offset by the continued caution around casualty as well as the previously-announced Medical Stop Loss business exit, which started in 2023 and will be completed by the end of this year. Consistent with prior quarters, we were prudent in less attractive lines such as directors and officers liability, workers compensation and other casualty lines exposed to social inflation. We gained additional momentum and achieved rate acceleration in excess of loss trend across a wide array of casualty lines in the quarter as increases in commercial auto liability, general liability and excess casualty lines averaged in the mid-to-high teens. Looking across the portfolio, we achieved an average rate increase of over 10%, excluding workers compensation and financial lines. The combined ratio benefited from a 70 basis point improvement in the attritional loss ratio. This was offset by higher cat losses as last year's quarter was benign and lower-than-expected earned premium resulting from the underwriting actions I have already described. At our Investor Day last November, we set a goal of hitting a 90% to 92% combined ratio for insurance. We are confident in achieving our objective, but the timing for getting to our target combined ratio run rate is now 2025, and we will not be satisfied till we achieve this goal. In order to achieve our target, we must, one, create a more balanced mix of business, including more short-tail premium. Two, continue to increase scale, particularly in our international businesses, And three, continue to prudently navigate the underwriting environment. We are making good progress on all of these. First on mix. As I said, we grew short tail lines in the quarter by over 30% and our specialty business by 26%. These are good results, but there's more work to be done, particularly in North America. There were also some jurisdiction-specific regulatory approval delays in new international markets that have now been granted. Those operations are ramping up in the second half of the year. Second, scale improved in the quarter as we did achieve strong growth with very attractive loss ratios in our international businesses, where we have continued to invest in people, products, technology and infrastructure. Earned premium will start to catch up. Some of this progress was offset by our underwriting discipline actions such as the ongoing runoff of our North America Medical Stop Loss business, which I mentioned earlier. This reduced earned premium in the quarter by approximately $70 million. Finally, regarding our work to navigate the complex risk environment, we are keenly focused on the effect of social inflation on casualty loss costs. We are booking our casualty business at prudent loss picks. And while we are achieving increased rate in excess of observed loss trend, we are reducing writings in certain lines, classes and jurisdictions. As a result, casualty premiums were slightly down in the quarter. We are focused on underwriting margin and we walk away from business that does not meet our standards. We are pulling all of these levers and making progress to reach our target combined ratio for insurance. This is our immediate focus for this segment. And in conclusion, I am proud of what we have accomplished thus far. We have a clear strategy. We are focused on executing our plan and we are delivering above our target total shareholder return. We are focused on making Everest even stronger. Our reinsurance segment continued to exceed expectations. We are strengthening our insurance platform as we position ourselves as a go-to global market and continue to solidify our value proposition. With the market environment setting the stage for continued opportunity, Everest is well positioned to continue building momentum. With that, I'll turn it over to Mark to review the financials in more detail.
Mark Kociancic: Thank you, Juan, and good morning, everyone. Everest had another strong quarter, rounding out an excellent first half of 2024. We delivered significant growth in operating income, net income and net investment income for the second quarter. This drove operating earnings per share of $16.85 and both an operating ROE and annualized total shareholder return of approximately 20%. Our reinsurance division delivered another strong quarter with successful execution at recent renewals with strong top and bottom-line results. The insurance division continued to gain traction in key markets internationally. We have strong momentum across our business heading into the second half of the year. Looking at the Group results, Everest reported gross written premiums of $4.7 billion, representing 12.8% growth in constant dollars and excluding reinstatement premiums. The combined ratio was 90.3% for the quarter, driven by an improvement in the attritional loss ratio, offset by higher cat losses when compared to the prior year's relatively benign second quarter. The cat losses in the quarter were primarily driven by mid-size international events, including several global flooding events and the Taiwan earthquake as well as the U.S. convective storms. The Group attritional loss ratio was 58.8%, a 70 basis-point improvement over the prior year's quarter with both segments contributing to the improvement, which I'll discuss in more detail in just a moment. The Group's commission ratio modestly increased to 21.4%. The Group expense ratio was in line with the prior year at 6.3%, while at the same time, we continue to invest in talent and systems within both franchises. Moving to the segment results and starting with reinsurance. Gross written premiums grew 16.5% in constant dollars when adjusting for reinstatement premiums during the quarter. Growth in the quarter was consistent with the trends seen throughout the prior year with strong and broad-based growth in property and specialty lines, while we continue to remain disciplined in casualty lines. Property lines grew approximately 30% in the quarter with Property Pro Rata and Property Cat XOL both contributing to the strong growth. We continue to see the written premium mix shift towards property and short tail lines, which now stands at 56% property and 44% casualty, a 4-point shift from the prior year. The net earned premium mix stands at approximately 51% property and 49% casualty. Consistent with prior quarters, growth will continue to favor short tail business as we trend throughout the year, which will become more pronounced on an earned basis. The attritional combined ratio improved 30 basis points to 84.4% during the quarter. The attritional loss ratio improved 60 basis points to 57% as we continue to achieve more favorable rate and terms while building higher expected margins, particularly in property and specialty lines. In addition to the business mix, I mentioned earlier, the combined ratio was 88.9% as the prior year benefited from a relatively benign level of cat losses. Both the commission ratio and underwriting expense ratio relatively in line with the prior year at 24.6% and 2.6%, respectively. Moving to insurance, gross written premiums grew approximately 6% in constant dollars to $1.5 billion. We continued to methodically scale our primary franchise globally, while proactively focusing our North American portfolio towards the most accretive lines of business, led by retail property and short tail specialty lines. We're maintaining a conservative underwriting approach in casualty lines, mono-line workers comp, Medical Stop Loss and public company D&O. Our North American casualty growth is being driven predominantly by meaningful rate increases, and we began reducing certain lines such as Medical Stop Loss, starting in 2023, and we expect the drag to be completed by year end. While a number of casualty lines saw continued price acceleration in the mid-to-high teens, gross written premiums were down slightly as we are focused upon risk selection, which meet our underwriting standards. Casualty rate increases remain above loss trend. We will continue to practice prudent cycle and portfolio management, drive rate and hold the line on terms and conditions. We are starting to see the benefits of these actions in the results as the mix shift contributed to a 70 basis point improvement year-over-year in the attritional loss ratio to 63.7%. At the same time, we remain prudent with our loss picks to reflect the elevated risk environment. The commission ratio was relatively consistent with the prior year, while the underwriting-related expense ratio increased to 16.9%. The increase was a function of higher expenses due to accelerated investments in our global platform and the lag in earned premium from both underwriting discipline actions in North America and some temporary regulatory delays in new geographies that Juan mentioned earlier. We expect the expense ratio will start trending downward in 2025 and approach a more normalized level of 15% over time as our international footprint scales. Aside from cat, the lag in expected earned premium was the primary driver of the year-over-year increase in the segment combined ratio to 94.4% in the quarter. As Juan mentioned, while it will take us a little more time to get within the target insurance combined ratio range introduced at our Investor Day, we have a clear and well-defined path to achieve our insurance combined ratio objective during 2025. We do expect to have a 93% to 94% insurance combined ratio quarterly run rate for the rest of 2024. Given the overall strength of our franchise, we have significant momentum heading into the back half of the year. We are well-positioned with multiple paths to achieving our ESR objective. Our reinsurance segment continues to perform strongly and market conditions remain attractive. And as I just stated, we're on our way to improving our insurance combined ratio. Moving on to investments, net investment income increased over $170 million year-over-year to $528 million for the quarter, driven primarily by higher assets under management, higher new money yields versus maturing assets and strong performance from alternative assets. Alternative assets generated $124 million of net investment income, an improvement from the prior year as equity markets have continued to accelerate. Overall, our book yield improved from 3.9% to 4.8% year-over-year and our reinvestment rate remains well north of 5%, which is in excess of maturing security yields. We continue to have a short asset duration of approximately 3.4 years, given the attractive level of short rates. The investment portfolio remains well positioned for the current environment and is built to generate strong returns on a consistent basis. For the second quarter of 2024, our operating income tax rate was 13%, modestly higher driven by the mix of jurisdictional profits in the quarter. Our capital strength gives us ample capacity for 2024 and positions us well for profitable organic growth and to opportunistically repurchase shares. We repurchased 174,000 shares in the quarter, amounting to $65 million or an average of $374.17 per share. Year-to-date, we've repurchased 264,000 shares, amounting to $100 million. And we will continue to look opportunistically to repurchase shares in the back half of the year. Shareholder's equity ended the quarter at $14.2 billion or $15.1 billion, excluding net unrealized depreciation on available-for-sale fixed-income securities. At the end-of-the quarter, net after-tax unrealized losses on available-for-sale fixed income portfolio equates to approximately $936 million, an increase of $60 million as compared to the end-of-the first-quarter, resulting from interest rate increases. Cash flow from operations was $1.3 billion during the quarter. Book value per share ended the quarter at $327.68, an improvement of 8.9% from year-end 2023 when adjusted for dividends of $3.75 per share year-to-date. Book value per share, excluding net unrealized depreciation on available-for-sale fixed income securities stood at $349.30 versus $320.95 per share at year-end 2023, representing an increase of almost 8.8%. Net debt leverage at quarter-end stood at 15.3%, modestly lower on a sequential and year-over-year basis. In conclusion, Everest had an excellent first half of the year. We have substantial flexibility and the fundamentals of our globally diversified businesses remain strong. Our investment strategy is well positioned and our capital structure is very efficient, providing ample capacity to execute our strategic plan. All of this positions us well to achieve our primary objective of consistently generating industry-leading financial returns. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Matt.
Matt Rohrmann: Thanks, Mark. Operator, we're now ready to open the line for questions. We do ask you please limit your questions to one question plus one follow-up and rejoin the queue if you have additional questions. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question today comes from Yaron Kinar with Jefferies.
Yaron Kinar: Thank you. Good morning. My first question goes to the pushback of the reported combined ratio target in insurance to 2025. Is that mostly driven by the expense ratio? Or is the loss ratio also a bit more elevated than you expected it to be for the year?
Jim Williamson: Yes, Yaron, this is Jim Williamson. Thanks for the question. There are really two factors that we are focused on driving to get ourselves to the 90% to 92% performance level. The first is related to mix, and you heard Juan address that in his prepared remarks. We are focused and need to continue to focus on balancing our portfolio and writing more short-tailed lines. We are making excellent progress. We grew our first-party business in insurance in the quarter by over 30%. We grew our specialty business by over 25%. And third party, which is mostly liability was essentially flat. So, we are moving the mix in the right direction. We need to continue to do that. I would also add that our international business, which is growing very strongly contributes mightily to that portfolio shift. And then the second factor is related to scale. So, it's growth in all the areas I just described and continuing to drive that as we go forward and we do see excellent opportunities to do that. And then allowing our international business to fully mature. I mean we've opened a number of international offices. In most cases, you need to front load investments in people and technology and process in each of those offices. They're now online. They're producing premium. And as the earned premium catches up, you'll see more scale relative to our expense base. So, I don't really think it's an issue of the expense base being too high. We just needed to plant some seeds that we are now going to be reaping the fruit from. So those are the factors that get us there.
Yaron Kinar: Okay. And so maybe if I try to translate that into expense ratio and loss ratio, it sounds like the mix issue would also drive the loss ratio down over time. But at the same time also maybe lower the expense ratio and then the -- obviously the platform investments with slow revenues ramping up would be an expense ratio and back, right?
Jim Williamson: Yes. Yaron, you're exactly right in that. The actions we're taking, they affect both of those dimensions simultaneously. So as you're growing into short tail, you get a mix benefit on your loss ratio, even while we're holding prudent and continue to hold prudent loss picks in all our lines, but especially in casualty. And then as the earned premium catches up, particularly in international, that scale benefit will drive down our expense ratio. So it's really -- you get the benefit in both directions.
Yaron Kinar: Got it. And then my second question, obviously, there's been a lot of focus this last quarter on liability reserves for 2020 through 2023's accident years as well. And just given the reserve actions that you took at the end of last year, could you maybe give us an update on how you're looking at those reserves today, specifically liability reserves for 2020 through 2023.
Mark Kociancic: Yes, good morning, Yaron. It's Mark. Sure. So let me start with, look, we review our reserves quarterly and we do it on a comprehensive basis and that process hasn't changed. It's what we've done for numerous quarters in a row. We've set prudent loss picks and particularly for casualty, we plan to hold those loss picks. We've mentioned in previous quarters and we'll state it again today that we've got a broadly stable and elevated loss trend in U.S. casualty and that's what we expect in this kind of heightened risk environment that we've seen for quite a few quarters led by social inflation. We feel good about the loss trend that we're posting in our assumptions. It's a high single-digit for U.S. casualty. But the real key is what we've emphasized previously, which is we've been able to build significant rate, limit reductions, underwriting actions. We've been able to diversify the book significantly since 2020 and it's matured into something that's much larger and diversified than pre-2020. And we're also benefiting from the international expansion we're having on the primary side as it further diversifies long tail, short tail lines and the long tail international lines come with a different type of risk profile, which is, I would argue more favorable. So in terms of where we are today, our picks are holding. We have various puts and takes for the first half of the year, but nothing material overall. So we're standing tight.
Yaron Kinar: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Gregory Peters with Raymond James.
Gregory Peters: Good morning, everyone. So for my first question, you mentioned in the call, in your prepared remarks about shaping the portfolio and skewing it more towards shorter term or short-tailed businesses, including more cat property exposures. And so I guess what I'm curious is, how does that -- how does that change the cat assumptions that you guys are thinking about as it relates both to the reinsurance and insurance segments?
Juan Andrade: Yes. Thanks, Greg. This is Juan. Good to hear from you. Look, I think there's a couple of things here that are important to keep in mind. One is how nimble and opportunistic we can be as a culture and as a company, which we're very focused on always trying to identify the highest economic return opportunities. And that's what you see us doing in both segments, both in reinsurance as well as primary insurance at this point in time. While there has been a moderation in pricing in property, property is still very adequate and we continue to be very much attracted to those lines of business and the expected returns in those lines of business continue to be quite strong for us. From a cat appetite standpoint, that really just is not having an impact as far as how we view our underwriting cat appetite and we continue to be in the box that we put out for you in our investor presentation really now going on for about three or four years. So we feel quite good about where we are. But the bigger picture in all of this is really skewing the portfolio to where we see the biggest margin opportunities around the world. But I'll ask Jim to maybe add a little bit of context as well.
Jim Williamson: Yes, sure, Greg. It's Jim Williamson. So the one thing I would emphasize that Juan has already said because I do think it's very important is if you look at our risk metrics, we've talked about earnings and capital at risk, we are well within the stated Group appetite. And so that gives us the flexibility where we see great opportunities to deploy some more capacity. And you certainly saw us do that in the second quarter, driven mostly by reinsurance, but also by insurance. The other thing that I think is a really telling item is the fact that our insurance division, while we have had such strong growth in first party lines, we haven't really had outsized cat losses even though there's been a lot of activity, certainly in the U.S. and around the world. And that's because we've been careful to grow our business, particularly in non-peak zones. And we've also been very thoughtful about where we're participating in large programs, shared and layered programs about selecting our attachment points thoughtfully to get the best economics and it also keeps us away from a lot of the attritional cat activity we've seen. So nothing in our growth trajectory that we see right now would change our assumptions around the cat load, for example, feeling very good about things.
Gregory Peters: Fair enough. I'm going to pivot to the top-line results in the insurance segment for my second question. If I look at the year-over-year comparison on a net written basis, not a lot of growth as you continue to adjust the portfolio, you mentioned the Medical Stop Loss is one point. When you think about how -- and you talked about the target combined ratio moving it to 2025, how should we think about consolidated top-line growth inside the insurance segment as you continue to reshape the portfolio trying to get your target combined ratio.
Jim Williamson: Yes, Greg, it's Jim again. Good question. So a couple of points. One, where you started on net written premium, you'll see obviously, that's a different number than the growth rate you're seeing on gross written. Really two factors there. First is the geography of our gross written premium growth has changed as we've focused on reshaping the portfolio. And so we've been growing more top-line in lines of business with a lower net-to-gross retention. So you will see for the next couple of quarters just a slight drag on net written premium as a result of that. And then lastly, there was just a change related to our hedging strategy in some of our short tail lines in North-America that creates a little bit of a drag on net written premium as well. So we'll work through that on a year-over-year basis over the next couple of quarters and then it won't be a factor as we go forward. In terms of you know, growing from there and driving the scale that we'll need to get to the 90 to 92 combined ratio and all the other things we talked about, it's really continuing the things that we said. So in this quarter, again first party up over 30, specialty over 25, now that's offset by the fact that third-party lines, despite all the rate we're taking were essentially flat. But the growth in those shorter tail lines, the expansion of our international business is really picking up speed. It's becoming a larger part of our overall business across all those dimensions. And so I think it will overcome this cautious approach we have on casualty as we move forward, which is why although we were not at the level of performance that we want to see yet, we remain very confident that we'll get there because all the levers that we need to pull are right in front of us.
Gregory Peters: Got it. Thanks for the detail.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question is on the insurance 90% to 92% target. So you guys said 93% to 94% this year and then going within that range next year. Is that something that we should think about? You'll be within the 90% to 92% in the first quarter of '25 or is it something that you'll build to throughout the year?
Mark Kociancic: Good morning, Elyse. It's Mark. So yes, I expect this to be 93% to 94% for the remainder of the next two quarters, largely driven by the two features that we've discussed. So one, you've got an elevated expense ratio as we're ramping up and then this mix of business earned premium dynamic will likely persist for a few more quarters. I do see us getting into that 90% to 92% range in the back-half of 2025. So it will be a gradual transition over the coming quarters.
Elyse Greenspan: Thanks. And then my second question is also keeping on the insurance business. You guys said that rate was 10% ex-workers comp and financial lines. So what loss costs would compare to that 10? And then can you also provide the all-in rate that you're seeing across the insurance book, including workers' comp and financial lines?
Juan Andrade: Yes. Elyse, this is Juan. So the loss trend that we're seeing is roughly high single-digits. So the 10% obviously compares well to that. And remember what we said about the long-tail lines about commercial auto liability, general liability in excess that are running into the mid-to-high teens up and that's been accelerating. So we feel pretty good about where we are as far as being rate ahead of loss trend and all of that. If you include sort of where we are, including workers' compensation, it's roughly pretty stable to what we've seen over the last three or four quarters, which is right around 6% or 7%, including workers compensation.
Elyse Greenspan: And then what about if you also include financial lines?
Juan Andrade: That's all included. So if we include everything together, it's about 6% to 7%.
Elyse Greenspan: Thank you.
Juan Andrade: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from Michael Zaremski with BMO.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, it's actually Dan on for Mike. Thanks. Good morning. First one, just a follow-up on the insurance combined ratio target. Your answer on the mix of business being one of the -- does that imply that your views on the loss ratios worsened versus last quarter since the business mix has been changing or is it a more prudent view on the casualty loss ratio, which would make sense given casualty inflation levels or is it that the mix maybe hasn't shifted as much as you expected? Thanks.
Jim Williamson: Yes, Dan, it's Jim Williamson. So it really comes down to the speed at which that mix is adjusting because we have sustained very prudent loss picks. On the casualty lines, our view on that hasn't changed and we really haven't had anything that's affected the short-tail loss picks either. So it's all about mix. While we have had terrific results in the mix shift and the growth in the short tail and specialty lines that I described, we had hoped to be a little further along. A couple of things are going on under the covers, mainly it took us a little longer-than-expected to get some of our international offices approved for operation. Those are now all up and running and we'll see the benefits of that over the back half. And then I would just say generally, as we've started this mix shift, you see it in the written premium first and we're -- when I'm citing like a 30-plus percent first-party growth rate that's on a gross written premium basis. Now that the net written premium is catching up, that will begin to have that gearing effect on our ratios as we move forward both -- and that's again, both a loss ratio and then with the scale comes a better expense ratio.
Juan Andrade: And the other thing. I would add, and this is Juan, it's really going back to Yaron's question and what I said in my prepared remarks that the international business is growing quite well and it's grown with very attractive loss ratios, right? This is something that we've talked about in prior calls. Those loss ratios are well in the 50s. And so as that business continues to be a bigger portion of the overall insurance business you should get a positive mix benefit happening there.
Unidentified Analyst: Great, thanks. And then maybe just following up on the international growth and Everest strategy growing internationally. Just wondering about what kind of the social inflation level you're seeing internationally and how that's impacting your loss assumptions and growth appetite maybe in certain geographies?
Jim Williamson: Yes. It's a great question. Frankly, it's one of the reasons why we strategically decided to do this now a few years ago. Look, social inflation is largely a U.S. phenomenon because of the tort system and the way our legal system works in the United States. Outside of the U.S., there's very few jurisdictions that have anywhere near the same level of inflation, legal system and abuse that you have in the United States of America. So from that perspective, growing overseas is one of the reasons why it produces a lower loss ratio overall. In addition to that is most of these markets tend to be more first-party oriented towards property, marine, those kinds of lines, which carry better loss ratios to begin with. So I would highlight that listen, outside of the U.S., you know, there's very few jurisdictions that have similar issues and frankly, nowhere even close to what you see in the United States from a legal system abuse perspective.
Unidentified Analyst: Awesome. Thank you.
Jim Williamson: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Brian Meredith of UBS.
Brian Meredith: Yes, thanks. Two of them here for you. First one, more of a numbers question on the 93 to 94 in insurance for the remainder of the year. I'm assuming and maybe I'm wrong here that you would have a higher cat load in the third quarter than the fourth quarter. So is that kind of an average you're thinking over the remainder of the year or am I wrong there?
Mark Kociancic: Brian, it's Mark. You'd be right, but cat is a much smaller proportion of the primary segment than of the reinsurance segment. And we've done a pretty nice job, I think, of managing cat risk in general. So that is included in our run rate 93 to 94 figure.
Brian Meredith: Got you. That makes sense. Thank you. And then second question one, I'm just curious, Jim, the expansion internationally, obviously, a lot of -- you've got a little bit of expense coming through. But I guess, is there any contemplation of adverse selection as you kind of move into these newer markets that a lot of them are kind of entrenched with legacy carriers have been there for a long, long, long time. Maybe tell me about how you're going to kind of approaching this and kind of getting into these new markets?
Jim Williamson: Yes. No, that's a great question, Brian. Look, really what we're after is upper middle market and large account business where there's significant competitive gaps among the other players in that space. So remember, we're not playing in small commercial or consumer lines in any of these markets where you would have the more local or regional companies that are entrenched in this. We are dealing with risks that have sophisticated risk managers, sophisticated risk needs, et cetera. And frankly, a lot of the competition is not focused on the space right now. So for us, it's really about a competitive advantage that is based on service, it's based on risk expertise, things like loss control, loss engineering, claims, et cetera, et cetera. So it's a very different risk mindset than you would run into in a sort of typical small commercial middle market type environment. It's really a segment where the risk manager really values the underwriting acumen and the expertise of our team essentially.
Mark Kociancic: Yes. Brian.
Brian Meredith: Thank you. Yes.
Juan Andrade: Sorry, I just wanted to add just two quick things to Jim Williamson, two quick things that I think are also very important there. The first is we have been able to attract really the best people in each of the markets that we've chosen to launch our operations in, which I think gives us a line of sight into risk quality locally that you can't get if you try to run these businesses with expats. And then I would also say that we monitor the results of that business very closely. And as we said, it skews much shorter tail. So we're getting a quick read, an early read on performance of that business and all results so far indicate that we have excellent performance in our risk selection.
Brian Meredith: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Dean Criscitiello with KBW.
Dean Criscitiello: Hi. I wanted to dig a bit into the attritional loss ratio within insurance. Of that 70 basis points of year-over-year improvement, is there any way to sort of quantify like the positive mix shift benefits there? And also was wondering if that loss pick assumes higher casualty loss trends.
Mark Kociancic: So good morning, Dean. It's Mark. So we've had a couple of things. First of all, we set prudent loss picks across the Board. So whether it's property or casualty taking into account market conditions at the beginning of the year from last year's planning cycle and then thoroughly reviewed every quarter, there is a shift in mix generally. So broadly speaking, you heard us talk about a significant growth in property. I think the figures were roughly 31%, specialty line growth north of 20% and then more modest movement on the U.S. casualty side in particular. So what you're seeing in general is, I think the figures are roughly 62% long-tail line composition of our premium mix in Q4 of last year, diminishing to something closer to 55%, 56% at this point. So, you've got a swing in the mix from longer tail to shorter tail. And in conjunction with that, you've got an increase in premium composition coming from the international markets relative to what we're doing in North America. So, that's going to swing some of those, that's going to swing the overall attritional loss ratio mechanically. I think most of the swing year-over-year will be a function of mix and a lesser function of the loss pick selection.
Dean Criscitiello: Thank you with that. I wanted to next shift to the casualty reinsurance. I was just curious about how the market conditions, competition, rate dynamics are different between the pro rata book and the excess of loss book.
Jim Williamson: Yes, sure. Dean, it's Jim Williamson. I mean, those are in many ways very, very different businesses, even though they're both casualty. What we've seen in casualty pro rata is just an abundance of capacity in the market. It's been more competitive than we think frankly it makes sense, and one of the key dynamics that we think needs to play out is a reduction in ceding commissions on that line. There has been some progress, but it's been in the neighborhood of about a point on average as we've moved through our renewals. We think more is needed and that's one of the reasons in addition just to some caution around the heightened risk environment that we've shed over $300 million in casualty pro rata renewals this year. And so that it's a pretty competitive market and we pick our spots carefully. We think the book performs well, but we are cautious. Casualty XOL is a very different market. It's a quite a small portion of our portfolio. While we did see a lot of -- we've seen growth at times. In the quarter, we were actually down slightly. The issue that we have there is not so much related to commission levels. It's really just making sure that our cedents are carefully managing social inflation. That is a line where we've seen some of that activity. And that's why we keep it as a relatively small share of our business.
Dean Criscitiello: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from [Peter Kennison] with Evercore ISI.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, good morning. So I'm curious on the Prop Cat Re growth number. I know last quarter that 4% growth had some impact by the recognition timing of Florida from 2Q '23. And I think ex that it was really up 24% on a clean basis. I'm wondering, is that '25 reported number a clean number or is there any sort of timing impact in this quarter as well that you could help me remove, if possible?
Mark Kociancic: So Peter, it's Mark here. So in terms of the reinsurance Property Cat XOL growth, we've got 30% growth year-over-year on a quarterly basis, so Q2 this year versus Q2 last year. We talked about the dynamics last quarter about the methodology of booking it on a quarterly basis versus the almost what I would call a cash basis, which was really the deposit premiums on Q1 and Q3. And so that's been working its way through the system. The way I would look at it is if you take a look at the four quarters trailing, you're right in the 20% range or slightly above. So, this will normalize out by the end-of-the year, this accounting phenomenon. So that's really 30% year-over-year on the quarter and a north of 20% run rate on a rolling 12-month basis?
Unidentified Analyst: Yes. Okay, great. Thank you. And just following up on that growth. You know, a pretty solid result amidst a time where we've maybe seen some others pull back a little bit. And so I guess I'm just wondering if you could maybe talk more about what Everest is seeing there that might be different or what Everest is doing differently that's allowing you guys to really lean in right now.
Jim Williamson: Sure, Peter. This is Jim Williamson. We have enjoyed a really terrific set of circumstances and opportunities in Property Cat. And I would really point to a couple of things. First, we've really achieved a lead market position in this generational hard market and it began really at the end of 2022 where you had a dislocated property cat market post Hurricane Ian. There was a lot of uncertainty in the market and frankly, a lot of bad behavior on the part of a number of reinsurers in terms of how they were treating their customers. I think Everest got high marks for being constructive, for being willing to create price discovery and for putting capacity to work. And the benefit of that and the reputational impact of that, I think will be very long-lived. And because we've been so consistent since that point in terms of how we manage our customers, getting out early ahead of renewals, you know, feeding capacity where it makes sense into their programs, taking up shortfalls, et cetera, we now are really in that lead market position. And what that brings to us is the opportunity to be the first carrier they call when they're looking to fill out new capacity and there's been a lot of new capacity buying. So that's been a boon to us. In many instances, we're able to achieve non-concurrent terms because our customers want us on their programs and that can benefit us in terms of pricing, in terms of terms and conditions. On the pro rata side, it can benefit us in ceding commissions. So you reap all kinds of benefits and that's been a very attractive part of this. And then I would just say it's also yielded benefits outside of property cat. So we get a first look at new programs or attractive non-cat lines of business that we want to write. So those are the things that I think are driving differentiated results for us. Now what we see in the market, whether it was the 6/1 renewal or 7/1 or frankly our expectations for January 1, 2025 is that the expected economics of these deals remain excellent. So as we model these transactions, expected return on our capital is just exceptional and we're continuing to lean into that. Our terms and conditions, which improved strongly at January 1, '23 have stayed strong. There's been no giveback that we've seen, no material give back in terms and conditions, which is significant. And then lastly, attachment points are not moving. And we like that because it takes us out of this attritional cat losses, if you will. So really it's our execution plus a market opportunity that remains excellent that allows us to drive the results you're seeing.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Charlie Lederer with Citigroup.
Charlie Lederer: Hi, thank you. I think you mentioned shedding some casualty programs business in your remarks. Juan, I guess, was that a new termination or was it related to some of the issues from last year? And can you help us better understand what you're shedding?
Juan Andrade: Yes, sure. So I mentioned two things. So I mentioned that in the reinsurance segment, we have shed about $300 million of casualty pro-rata renewals so far in the first six months of the year. And I think Jim did a nice job expanding on that a few minutes ago. Those were basically a pro-rata deals that we didn't like the economics. We're being cautious in casualty, as I stated, and so we moved on, but you still saw the growth of the book in general. And even in the casualty line, you saw growth. But as I said in my remarks, it was all rate-driven as opposed to exposure driven. So, I think that's the first part of that. And then on the insurance side of things, it's a similar story, right, where we are being cautious. And I said that we had rate in excess-of-loss trend for the long-tail lines in excess of mid-to-high teens which is excellent. But you also saw the top-line for the casualty lines be slightly down. And so that gives you a little bit of a sense of the discipline where we're looking at certain classes, jurisdictions, lines of business very carefully. And frankly, we're choosing to grow in areas where there's better margins, more certain margins, which are certainly the specialty lines and the short-tailed property lines right now.
Charlie Lederer: Got it. Thanks. And I don't think you touched on this, but sorry if you did. So beyond the three geographies you detailed for new entrants or new entries internationally, are there other major markets that you're looking to enter and scale near-term in insurance?
Juan Andrade: We have one more that we have on tap before the end-of-the year and that's basically Italy in Europe. And I think at that point, we'll pause for a period of time and really starting to dig deeper into each of the geographies that we've already opened.
Charlie Lederer: Thank you.
Juan Andrade: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference over to Juan Andrade for any closing comments.
Juan Andrade: Great. Thank you. Thank you all for the questions and the excellent discussion today. I look forward to meeting again and discussing our third quarter results. Thank you for your support of Everest.
Operator: Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-04-30 08:00:00) =====
Matthew Rohrmann: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Everest Group Limited First Quarter of 2024 Earnings Conference Call. The Everest executives leading today's call are Juan Andrade, President and CEO; and Mark Kociancic, Executive Vice President and CFO. We are also joined by other members of the Everest Management team.
 Before we begin, I'll preface the comments on today's call by noting that Everest SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. Management comments regarding estimates, projections and similar are subject to the risks, uncertainties and assumptions as noted in these filings.
 Management may also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These items are reconciled in our earnings release and financial supplement.  
 With that, I'll turn the call over to Juan. 
Juan Carlos Andrade: Thank you, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. We had a strong start to 2024. Our first quarter results included record underwriting profit and significant increases in operating income, net income and investment income. This resulted in a total shareholder return exceeding 18% and an operating return on equity of 20%.
 We drove margin expansion through rate increases that are meaningfully in excess of loss trend, targeted risk selection, portfolio and cycle management, exposure growth and with underwriting discipline. We accomplished this while consistently and purposely maintaining conservatism in our loss space. We are confident in how we have shaped our portfolio.
 In reinsurance, we built on our preferred lead market position at the January 1 renewals and continue to distinguish Everest in the accelerating flight to quality. Our Reinsurance portfolio is well positioned and driving strong risk-adjusted returns.
 In Insurance, we advanced our disciplined expansion in targeted markets while remaining focused on prudent risk selection and the bottom line. We are focused on our primary objective of delivering consistent, leading financial returns. With the 3-year strategic plan, we laid out during November 2023 Investor Day, Everest has entered a new chapter of profitable growth and opportunity, and we are well positioned for the future with a focused strategy and great talent.
 Now I'll turn to the first quarter financial highlights, beginning with our group results. We delivered $709 million in net operating income, a 60% increase from the prior year. Gross written premium increased by over 17% in constant dollars. Our growth in the quarter was broad-based and reflects Everest's diversification by segment, geography, business line and distribution. Growth was supported by best-in-class execution and our ability to take advantage of market conditions in Reinsurance and Insurance, particularly in property and specialty lines.
 Our underwriting performance was strong in the first quarter. We delivered $409 million in underwriting profit. The group combined ratio was 88.8%, a significant improvement from last year. This is despite the industry incurring approximately $20 billion in catastrophe losses in the quarter.  
 For Everest, pretax catastrophe losses, net of estimated recoveries and reinstatement premiums were $85 million or just 2.3 points, a year-over-year decrease directly resulting from our portfolio optimization efforts. Everest catastrophe losses were primarily driven by the Francis Scott Key Bridge Collapse in Baltimore.  
 With regard to investments, we generated net investment income of $457 million, a new quarterly record.
 Now turning to our Reinsurance business. Reinsurance delivered significant top and bottom line growth. Our success at the January 1 renewal gave us a running start to the year, delivering a higher quality, higher-margin portfolio. We grew the Reinsurance business in the first quarter, over 20% on a constant dollar basis, with $3.2 billion in gross written premiums.
 We increased underwriting profit to $345 million, with an 87.3% combined ratio. The attritional loss ratio and attritional combined ratio also improved to 57.2% and 84.4%, respectively. This quarter included pretax catastrophe losses of $80 million, net of estimated recoveries and reinstatement premiums. Both rate and terms and conditions remained at attractive levels, resulting in a portfolio that should continue to achieve excellent risk-adjusted returns.
 We grew our total property portfolio significantly, building on meaningful increases in 2023. We expanded our portfolio in attractive specialty lines of business, particularly marine and aviation. We remain disciplined and surgical in our approach to certain casualty lines. Our responsiveness, creativity and constructive approach to the market once again set Everest apart. We deepened relationships with top-tier clients globally while capturing incremental demand and growing share on oversubscribed deals.
 We continued this positive momentum through the April renewals, resulting in high-quality, broad-based growth, particularly in property lines and excellent overall risk-adjusted returns. We capitalized on strong demand, expanding with core cedents, while also growing with targeted new partners. Consistent with the January renewal, we maintained discipline in certain casualty lines, nonrenewing business that did not meet our thresholds.
 Overall, the market remains disciplined and trading conditions continue to be favorable, particularly in property and specialty lines. We continue to see incremental demand from cedents, and we are leaning into these opportunities. We expect risk-adjusted returns to remain attractive through upcoming renewals and into 2025.
 Now turning to insurance. We continue to unlock value in our primary insurance business, making solid strides in bringing our capabilities to new markets globally. We grew the Insurance segment by 10% in constant dollars and generated over $1.2 billion in premiums for the quarter. Growth was diversified with 37% growth in property and 36% in specialty lines such as aviation, energy, surety and marine. We see strong rate and terms and conditions in these lines.
 Also, due to strong rate increases, we saw modest growth in some casualty lines. With a consistent emphasis on profitability, we focused on lines of business with favorable pricing and strong profit trajectories. We achieved a 12% rate increase across the portfolio, excluding workers' compensation and financial lines. Loss trends in casualty remain elevated but they're stable and pricing continues to meaningfully outpace that trend.
 We continue to see rate acceleration across casualty lines excluding financial lines. This was most pronounced in commercial auto liability, general liability and excess casualty lines. The rate increases in these 3 lines average mid-teens overall. The combined ratio at 93.1% resulted in an underwriting profit of $64 million. The attritional loss ratio was 64%, reflecting our discipline and continued loss pick conservatism in casualty lines of business.
 We also continued our proactive shift or short-tail lines, which we expect will benefit underlying margins throughout the remainder of the year. As I've said in the past, we will recognize bad news quickly, and the good news from our positive portfolio rate actions will season over time. We are focused on profitably growing in geographies and lines of business we find attract while continuing to drive rate in excess of loss trend.  
 Our first quarter continued to demonstrate the strength of Everest franchise and the results of our actions over the past 4 years. We see significant opportunities for our underwriting businesses globally, and trading conditions remain favorable. I'm excited about the journey ahead for our business and our ability to continue delivering leading financial returns.
 With that, I'll turn it over to Mark to review the financials in more detail. 
Mark Kociancic: Thank you, Juan, and good morning, everyone. Everest is off to a strong start to 2024. We delivered significant growth in underwriting income, net investment income, operating income and net income for the first quarter. This drove operating EPS of $16.32, and an operating ROE of 20%. The annualized TSR or total shareholder return was strong at 18.1% despite modest foreign exchange headwinds. The company's strong performance in the first quarter was led by our team's high level of execution and ability to capitalize on attractive opportunities. We have significant momentum behind us across both of our franchises driven by excellent outcomes at recent renewals and our disciplined insurance expansion into target global markets.
 Looking at the group results. Everest reported gross written premiums of $4.4 billion, representing 17.2% growth in constant dollars and excluding reinstatement premiums. The combined ratio was 88.8% for the quarter, driven by an improved underlying loss ratio and lower Cat losses. The CAT losses in the quarter were largely driven by the Baltimore bridge collapse, which contributed $70 million to Cat losses.  
 The group attritional loss ratio was 58.9% and a 90 basis point improvement over the prior year's quarter with both segments contributing to the improvement. The group's commission ratio was 21.4%, consistent with the prior year. The group expense ratio improved 30 basis points to 6.1% in the quarter, an excellent result as we continue to invest in talent and systems within both franchises.
 Moving to the segment results and starting with Reinsurance. Gross written premiums grew 20.4% in constant dollars when adjusting for reinstatement premiums during the quarter. Growth in the quarter was consistent with the trends seen throughout the prior year with strong and broad-based growth in property and specialty lines, while we continue to remain disciplined in certain casualty lines.
 Property lines grew 31% in the quarter, while casualty lines grew 11% in the quarter, and we continue to see the written premium mix shift towards property and short-tail lines, which now stands at 54% property and 46% casualty versus 50% property and 50% casualty in the prior year. Growth will continue to favor short-tail business as we trend throughout the year, which will be more pronounced on an earned basis.  
 The combined ratio was 87.3% an improvement of 350 basis points from the prior year. The attritional loss ratio improved 80 basis points to 57.2% as we continue to achieve more favorable rate and terms particularly in property and specialty lines. The attritional combined ratio improved 150 basis points to 84.4% during the quarter.
 Both the commission ratio and underwriting expense ratio improved modestly to 24.6% and 2.6% in the quarter, respectively.
 Moving to Insurance. Gross premiums written grew approximately 10% in constant dollars to $1.2 billion. We continue to methodically scale our primary franchise globally while proactively focusing our North American portfolio towards the most accretive lines of business, led by retail property and short-tail specialty lines. The growth in casualty and professional lines was driven by rate increases as a number of lines saw continued price acceleration in the quarter.
 The attritional loss ratio stood at 64% this quarter, an improvement of 40 basis points from the prior year. The commission ratio was consistent with the prior year, while the underwriting related expense ratio increased to 16.6%, driven by the continued investment in our global platform.
 Moving on to investments. Net investment income increased nearly $200 million year-over-year to $457 million for the quarter, driven primarily by higher assets under management and higher new money yields versus maturing assets. Alternative assets generated $74 million of net investment income, an improvement from the prior year as equity markets have continued to rebound.
 Our overall book yield improved from 3.8% to 4.7% year-over-year and our reinvestment rate remains north of 5%, which is in excess of maturing security yields. We continue to have a short asset duration of approximately 3.4 years given the attractive level of short rates.
 The investment portfolio remains well positioned for the current environment and is supported by the compounding effect of strong underwriting income and cash flow. Our high-quality portfolio is built to generate strong returns on a consistent basis.
 For the first quarter of 2024, our operating income tax rate was 12.2%, which was broadly in line with our working assumption for the year. Our capital strength gives us ample capacity for 2024 and positions us well for profitable organic growth. We opportunistically repurchased 90,000 shares in the quarter, amounting to $35 million with an average of $387.64 per share. Shareholders' equity ended the quarter at $13.6 billion or $14.5 billion when excluding net unrealized depreciation on available-for-sale fixed income securities.
 At the end of the quarter, net after-tax unrealized losses on the available-for-sale fixed income portfolio equates to approximately $876 million, an increase of $153 million as compared to the end of the fourth quarter, resulting from interest rate increases. Cash flow from operations was $1.1 billion during the quarter. Book value per share ended the quarter at $313.55, an improvement of 3.6% from year-end 2023 when adjusted for dividends of $1.75 per share year-to-date. Book value per share, excluding net unrealized depreciation on available-for-sale fixed income securities stood at $333.70 versus $320.95 per share at year-end 2023, representing an increase of approximately 4%.
 Net debt leverage at quarter end stood at 15.8%, modestly lower on a sequential and year-over-year basis.
 In conclusion, Everest had an excellent start to the year. Market fundamentals remain attractive and we have strong momentum across both underwriting franchises.
 And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Matt. 
Matthew Rohrmann: Thanks, Mark. Operator, we are now ready to open the line for questions. We do ask that you please limit your questions to 1 question plus 1 follow up, then rejoin the queue if you have additional questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions]  
 Our first question comes from David Motemaden from Evercore ISI. 
David Motemaden: I just had a question on the premium growth in property Cat. I was a little surprised at the 4% growth, I thought it would have been more than that, just given how attractive market conditions are. Could you elaborate on what you're seeing and it looks like you may have shifted a little bit more towards property pro rata. Maybe just talk about why you chose to grow that instead of a property Cat. 
James Williamson: Sure, David, this is Jim Williamson. Thanks for the question.
 First of all, just on the property Cat XOL growth that you're seeing printed in the quarter, that's really a premium recognition timing phenomena. And so if you look back at the June 2023 property Cat renewal, which was the Florida renewal, that was really the only renewal last year that we did not grow. And so you're seeing that roll through the numbers in this quarter. All of the other renewal dates that we've experienced recently have shown strong growth.
 And just to give you some of that perspective, at the January 1 renewal of this year, we grew our property Cat business by 24%, which was just excellent. We did that at outstanding risk-adjusted returns. And then we were able to continue that growth at the April 1 renewal, where we grew globally just about 10% and in our North America property business, we grew property Cat by 76%, again, at outstanding risk-adjusted economics.
 So it's a little bit of a blip that way. My expectation, obviously, is it will work itself out as we go forward.
 In terms of the property pro rata part of your question, it's really not a matter of saying, okay, we now like property pro rata better than property Cat XOL for the reasons I just described. What it is, is it's starting really in the back half of last year, we saw just terrific economics in the primary property market, particularly in the E&S space in North America. We leaned into that with our core clients and wrote bigger lines with some of the best underwriters in the market, and that's now flowing into our financials, and we're picking it up in meaningful growth this quarter.
 And then the other major contributor to pro rata property growth is the expansion of our business in Asia, where we've traditionally been underweight. We're growing very nicely again with best-in-class underwriters in that market. And that market does tend to be more of a pro rata market and very much a property market. And so you're seeing the effects of selecting some really outstanding deals in the Asia market. 
David Motemaden: Got it. Understood. Thanks for that clarification on the property Cat growth. I appreciate it. 
 And then maybe, Juan, just on the attritional loss ratio in the Insurance business. So I caught that you're expecting that to come down over the course of the rest of the year as you shift to more short-tail lines or that should benefit underlying margins throughout the remainder of the year.
 Could you just elaborate on that a little bit and just maybe talk about what drove the 64% this quarter? I think you mentioned conservatism, but I was just wondering if you could just talk about that and maybe also what sort of impact that has on your view of the 2020 through 2023 accident year, if at all? 
Juan Carlos Andrade: Yes. This is Juan. Let me start and then I'll ask Mark Kociancic to add some color as well. 
 I think the most important thing is, really start with sort of the framework, right? So we have been essentially running between the 63% and 64% attritional loss ratio in insurance over the past 2 years. And so there's a couple of things. One, in every quarter, you're going to have some timing and mix noise, but the fundamentals to our approach have remained consistent. And that's really the fact that we have been very disciplined underwriters and we continue to remain conservative with our loss picks for casualty lines in both divisions, not only in Insurance and this is something that we have talked about in prior venues.
 So we're holding our loss picks longer across all lines of business even if we see favorable loss experience in any given quarter and we're going to continue to do that in a very disciplined and systematic manner. And so that's basically what you're seeing as far as the 64% here in the quarter. But let me ask Mark to add a little bit more on that. 
Mark Kociancic: Yes. Juan, just a couple of things to add to the equation. So in addition to the conservatism and the prudence of the lost fix, we feel very good about the margin that we're building in the lines that we're writing. We're obviously tracking loss trend, give you a couple of high-level points on that. Essentially, it's been elevated for a while, for several quarters, but stable, broadly stable, and rate has been meaningfully in excess of trends. So we feel good. No issue on our side to have the extra, what we would call, level of prudence in those loss picks given the loss environment that Juan spoke about and I spoke about during the Investor Day.
 I do think mix of business will eventually push the loss ratio mechanically lower as we had a bit more short-tail lines to the mix overall. And that should happen throughout the year and a little bit more over time over the 3-year plan. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Meredith from UBS. 
Brian Meredith: Juan, I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about your expectations for midyear renewals. We're hearing some signs from brokers that there's ample capacity and maybe we're seeing property Reinsurance pricing kind of peaking out. Is that your perspective on things? 
Juan Carlos Andrade: So sure, Brian. Let me get started, and I'll ask Jim to give you a little bit of extra color on all of this.
 Look, I think as we've said, both in my prepared remarks and in Jim's question -- answer to David a few minutes ago, we had a terrific 1/1 renewal and we had an excellent 4/1 renewal. So at this point in time, we got close to 70% of our book that's been renewed at what we believe are excellent risk-adjusted returns. The market for us continues to be pretty good. If you think about it from a pricing perspective, you would expect some of the pricing to moderate, given that we've had rate on rate on rate, particularly in some of these geographies over time. But I think more importantly is the fact that attachment points and terms and conditions have continued to hold. And I think that is a critical point to keep in mind going forward for the future.
 The other thing is what I said in my prepared remarks, which is our competitors remain disciplined. So the trading conditions from that perspective continue to be favorable. But let me ask Jim to give a little bit more color on how he views Florida at 6/1, and then some of the 7/1 renewals as well. 
James Williamson: Sure, Brian. Thanks for the question. Just to maybe reinforce some of the points Juan made, which I think are spot on. We have seen really terrific results from the most recent renewals, including April. And you would certainly have expected, given how much rate the market took last year, that more underwriters are going to be interested in writing the business. And while that's true, we've also seen just a floor under the discipline that people are applying to this market, which is what's sustaining terms and conditions, keeping risk-adjusted rate on the upward trajectory, which is resulting in the economics that we find so attractive. 
 The other thing to keep in mind is we're still experiencing elevated losses around the world. And while we had a terrific Q1 Cat result, the fact is Cats remain elevated, whether it's weather, earthquake, man-made disasters, et cetera, those things are happening, and I think that's keeping a focus on the discipline that the market is pursuing. 
 And then the other factor to keep an eye on is we see some really strong increasing demand from some of our best clients. And given Everest's position as a preferred and lead market, we have opportunities to deploy incremental capacity at really attractive rates. And I think that's happening both at the major renewals but also between those renewals. And there's a lot more in that pipeline that I think will help to sustain the market.
 And so our perspective is, as we roll into the rest of 2024 with Florida renewal in June and then the 7/1 renewal, primarily driven by Australia, we expect discipline to be maintained, risk-adjusted economics should be terrific. And then I would further say that our expectation remains that, that will continue into 2025. 
Brian Meredith: That's really helpful. And then I just wanted to pivot back to the Insurance underlying, call it loss ratio just quickly here. I know that last year, you had some mid stop loss one-offs. So year-over-year, it looks like about 150 basis points up year-over-year.
 But I'm just curious, how much of maybe that conservatism you've built in is due to perhaps financial lines and workers' comp? I know you gave us a rate of 12x financial lines and comp. I'm curious, was that your -- you put everything all in. And if that is one of the contributing factors to the year-over-year increase? 
Mark Kociancic: Yes. Brian, it's Mark. I don't think it is. I think workers' comp is broadly stable in the last few years. So that's not driving it. 
 You're right, we had 100 -- roughly 150 basis points of delta last year because of A&H. There is a bit of mix that drove the delta from last year down to something that was sub-63% attritional loss ratio. But I'd say our run rate is more in the 63% to 64% range. And I think what you're seeing here is just a mix of business that is skewed a bit more to longer-tail casualty, and we're keeping those loss picks at a healthy level, a prudent level on our side. 
Brian Meredith: Do you have the all-in number for kind of what rate looked like in the first quarter when you include financial and comp? 
Juan Carlos Andrade: Yes, that would be about a little bit over 7%. 
Operator: And our next question is coming from Michael Zaremski from BMO. 
Michael Zaremski: Follow-up on the primary insurance pricing. I think you might have answered part of this, but so the rates have accelerated in social inflation, I guess, associated lines and the decelerated in property, I think, is how -- what kept the kind of the math flat at 12%. 
 On the social inflationary lines, do you feel that there's still kind of momentum in the marketplace potentially as the year progresses? Or is kind of the jump up into the low to mid-teens, is that a kind of -- is that a very healthy level to kind of protect against what looks like to be an inching higher of social inflationary trends? 
Juan Carlos Andrade: Yes, Mike, this is Juan. So let me give you a little bit of perspective, and I think you can break it down sort of into different lines. 
 If I look at, for example, commercial auto liability, we have seen essentially rate trend up over, frankly, the last 5 quarters or so with a pretty consistent basis. General liability has done the same for about the last 4 quarters, [ umbrella ] and excess for about the last 3 quarters, right? So that gives you a sense that this is -- it's a trend, right? It's not a fluke, per se, just 1 quarter over the other. 
 And look, I think the issues in the industry are well known. It's something that, obviously, we have discussed with all of you, competitors have discussed with all of you. So I would expect that, that continues through the rest of 2024. Again, it's 4 to 5 quarters, depending on the line of business that you continue to see that momentum. 
 When I look at property, there's certainly been a bit more capacity that's come in, particularly into the E&S market, and we saw that in the first quarter. But the pricing is still good and it's still significantly adequate in an excess of loss trend. So we still feel very good about the property business on the primary side of things as well. 
Michael Zaremski: Okay. Got it. An encouraging trend on the liability side, given what we're seeing. I believe my follow-up in the prepared remarks, I think, Jim Williamson said that property Cat grew by 24%, I believe. Is that -- I feel like when we're looking at the disclosure in the earnings release, we see a much lower number for Cat XOL? Am I thinking about something incorrectly? 
James Williamson: Yes, Mike, this is Jim. Yes, the -- an earlier question was about the fact that we had printed a lower Cat growth number. You would have seen about a 4% growth number on Cat XOL. And what I had indicated is that's really the impact of the recognition of written premium flowing through the first quarter financials, which included a renewal last year, the June 23 renewal where we actually chose to step back a bit on Florida because of the stringent -- our own stringent financial underwriting approach. And so now that's kind of flowing into the financials. 
 What I further commented on is that at the January 1 renewal, we grew our property Cat XOL business by 24% for the renewal at really terrific risk-adjusted economics. And then further said, we did also very well at the April renewal, growing about 11% overall, we grew our North America property business at 4/1 by 76%. And so just outstanding growth rates and you'll see that show up in future quarters. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Josh Shanker from Bank of America. 
Joshua Shanker: A lot of property questions. So on the big pro rata growth, can you talk about what that means for your exposures and how that affects your capital utilization? 
James Williamson: Sure, Josh. This is Jim. So a couple of things. One, if you look at our gross PML and then further our net PMLs as they've trajected over the last several renewals, they're up modestly. I would say that's being driven more by taking advantage of the property Cat XOL market. We've been pretty cautious on how much Cat exposure we're taking in the property pro rata book. Obviously, it exists, but we're being thoughtful about that balance.
 I would further say, there's no constraint, given our available capacity, where we are relative to our risk appetite, as you would have seen in the investor presentation, we still have plenty of room to maneuver. And so there's not going to be a point where -- the fact that we've taken advantage of some really exciting opportunities in the property pro rata space, where we then can't go and grow where we want to with key clients on the property Cat XOL, that is definitely not a trade-off we're making. And we would not disadvantage the Cat book for any other opportunity. 
Joshua Shanker: And capital utilization? 
James Williamson: Are you referring in terms of how we put the capital to work? 
Joshua Shanker: Yes. As you've grown that book, does that -- obviously, more efficiently, I guess, it is capital. Does that -- is there a binding constraint on how much of this property pro rata you can write? 
Mark Kociancic: No. Josh, it's Mark. The answer is no. Despite the large level of growth, very manageable full degrees of freedom to underwrite as we see in the market going forward. No issue on that side. 
Joshua Shanker: And then switching gears to casualty reinsurance. Can you talk about what you're seeing in terms of incurred loss activity versus claims as disclosed by your customers on the reinsurance side for the older accident years as they deal with social inflation? Have they taken their picks up enough? Or are you -- do you think that they're playing a game of sort of catch-up based on picks that you've set in the space? 
James Williamson: Yes, Josh, it's Jim again. Look, I'm not going to comment on the approach that other companies are taking to lost pick selection. What I would say is -- and this is true of older accident years and more recent accident years. We take a very prudent approach to ultimate loss ratio selection. We certainly did that over the last few years as we've strengthened reserves in reinsurance casualty. You saw us do that. We took a very conservative approach to how we set those ultimate loss ratios and put ourselves in a position to ensure that, that's in the rearview mirror.
 And then we do the same thing on more recent accident years, which, in some cases, means that we have a different view of the ultimate loss ratio that our clients have. And you would have heard us describe in the last earnings call that we stepped back from some casualty in the -- at the January 1 renewal. We reduced our expiring book by about 15% due to portfolio management actions. And in many cases, that was due to the fact that we had our own independent view of the expected loss pick, and that may have been higher than what our clients expected. 
 So we're absolutely applying our own disciplines and analytics to what others are reporting, whether they're reporting in their financials or reporting it to us in their submissions and we think that puts us in good stead. 
Operator: And now we have a question from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. 
Elyse Greenspan: Sorry to follow up again on the property Cat question, but just going back to the 4% reported growth. And Jim, I know you said that the property Cat XOL book grew 24%, sorry at 1/1. I understand that debt premium earn lags as you write business. I just didn't, I guess, appreciate that there's a lag on a gross or net premiums written basis on business that you would have written in the middle of last year. Can you just, I guess, just kind of explain that just that concept to me, just like the lag on the written that would, I guess, flow through 6 months later? 
James Williamson: Yes. Sure, Elyse. It's Jim. Yes, we've recognized written. We don't recognize written premium on a reinsurance contract the way you might on a primary insurance contract where you recognize all of the written premium in the period that you originally incepted the deal. Instead, the written recognition of premium is spread out. In the case of property Cat, it would typically be over a 4-quarter period, whereas something like casualty pro rata is typically recognized over an 8-quarter period and you don't recognize all the premium in a straight line, particularly for casualty pro rata. 
 And you may recall earlier in the year and last year, we talked a lot about this relative to the recognition of growth from the Jan 1, 2023 renewal relative to casualty. 
 And so there are going to be these effects. But as I indicated earlier, we're seeing -- we've seen strong growth pretty much at every renewal since January of 2023 and actually going back into June of '22, as the market started to correct. The only renewal that we've had in that entire time that showed a reduction was the June 2023 renewal because we stepped back a bit in Florida because a lot of smaller clients weren't able to meet our quite stringent financial underwriting approach. 
 So to give you some statistics, we talked about January '24, July '23 almost 25% growth, April '23, 30% growth. Jan '23, almost 50% growth. And it was only June '23, where we actually reduced the book by about 2.3%. So it just gives you a sense of the fact that we are delivering strong growth at terrific economics at all of these renewals. Got a little bit of a blip in this quarter and we expect that to correct. 
 Now the other thing I would indicate, of course, as you'll see in the financials is earned premium for Cat XOL was up almost 20%, which is much more consistent with what you might expect. 
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. And then on the -- on the capital side, you guys started to buy back a little bit of your stock this quarter. I think you used the word opportunistic around that. So can you just give us a sense of just kind of capital return thoughts from here just balancing growth? And I guess, obviously, as we get closer to win season? 
Mark Kociancic: Elyse, it's Mark. So you're right. We did start some modest share buybacks in the first quarter, really no change from what we've been saying all along. We're privileging the organic growth, no reason we can't do capital management actions like share buybacks. At the same time, we demonstrated that in March and no reason it won't continue going forward, it's an attractive level. 
Operator: And our next question comes from Gregory Peters from Raymond James. 
Charles Peters: So for the first question, I'm going to pivot back to the TSR target that you guys have rolled out. And I'm just curious if there's been an updated view on the risks to hitting your TSA target -- TSR target, excuse me. And in that regard, I was looking at your slide deck, and I noticed your -- you disclosed your 1:100 PMLs. I'm wondering how that might look when we get to [ 7/1/24 ]? 
Mark Kociancic: So it's -- Greg, it's Mark talking. Let me kind of split this into 2 pieces of PMLs and TSR, ways of getting there. So back in the Investor Day, one of the points that I made during the presentation was that we had lots of different avenues to achieving leading financial returns as measured by total shareholder return. 
 So it doesn't matter really from our standpoint, if there's pluses and minuses coming from different underwriting markets, pricing and rate. We have a very well-developed and diversified set of franchises to manage cycle management, portfolio management and really drive growth of the franchise, combined with strong investment income. That's unchanged in terms of achieving the target that we set out.
 PMLs, I'll hand it over to Jim and maybe I'll add a little bit of color at the end. 
James Williamson: Yes. Greg, it's Jim. So referencing your question and the PMLs that you would have seen in the investor presentation. So a couple of things. One, look, the peak zones that are represented there, we certainly have seen a little bit of growth in our net PMLs from July of last year to 1/1 this year. 
 That's a couple of factors. One, we've taken advantage of the market as I've talked about on this call, and we've grown our portfolio at great economics, which is fantastic. We've also optimized our hedging and we're taking more of our Cat risk on a net basis, and that's contributed to the growth in the net PMLs. 
 Now those particular peak zones that are featured in the investor presentation. We'll see a little bit more growth, I would expect in Southeast wind through the June renewal, assuming that Florida pricing terms and conditions hold, which we expect.  California quake is pretty much in the bag for the year, where you will see us continue to lean into the market at the 7/1 renewal is outside of our peak zones. And so we have plenty of capacity, both in our PMLs and our capital and really any other way you want to think about risk to continue to grow. And I think that's best illustrated by the other exhibit on that page, which shows our earnings and capital at risk and our current position. And you see there that we're -- we have plenty of room to maneuver within our stated risk appetite to take advantage of great market conditions and grow where we need to. 
Juan Carlos Andrade: Greg, this is Juan. And I would just essentially reinforce 2 points that Mark and Jim have made. So number one, we absolutely see no change to the 17% target. And you see where we started the year at the 18.1%. 
 But I think the second point is probably more critical one, which is the one Jim just made that we are well within our Cat underwriting appetite. And so that gives us confidence to be able to maneuver and frankly keep growing the property Cat book, given the, frankly, the excellent risk-adjusted returns that we're seeing in that book right now. 
Charles Peters: I guess, my follow-up question, just more specific. Can you talk a little bit about how the facultative market is evolving because sort of hearing mixed messages out of the market and value your perspective on that. 
James Williamson: Sure, Greg. It's Jim again. Yes. So in terms of facultative, we had a terrific quarter in our facultative business. We were able to grow that business very nicely, about 14% over prior year. And that's really on the back of significant demand by our cedents. And in particular, in short tail lines where they had to increase their Cat XOL attachment points last year to manage the market cycle. That means that, in some cases, they're feeling exposed on larger risks. Their per-risk limits might be uncomfortable. And so they're coming to Everest to try to manage that exposure. And so we're getting really great results that we're excited about and I expect we'll continue to lean into. 
 That said, like all parts of this business, we need to be very thoughtful in our risk management approach. And so there are parts of the portfolio, none of this would surprise you, where we're being very cautious and very prudent. And certainly, commercial auto would be an area where we're being prudent. We've pretty much exited or significantly reduced any exposure to professional or financial lines. We're being very careful about limit deployment in excess casualty. So we are writing some terrific deals there, but we're being careful about limits, obviously, ensuring we're getting paid adequately.
 So like any business, whether it's reinsurance or primary insurance, need to manage the cycle carefully, but we continue to see really strong opportunities in fact. 
Operator: And our next question is coming from Bob Jian Huang from Morgan Stanley. 
Jian Huang: So first question is on reserving. So looking at the last year's reserve charge, a large portion of that came from the accident year 2016 to 2019 cohort. I understand that you will probably do more reserve studies later on in the year. But just curious if there are any new developments or update at this particular point regarding the current reserving positions and as well as that 2016 to 2019 cohort as well? 
Mark Kociancic: Bob, it's Mark. So we did do our Q1 quarterly review process. It's quite comprehensive. You're right, no real reserve studies to go through in the first quarter, but plenty of anecdotal data that we're looking at, all kinds of information.
 And so after we did a review of not only those years, but really across the board, we don't see anything that's altered our view of our reserve portfolio. So steady as she goes. 
Jian Huang: Got it. That's very helpful. Second one is more of a modeling question. So I understand that your expense ratio for the Insurance segment was elevated a little bit due to international build-out. How should we think about maybe a near-term run rate on this? Is this something that will persist for next few quarters, next few years? Is there a good way to think about the expense element on the Insurance segment? 
Mark Kociancic: Bob, it's Mark again. So I think it will be elevated for several quarters. So we're adding talent, technology. The premium, as you can see, is growing meaningfully. The earned is trailing and obviously earns in over time. And so we're still in a process of scaling. And you can see, just in the Q1 comparatives, we're coming in for the insurance division of 16.6% expense ratio versus something closer to 15% a year ago. 
 So our North American operations are fairly stable in the expense ratio. The international is what's got this trailing effect. The good thing on our side is the -- I think the growth is quite accretive. We're seeing very nice technical ratios from the business that we're writing there, diversifies well, good margins that are embedded. So -- and we like the pace that we're going at. So I can see that being elevated for several quarters, but eventually trending down as the scale starts to catch up with the size of the foundation we're building. 
Juan Carlos Andrade: Bob, this is Juan. Let me add a couple of comments as well to what Mark just said. I think one important thing to keep in mind is really the hallmark expense discipline of Everest. And if you look at the group expense ratio really at that low 6% range, 6.1%,  6.2%, we've been able to maintain that throughout the entire build-out of that international component because of our expense discipline and our ability to prioritize things that matter and say no to things that don't. So I think that is something you can expect for the company going forward is that we continue to have one of the most competitive expense ratios in the industry, and that, frankly, is not going to change as we invest and build and grow the international component. 
Operator: And next in question is Yaron Kinar from Jefferies. 
Unknown Analyst: This is Andrew on for Yaron. Within Insurance, it sounds like there could be some benefit on the underlying loss ratio for the remainder of the year. But does the guide of 90% to 92% for reported combined for full year '24 still stand, considering the reported 93% this quarter? 
Mark Kociancic: Yes, Andrew, it's Mark. The short answer is yes. I think there are several factors that are going towards that. You heard me in the previous question speak to some of the scaling benefits that we expect to get, particularly from the insurance franchise. So there are several factors, tailwinds that we have that I think will help us achieve that range.
 I would start with -- we've got a mix that's going to trend a little bit more short-tail in terms of its proportion to the overall book that will come with lower combined ratios. You're still seeing very strong margin that's being added to the portfolio across the board as we cycle manage through the different opportunities that we have.
 The expense ratio, really the 2 points. So the earned is going to grow more quickly on the international side as it trails the gross written. So that's going to help mechanically when you do the math. And then the expenses as a whole, I think given the fact we've spent over a year, well over a year building the foundation, those benefits are going to start to pay off and expenses will start to level out as an overall ratio.
 So those factors overall are what's going to drive us back into that 92%, 90% range. 
Unknown Analyst: And maybe on Reinsurance, some strong growth within casualty pro rata and casualty XOL. Could you talk about some of the opportunities there this quarter? 
Juan Carlos Andrade: Yes. So let me start, and then I'll turn it over to Jim. This is Juan, Andrew. 
 So I think 2 things drove particularly that casualty pro rata. Again, some of it is the timing of the business that was written at 1/1/23 last year. And I think Jim has talked a little bit about how the earnings pattern on that business works. So I think that's an important part of that. And we felt good about the pricing for that business as well. 
 The second part of it is we saw some attractive opportunities in both Canada and Europe, outside of the United States where you don't have the social inflation issues that you have in the U.S. But Jim, maybe you can provide a little bit of additional color? 
James Williamson: Yes, I think that's right. It is on the pro rata side, it is largely timing of recognition. As we had indicated after the January 1, 2023 renewal, we earn casualty pro rata or I should say, recognized written premium over 8 quarters. And it's really in the middle of that period that you see the largest recognition of premium. And so we're in that period. We had really strong printed numbers last quarter on Cat's pro rata, same this quarter, et cetera. And there have been incremental opportunities, as Juan indicated. And in particular, when those are taking place outside the U.S. and in a very balanced way, we're more than happy to lean in to those opportunities. 
 On the XOL side, not an entirely different story. I mean, we have chosen to grow in a targeted way with some of our top cedents. But the other thing that you'll see in that line, in particular, which is a relatively small part of our portfolio is that the amount of rate that will be flowing through in that line is going to be elevated. That's our expectation, and that certainly helps to support the growth numbers that you're seeing in the quarter. 
Operator: And next, we have a question from Meyer Shields from KBW. 
Unknown Analyst: It's Jean on for Meyer. I have a question on the professional line growth, kind of accelerated from 9.9% in 4Q. So instead of 11.7%, you mentioned rate acceleration. Are you guys expecting more if rates continue? Can you give more color on that, please? 
James Williamson: Yes, it's Jim Williamson. Thanks for the question. Actually, for the most part, the acceleration you would have seen some of the growth in professional lines for the quarter in our Insurance business was really related to one large fronting arrangement in our Canadian operation. So it's not really a general trend that you can apply to the rest of our business. 
Juan Carlos Andrade: Yes. The only other comment I would make and this is Juan, is [ freight ] also had some implications into that as well. But the growth that you're seeing is really what Jim has described, is that fronting deal in Canada. 
Unknown Analyst: Got you. So we don't expect that to continue for the rest of the year? 
Juan Carlos Andrade: No, I don't think we would expect that to continue for the rest of the year. Again, that was due to just one specific deal in Canada. 
Unknown Analyst: Okay. Got it. Just one more question, just a board question on Reinsurance. Just curious, can you share any plans for buying reinsurance for the Insurance segment? 
James Williamson: Yes. Sure. It's Jim Williamson again. Yes, we've been a pretty consistent buyer of reinsurance for our Insurance business. There are a lot of good reasons to procure reinsurance, obviously, it helps us to manage volatility within that line. In a number of cases, particularly our pro rata treaties in North America are quite accretive from a ceding commission perspective. So I think that strategy of using reinsurance strategically to manage our exposure and our economics will continue. 
 I would expect, as the business matures both in North America and then, of course, over time in our international business, you could expect our net to gross ratio to increase as we retain more of our business. But I think those changes will be modest and will occur gradually over time. So I wouldn't expect any near-term changes in our approach that way. 
Operator: And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Juan Andrade for some closing remarks. Please go ahead. 
Juan Carlos Andrade: Great. Thank you for all the questions and the excellent discussion. And I'll end really where I started, which is we're off to a very good start in 2024, with an 88% combined ratio for the quarter and a 20% ROE. And from the prepared remarks and the commentary that we found over the past hour, you see that we are still in a market with strong trading conditions, generating that 17% growth that you saw overall for the first quarter. And then you certainly heard about the opportunities we see in both Reinsurance and Insurance for the remaining part of the year. 
 And lastly, we're very focused on delivering our 3-year plan. And I think you've heard from Mark and from us pretty clearly that we still see that ability to generate excess of 17% TSR on an ongoing basis. 
 So with that, thank you very much, and we'll talk in the next quarter. 
Operator: And the conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.

===== 2023 Q4  (2024-02-08 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Everest Group Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, today's event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Matt Rohrmann, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Matt Rohrmann: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Everest Group Ltd. fourth quarter of 2023 earnings conference call. The Everest executives leading today's call are Juan Andrade, President and CEO; and Mark Kociancic, Executive Vice President and CFO. We are also joined by members of the Everest management team. Before we begin, I'll preface the comments on today's call by noting that Everest SEC filings, including extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. Management comments regarding estimates, projections and similar are subject to the risks, uncertainties and assumptions as noted in these filings. Management may also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These items are reconciled in our earnings release and financial supplement. With that, I'll turn the call over to Juan.
Juan Andrade: Thank you, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. 2023 was the most profitable year in our history. We delivered exceptional full year results. We achieved record underwriting income, record net investment income, record operating income, record net income and record operating cash flow. We executed on our objectives and delivered a 2023 operating ROE of over 23% and a total shareholder return of over 26%. The strength and quality of our franchise was evident as we achieved these results in another elevated catastrophe year, while also taking prudent actions to further strengthen our balance sheet, Everest capitalized on the hard market to grow in attractive lines across our businesses. Our precise execution at the 2024 January reinsurance renewal created excellent outcomes. We completed the deployment of our $1.5 billion equity capital raise on schedule and at superb risk adjusted returns. We expanded key client relationships, while improving the scale, quality and profit potential of our portfolio, giving us a strong start to the year. Market conditions remain strong. We are not seeing any meaningful new capacity enter the market and we expect conditions for upcoming renewals to remain excellent. Our capital strength positions us to profitably grow both underwriting businesses. At Everest Investor Day last November, we outlined our progress, strategy and financial objectives for the next three years. As you have seen from our 2023 results, we are on-track to achieve these goals. Our primary objective is to generate industry leading financial returns consistently and across market cycles and we have delivered. We are building on momentum created by our actions to transform Everest over the past four years. Operating as one Everest, we elevated all aspects of our business. Everest is a more diversified and higher margin business with a strong underwriting culture of execution and accountability. This guides our underwriting decisions and our drive to outperform and allows us to deliver on our long-term objectives. Turning to the full year financial highlights beginning with the Group. The Group delivered outstanding results in 2023. As I said, we achieved new company profitability records including annual operating income and net income which both exceeded $2.5 billion for the year. We grew by 21% in constant dollars, ending the year at nearly $17 billion in gross written premium. Our performance was supported by the execution of our strategies and our ability to take advantage of strong market conditions and reinsurance and insurance. We generated $1.2 billion in underwriting profit also a company record and we improved the combined ratio more than five points to 90.9% despite industry catastrophe losses exceeding $120 billion. We achieved a six point year-over-year improvement in the Group loss ratio contributing to our excellent underwriting results. Building the strength and flexibility of Everest balance sheet has been a priority for this management team since we took over this company. This was reflected in the quarter through our modest favorable development as we built additional strength into our already strong reserve position. Mark will provide more detail on these actions. Turning to investments, we achieved another record with annual net investment income of $1.4 billion driven by our actions to capitalize on the rising interest rate environment. Now for the underwriting segments beginning with reinsurance. The reinsurance division had an exceptional year. Our disciplined planning and execution in 2023 allowed us to capitalize on the generational hard property market, delivering outstanding top line growth and bottom line results. For the full year 2023, growth was 26% in constant dollars and excluding reinstatement premiums with $11.5 billion in total gross written premiums. Growth was broad based as we expanded with core seeds, grew in targeted markets and allocated capital to higher return opportunities. We grew our core North America property catastrophe portfolio by over 30% had exceptional risk adjusted returns. Internationally, we grew our total property portfolio by over 40% with strong and targeted growth in Europe and Asia. We also leaned into growth opportunities outside of property catastrophe including in targeted proportional property deals, aviation, marine, and in facultative with strong of returns in these lines. The division delivered $1.3 billion in underwriting profit for the year. The attritional loss ratio improved by 4 point to 57.7%, and the attritional combined ratio was down 110 basis points from 2022 when adjusted for prior year commissions related to the reserve releases. We leveraged deep client and broker relationships and our strong balance sheet to build a more profitable and higher margin book, which culminated in outstanding results at the January 2024 renewal. At 1/1/’24, we grew our total property catastrophe portfolio by over 25% compared to expiring premium. Following the significant increases in 2023, we saw further property catastrophe rate increases at 1/1 broadly across geographies. In North America, the Property Cat XOL risk adjusted rate change was approximately 7%. Internationally, rates on our portfolio were up 14%. This trend also continued in specialty lines particularly marine and aviation. The flight to quality in the reinsurance market continued. Our leading market position allowed Everest to grow market share on oversubscribed deals with leading clients on the best quality Property Cat, cyber and specialty line treaties and in geographies around the world. Our clients signed down other carriers to make more room for Everest. We also played a leading role in several of the increased CAT limit purchases being made by some of the best primary insurance underwriters in the business. This reflects the strength of our franchise and reputation in the market. To illustrate the point, we generated close to $300 million in additional premium growth through increased shares on existing property treaties. The favorable terms and conditions that we achieved during the 2023 renewals held while attachment points which increased significantly last year or maintained. We were also surgical in our approach towards certain casualty lines at 1/1. We non-renewed 16% of our casualty and professional liability pro rata business particularly when ceding commissions did not meet our thresholds. These targeted actions however were partially offset by expanding shares on attractive casualty programs with select top clients. We achieved our objectives at 1/1 executing with the same discipline and focus Everest has consistently applied to shaping and diversifying the portfolio. We do not right the market. We selectively underwrite risks that meet our requirements. Our priority is growing the bottom-line to deliver leading financial returns. Coming out of the 1/1 renewal, the quality of our book is excellent. We are positioned to drive sustainable margin expansion, while continuing to distinguish ourselves as the preferred lead market platform. Now turning to our primary insurance division. 2023 was a pivotal year for Everest Insurance. We advanced our key objectives while establishing strong foundations. We solidified and enhanced the division's global leadership team with top talent in the right places operating through a regionalized structure aligned to customer needs. In 2023, we grew the insurance business by 10% in constant dollars, achieving record annual premium of over $5 billion. Growth was balanced and diversified by product, business line and geography. We saw excellent opportunities in property and specialty lines including marine, aviation, trade credit and political risk. We are disciplined. The modest growth in certain casualty lines was primarily driven by robust rate increases as we remain prudent in our writings and focus on lines of business meeting our return thresholds. We continued to shift to shorter tail lines with favorable pricing and a strong profit trajectory. For both the year and the fourth quarter, we achieved a broad-based 12% rate increase in our core portfolio, excluding workers compensation and financial lines. Beyond property, pricing accelerated and was particularly strong in marine and other specialty lines, commercial auto, general liability and access liability. Overall, rate remains ahead of loss strength. We will only grow where we can do it profitably. We will remain disciplined in less attractive lines including D&O, workers' compensation and commercial auto. The combined ratio increase was driven by our reserve strengthening to address the impacts of social inflation along tail lines in the 2016 to 2019 period. The core underlying performance of the book is strong. We advanced our disciplined international strategy led by a proven entrepreneurial team of industry leaders and local underwriting talent. They accomplished a great deal in 2023, scaling our insurance platform across Latin America, the UK and Ireland, Continental Europe in Asia Pacific where our value proposition is differentiated and eagerly welcome. We made strides implementing systems and capabilities enabling us to operate from common platforms and drive efficiencies. We are on-track for new openings this year in Colombia, in Mexico and Australia. While we have tremendous headroom in lucrative markets, we are focused only on the most accretive opportunities. Since this management team took over in 2020, we have significantly increased prudence around risk selection and deployed a disciplined underwriting strategy. We rebuilt the underwriting engine from top to bottom, investing in top tier underwriting and experienced talent. We significantly strengthened our underwriting guidelines and risk selection parameters. Additionally, we pushed rate in excess of trend, broadly raised our inflation assumptions and initial loss picks. We added more loss sensitive features, raised deductibles, and lowered limits. We exited certain social inflation prone industry classes and invested in additional claims technology. As I said, if business doesn't meet our underwriting criteria, we just won't write it. As we head into 2024, the insurance division is executing from a strong foundation and is well positioned to deliver on the targets we set out for the business at Investor Day. Our financial results led to the most profitable year in Everest's history. We are building on this momentum with standing start to 2024. As favorable market conditions persist, we are leaning into robust tailwinds across our reinsurance and insurance businesses with the full power of Everest behind us, and we will make the most of the opportunities in front of us. We have the right team driving a clear strategy with multiple avenues to deliver on our primary goal of generating consistent leading financial returns. We are confident about delivering on our objectives. With that, I'll turn it over to Mark to review the financials in more detail.
Mark Kociancic: Thank you, Juan, and good morning, everyone. Everest had a strong finish to 2023. For the full year, Everest delivered record annual results in underwriting income, net investment income, operating income and net income. This drove annual operating earnings per share of $66.39 and an operating return on equity of 23.1%, the annualized TSR or total shareholder return was excellent at 26.5%. 2024 is off to a great start as we successfully executed on our 1/1 renewals, where we enjoyed strong growth and deployed the remaining capital from our $1.5 billion equity raise last spring. We capitalized on our market position and prevailing conditions, growing in attractive lines of business with expected returns in excess to cover our financial targets. This was evidenced in particular by strong growth in our Property Cat book globally. Market fundamentals remain strong and we expect the upcoming renewals throughout 2024 to continue to be excellent. Our underwriting franchises are fully mobilized and our capital strength gives us lots of capacity for 2024. This positions us well for profitable organic growth. Turning to the fourth quarter results, operating income was $1.1 billion or $25.18 per diluted share, equating to an operating ROE of 32.4%. Looking at the Group results, Everest reported gross written premiums of $4.3 billion representing 18.3% growth in constant dollars and excluding reinstatement premiums. The combined ratio was 93.2% for the quarter, driven by improving underlying loss ratios offset by the results of an active CAT quarter and the CAT losses in the quarter were largely driven by Hurricane Otis, which made landfall in Acapulco, Mexico as a Category 5 Hurricane. I would note that the prior year quarter had much lower than average CAT activity. Everest also recorded modest net favorable reserve development of $5 million in the quarter, which we'll discuss in more detail in just a few minutes. The Group attritional loss ratio was 59%, 60 basis point improvement over the prior year's quarter with both segments contributing to the improvement. The Group's commission ratio was 21.3%, when excluding the impact of 2.5 points from the profit commissions associated with favorable reserve development in the reinsurance segment related to the mortgage business, an improvement year-over-year. The Group expense ratio was 6.3% in the quarter, an excellent result as we continue to invest in talent and systems within both franchises. Moving to the segment results and starting with reinsurance. Reinsurance gross written premiums grew 21.9% in constant dollars when adjusting for reinstatement premiums during the quarter. The strong growth was primarily driven by double-digit increases in Property Pro rata, Property non-Cat XOL and Property Cat XOL, and was broad based globally. The combined ratio was 78.8%, an improvement of 8 points from the prior year. The attritional loss ratio improved 40 basis points to 57.8% as we continue to achieve more favorable rate and terms, particularly in property. The attritional combined ratio improved 90 basis points to 85.1% when excluding the impact of $94 million in profit commissions associated with favorable mortgage reserve development this quarter. The normalized commission ratio was 24.8% when you exclude the 3.6% attributed to those profit commissions. The underwriting related expense ratio was 2.5%, an improvement of 30 basis points from the prior year. Moving to insurance, gross premiums written grew 11.6% in constant dollars to $1.4 billion. We continue to methodically scale our primary franchise globally, while proactively focusing our North American portfolio towards the most accretive lines of business, led by retail property and short tail specialty lines. The growth in casualty and professional lines was largely driven by rate increases. A number of casualty lines saw pricing accelerate in the fourth quarter. We remain disciplined in our approach as some lines are less attractive than others, including D&O, workers' comp and commercial auto as we've discussed on prior calls. The attritional loss ratio improved this quarter to 62.6%, driven primarily by business mix, given the higher proportion of short tail lines within the portfolio. The commission ratio improved 110 basis points, also largely driven by business mix as increased property writings earned through as well as increased volume of ceding commissions. The underwriting related expense ratio was 16.6% with the increase largely driven by the continued investment in our global platform. Now, let me touch on the reserve moves in the quarter. As we stated at our Investor Day, our objective is to book the company's overall reserve position at management's best estimate plus a margin. And as of year-end, we've accomplished that as our reserve position remains strong. This quarter, we recognized $5 million of net favorable reserve development following the completion of our detailed ground up review of all of our reserve portfolios for 2023. We released $397 million net of our embedded reserve margin from the reinsurance division, primarily from well-seasoned short tail lines like property and also our mortgage lines. The releases were split roughly evenly between the two lines. And this was partially offset by $392 million of strengthening in the insurance segment driven by a few specific casualty lines of business. The entire industry faces the real impact of social inflation focused on the 2016 to 2019 accident years. And Everest is seeing some of these same trends and we've prudently acted on them given the now well-developed loss patterns for those years and this is driven primarily by higher severity in general liability and to a lesser extent commercial auto liability. And this is contrasted with accident years 2015 and prior, which continue to show strength and stability and more recent accident years, namely 2020 and onward, where we see the benefit of significant rate increases, limit reductions and targeted portfolio management actions as Juan highlighted. We will be prudent and let long tail reserves from those more recent accident years from 2020 onwards continue to season more fully. As a result of these comprehensive actions, the portfolio today is a higher quality, more diversified book of business well-positioned to provide strong risk adjusted returns. In terms of the reinsurance division, we made marginal adjustments to long tail lines that were impacted by social inflation from 2016 to 2019 accident years and these adjustments were easily offset by favorable developments in other lines. Since this management team took over in 2020, we have made significant improvements to our reserving, underwriting and claims functions. And this allows us to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our feedback loop between underwriting, management, claims, pricing, and reserving. This allows us to manage information faster improving overall portfolio performance. We have been embedding conservatism into social inflation prone lines in both divisions to make sure we can manage these types of industry hurdles. In conjunction, the actions taken to build the company's balance sheet strength, Everest has significant financial flexibility, underwriting diversification, and the ability to better manage volatility. We were able to generate an operating ROE of over 23%, while taking actions to fortify the reserves on our balance sheet. As you can see from our full year 2023 results, we can manage issues as they arise and still produce excellent returns overall. Given our disciplined approach to acting on bad news early and good news late, we feel our reserve position is prudent and there is meaningful embedded margin that we will let season, we believe the balance sheet moves we made this quarter have closed the book on the 2016 to 2019 reserves and put us in very good shape to generate leading returns in the years ahead. Moving on, net investment income increased over $200 million year-over-year to $411 million for the quarter, driven primarily by higher assets under management, higher new money yields, and our investment in floating rate securities as they benefit from higher reset rates. Alternative assets generated $41 million of net investment income, an improvement from the prior year as equity markets have continued to rebound. Overall, our book yield improved from 3.5% to 4.7% year-over-year and our reinvestment rate remains at approximately 5%. We continue to take deliberate actions to best position our investment portfolio and capitalize on market conditions. We made a number of portfolio moves over the past quarter to take advantage of the evolving interest rate environment. We successfully executed our strategy to sell lower yielding bonds totaling $3.3 billion of market value in Q4, which resulted in after tax realized fixed income losses of approximately $210 million in the quarter, while reinvesting the proceeds into higher coupon bonds with higher credit quality and this contributed approximately 30 basis points to the book yield increase in the quarter and is expected to add significant additional interest income in 2024 and beyond. We generally purchased 10-year maturities thereby extending our duration modestly to 3.3 years, which is broadly consistent with our liability duration of 3.9 years. For the fourth quarter of 2023, our operating income tax rate before the Bermuda taxing impact was 14.5%, which was higher than our working assumption of 11% to 12% for the year, given the geographic distribution of income. However, the full year operating effective tax rate excluding the Bermuda tax impact was 10.5%, well within our expected range. Everest also booked a $578 million net deferred tax benefit in the quarter as a result of Bermuda's income tax guidelines and this will begin to be utilized in 2025 when the Bermuda income tax is in effect. Shareholders' equity ended the quarter at $13.2 billion or $13.9 billion when excluding net unrealized depreciation unavailable for sale fixed income securities. At the end of the quarter, net after tax unrealized losses on the available for sale fixed income portfolio equates to approximately $723 million a decrease of $1.1 billion as compared to the end of the third quarter resulting from interest rate decreases. Cash flow from operations was $1 billion during the quarter and $4.6 billion for the full year. Book value per share ended the quarter at $304.29 an improvement of 44.3% from year-end 2022 when adjusted for dividends of $6.80 per share year-to-date. Book value per share excluding net unrealized depreciation on available for sale fixed income securities stood at $320.95 versus $259.18 per share at year-end 2022, representing an increase of approximately 23.8%. This is an outstanding result and shows the value creation from 2023. Net debt leverage at quarter end stood at 16.3%, modestly lower on a sequential and year-over-year basis. As mentioned earlier, our capital raise back in May coupled with the organic capital generation of our portfolio throughout the year put us in a position of strength to be able to capitalize on a number of market opportunities. Another tangible example of this was our ability to reduce our CAT bond reliance at year end 2023 as we seek to retain more of the gross and net economics in lines of business with exceptional risk-adjusted return potential. So while our PMLs have gone up in the tail with the Cat bonds rolling off, we remain well within the risk tolerances of our predefined risk appetite as well as having ample room for additional organic growth. In addition, Everest had an excellent fourth quarter and year in 2023. We began 2024 with a strong set of renewals, plenty of dry powder for future renewals and attractive organic growth opportunities in both of our underwriting franchises. Our teams are fully mobilized to serve their markets. We have substantial flexibility and strong momentum across both businesses, leaving us very confident in our ability to deliver on the total shareholder return and combined ratio targets, we introduced at our most recent Investor Day. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Matt.
Matt Rohrmann: Thanks, Mark. Operator, we are now ready to open the line for questions. [Operator Instructions]
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Yaron Kinar with Jefferies.
Yaron Kinar: I guess, I wanted to start with the reserve strengthening in insurance, and I appreciate the color that you offered in the prepared comments. But that said, it seems like there may be a little bit of a break with the messaging we heard in prior quarters, namely that the company was already -- had already started reserves considerably back in 2021, has cut loss picks conservatively high since then. So what's changed from that perspective now? And how can investors gain comfort or confidence that we're not going to see some similar pattern emerge in the reinsurance reserves?
Mark Kociancic: Yaron, it's Mark here. So let me address that. I think, look, 2016 and '19 clearly is impacted by social inflation and there was a very marked rise in actual losses during the 2023 calendar year. And those years are exposed to social inflation and casualty, in particular, really showed signs of development for 2016 to '19. So we're seeing reported loss patterns that are very seasoned, very mature and the trends are undeniable. So for us, the issue really lies primarily in general liability. And from that standpoint, we believe we've captured it simply because these reporting patterns are fairly well developed, but the losses are on an actual basis now to a larger degree. And so there's less estimate involved more precision in how we're able to size that class or period of business. And so we feel pretty good about the fact that we're able to put this to.
Juan Andrade: Yaron, in addition to that, this is the Juan Andrade. Look, I would say there is no change in the messaging from our perspective. We have been very consistent in the fact that we have a strong overall reserve position. We are confident in the most current years. You're right. We have raised inflation assumptions. We've raised our initial loss picks. We have pushed rate in excess of trend as well as a number of other things that I talked about in my remarks this morning. So we feel very confident about that. And I think as Mark said in his prepared remarks, we believe this closes the book on the 2016 to 2019 years.
Yaron Kinar: And then maybe pivoting a bit to the current accident year and your current calendar year. In reinsurance, the underlying loss ratio, it did improve year-over-year, but the improvement actually subsided relative to what we saw earlier in the year, the first nine months. And intuitively, I would have thought that we'd see that improvement accelerate just as the changing terms and conditions and better rates that you implemented starting in 1/1/’23 would be earning in. So can you maybe address? Were there any offsets there? Anything I'm not thinking about correctly?
Jim Williamson : Sure. Yaron, it's Jim Williamson. Thanks for the -- thanks for the question. So just to step back a little bit, our approach to establishing our quarterly loss ratios has been very consistent over the last few years. We set conservative loss picks as we enter the year. And then we don't tend to change them unless we see some bad news emerge. And so we do that at a very granular level. And so quarter-to-quarter, the only real effect you're going to see are mix related. And so what we have seen is, particularly on an earned premium basis, casualty is still greater than 50%.
Operator: Pardon me. It appears, we have lost the connection with our speakers. Pardon me, everyone. We do have our speakers back, and we will move on to our next question, which comes from Josh Shanker with Bank of America.
Jim Williamson: Hold on, please. I'm sorry. Just one moment, let me -- this is Jim Williamson. Let me finish answering Yaron's question. Sorry for the interruption of their folks. So as I was saying, we did not take credit for the 1/1/’23 property rate increases in our 2023 property attritional loss ratio. And we do that out of prudence. We keep that pretty consistent year-to-year. And then the last factor, the only thing that affected our fourth quarter reinsurance attrition loss ratio was we did recognize the effect of 2 large property risk losses in the fourth quarter. And again, out of prudence, we bumped up our loss pick for those losses. That's about -- that's worth about 60 basis points on the total reinsurance loss ratio. So that also masks some of the underlying improvement that you'd be seeing from us, Yaron.
Operator: And our next question comes from Josh Shanker with Bank of America.
Josh Shanker: More questions about the insurance reserve charge, of course, $392 million of net adverse development principally related to '16 to '19 in general liability. But of course, those are inflationary CAGRs that are being set correctly, which span into 2020 to 2023. What was the gross amount of the inner impact on the loss reserves, I assume offset by development for frequency-related issues on the short-tail lines from the '20 to '23 period. I guess what I'm getting at is how much will reserve strengthen for inflationary issues on those later years?
Mark Kociancic: Well, virtually, all of the strengthening took place in 2016 to '19, and that was really related to the inflationary pressure favorable development. We had some on the insurance side with respect to workers' comp, property and surety. But by and large, we're dealing with more of an isolated issue from '16 to '19. When we look at 2020 to onwards to 2023, we feel good about the loss picks that we've set and then the process that we followed there. So we've got a few points there. So start with underlying rate that's been achieved on an annual basis. And even before social inflation became even more elevated, we were increasing loss picks in 2020. And then there's the portfolio actions really identifying the root cause of some of the general liability development that we've had, and that's been acted upon. So the loss picks from 2020 to 2023 have reflected a proper amount for the social inflation risk, and we feel comfortable with those figures. And then going back to 2016 to '19, given the seasoning and the really well-developed patterns, payment patterns that we've seen, the fact that they're so mature approaching the 70%, 80%, 90% range depending on the year, you're looking at, that's what's giving us the confidence in that segment, and that's also why we're confident for the 2020 to 2023 period.
Juan Andrade: Josh, this is Juan. I would also add maybe just a couple of things. Gross is very similar to net and there are no big moves under the covers per se. I think, as Mark basically just said. The other thing that's important to note in context always matters. When we're talking about general liability, for 2016 to 2019 and the actions that we took, they're really isolated to two things. One is a program that's now been put into runoff. The second one is related to a block of business that we have aggressively reunderwritten as well in the past couple of years. This is not endemic to the rest of the GL book in insurance. That also gives us confidence on the go-forward numbers. And hence, what you hear Mark saying that we have closed the door on the 2016 to 2019 years with this action.
Josh Shanker: So look, I'm just someone who throws peanut shells from the cheap seats, and I apologize. To understand what you're saying is that the inflationary CAGR was underestimated in the '16 to '19 period, but even on those accident years, it was corrected in the 20 to 23 years such that you didn't have to make -- I mean I would assume that if you felt that the inflationary was 5% from the 6% all years need to be just up for that 6% CAGR. Is that a too simplistic way you're thinking about it?
Mark Kociancic: No, you can look at it that way for sure.
Josh Shanker: And then the question would be if the 2018 accident year inflationary CAGR was underestimated in '18, '19, '20, '21, '22 and '23, why don't I need to be concerned that the 2020 year was underestimated in 2021, '22 to '23?
Mark Kociancic: Well, first of all, I go back to my other remarks that I was making. So you've got payment patterns for 2016 to 2019, well developed. And so we're showing ultimate loss ratios in the '16 to '19 period, which are markedly elevated from the initial loss picks. So that's one part. When we switch over to 2020, 2023 time frame, out of an abundance of prudence, we started with elevated loss ratios to begin with. So over and above what we would have expected. Then you're getting the rate in addition to that, and you've got the portfolio management, which is eliminating some of the root cause of the '16 to '19 development. So it's not just applying a raw number, a social inflation factor. There are other things that go to mitigate the development that could happen from 2020 to 2023 and probably more importantly, how do we get comfortable with those years. So GL for us from 2020 to 2023 still looks very good, good to us. There's -- we don't have an issue there. From 2016 to 2019, it was the lion's share of the problem that we're solving with this reserve charge today in insurance.
Juan Andrade: Yes. And again, Josh, this is Juan. Just to add a little bit more color on that. Look, the bottom line is the factors you're talking about have already been addressed. And again, I would reiterate some of the things that Mark said, I think it's very important. They've been addressed, number one, by much higher loss picks that we started to put in place really at the end of 2019 for 2020. That's number one. The fact that we raised our inflation assumptions essentially in our loss trend select, so we price to it. Number three, the fact that additional pricing in excess of trend was coming in through that period of time, and on the underwriting side, the fact that we did a lot of different things, for example, increasing our loss sensitive mix, lowering limits, racing deductibles, all of that basically helped to give us the confidence that we're talking about today in addition to exiting social inflation prone industry classes.
Josh Shanker: Okay. I know it's a complicated issue. I'll take anything else have offline. Appreciate it.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Elyse Greenspan at Wells Fargo.
Elyse Greenspan: Following up on the reserves as well. I was hoping can you give us a sense on where you're working your reserves overall and in each of the segments, insurance and reinsurance relative to the actuarial midpoint and where was it before?
Mark Kociancic: So we're clearly looking to best estimate plus a margin overall. So we do feel confident with that. I can tell you two pieces to the margin point. So one is what's embedded in the balance sheet. And I think we've still got a good chunk of seasoned or embedded margin in the reserves. And then we have the more green years, particularly in long-tail casualty, which we feel strong about as well. But that's going to take some time to play out. So I would say there's an embedded margin in that's diversified in the current set of reserves. The second part is really the flow or the engine that's producing it. And this is what we're trying to emphasize with a lot of the remarks we made in the model lives. The steps that we've taken to ensure that we are producing margin accretive business, and we're just taking our time to let it season and we're not touching it right now. So when you think about the reserves that we've released, for example, you're seeing mortgage, for example. There was -- most of that release was from 2013 to 2019. So well-seasoned, very prudently reserved. We're letting that out. Similarly, on the property side, you've got 2020 to 2022 as the lion's share of those releases. Again, short-tail, well-seasoned, well defined, we're letting that out. And so we have this engine that is producing and embedding margins. And for longer tail lines, it takes more time to let it season for shorter tail, it can become available sooner. And so to get back to your point, best estimate plus a margin, feeling good about our positioning and the flow of margin in the future.
Juan Andrade: Elyse, this is Juan. And just to add to what Mark is saying. To think about what we have been saying and said in this call today about the quality of the underwriting really over the last four years, the pricing environment that we've been in ahead of loss trend the portfolio management actions that we have done and how we have crafted both books to be higher quality. What that basically means is that there's more in the tank and there are lots of good news in the future that we just haven't touched for the reasons that Mark just articulated. They're just not well seasoned yet.
Elyse Greenspan: And then my follow-up question, you guys said that you made an adjustment in reinsurance, but I think, Mark, you said that it was marginal for some of those years, 2016 to 2019. Can you give us a sense of what the reinsurance charge was for those years? And I guess, why you didn't think you had to embed some extra conservatism and move that a little bit further?
Mark Kociancic: Yes. It was marginal. You're looking at a very small percentage of the total reserves, low single-digit for those exposed years. I think there's a couple of things that you can look at, and I would start with the reserve charge we took in 2020 that was fairly meaningful at $400 million, and most of that was going into the casualty years from 2016 to '19. So I think we took a good chunk of that apple. Over the last few years, both sides, Insurance and Reinsurance, there has been some minor adjustments for those years throughout the time. So we have been nibbling away at the data that we've been seeing. 2023, I think, was more pronounced in terms of industry loss data for those years. But we were in a -- we were just in a much stronger position from a reinsurance point of view, on those years. I don't see any problem going forward on either side for '16 to '19 in either segment.
Elyse Greenspan: When you say low single-digits, do you mean low single-digits millions or low single-digits as a percent of.
Mark Kociancic: Percentage, percentage, yes.
Operator: And our next question today comes from David Motemaden with Evercore ISI.
David Motemaden: Just following up on the reserves. So Mark and Juan, you guys spoke about specific programs that are driving the insurance charge mainly on GL, but I guess I would have thought that the trends impacting those lines are the same trends that are impacting the rest of your book. So I'm just wondering, as you guys take a look at it, how do you make the conclusion that it's isolated to these books in these accident years and not other programs across GL, but other lines in general?
Mark Kociancic: I think the data for us is quite definitive when you look at it. So in particular, 1 program and 1 block of business is driving a very strong majority of the development that we're seeing in GL. It doesn't mean it's 100%, but it's clearly a strong majority. And just in terms of other lines, made clear, umbrella, for example, on our side was performed well during that 20 to 16 -- to 2016 period. Professional liability, very minimal impact for us. So this is really general liability, and there were two main components for us, which we identified some years ago and began to act upon. But the 2016 to 2019 aspects of those two are what we're dealing with today.
Juan Andrade: Yes, David. And what I would add is those two items that both Mark and I have mentioned, those are niche type businesses, not sort of standard type of GL. And essentially, we have closed that book for all intended purposes.
David Motemaden: And then. Yes, just on that point, just closing the book. I guess I'm sort of just wondering any other color you can give us that would help us feel comfortable that this is behind us because I kind of look at the charge that you guys took in 2020. And then after that, there have been more additions. It sounds like you guys did a little bit here in 2023. So what makes you think we don't sort of see that same trend happen on the insurance side as well?
Mark Kociancic: I think there's several points. First of all, you've got very well-developed reporting patterns for the '16 and '19 years. So again, anywhere from 70% to 90% development, completion of development for 2016 to '19. So that gives us a lot of confidence that we're dealing with actual data. We also have assumptions that I think are very prudent in terms of the social inflation impact. And so when you combine that altogether, we're able to capture with a high level of confidence what we think the ultimate loss ratios are going to be for really '17, '18 and '19, '16 is pretty much I think, done and really didn't move that much for us. The larger point is 2020 onwards, and I think this is what we've been trying to emphasize is we're benefiting from several factors, you can see with the process that we've embedded not only on the reserving side, but how we act upon information inside the company. And so you're seeing the claims data, what we're getting on the reserving side and embedding it within management pricing and underwriting. So which classes of business, which programs are causing issues or at risk? Are we getting adequate pricing for it? And so we're far more disciplined, I would say, 2020 onwards with respect to that. Second part, there's been a significant amount of rate that's accumulated on a quarterly basis beginning in Q4 of 2019. And that's clearly helping and it's supported by the industry loss data that's been developing since that point in time. And then you've got the prudent loss picks. Clearly, we've elevated our loss pick selection, taking into account social inflation factors, other risk factors, just trying to be more prudent as a management team. Nobody wants to go through this exercise. And so we recognize that when we started. And hence, the constant effort on portfolio management. I mean, that is ultimately the key understanding at a granular basis, your portfolio by line, by client, by policy what is driving your profitability? What is driving underwhelming results? What is driving good results? The risk selection aspect, and that's something that I think we've been able to do a pretty good job of since 2020.
Mark Kociancic: The other piece I'd add to all this is as you think about us growing into the hard market years, these portfolio compositions are dramatically different. So to point to risk selection, we've massively cut down rates over 40% on average, our rates -- our overall limits are down in excess or we've actually continued to drive and thinking just on GL, our policy count is down over 23% in heavy risk selection, driving rate embedded to exceed margin. So we're making all the right steps to continue to be proactive in our portfolio management.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Gregory Peters with Raymond James.
Gregory Peters: I'd like to pivot to the reinsurance business and a lot of market commentary and your commentary around the 1/1 renewals certainly seem more orderly on from a supply-demand perspective. I guess where I'm going with this is just the sustainability of price and terms and conditions that have been achieved over the last year. As we look to 6/1 and future renewal periods. So any perspective on that? Like, for example, we were hearing of more interest in the risk remote layers by the marketplace, et cetera. So just your perspective on how the market's changing inside reinsurance would be helpful.
Jim Williamson: Everest did have another excellent Jan 1 renewals you heard Juan say we were able to deploy our incremental capital at really exceptional economics. We did grow the cat book, including leading or participating in many of the new top-off programs that you would have heard about as well as executing on a number of non-CAT opportunities in engineering and cyber, aviation and marine. So it's really excellent all around. In terms of the dynamics of the sustainability of the market on the Property Cat side, which is, I think, where the core of the question lies, I would really point to three critical factors in terms of what is driving or what drove the market correction that started in the back half of 2022, and then obviously reached a peak and sustained itself through 2023. The first is there's been this persistent gap between supply and demand in terms of available capital. And clearly, some of that ameliorates as the industry earns good returns in 2023. But there's really fundamentally been no formation of new capital in the industry other than our equity raise. And so I think there's still that element. There's also a rising demand from our cedents to buy more limit, which we saw again in some of those new deals that came out. The second key factor, which I think is critical is underwriting psychology. The fact is the industry has been affected by multiple years of elevated loss activity that's hurt underwriters across the business. And they understand, I think, where you need to sustain rate momentum to earn good returns. And then the last thing is, if you look at the underlying loss trends, climate change, the impact of development patterns we're in an elevated CAT world. It's the new normal, and we saw it again this year. We had an elevated 2023 CAT year. So our view is that puts legs on this market, and our expectation remains that these terrific conditions will persist past the January 1/’25 renewal. In terms of risk remote layers, yes, I mean, look, there's interest there because I think people are trying to get away from all of the factors that I just described. We did see some cap on formation up in the towers that caps price increases. But as you saw in our portfolio, there's plenty of areas of these programs where we can continue to do exceptionally well. And so we see just tons of opportunity for us as we go forward.
Gregory Peters: And just building on that answer. I was looking at Slide 16 of your investor deck where you talk about the risk profile and after-tax net 1:100 year PML. Given some of the growth statistics you've thrown out in Property Cat. I guess I'm surprised that we haven't seen a bigger increase in your 1:100 year sort of PML calculation. Give us a sense of what's going on there that's keeping it muted.
Jim Williamson: Sure. Greg, Jim again. Yes, so a couple of things, and you would have heard us opine on this in prior calls, a couple of things moving there. First of all, the way we shaped our portfolio definitely has an impact on the shape of the curve and the shape of the PMLs. And so, one of the things that we did, for example, throughout 2023 was move up in programs and really get more remote in terms of our average attachment level. And I've talked about an average attachment that might have been in the 1 in 4 or 1 in 5 year range is now more like a 1 in 7, and that's very meaningful in terms of managing total risk profile. And so that's been very important. The other thing I would indicate, obviously, is we are growing our portfolio across the world. We see really terrific opportunities in markets in Europe, in Asia, in Latin America. So we don't have to over-lever ourselves to our existing peak zones. We can be diversified and get exceptional returns. And then the last thing I would note, obviously, is the company is growing. And so the capital base, the denominator of those 1:100 calculations that you're referencing is getting larger as well, which gives us obviously capacity to prudently grow our portfolio. So if you were to look at on a dollar basis, our reported PMLs, you'll see growth. I think that growth is appropriate given the environment. I'd say gross PML growth is lower than net PML growth. As we've hedge last as Mark indicated in his comments, which means more retained profit for us. So we're really moving all of these dials to ensure superior returns as we move forward.
Mark Kociancic: Greg, it's Mark. I'll just add another point to it. I do think that you will see a movement to the right on that slide that you're indicating where we'll take a bit more exposure to tail risk through the course of 2024 and probably beyond. We are becoming more of a gross underwriter. And so in addition to Jim's point on the expansion of capital, the portfolio is shaping, there will be less reliance on some of the hedging instruments as we move into more of a gross underwriting mindset but all within our risk appetite and only where we have significant margin expectations. And then the last point is we are benefiting from meaningful diversification in our Property Cat book as well.
Operator: And our next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS.
Brian Meredith: I've got two quick ones here. The first one, I'm just curious, back to the reserves and I apologize on the reinsurance side. You're not the only ones on the primary side, obviously, there's some taking to adverse development in the '16 through '19 years on the insurance side. I'm just curious, is the border rows come in from all these other companies that are taking reserve charges. Do you or have you taken into account that increase in the claims activity and severity that you're likely to see just from Border Rose coming in on reinsurance?
Mark Kociancic: Yes. We're definitely, I think, ahead of the curve on that. That's something that we've had in our vision for quite some time. And we're prudently reserved clearly in '23, have been proving out. So we feel very good about our casualty reserve positioning in the reinsurance segment for those years and recent years.
Jim Williamson: And Brian, it's Jim Williamson. The only thing I would add to that, I totally agree with what Mark said. But we're not waiting for border rows. We have very strong collaboration with our core cedents in terms of claim -- from a claims management perspective, we're getting signals much earlier than reported rose and that helps to stay on top of these trends and to ensure that we're building significant prudence into our quarterly loss base.
Brian Meredith: And then second question, just curious, capital management. I mean, obviously, you've had a lot of fantastic organic growth opportunities here, you're really growing. But as I look at your stock right now, it's kind of come down and getting closer to some pretty attractive valuations. And what are thoughts on kind of using some of the capital that you're generating for share buyback?
Mark Kociancic: Well, it's always a consideration, Brian. But we made this point last year. The underwriting opportunities are very lucrative, particularly in reinsurance. And we think we can capture a lot of in 2024, build our portfolio, build the franchise, and we can execute easily. So remunerating that capital is fundamental to achieving our Investor Day objectives. If we can't do that, yes, capital management is a tool that we can use to remunerate our shareholders more adequately, but we're very confident in our ability to achieve those objectives from Investor Day, deploy that capital profitably, build the franchises and get it done. There's a runway here for 2024, clearly and well into 2025.
Juan Andrade: Yes, Brian, this is Juan. And I would echo what Mark said, look, from our perspective, buybacks are always there right after organic growth and something that we consider on a regular basis.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research.
Ryan Tunis: Just one for me. If we think about your 2024, 2025, 2026 objectives, let's say, social inflation continues to kind of nag. So there's -- in this area where there's a little bit of underlying loss ratio pressure at the group level. Are those objectives still achievable in your mind? And I guess, if not, you mentioned capital management, but are there other levers that you can pull to stay within that ROE range?
Mark Kociancic: Ryan, it's Mark. Short answer is, yes. Very well-diversified set of lines of business that we have in both franchises to execute from. It goes back to my earlier point about the granular that we have in our portfolios so that we understand where loss trend is, what we think of social inflation exposure, medical inflation, economic inflation, et cetera, all the kind of risk factors that go into calculating the expected returns that we can get. And so when you've got that type of diversification, much easier to do cycle management and make sure that you're disciplined in allocating that capital over time. So lots of paths to do that. In terms of the social inflation aspect, I mean, it's well known, I think, in the industry. So we're obviously taking prudent loss picks into consideration as we price that business going forward. So we feel very good about the three year plan beginning '24 to '26.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Michael Zaremski with BMO Capital Markets.
Michael Zaremski: So back to the reserving discussion. You said I think, Juan, you might have said that you're making much higher loss -- taking much higher loss picks on the -- as of 2020 from looking back at the transcript wording. I don't believe, and maybe I'm incorrect your disclosure, many of your peers, you can see the disclosure, but I don't believe you Everest discloses loss tax side vintage or by major line of business. So unless I'm wrong, and you want to give some color on that, it would be great to understand how much higher those loss picks are or if you wanted to change the disclosure in the future kind of as many of your peers to disclose that.
Juan Andrade: Yes, Mike, I'll start and then I'll have Mark add some commentary as well. Look, we don't disclose our loss picks, obviously, for competitive reasons. But I can tell you that, again, as I've said before, since I arrived here in the fall of 2019 and for the first plan that we did for 2020, we significantly increased our loss picks in both insurance and reinsurance, particularly on long-tail lines of business. And that is something that we look at every quarter. and we true up every quarter, and you have not been seeing us really take loss big staff, at least not since I've been here as CEO of this company. And the reason for that is everything that we have been talking about right now, right? Number one is the fact that we recognize that there is loss inflation in the environment. So that's one of the key reasons for increasing the loss picks and not taking them down. We also have been truing up our loss trend assumptions and we've been doing that on a very regular basis starting in 2020. So before inflation, economic inflation really started to happen, we started doing that really in 2020. So I think those two things really come back to what Mark and I were saying earlier in the conversation, which also gives us comfort as to where we are right now. In addition to that, and very importantly, it's all the risk management and portfolio management actions that we have taken across the book. You heard Mike Karmilowicz, for example, talk about the fact that in lines like ex liability, where we might have had $25 million limits exposed back in 2018, 2019, they're down to $10 million now, and it's actually a net of $5 million for us in the company. So significantly lower. And that's across every single line of business that's out there. So when you take into account the increased loss picks, the increased rate, the additional loss trend is put up, the rate and the portfolio management actions, the risk selection, et cetera, all of this comes together. And essentially, the conclusion that we're giving you today on how we feel about that go-forward business and the fact that we have dealt with the 2016 to 2019 years.
Michael Zaremski: That's helpful, especially the reminding us about the limits changes on lots of the policies in '20 and beyond. Let me -- just lastly, I don't know if -- just looking at the -- you've taken a lot of realized losses make sense to kind of lock in some higher yields and some reserve changes, too, a lot of premium growth, which is -- which uses up capital. So just is there -- should we be thinking about just being careful with our buyback assumptions on a go-forward basis given all the moving parts? Or should we -- am I splitting hairs and that you can keep kind of at the current pace?
Mark Kociancic: Mike, it's Mark. The first point that I would make is we have ample capital. There's a lot of capital that we have at our disposal -- the capital raise that we did last year, fully deployed, we've generated an additional $1.5 billion in the second half of 2023. I think we've also got very favorable margin expectations for 2024 and beyond. And so the ability to generate income and retained earnings going forward, we feel very bullish about. And then you've got process that we have internally where there's the -- and I think this is really important, there's a discipline of what I call threshold pricing where we are able to move into the most accretive opportunities. We are not forced to simply underwrite certain lines or classes of business to keep volume or whatever it is. It's very much a profit focus. And so the attractiveness of what we see in this environment for underwriting expansion is driving everything. Capital management, I think that's a secondary tool. There's nothing that would restrict it. It's simply not as privileged given these opportunities that we have now. And the main point here is that with all this ample capital and capital generation ability. If we're not able to remunerate that satisfactorily to our TSR objectives. Yes, then I think you'll see more to management levers being pulled, but there's nothing stopping that conceptually. It's simply the opportunity set that we have in front of us that we want to pursue and capture.
Operator: And our next question comes from Jing Li with KBW.
Jing Li : The first question on that you mentioned in the block on the return on the casualty book. Just wondering like how big was and what's left on these books? Are they in majority GL book?
Juan Andrade: Yes. So on the two items that we mentioned for general liability and frankly, what's creating some of the issue that we're proactively addressing right now. I would say one of those programs has been completely shut off at this point in time. And then second book has been remediated, re-underwritten very little new business coming into that at this point in time. But I don't know Mike Karmilowicz, if you want to add a little bit of color to that.
Mike Karmilowicz: Yes. It's basically a couple of $100 million. And these were actually dealt with over the last 18 to 24 months. So we proactively got in front of it. And again, I think that gets back to the point you made around active and portfolio management.
Jing Li : Just one more follow-up on the market. How attractive do you guys think is for the market looking post reform?
Jim Williamson: Yes. This is Jim Williamson. Thanks for the question. Our stance has been pretty consistent in that. We thought the government of Florida, the legislator did a very good job in the structuring of those reforms. Early indications in terms of communication with our clients in Florida and other stakeholders in the state would suggest that the reforms are doing what they were intended to do. But we also said that we would be waiting for the results of those reforms to show up in our data before determining what that means for our underwriting position. So our approach to Florida has been quite consistent over the last couple of years. We are a meaningful provider capacity to the state -- and as long as our expectation for risk-adjusted returns are met, which would mean at least as good or improved from last year, meaning excellent, we'll continue to provide that capacity. Obviously, if that isn't the case, we would do less. And if conditions get even better, we might do a little bit more. But I don't expect a major change at the upcoming June 1 renewal.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to the management team for any closing remarks.
Juan Andrade: So thank you for the great dialogue and all the questions on the actions that we took in the quarter. I do think it's important to zoom out and keep things in context, right? If you look at the 2023 results for the company, they were simply outstanding. 23% operating ROE, total shareholder return over 26%. And if you exclude the Bermuda DTA action, you're still generating an operating ROE of 19% and a TSR of 21%. So simply world-class results. You also heard a commentary on the 1/1 renewals, which were excellent. That gives us pretty significant tailwind going into 2024. Not a great discussion on the reserves. And I think hopefully, the takeaway that you have here is we have a strong reserve position. We feel confident about where we are. And then lastly, as Mark and I both said, we are confident in achieving our Investor Day targets. We have lots of levers to achieve our objectives. So with that, I look forward talking to you after our Q1 results. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines. Have a wonderful day.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-10-28 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Everest Group Ltd. Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Matthew Rohrmann, Senior Vice President, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Matthew Rohrmann: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Everest Group Ltd. third quarter of 2023 earnings conference call. The Everest executives leading today's call are Juan Andrade, President and CEO; and Mark Kociancic, Executive Vice President and CFO. We are also joined by other members of the Everest management team. Before we begin, I'll preface the comments on today's call by noting that Everest SEC filings, including extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. Management comments regarding estimates, projections and similar are subject to the risks, uncertainties and assumptions as noted in these filings. Management may also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These items are reconciled in our earnings release and financial supplement. With that, I'll turn the call over to Juan.
Juan Andrade: Thank you, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Everest's third quarter performance was excellent. We delivered outstanding returns, including a near 20% operating return on equity and an annualized total shareholder return of 25%. We are leaning into the hard reinsurance market, where favorable conditions and a flight to quality persist. As a lead reinsurance market and preferred partner, we are taking advantage of strong pricing while deepening our client relationships and expanding our global portfolio at significantly improved risk-adjusted returns. We are positioned for success as we head into the January renewals. We also remain on track for January 2024 for the full deployment of the equity capital raised in May. Our primary insurance business delivered strong underwriting income with a significant year-over-year improvement in the third quarter. And our high-quality investment portfolio continues to support our underwriting performance with outstanding returns. We achieved these results despite another active catastrophe quarter. We tracked over 80 material events globally this quarter, resulting in a 9-month year-to-date industry loss estimated at roughly $93 billion. The industry is on course for another $100 billion loss this year. This reinforces the need for continued underwriting discipline and for additional pricing increases across all lines. As the world becomes increasingly complex, Everest value proposition, it's in greater demand. As you have heard me say before, we are on offense with strong tailwinds across all of our earnings streams, a strong balance sheet and top-tier global talent powering it all. With that, I'll turn to our third quarter financial highlights, beginning at the Group level. In addition to delivering exceptional returns, we drove substantial improvements across our Group key financial metrics, underwriting income, net investment income, operating income and net income and we delivered record increases in operating cash flow and book value per share. We grew the business at significantly expanded margins. Gross written premiums increased by 23% year-over-year in constant dollars, led by record quarterly reinsurance growth. We generated $613 million in net operating income, a significant year-over-year increase, and we have generated $1.7 billion year-to-date. The Group combined ratio of 91.4% also improved year-over-year by 21 points, which translates to an underwriting profit of over $300 million for the quarter and nearly $1 billion in underwriting profit year-to-date. Our attritional loss and combined ratios both improved by more than a point year-over-year to 59% and 86.5%, respectively. We generated more than $400 million in net investment income in the third quarter and we delivered over $1 billion of net investment income year-to-date. In addition to the improved interest rate environment, this year-over-year improvement was driven by strong returns from both our fixed income and our alternative investments. Turning now to our reinsurance business. The reinsurance division delivered an exceptional quarter with outstanding top and bottom line results and superb execution by our team. Leading into the strength of the market, we maintained our strategy of targeted and nimble capital deployment with core clients, resulting in significant growth across virtually all business lines and geographies at materially improved risk-adjusted returns. We grew gross written premiums on a constant dollar basis and excluding reinstatements, by 33% to $3.2 billion for the quarter. This is a new record for the division. In property catastrophe, where the market remains outstanding, premiums, excluding reinstatements, were up 41% from last year. Property pro rata premiums increased 44%. Casualty pro rata premiums were up as well at 20%, while we carefully manage the casualty market cycle and target best-in-class clients. Internationally, we expanded in key target growth markets across Europe, Asia and Latin America. We also grew in specialty lines with strong margins, including aviation, marine and mortgage. Despite the active catastrophe quarter, we improved our catastrophe loss ratio significantly year-over-year, reflecting our deliberate and consistent actions to manage volatility. The attritional loss and combined ratios were down year-over-year by 1.6 and almost two points, respectively, with the overall combined ratio improving to 91%. This helped us achieve an underwriting profit of $234 million. Looking ahead, our outlook for the January 1, 2024 renewal remains strong. We fully expect the robust pricing and favorable conditions to continue. And as a lead market, we stand to benefit. Our nimble, creative and collaborative approach allows us to simultaneously improve our economics and strengthen client relationships. This tremendous relationship equity will serve us well. Expectations for pricing and terms and conditions in the global property market are now well understood, which should make future renewals more orderly. At recent industry events, including Monte Carlo and CIAB, our clients told us that they want more of our capacity and want to further broaden their partnership with us. Our confidence in our strategy and in the strength and durability of the market is high. I am excited by the magnitude of the opportunity we have created for the business. We are extremely well-positioned with the expertise, global capabilities and financial strength to seize this generational market opportunity and to optimize the portfolio for the long-term. Now turning to our Insurance division. In our primary business, rate continues to exceed loss trend with improvements across multiple lines. We achieved an 11% increase in our core portfolio, excluding workers' compensation and financial lines. In addition to property, improved pricing was particularly strong in marine and other specialty lines. We grew the business approximately 4% and generated more than $1 billion in gross written premiums. Growth in the quarter was diversified and particularly strong across property, where we see excellent opportunities and specialty lines such as marine, aviation, trade credit and political risk. The growth was offset by reductions in workers' compensation and financial lines where the market is less attractive. Additionally, we are gaining traction internationally, where we are methodically scaling our capabilities and our platform. Our focus remains on driving bottom line growth. We continue our disciplined underwriting to take advantage of high margin opportunities and reduce exposure in pockets of business that do not meet our profitability objectives. The attritional loss ratio improved year-over-year to 63%. Our pre-tax catastrophe losses at $10 million, net of estimated recoveries and reinstatement premiums were modest, leading to an improvement in the reported combined ratio to 92.6%. We achieved an underwriting profit of $66 million in the quarter and a record profit of $196 million year-to-date. We continue to attract and develop best-in-class talent. We share our vision for the company and our commitment to world-class customer service. I am bullish about the momentum we have created for our business and Everest's position in the market. We have every advantage at our disposal, a world-class team, strong and diversified reinsurance and insurance platforms and market tailwinds at our back to accelerate our progress and build even greater value for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Mark to review the financials in more detail.
Mark Kociancic: Thank you, Juan, and good morning, everyone. Everest had another very strong quarter and built upon the momentum we saw in the first half of the year. The company reported operating income of $613 million or $14.14 per diluted share in the quarter, equating to an operating income return on equity of 19.2%. Year-to-date, total shareholder return or TSR, stands at 24.5% annualized. We significantly improved our overall combined ratio while generating double-digit growth as pricing and terms remain attractive in most lines of business around the world. The company's strong performance in the third quarter was led by our team's high level of execution in our core markets and we have a number of tailwinds across both of our businesses heading into the last quarter of the year and into 2024. Looking at the Group results for the third quarter of 2023, Everest reported gross written premium of $4.4 billion, representing 23.4% growth in constant dollars year-over-year. The combined ratio was 91.4%, which includes 5 points of losses or $175 million from pre-tax natural catastrophes, net of estimated recoveries. The natural catastrophe losses in the quarter were driven by a number of midsized events globally. Group's attritional loss ratio was 59%, 120 basis point improvement over the prior year's quarter, led by the reinsurance segment, which I'll discuss in more detail in just a moment. The Group's commission ratio increased 50 basis points to 21.4% on mix changes, while the Group's expense ratio remains a competitive advantage of 6.1%, up modestly year-over-year as we continue to invest in our talent and systems within both franchises. Moving to the segment results and starting with reinsurance. Reinsurance gross premiums grew 32.7% in constant dollars when adjusting for reinstatement premiums during the quarter. As Juan mentioned, this was a record for the segment. The strong growth was driven by double-digit increases in Property Pro rata, Property Cat XOL, Casualty XOL and Casualty Pro rata and was broad-based globally. The combined ratio was 91%, which improved from 115% in the prior year. The prior year period included $620 million of pre-tax catastrophe losses, net of recoveries and reinstatement premiums, largely due to Hurricane Ian. The attritional loss ratio improved 160 basis points to 57.5% as we continue to achieve more favorable rate in terms, particularly in property, which we expect to continue throughout 2024. The commission ratio was 24.8%, an increase of 90 basis points from the prior year due to the impact of reinstatement premiums from the Q3 Cats last year. There was a modest 30 basis point underlying mix impact benefit, excluding the Q3 2022 reinstatements. The underwriting-related expense ratio was 2.5%, which was essentially flat year-over-year. We continue to lean into the hard reinsurance market and the equity capital raise deployment remains on track and will be fully deployed by January 1 renewals. Moving to Insurance. Gross premiums written grew 3.5% in constant dollars to $1.2 billion. As you may have noticed, gross written premium growth was more modest this quarter as the division enjoyed double-digit growth in a diversified mix of property and specialty lines, while being partially offset by lower written premiums in workers' compensation and financial lines. Overall, pricing remains ahead of loss trend, and we continue to see attractive market opportunities across our book of business. We will also continue to have underwriting discipline in areas we find less attractive as we exhibited this quarter. The combined ratio was 92.6%, which improved from 103.5% in the prior year. The division benefited from a relatively low level of natural catastrophe losses in the quarter in the amount of $10 million net of estimated recoveries and reinstatement premiums, further demonstrating the success of our derisking actions on our portfolio. The attritional loss ratio improved slightly this quarter to 63.1% driven primarily by business mix, given the higher proportion of longer tail lines of business. The commission ratio improved 120 basis points largely driven by business mix as increased property writings earned through as well as increased volume of seating commissions. The underwriting-related expense ratio was 16.7%, largely driven by certain one-off expenses and the continued investment in our global platform. And finally, to cover investments, tax and the balance sheet, net investment income increased $255 million to $406 million for the quarter, driven primarily by higher new money yields, our investment in floating rate securities and higher assets under management. Alternative assets generated $75 million of net investment income, a sequential improvement as equity markets have continued to rebound. Overall, our book yield improved from 3.2% to 4.2% year-over-year, and our reinvestment rate remains close to 6%. We continue to have a short asset duration of approximately 2.7 years given the attractive level of short rates. And as a reminder, the 23% of our fixed income investments are in floating rate securities. For the third quarter of 2023, our operating income tax rate was 6.5%, which was lower than our working assumption of 11% to 12% for the year, and this was largely due to geographic income splits. Shareholders' equity ended the quarter at $11.3 billion or $13.1 billion, excluding net unrealized depreciation on available-for-sale fixed income securities. At the end of the quarter, net unrealized losses on the available-for-sale fixed income portfolio equates to approximately $1.9 billion, an increase of $242 million as compared to the end of the second quarter, resulting from rate increases and foreign exchange movements. Cash flow from operations of $1.4 billion during the quarter was a company record and book value per share ended the quarter at $258.71, an improvement of 22.4% from year-end 2022. When adjusted for dividends of $5.05 per share year-to-date. Book value per share, excluding net unrealized depreciation on available-for-sale fixed income securities stood at $301.76 versus $259.18 per share at year-end 2022, representing an increase of approximately 16.4%. Net leverage at quarter end stood at 18.6%, modestly lower on a sequential and year-over-year basis. In conclusion, Everest had an excellent third quarter of 2023 and is well-positioned heading into the final quarter of the year and into 2024. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Matt.
Matthew Rohrmann: Thanks, Mark. Operator, we are now ready to open the line for questions . We do ask that you please limit your questions to one question plus one follow-up, then rejoin the queue if you have additional questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Alex Scott: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. First question I had for you is on the demand for Property Cat reinsurance headed into this next year. And I'd just be interested if there's any color you can provide from early discussions and indications around that piece of things in terms of just thinking through last year, the retentions brought up a bit, I think limits in certain cases, weren't taking up as much as insured values were going up, that kind of thing. Are you seeing some willingness to reverse some of those actions? Do you think you'll see that kind of growth in the Property Cat reinsurance market this next year?
James Williamson: [Audio break] on demand is that we see very strong signals that our clients are looking for more Property Cat capacity. And as you say, there was, I think, some pent-up demand at 1/1 of '23 that ultimately didn't get fulfilled. And so they're now back in the market and seeking capacity. We are having discussions with our clients actively about the 1/1 renewal and have also taken advantage of some opportunities to do some private placement activity in the latter half of this year to start filling in that demand. So I think that's a very strong signal and our view with that is that, that will continue to drive really attractive returns in that market. As respects retention levels and the market's reaction to that and what might happen next year, our view is, overall, the movement in retentions were necessary and appropriate. There clearly was too much industry loss activity flowing into the reinsurance sector that needs to be retained in the primary market. Now does that mean that every single carrier landed in the right spot, probably not. And I'm sure there'll be some adjustments around the edges. But fundamentally, I don't see any change in terms of going backwards on retentions.
Alex Scott: Got it. And in terms of a follow-up, I wanted to ask you about Casualty Reinsurance and just your comfort with the price adequacy of the quota-share commissions and so forth. We heard that there was some negativity coming out of Monte Carlo from some of the European reinsurers. What's your perspective on some of the social inflation concerns and how well that's being captured in price and willingness to grow in some of those areas?
James Williamson: Sure, Alex. It's Jim again. So as you say, I mean, this issue is clearly on the minds of the market, and it's been much discussed, including by Everest with our customers at both Monte-Carlo and CIAB. I think to fully understand our view of the market and what happens next, you really have to understand the context of how we built our book of business. We've been incredibly deliberate and focused on managing the market cycle, and growing with the best-in-class cedents around the world, right? So we timed it correctly. We grew after the market began to harden. In 2019, we grew with best-in-class underwriters. We did not write the entire market. And I think some market participants did do that, and their results and their market commentary reflects that error. And you also may have heard recently if you expressed, I think, that reinsurers have been slow to recognize the changes that are happening around social inflation and the other trends you mentioned. I mean that is absolutely not the case with Everest. You would have seen our approach over the last 3-plus years. We've been very decisive on the reserve front. We've been prudent in our loss picks and which we've maintained by the way, even though pricing over the last couple of years has exceeded our expectations. We've been updating our trend factors on a frequent basis. So we are staying very much close to these trends and staying on top of them. So today, we are sitting here with a very strong book with the best underwriters in the market. And those underwriters are not sitting by idly waiting for bad things to happen, which, by the way, is why we are starting to see signs of some reacceleration of rate taking among many of our clients, they're managing this closely. That said, social inflation is real. It's a real trend that needs to be managed. And so our approach at whether it's the January 1 renewal that's coming up or really any renewal is to assess each deal on its merits. And we do that in a very rational way. If the deal passes muster and is delivering returns we want, we'll write it. If it doesn't, we are more than happy to move away from it. We have many, many options to deploy our capital, which is why diversification is so important in our business, many different ways to get to our financial goals. And so we have the flexibility to move among deals. The other point that I would make just relative to a piece of your question around ceding commissions, given all these trends, our expectation is that ceding commissions will continue to improve. We've seen that movement already begin and we expect it to strengthen considerably as we move into 2024.
Alex Scott: Thanks for all the details.
James Williamson: You got it.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Joshua Shanker: Yes. Thank you for taking my question. Maybe there's no answer to this question, but obviously, the attachment points have gone up this year and the portfolio is more risk averse than it was a year ago, presumably. Given the moderate and frequent catastrophes this quarter, is there any way of putting in context what the Cat loss would have been had it happened last year instead of this year?
James Williamson: Sure, Josh, this is Jim. Well, one point I would start with, I know you've made a point that it was a moderate Cat quarter and I think we feel very good about our Cat loss. But this quarter, from an industry perspective was anything but moderate. I mean we tracked over 80 events around the world. You had significant hurricane activity, which fortunately because of landing points, et cetera, did not do significant damage. But the comment I would make, and as you say, it's sort of an unanswerable question, but you've seen our year-to-date performance in terms of our reported Cat losses. And that's happening against the backdrop of a year that's likely going to be another $100 billion plus industry loss a year, which is incredible, right? And our expectation is that if you repeated the losses of 2022, for example, our loss this year against those same events would have been meaningfully lower, and that's because of attachment points. It's because of portfolio management, it's because of aggregation, it's our underwriting discipline, it's all those things laddering up. So we have clearly changed and improved the risk profile of the book, particularly when you're talking about a large number of mid to large sized Cat losses.
Joshua Shanker: Okay. And then if I can get one more in. You mentioned that you're ready to deploy the capital you raised earlier in the year at January 1. Is there any way to discuss the degree to which capital is underdeployed right now in 3Q '23? And what the impact might be if you were fully deployed the way you want to be?
James Williamson: Yes. Sure, Josh. Jim again. Well, look, so just to kind of go back to what we said after the capital raise, our expectation was that we would begin the deployment meaningfully with the 7/1 renewal that there would be incremental opportunities through the back half of 2023, and then we would complete the deployment at the January 1 renewal. So, we have done exactly that. We've begun the process of deployment. We had a really strong 7/1. The back half of the year after 7/1 gets quieter, but there's been some nice deal activity both at the renewal periods as well as on a private placement basis. And based on the conversations we've had with our cedents, we see a very strong path to completing the deployment. We really have no concerns around that. So I'm not going to speculate on, well, what if I just sort of deploy all the capital at 7/1. But what I can say is the path to completing that process, as we described, is incredibly clear.
Mark Kociancic: Yes, Josh, it's Mark. Just to add a couple of points to Jim's commentary. So number one, we are obviously very, very certain of our ability to deploy by 1/1. So you're dealing essentially with a 6-month time frame between the raise and the 1/1 deployment along the way. Clearly, we are deploying it where we see fit. From an investment point of view, it's fully deployed the way we would like it for the time being. No issue for us to carry a little bit of excess capital. That's going to get remunerated to some extent, but will be, like I said, fully deployed by 1/1. And there's no benefit to rushing any kind of deployment. We want to stay disciplined and focused just as our initial plan back in May for the equity raise indicated.
Juan Andrade: Josh, and this is Juan. Just maybe to put a fine point on it. Rates are still improving in property. And we also got paid a lot more for the risk that we took, and so that's part of the confidence that we have in being able to deploy this fully by the 1/1 renewal.
Joshua Shanker: And so we should expect a healthy growth with 1/1 given all that you've said?
James Williamson: Yes, Josh, it's Jim. I mean my expectation is we are going to grow our Property Cat writings with our core clients very nicely. Again, we see significant demand. Our expectation is that risk-adjusted rates will increase at the 1/1 renewal. So lots of opportunity in the environment.
Joshua Shanker: Thank you for the extended answer. I appreciate it.
Juan Andrade: Right.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Yaron Kinar: Thank you and good morning. My first question piggybacks on your thoughts on 1/1 renewals in the property reinsurance market. So certainly, you sound very constructive. You're also talking about demand being up. What about the supply side? Because I would have thought that with relatively benign reinsurance losses this year and certainly in hurricane season, you're going to see an uptick in capital. So how are you thinking about that and the kind of supply-demand dynamic, especially for maybe more remote risk, which seems to be where the insurers are more interested in playing right now into 1/1, is the constructive view really driven by supply/demand? Or is it more about sentiment and discipline considering maybe a more balanced equation this year?
Juan Andrade: Yes. Yaron, this is Juan. Thank you for the question. Look, I think from our perspective, you're seeing a couple of dynamics that really have not fundamentally changed since the beginning of the year since we've been talking about this issue. Number one, there's still definitely a supply and demand imbalance that's out there. And I think as we've discussed before, whether that's $100 billion or $40 billion, it doesn't really matter because it's a pretty big gap between supply and demand. And there has not been a particularly large or moderate influx of capital into the industry to close that gap. So there's definitely that imbalance that continues to exist on the supply side. In addition to that and building on what Jim said earlier, you're still seeing pent-up demand and increased demand from our cedents across the board. A lot of that is also generated by, frankly, a flight to quality. It is basically cedents wanting to work with more companies like us who have stronger balance sheet, who've been very constructive into renewals, et cetera. So from that perspective, we are not seeing anything in the environment right now that really fundamentally changes the pricing trajectory or the trajectory of this business going into 1/1. And frankly, further, you saw the growth rates that I quoted earlier in my prepared remarks, where we were up over 40% of property. You heard Jim's comments just a minute ago about what he expects to see at 1/1. So we do expect that tailwind to continue to be behind us as we go forward. But let me ask Jim to jump in and see if he wants to add anything to that.
James Williamson: Yes. Sure, Yaron. A couple of other points I'd add to what Juan said. I mean there is -- I think you've referred to it as a sentiment, but there's an underwriting discipline that underlies all of this, irrespective of how much capital is available to underwriters. In our industry, every underwriter I've talked to, they want to get paid more for the risk they've been taking, and that's a reflection of the last several years of elevated Cat losses and even what we've seen this year and in this quarter. And I don't see any sign that's dissipating. And then to your -- the other point you made around more remote layers and that seems like an area where more people want to participate. You've seen some Cat bond activity up there, et cetera. I mean that how much rate gets added to the effects of 2023 and at which levels will remain to be seen. But in our view, it doesn't really matter. If there's more supply at the remote level, that means that just below that there'll be great opportunities. We are very flexible and nimble in where we deploy our capital. And so those kinds of impacts don't really reflect our -- or change our opportunity.
Yaron Kinar: Thank you. That's very helpful. And then if I could maybe shift gears to the Insurance segment. And I think, Mark, in your prepared comments, you talked about some mix shift as maybe driving the loss ratios to stay -- have unchanged year-over-year despite the fact that you're getting rate over trend. Can you maybe elaborate on that a little bit? Because for me as an outsider, if I look at the book, it seems like property and short tail lines grew by about 40% year-over-year. In aggregate, over the last 12 months, I see other specialty up 40%. And then we see some of the lines that I would have thought have higher attritional loss ratios, such workers' comp and professional liability actually coming in a bit. So I'd love to better understand the dynamics there if you could elaborate?
Mark Kociancic: Okay, Yaron. It's Mark. I'm going to start, and then I'll ask Karm to finish and add some color to it. Look, first of all, I think the attritional loss ratio is pretty much right where it should be. We are still setting conservative loss picks for casualty lines in particular. We are in an elevated risk environment. We want to be prudent on that. We are obviously getting rate, and we are getting the kind of business we want to write in terms of cycle managing this particular marketplace. So you've seen some increases in writings and decreases in different lines, and that gives you a sense of our discipline in the marketplace. And so that mix in the attritional loss ratio is coming out too broadly stable with last year. We don't see any problem with that. We've got an embedded margin in there that we are quite comfortable with, quite confident in, and we think it takes into account the risk environment that's out there for the different lines we've underwritten.
Michael Karmilowicz: Yes. And Yaron, I would add -- this is Mike Karm. I would add to it a couple of things. First, the focus for us is Juan stated in his opening comments, is about profitability, and we've been leaning into the first party lines pretty heavily, particularly in the property, aviation and marine. And then you see the other specialty lines like you mentioned, we are driving lines [indiscernible] and energy, where we see really, really strong risk-adjusted returns. I think you'll see that play through, hopefully on the [technical difficulty]. Ultimately, that's being offset when you think about what we are in that cycle management that Mark mentioned, particularly on the workers' comp and financial lines, and that offsets it. If you think about the quarter for us, we are focused on mix. That is our general focus ultimately is to get the loss ratio continue to get lower. But for us, ultimately, is really trying to make sure that we are leaning into the market where there's opportunity and again, being disciplined around what we don't chase. And we don't chase the lines that we think right now. We are not showing those risk-adjusted returns. So if you took those out, particularly the workers' comp and particularly the financial lines, our growth would have been where we are year-to-date around 9% plus. So I think for us, we tend to focus on the long term, it's really about generating the right mix and making sure that we are driving the best loss ratio we can do.
Yaron Kinar: Thanks so much.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Michael Zaremski with BMO. Please go ahead.
Michael Zaremski: Hey, good morning. Thank you. Maybe just looking at the paid to incurred ratio ex catastrophes and reserves. It's been, I think, not just you all, but it's been ticking up a bit year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. Anything worth calling out or talking about in terms of trend there?
Mark Kociancic: Mike, it's Mark. I wouldn't say there's anything specific to say there. I think it's largely your portfolio mix that's just driving that trend, mix of property, the long-tail lines. There's no particular significant set of claims or COVID settlements or anything like that, that's in the mix. So from my standpoint, it's just a natural outcome of the portfolio mix.
Michael Zaremski: Okay. That's helpful. I guess switching gears a bit back to the discussion on ceding commissions. The business mix has changed a lot over time. And I know you used to -- I think the wording it could improve considerably. Any perspective on kind of like if ceding commissions are still -- many points different than they were many years ago, right? But I know your business mix has changed a lot, too. So is there any context about what considerably could mean if things do go -- continue to move in favor of reinsurers into '24?
James Williamson: Yes, Mike, this is Jim Williamson. Look, we've -- one of the things we said this year is that ceding commissions on Casualty Pro rata overall have moved by about a point. And obviously, it differs by deal and geography and all those sorts of things. I think our view is that, that will accelerate and needs to accelerate. And we've certainly seen some anecdotes that you probably would have heard of as well of deals in the back half of this year moving by more than that, and we've seen some of that as well. And I think that bodes well for us in 2024 being able to accelerate from that one point to a larger number. I'm not going to predict what that ends up being, but the trend line around getting a better outcome is certainly there.
Michael Zaremski: Okay. Got it. And maybe lastly, just wanted to make sure on Everest historical Cat load guidance, is it correct that your last Cat load guidance was less than 6%. And I'm -- I clearly heard -- but we clearly heard what you said about if Cat losses last year happened this year, what would happen, but then also you're probably leaning into the marketplace as well and business mix has changed. So just is less than 6% the most recent update?
Mark Kociancic: Yes. Roughly 6% is the expected annual Cat load that we would have in our operating plan for the year. Now that's consistent -- broadly consistent with what we said at the IR Day back in '21.
Michael Zaremski: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Mike Ward from Citi. Please go ahead.
Michael Ward: Thanks, guys. Good morning. I was just wondering if you had any preliminary view on maybe the industry exposure for Hurricane Otis in Acapulco?
Juan Andrade: Yes. Sure thing, Mike. This is Juan Andrade. Look, I think Otis is a great example of what we've been talking about over the last few minutes. And the reason why frankly, the property cat market will continue to be hard into '24 and '25. Let's put it in the context of what we said earlier, right? We saw 80 events roughly around the world that we were able to track. The industry loss now is at about $93 billion, 9 months year-to-date, headed well probably into $100 billion plus by the end of the year. And now you have something like Otis, which if you follow what happened with that storm, it basically exploded from being a 70-mile an hour storm to be at 165 miles an hour in a period of about 12 hours, which was pretty significant strengthening and then hitting Acapulco, right? So this is one of the things that when you look at the world, you realize that you still need to continue to push for pricing. You need to continue to push for cash flow points being up, terms and conditions, et cetera. Look, from our perspective, we expect that loss to be modest at the end of the day, I can't speak for others out there. But I think this is also the discipline that you've seen from us on how we manage our volatility and our accumulations around the world.
Michael Ward: Thanks. That's helpful. Maybe on the expense ratio front, the internal investments seem a little weighted to insurance. I guess as you look to 2024, do you expect that to set up softer comps in that segment or for the group overall?
Mark Kociancic: I missed the last three words on that, sorry. Could you repeat it, Mike?
Michael Ward: I was just -- looking into '24, I was wondering if you expect the expense ratio weighted towards insurance to set up softer comps, whether it's insurance or just for the group overall?
Mark Kociancic: Well, we are continuing to expand in insurance, both in North America, but also internationally. So that comes with a bit of front end loaded expenses, something we think we can manage well within our combined ratio expectations for the business. It's a bit elevated right now compared to prior years as we start to gear up. But it's not something that I would expect to have any kind of meaningful impact on our combined ratio going forward. Having said that, I think the benefits of our expansion, this is something we'll get into in our Investor Day, but that's something we feel very confident about going forward in terms of being a future profit driver and an expansion of our franchise offering.
Michael Ward: Thanks, guys.
Juan Andrade: Thanks, Mike.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.
Ryan Tunis: Hey, thanks. Good morning. So I just have one, and I guess it's on the Kilimanjaro bond. So earlier in the year, it looked like you guys let a couple of hundred million of those expire without replacing them. And it looks like there's almost another $0.5 billion of those that expire at year-end. And I'm just curious if there is a plan to replace those with some other form of reinsurance? Or should we think about the capital raise you did earlier this year is potentially going to fill a little bit of that.
Mark Kociancic: Ryan, it's Mark. So let me take a shot at this. I think whenever we talk about our capital shield, we always start with the gross risk that we are underwriting. We essentially want to be gross underwriters. It's not a flow-through or anything else in terms of the use of retrocession cat bonds, et cetera. So that's kind of the starting point. So we have a substantial laddering of Cat bonds, typically over a 4- or 5-year type of duration. There are different layers at which they attach and our book changes as well on the growth side from time to time. So we take the gross portfolio that we are underwriting into account. We take our overall cat position into our account, and then we start to modify. And there's a couple of other factors that would go into it. So let me just start with the easy stuff. So we always -- we have the ability to use and we prefer to use Mt. Logan, our third-party sidecar vehicle as much as we can in terms of hedging and aligning it with the kind of risk we are taking in property cat. Tactical use of ILWs on a periodic basis is another tool that we use, and we use this proactively, depending on where the efficiency of the pricing and the placements are for cat bonds and ILWs and then Logan, of course. So we also take into account the capital position. You referenced the capital raise in May as an additional source of capital base for the company. So that definitely enters the equation. And lastly, I would throw into the mix the economic capital at risk graph that we talk about frequently in our investor deck. And essentially, that space that we are comfortable playing in shows that we have a lot of room to expand risk appetite within our tolerances for tail risk, earnings at risk. And we tend to do that, especially when we see superior margin on the types of risks that we are underwriting, particularly property cat. And so we take all of these factors that I've mentioned to plan out our capital shield going forward. And so obviously, we had a conscious decision to not renew the -- I think we had two bonds in the spring. We did add another one at a different layer, but net-net, there was a reduction. We've got significant capacity that's up for maturity in -- I believe it's November, December. And that's something that we are taking into account now, but I've given you the framework of how we look at it. So I can assure you that given our ambition as a gross underwriter and pursuing superior risk adjusted returns, we are going to look at the options on the capital shield side relative to our gross book as we make those decisions.
Ryan Tunis: Thank you. That's helpful.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Gregory Peters with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Gregory Peters: Good morning, everyone. I guess I wanted to step back with the substantial growth as you're leaning into the market and property and the reinsurance side, I mean you're also reporting the growth in the insurance operations on property short tail. Could you just talk to us about how you're managing risk aggregation because it's a lot of growth and just I'm sure there's a lot of involvement in managing your risk, but give us some perspective there?
James Williamson: Yes, Greg, this is Jim Williamson. It's clearly an important topic. We have a very robust risk management process at Everest that spans both our reinsurance and our insurance business across really all aspects of the risk we are taking, whether it's property cat, it's credit risk, casualty, et cetera. And there are robust processes underneath that framework where underwriters in the respective divisions are analyzing our aggregation, assessing risk reward. We have a companywide risk reward scorecard that shows us where we are getting best paid for capital deployment. And we leverage that process to ensure that we are moving capacity to the areas of the business that drive the best returns. And so what you would have seen, for example, earlier this year, if we rewind the clock in those discussions, Mike Karm and I were staying very close on what was happening in the reinsurance market. And so reinsurance started consuming more of the available capacity because that's where the opportunities lie. That started to balance out a little bit more now as the opportunity in insurance has strengthened so much. So that's the process we use. If you look at our PMLs by peak zone, we are still in really good shape in all of our peak zones. We do monitor it very carefully. But as Mark indicated, on an earnings and capital at risk, or if you look at our stated risk tolerances in our ORSA filings, et cetera, we are all well within risk tolerances, which gives us room to grow both reinsurance and insurance as these opportunities emerge.
Juan Andrade: Yes, Greg. And one thing that I would add to what Jim just said, and this is Juan. A lot of it is rate, not necessarily exposure, right? And that's the trade that we've talked about in the past that is an excellent trade for us, which is, we are able to get significant rate for similar exposure and significantly better risk adjusted returns. And that's our focus right now, and basically we are achieving that.
Mark Kociancic: Yes. Sorry, I guess you're going to get all four of us, Greg, it's Mark here, and then I'll let Mike finish it off. I just want to add two points. So number one, we have very clearly defined risk tolerances inside the company for how much risk we are willing to take. Those are not going to be breached. Those are governed at the Board level, respected by management, and we have a clear process to manage that stuff, a lot of flexibility there as well. And number two, we are fairly diversified and broad based with our exposures as well on a geographic and line basis, which also helps. You're not seeing single concentrations that are onerous in the different zones. Mike?
Michael Karmilowicz: Sure. Yes. And I'll finish it off. I guess just from a perspective, you've seen over the last few years in insurance, we've meaningfully derisked a lot of the portfolio, particularly in the peak zones. Over the last 2 years alone, you saw us exit the Florida condo business, not just because it wasn't profitable, but because it really didn't meet our risk-adjusted returns and we just saw the regulatory environment and litigation environment changing. And then more importantly, the specific portfolio actions we've taken around our hurricane 100 PML over 40%, we reduced that. We took our gross limits in our wholesale, which is more cat-prone again and reduce that over 40% deployed limits over the last year. And what you're seeing from us right now is basically getting much, much better risk adjusted returns, but really derisking our concentration around these P zones and really basically diversifying the portfolio, not just domestically, but globally as well.
Gregory Peters: Well, that's good detail. Juan, I think you mentioned the durability of the market in your prepared remarks and I know very well, many of us are focused on wind in North America wind and which has not been an issue this year, at least in a sort of material way. But there hasn't been many losses in fire at DIC in North America either. And I'm just curious, I know it's rather a specific question, but do you see any change in pricing or terms in fire or DIC going into 1/1 considering the lack of any loss there?
Juan Andrade: Look, I think -- thanks, Greg. It's Juan. I think ultimately, all of this goes back to the fundamental question as to how much capacity is available for property in general. So I think it is part of the same equation. And so in our view, we expect this market to continue the way it is. You look at the rates that you're getting in wholesale in North America are basically 30% or plus. In the retail property in North America, they're 20% to 30%, and that has continued. That sort of gone unabated in this period of time. So I think that same dynamic that we talked about earlier, where not only is there a supply and demand issue here, but there's also the psychology that Jim was talking about. I think Yaron may have asked the question. The environment hasn't fundamentally changed. And so because of that, I don't think there's going to be a fundamental change in pricing in property ex cat at this point in time.
Gregory Peters: Fair enough. Thank you for the answers.
Juan Andrade: Thanks, Greg.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods. Please go ahead.
Meyer Shields: Great. Thanks so much for fitting me in. Two really quick questions. First, Mark, in addition to the investment spend, I think you noted some one-time expenses in insurance. I was wondering whether there's any way of quantifying that?
Mark Kociancic: Well, one-time expenses. So let me break it down into kind of two components on the insurance expansion. So I would say roughly maybe a little less than two-thirds of our expense is compensation related to human capital. So we are expanding that's going to provide future bandwidth to underwrite and current bandwidth. It's clearly actionable. The second piece is you are dealing with technology spends as well to improve systems and middle office process type stuff. So that stuff is making its way through. It's very manageable. It's a relatively modest amount, and it's something that comes first and the growth is trailing somewhat. But we definitely see this paying for itself and again, manageable within the combined ratio assumptions that we have for the plan.
Meyer Shields: Okay. Perfect. That's very helpful. Second question, just to make sure I'm not overlooking anything. I think, Juan, you've talked about a lot of executives have noted that this year -- or sorry, the 1/1 '24 reinsurance renewals should be much more orderly. Is there any benefit to the more chaotic renewals that we saw last year? Did that -- or are there any good guys embedded in that?
Juan Andrade: Well, look, I mean, you always want to be in a place where your customers, your cedents and the brokers sort of understand the situation and understand what you are, essentially putting forth the storms, conditions, et cetera, et cetera. And I think that was a more challenging renewal last year because the market changed so quickly. I think what we see now is basically what I articulated earlier, where, at this point in time, I think we all recognize the world that we are living in, we all recognize the environment. Discussions have begun much earlier than they did last year. And so from that perspective, I think that's actually a pretty good thing. So we feel pretty good about it. I think, frankly, the only benefit that I would have seen last year is the fact that Everest was one of the first, if not the first, to get out and offer constructive terms and conditions and pricing, whereas a lot of our competitors were still looking to essentially fill the retro buckets to know how much capacity they had. So I think for us, that was a good guy last year. But ultimately, I think having an orderly market is good for the industry.
Meyer Shields: Perfect. Thank you so much.
Juan Andrade: Thanks, Meyer.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS. Please go ahead.
Brian Meredith: Yes, thanks. Just one quick one here. Mt. Logan, I'm just curious kind of plans are for 1/1. Do you think you're going to be able to increase capital there and maybe investor demand for those types of facilities?
James Williamson: Yes, Brian, this is Jim Williamson. Yes, Mt. Logan has had a pretty solid year from a capital raising standpoint, particularly against the backdrop of a lot of the big ILS allocators sort of being on the sidelines this year. We've raised over $250 million, AUM sits just under $1.1 billion. So feeling very good about that. The team at Mt. Logan has done a terrific job of building a pipeline of what we view as sort of world-leading allocators, being the really smart, long-term money, the sovereign wealth funds, the pensions, et cetera. And we do expect some incremental capital raising at 1/1 and throughout the course of next year. I will say, as a general comment, I've had a number of discussions recently with some large pension fund allocators, the challenge they still have is they've seen a lot of deterioration in other parts of their portfolio, which tends to bump them up against their ILS risk limits. And that is easing a little bit, but it's still a factor. And so I think -- which, by the way, we view as a good guy, it helps sustain momentum in our underlying market, which is our critical priority. But my guess is that we'll have some nice successes in 2024.
Brian Meredith: Great. Thank you. I appreciate it.
James Williamson: Got it.
Operator: The last question for today is a follow-up from Mike Ward with Citi. Please go ahead.
Michael Ward: Hey, guys. Thanks. I was just wanted to follow-up on the Otis and Acapulco. Is there any quantification on the potential industry exposure -- I know it's early.
Juan Andrade: No, Mike, this is Juan. I think it's so early. I mean, this thing just made landfall really yesterday at this point in time. And for us, as I said, this is a modest exposure based on how we have managed the portfolio to reduce the volatility. But I think it's way too early. We haven't seen anything yet from any of the modeling agencies at this point in time.
Michael Ward: Okay. Thanks so much guys.
Juan Andrade: Thanks, Mike.
Operator: That was the last question.
Juan Andrade: Okay. Well, thank you all for your questions and for the excellent discussion. We had an excellent quarter, and I look forward to discussing the company's strategic plan at our Investor Day on November 14. I hope to see you all then. Thank you.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

Matthew Rohrmann: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Everest Group Limited Second Quarter of 2023 Earnings Conference Call. The Everest executives leading today’s call are Juan Andrade, President and CEO; and Mark Kociancic, Executive Vice President and CFO. We are also joined by other members of the Everest management team. Before we begin, I will preface the comments on today’s call by noting that Everest SEC filings, including extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. Management comments regarding estimates, projections and similar are subject to the risks, uncertainties and assumptions as noted in these filings. Management may also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These items are reconciled in our earnings release and financial supplement. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Juan.
Juan Andrade: Thank you, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Everest second quarter performance was outstanding. We grew the business at significantly expanded margins, taking full advantage of the hard reinsurance market and delivered industry-leading returns, including a near 22% operating return on equity and a record annualized 25% total shareholder return. We have strong momentum across the board. Capitalizing on the hard market opportunity in reinsurance, which continues globally, and both underwriting businesses continue to benefit from the global flight to quality amidst excellent and persistent market conditions. In addition, our superb execution drove strong results in the June and July reinsurance renewals. We continue to invest in our primary insurance business, which is also benefiting from similar tailwinds with favorable pricing across a number of business lines. In May, we completed our successful $1.5 billion equity base. The response from the market was excellent and validates the opportunity we see before us. We remain proactive and nimble with our capital deployment, and we are on track to fully deploy the capital raised by the January 1, 2024 renewal. We changed our official company name and stock ticker symbol during the quarter. This was another key milestone. Our updated Everest Group name with our newly branded ticker symbol, EG, is a testament about our hybrid strategy and steadfast commitment to global reinsurance and insurance. As we approach the back half of the year, our talent, underwriting discipline, and capital position give us significant firepower to achieve our objectives and drive superior returns. With that, I’ll turn to our second quarter financial highlights, beginning at the group level. All of our group key financial metrics improved and included quarterly records for both operating income and total shareholder return. Growth was broad and diversified. We continue to see excellent opportunities for further expansion across our portfolio. We grew gross written premiums by 22% year-over-year in constant dollars, led by exceptional reinsurance growth, which hit a new written premium record. Net operating income increased to an all-time high of $627 million, up more than 62% year-over-year. This was supported by underwriting profits in excess of $400 million. The group combined ratio improved 410 basis points year-over-year to 87.7%. This is an excellent result, especially considering this is projected to be the worst second quarter for U.S. catastrophe losses since 2011. Everest net catastrophe loss was just $27.2 million. Additionally, our investment portfolio performed well, producing $357 million in net investment income, a significant improvement from the prior year. Turning now to our reinsurance business. Second quarter reinsurance results were also excellent. They are a product of our lead market position, breadth of offering and outstanding execution by our team. We grew our portfolio and we expanded margins. The Property Cat pricing remained strong, and the 2023 hard market has now surpassed the post-hurricane Andrew market. This provided the backdrop for excellent mid-year renewals. June 1 renewal, centered on the Florida market, was very strong with prospective returns exceeding the January 1st renewal. This momentum persisted into the July 1 renewals. Pricing was up sharply in key markets around the world. For example, the Australian market underwent a complete restructuring, moving away from frequency covers to true catastrophe structures. Everest is the preferred market by many of our customers. And as I noted earlier, we continue to benefit from a flight to quality around the globe. We were able to deploy additional capacity to many of our core clients at attractive returns. Gross premiums for the quarter were up 27% over the second quarter of 2022 on a constant dollar basis, $2.8 billion. As I noted earlier, this is a record for the division. Growth was widespread across business lines and geographies. Property Cat premiums were up 30% from last year. Along with casualty and property pro rata premiums at 16% and 35%, respectively. We also grew in specialty lines, including marine and aviation. International growth was strong, particularly in Asia, where we nimbly took share in dislocated markets like South Korea. Pretax catastrophe losses were modest despite the active cap order for the industry. Our deliberate initiatives to shape the portfolio and manage volatility continue to improve our results. We nearly doubled our underwriting profit to $337 million, equating to a combined ratio of 85.9%, a 5.9% improvement year-over-year. Approximately 90% of our portfolio now renewed in 2023 at significantly improved rates and terms, we enter the second half of the year well positioned and our outlook for the January 1, 2024 renewal is positive. Turning to insurance. We made strong progress in advancing our global insurance business. We grew the segment more than 14% in constant dollars, generating a record $1.4 billion in premiums. Growth was broad and diversified, both geographically and by product line, particularly strong in property, both domestically and international as well as in specialty lines like marine, aviation and energy. We maintained our disciplined approach to managing and diversifying the portfolio, reducing our exposure in lines where the market is not well priced, like monoline workers’ compensation and public company D&O. While it’s still early days, we are also gaining traction in international markets where we are methodically expanding our capabilities and local expertise. Market response has been excellent. Reinforcing the abundant global opportunity that we see. In aggregate, rate continues to exceed trend across our core portfolio. We achieved a double-digit rate increase, excluding workers’ compensation and financial lines. Group pricing was particularly noteworthy in property, marine and other specialty lines. The heart of reinsurance market contributed to positive pricing in the primary market. This, coupled with persistent industry cat losses and a heightened risk environment supports continued favorable pricing in insurance. Despite severe weather in the U.S., our cat losses were de minimis and reflect our consistent proactive portfolio management and our focus on superior risk-adjusted returns. The enhancements we have made to augment our technology and streamline our infrastructure are yielding greater efficiencies and connectivity across our platform. Everything from claims to distribution is being scaled methodically around client needs, allowing us to remain agile and responsive as we grow. I’m proud of Everest’s performance in the second quarter, and our team’s consistent ability to adapt and serve the needs of our clients and deliver leading returns to our shareholders. We have built a long and durable runway to profitably grow our hybrid platform, we’re approaching the market opportunity with full force. With that, I’ll turn it over to Mark to review the financials in more detail.
Mark Kociancic: Thank you, Juan, and good morning, everyone. Everest had a very strong quarter, rounding out a solid start to the first half of 2023. The company reported record operating income of $627 million or $15.21 per diluted share in the quarter, equating to an operating income ROE of 21.8%. Total shareholder return or TSR stands at 25.3% annualized. We improved our overall combined ratio by more than 400 basis points while generating double-digit growth in constant dollars in both segments as pricing and terms remain attractive in most lines of business around the world. Juan mentioned during May, we completed a successful $1.5 billion public equity offering in the quarter and are on schedule with the deployment of that capital. Company’s strong performance in the second quarter was led by our team’s high level of execution in our core markets, we have a number of tailwinds that are back throughout the remainder of the year and well into 2024. Looking at the group results for the second quarter of 2023, Everest reported gross written premium of $4.2 billion, representing 22.3% growth in constant dollars year-over-year. The combined ratio was 87.7%, which includes 80 basis points of losses or $27 million from natural catastrophes. Catastrophe losses in the quarter were partially offset by $30 million of catastrophe bond recoveries related to Hurricane Ian. The group attritional loss ratio was 59.4%, a 40 basis point improvement over the prior year’s quarter, led by the reinsurance segment, which I’ll discuss in more detail in just a moment. Group’s commission ratio improved 50 basis points to 21.1% on mix changes, while the group’s expense ratio was 6.3%, up modestly year-over-year as we continue to invest in our talent and systems within both franchises. Moving to the segment results and starting with reinsurance. Reinsurance gross premiums written grew 26.9% in constant dollars during the quarter. Strong growth came from the continued successful execution of our 2023 renewal strategy. We generated double-digit growth across every line of business. Combined ratio was 85.9%, which improved 600 basis points from the prior year. The attritional loss ratio improved 120 basis points to 57.6% as we continue to achieve more favorable rate and terms, which we expect to continue into 2024. The commission ratio was 24.5%, an improvement of 30 basis points from the prior year. The underwriting related expense ratio was 2.6%, which was essentially flat year-over-year. Moving to Insurance. Gross premiums written grew 14.1% in constant dollars to a quarterly premium volume record of $1.4 billion. Growth was primarily driven by property and specialty lines in the quarter as pricing gained additional momentum. Overall, pricing remains ahead of loss trend, as Juan mentioned. Combined ratio was 92.7%, up 120 basis points year-over-year. The division benefited from zero natural catastrophe losses in the quarter further demonstrating the success of our derisking actions on our portfolio. The attritional loss ratio was modestly higher this quarter at 64.4%, driven by business mix and one-off premium adjustments in our Lloyd’s syndicate. Commission ratio improved 100 basis points, largely driven by business mix as increased property writings earned through as well as increased volume of ceding commissions and decreased gross commissions across multiple lines. The underwriting related expense ratio was 16.5%, largely driven by certain one-off expenses and continued investment in global systems in our platform. We expect the expense ratio to diminish over the course of the year. And finally, to cover investments, tax in the balance sheet. Net investment income increased $131 million to $357 million for the quarter, driven primarily by higher new money yields, our investment in floating rate securities and higher assets under management. Alternative assets generated $59 million of net investment income, a sequential improvement as equity markets have continued to rebound. Overall, our book yield improved from 2.8% to 3.9% year-over-year and our reinvestment rate remains north of 5%. We continue to have a short asset duration of approximately 2.9 years. And as a reminder, the 22% of our fixed income investments are in floating rate securities. For the second quarter of 2023, our operating income tax rate was 11.5%, in line with our working assumption of 11% to 12% for the year. Shareholders’ equity ended the quarter at $10.9 billion or $12.5 billion, excluding unrealized depreciation and depreciation of securities. At the end of the quarter, unrealized losses in the fixed income portfolio equate to approximately $1.6 billion, an increase of $167 million as compared to the end of the first quarter resulting from increases in rates at the front end of the curve. Cash flow from operations was strong at approximately $1.1 billion during the quarter. Book value per share ended the quarter at $251.17, an improvement of 18.1% from year-end 2022 when adjusted for dividends of $3.30 per share year-to-date. Book value per share, excluding unrealized depreciation and depreciation of securities stood at $288.64 versus $259.18 per share at year-end 2022, representing an increase of approximately 11.4%. Net leverage at quarter-end stood at 19.1% modestly lower on a sequential and year-over-year basis. In conclusion, Everest had an excellent second quarter of 2023 and is well positioned heading into the back half of the year and 2024. With that, I’ll turn the call back over to Matt.
Matthew Rohrmann: Thanks, Mark. Operator, we are now ready to open the line for questions. We do ask that you please limit your questions to one question plus one follow up, then rejoin the queue for any additional questions.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question, I was hoping you could just walk us through your plans on putting the $1.5 billion of equity you guys raised to work. I know, Mark, you said you guys are on schedule deployment of the capital. Can you just give us a sense, expand upon that and give us a sense of the split that you see between property and casualty reinsurance writings as well as the expected ROE on the deployed capital.
Juan Andrade: Yes. Thanks, Elyse. This is Juan. So let me get started, and I’ll ask then Jim to join in and provide a lot more granularity to you on that topic. But as both Mark and I said in our prepared remarks, we’re very much on track to fully deploy the capital by the January 1, 2024 renewal. As you saw from the numbers, we drove meaningful growth not only in the quarter but also during the July 1 renewal. But in addition to the key renewal dates, and Jim will talk a little bit more about this in detail, we have also done a number of private or closely placed opportunities at excellent rates and terms that have also emerged outside of the renewal period. So we continue to see plenty of opportunity. We don’t see any change in the market, and we’re very much on track with the deployment. But now let me ask Jim to go a little bit deeper on that.
James Williamson: Sure. Thanks for the question, Elyse. And I’m going to be a little expansive here because I do think this is connected to a number of critical trends within the business. I mean, first, to take you back to a little bit of what we said on the last quarter’s call around how we expected this to play out, we sort of laid out, look, this capital deployment really begins with the 7/1 renewal, which is for us about $1 billion of expiring premium. It would continue through the end of 2023, where you’ve got about another $1 billion of premium. And then it would complete at the Jan 1 renewal, which, at this point, our expiring book will be somewhere on the order of $6 billion. And that proportionality would account for the capital deployment. And that’s playing out as we expected. In fact, I would add to that, that we did have some opportunities in a very targeted way outside of Florida, but at the 6/1 renewal to take meaningfully increased lines with some of our core cedents, which were very attractive. That continued into 7/1. We grew strongly at that renewal and we did it at excellent rate. In fact, if you look at the rate we printed for North America in the second quarter of [‘47], we actually exceeded that in many cases for the June and July renewals. So we feel really good about that. And then as Juan had indicated, we participated on a number of private or closely brokered placements, and there’s a variety of things in there, whether it’s a large layer on top of the Cat program for a global cedent down to fact placements to deal with sort of dislocated single risks and everything in between. And so we’re on our front feet that way and taking advantage of those opportunities as they come to us. And I would also add, obviously, I’m focusing here on property Cat, but we’ve also taken advantage of trends in casualty where we continue to grow in some of the specialty lines. And one example I would cite in the second quarter is our aviation book, which on the back of really incredible rate change was up over 50% year-over-year at again, terrific economics. And so as we’ve executed this, we’ve been focused on a number of key priorities. And before you even really talk about growth, it’s portfolio quality. And so all the things that we’ve mentioned in our last call continue to play out. Attachment points are going up. Our average attachment point is moving further out in the curve. And certainly, you saw proof of that in our second quarter Cat print, which was simply outstanding. You saw us adjust our portfolio in Florida. A number of the Demotech rated Florida specialists, frankly, did not pass our financial underwriting standards, and we moved away from them and redeploy the capital elsewhere. So we are nimble that way, and we’re as focused on portfolio quality as we are on top line, even more so. And the other thing I would say in terms of priorities is over 90% of the incremental capacity that we’ve deployed has been with our existing clients. These are people we know well and people who we play with across a wide variety of lines. And so that incremental Cat capacity not only is a tremendous opportunity in itself, it also further strengthens our core relationships. And so as you play all that forward to Jan 1, our expectation is that we’ll be confronted with just excellent prospective returns at the renewal. Why do we believe that? Pretty fundamental stuff. The first is that the supply-demand imbalance that’s been playing out in the reinsurance market hasn’t fundamentally changed. And we’ve certainly seen analysis that suggests there’s still a very meaningful gap between supply and demand. And I would posit to you that demand is pent-up and growing rapidly. And that’s because I think many scenes weren’t able to complete their queue. There are 1/1 placements the way they wanted to. They’re facing a risk environment that’s not getting any easier, climate change being at the front of that line, but also inflation, geopolitics and other factors. And then obviously, while we had a terrific second quarter in Cats, many primary underwriters did not. In fact, it’s a record level or near record level of second quarter Cat activity, particularly in the United States, but also in other markets around the world. So a really tough spot to be in as a primary underwriter and that’s increasing their demand for reinsurance. We’ve also seen no capital formation of any meaningful extent, obviously, putting our capital raise aside and I’ve heard of nothing meaningful in the pipeline that’s going to really change that. The other factor that I think is important is if you go back to 1/1, many of the panels that got put in place particularly for the global cedents, included a number of reinsurers that frankly, I think they’d rather not be trading with very extensively. And as Juan had mentioned in his opening remarks, there is a global flight to quality happening, and we think we’ll continue to benefit from that at 1/1, where we’ll have an opportunity to help our clients clean up those panels with a much higher quality underwriter. And then the last piece that I’ll cite, and I think it’s important, it’s a little harder to quantify or maybe impossible, but there’s an underwriter psychology component at play, which is there’s a reason this market hardened and it’s because underwriters have taken a number of years of Cat losses. And I haven’t met anybody in this industry who because they may have some additional capital coming into 1/1 wants to trade down or auction down pricing in property Cat. That’s just – that is not the mentality that exists in our industry. So our expectation going into 1/1 is that we’re going to push hard for increased rates. We think the industry should be pushing hard for more given the experience we’ve had in all those external factors we talked about. We’re going to be looking to grow not just property Cat, which we will grow meaningfully, but casualty, specialty and a number of other areas. We are globally diversified, so we can drive growth in multiple regions. We’re also diversified by line, so we can grow Cat, non-Cat property specialty, you name it. And we fully expect that we will complete the deployment of the incremental capital at the 1/1 renewal at outstanding terms. So hopefully, that gives you the color you’re looking for.
Mark Kociancic: Elyse, it’s Mark. I just want to add a few points to Jim’s comments and once we get some of the specifics you were asking earlier, we still see greater than 90% of this capital raise deployment this year going into the reinsurance division. That’s the lion’s share. That’s where we have a very strong an exceptionally strong franchise and underlying fundamentals that Jim just walked through that really gives us the confidence, especially coming out of the 7/1s, our conviction just couldn’t be stronger at that capital raise will be put to good use. I do expect the property casualty mix to swing a bit more single digits into favor with property lines or property premium moving forwards. And I think you’re seeing some of that evolution in our financial supplement. And again, the ROE on that incremental $1.5 billion of capital is something we feel confident in exceeding our Q1 operating ROE going forwards.
Elyse Greenspan: That’s helpful, and thanks for the all the color. My follow-up, we’ve been – there’s been headlines on surrounding collateralized casualty reinsurance. And I was wondering if you guys are seeing cedents looking to replace covers with high-quality reinsurers like yourselves? Or if this is something that you’re expecting we could start to see play out in the market?
James Williamson: Yes. Elyse, this is Jim again. Yes, we – look, we are definitely hearing a lot of chatter around the topic, particularly given some recent events, and you’ve seen some dislocation in a variety of parts, particularly in the fronting market. And look, what I would say to that is obviously, we’re opportunistic. We have the flexibility if there’s an interesting opportunity that emerges, that gives us an opportunity to earn great returns. We certainly take it. But our priority remains building franchise positions with the best global underwriters over time. And that means that’s where our focus is, and we don’t get distracted by some of the noise that might exist around a particular opportunity even though we are ready to lean into it, should those opportunities come our way.
Elyse Greenspan: Thank you.
Juan Andrade: Thanks, Elyse.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Yaron Kinar with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Yaron Kinar: Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Maybe a follow-up on the last line of questions. We did hear some commentary yesterday from a couple of your competitors, one thing that they believe that property Cat rates were now adequate for the industry. And I noticed, Jim, in your response, you said that you’re still looking to push a lot of rate in 1/1. So I guess I’d be interested to hear your views on how adequate pricing or rates are today? Or if it’s just a matter of really just keeping up with loss trends going forward? And then the other comment we heard yesterday was a preference by one of your competitors to really deploy capital and property more into insurance than reinsurance. And clearly, we’re hearing a different tone from you. So I would love to hear how you’re thinking about the two from that perspective.
Juan Andrade: Yes, Yaron, this is Juan. So let me go ahead and get started with that. Look, I think from our perspective, we obviously like the returns that we’re getting in property Cat but in general as well. And I fundamentally agree with what Jim said. We will keep pushing for rate terms and structure as we really haven’t seen any fundamental changes in the external environment. I think you’ve seen some of the headline news this morning with one of our competitors reporting that in the first half of the year, Cats were over the 10-year average at over $40 billion. So there’s still an active Cat environment. That hasn’t changed. We also see the general risk environment continue to be very elevated. You’ve got geopolitical issues, you’ve got social inflation, you’ve got all these other things that are out there, that hasn’t changed. And then you also have inflation that comes into the equation, right? There’s an impact on cost of materials, et cetera. So this is why from our perspective, we don’t see a change in the market. And therefore, we’re going to continue to push price, rate, terms and structure. So from my perspective, that is how we think about it. To your second question on insurance and reinsurance and property Cat deployment, we do like the property Cat environment right now in reinsurance. But as you saw in our insurance numbers, we also grew property and insurance by 37% as we reported in the supplement. So we’re leaning into it as well. And frankly, that’s one of the advantages that we have in our hybrid models. We can take advantage of the best risk-adjusted opportunities and move capital pretty nimbly to that. But let me have Jim also add some color on this.
James Williamson: Yes, Yaron, thanks for the question. And maybe at the risk of repeating a little bit of what Juan said, but I do think it’s a critical point. The fact is, whether we like it or not, we live in a cyclical industry. And we’ve come through a period of a number of years where Cat pricing wasn’t where it needed to be. Losses were elevated and that hurt a lot of underwriting companies and losses piled up. And so my view is we’re not sitting here saying, "Okay, we’re going to take rate change until we hit adequacy, declare victory and then just sit there." I mean that’s not how we’re going to run this business. We want to be earning excellent returns. And you’ve heard me consistently say, starting with the 1/1 renewal in particular, but really even going back to 7/1 of 2022, prospective return profiles are excellent. That does not mean we’re going to sit idly and just accept that. We want to continue to push. It is an elevated risk environment. There is inflation. There is geopolitical challenge. Cat is inherently volatile, and we think reinsurers deserve to get paid for that, and we’re going to continue to push for it.
Michael Karmilowicz: And Yaron, this is Mike Karmilowicz. I would just add on the insurance side to the point that Juan made earlier, take into consideration the last couple of years, what we’ve done to really basically go through our portfolio strategy, not just on volatility of muting that, but actually looking specifically at how we can actually take our concentration, derisk that across not just the U.S. but also the opportunity across the globe. So we basically have lowered our gross limits over the last two years by over 41%. In addition to that, lowered our PMLs, premium to PML ratio is dramatically the 1 in 100 to take that into consideration of what’s given us the opportunity and the capacity to the point Jim just said, we’re leaning in very heavy seeing very meaningful returns with average rate increases of over 30% when you add an exposure change you’re talking premium change of over 40%. So we think the market is really robust. We see really good opportunity not just domestically, but internationally with a really good strategy to derisk and keep our concentration limited in a lot of pockets in both peak and non-peak areas, which I think just bodes well for us going into ‘23 and ‘24.
Yaron Kinar: Thanks for a very comprehensive answer. And then maybe if we continue with you, Mike, and I apologize for nitpicking here on a very good quarter. But one thing that did stand out was the 170 basis point deterioration in the underlying loss ratio in insurance. I know Mark called out some premium adjustments and mix shift. But could you maybe give us a little more color there and quantify some of the EBIT changes?
Mark Kociancic: Yaron, it’s Mark. Maybe I can start. So a couple of components. Like I said in my scripted remarks, the premium adjustments were – they were a reasonable size. You’re talking $5 million, $6 million lion’s share coming out of the Lloyd’s syndicate. So that’s flowing through earned premium and altering the ratios mechanically, unfortunate situation, but definitely, we would consider it to be one-off in nature. And then you’ve got a mix of business component. We do see property becoming a much more substantial portion of the earned premium moving forward, so that’s going to help to change the composition of the attritional loss ratio within the combined ratio and you’ll also see, I think, A&H subside in terms of the size of its contribution to the combined ratio and the dynamics it brings in terms of expected loss ratio and expense within there. So this is something that should mechanically move towards a lower attritional loss ratio moving forward.
Juan Andrade: And what I would emphasize, too, Yaron, this is one is, as Mark was saying, the uptick was really from one-time and non-recurring adjustments. And just to emphasize his last point is, as we continue to write more property at excellent prices and you heard the numbers being quoted by Mike, and as we write, frankly, more specialty products, too, which we also – we saw the growth in other specialty in the quarter of over 39% like aviation and marine, energy, et cetera, all of that is going to have a very positive impact on the loss ratios it earns in during subsequent quarters.
Yaron Kinar: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Michael Ward with Citi. Please go ahead.
Michael Ward: Thanks, guys. Good morning. Maybe a somewhat similar question, but for reinsurance. Just curious if you could talk about the pace of underlying margin improvement from here?
James Williamson: Yes, Mike, it’s Jim Williamson. Thanks for the question. Look, I’d say if you look at the improvement in the current quarter, that’s really driven by two factors. One, we have selected a lower current accident year attritional loss ratio for our Cat portfolio based mostly on our experience. So just in prior years, we’ve outperformed that pick. And so we reduced it. Obviously, I expect a tailwind from all the rate we’re getting to continue to improve that pick over time. So that would be a factor. And then the second factor is really the beginning of a mix shift toward property from casualty, not because we are not growing casualty, you saw we continue to do that in Q2 at a slightly lower rate, but that property growth has picked up and we’ll continue to earn through the portfolio. So all those tailwinds that I described will continue. In particular, you’re really just really at the beginning of earning through all of these positive impacts. So really positive that way. And I know you’re talking loss ratio, but while we’re talking margin, the other tailwind I would describe is around commission. You did see a little bit of commission improvement in the quarter, which obviously a good thing, which we welcome. That was driven almost entirely by mix. So that’s a mix shift toward property and this property mix on the earned premium side increases, that will continue. The piece that you’re really not even seeing yet, but you will see is the fact that casualty seating commissions have been coming down. We’ve seen that pretty consistently starting with 1/1, and it’s really just beginning to earn into the portfolio. So a tailwind there. So the bottom line is, we expect some really good trends in terms of total margin.
Michael Ward: Thanks. Really helpful. And then so I guess, net investment income was pretty strong, including ops for the quarter. Just wondering if you have any outlook for the second half of the year.
Mark Kociancic: Mike, it’s Mark. So a couple of points to make here. I’ll split it between the interest income component and then the ops performance. I think the interest income has got very good momentum. We’ve taken advantage of structuring our portfolio taking into account the short end of the yield curve. And so you’re seeing those floating rate securities that we speak about frequently, really pay off in terms of the resets and the higher yield that is generated from those securities. So I see a strong tailwind there. You’re seeing our book yield rise year-over-year. We’re clearly investing well north of a 5% new money rate on a global basis. And the AUM, I think, is churning north even beyond the equity raise contribution. We’re getting some nice pickup on that. So feel very good. I think the credit quality of the portfolio is quite strong. We’re really at the north end of an A+ average credit quality on the fixed income portfolio bordering a AA-, but – so that’s important as we contemplate credit adequacy in the portfolio. And the op performance is something we’re very pleased with. It’s difficult to forecast, but we’ve got a broadly diversified set of investments there on the private equity side for the most part. And that is expected to give us a nice stable – relatively stable distribution given the diversification of over 200 limited partnerships. Now it’s somewhat cyclical in terms of how that contribution comes in, but generally correlates well with where the S&P 500 is coming in over time. I don’t think you’re seeing any kind of one-off type contribution in the quarterly performance for Q2, but rather you’re seeing a broad-based support from the ops in the income.
Michael Ward: Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from C. Gregory Peters with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Gregory Peters: Hey. Good morning, everyone. I guess I had one macro question and then one more detailed question. On a macro basis, can you just speak and I know you’ve spoken, talked about the hard property market. Can you talk about your perspectives on the facultative portion of the market versus the treaty portion of the market. I really don’t hear a lot of commentary, but I believe you’re pretty active in the facultative side, too.
Juan Andrade: Yes, Greg, this is Juan Andrade. Look, facultative has seen some very strong growth as well. And it’s frankly for the same reasons that we’ve been talking about, right? Basically, cedents are looking for opportunities to upload, if you will, some of the risk that does necessarily fit into their treaty structure. So from our perspective, our global fac book right now is also growing pretty significantly. We feel very good about that as well. But Jim, maybe you can add some specific color.
James Williamson: Yes, Greg, thanks for the question. I think it’s an astute one because as we mentioned, it’s a tough environment for our cedents and they’re looking to manage risk. And if their treaty attachments have gone up, they’re looking at their pre-risk exposures and their concerns. So they turn to the fac market. We grew our fac portfolio in the second quarter by almost 40%. Based on those trends, with a real emphasis on property as well as some segments of casualty and specialty lines. What I would add to that is very similar to what you’ll hear us say about our insurance property business. The same factors are playing out in facultative in terms of our approach to underwriting. We’re controlling limits deployed, so keeping limits very tight, focused on quality risk selection and ensuring that we’re getting paid extremely well for the risks we’re taking. And I would say, similar again to primary insurance market. The fac rate taking has really accelerated steeply, particularly as our competitors are dealing with their own reinsurance costs. So we view it as a nice opportunity.
Gregory Peters: Makes sense. I wanted to pivot to the insurance operations as my second and follow-up question. When I look at some of the lines of business, accident, health maybe not so much, but specialty casualty, professional liability, workers’ comp. We’re observing other primary companies report some volatility around prior year development and really not seeing that out of you guys. So maybe you could spend a minute and just update us on sort of the give and takes out of some of the older accident years inside your book and how the reserves are developing?
Mark Kociancic: Yes. So Greg, it’s Mark here. A few points to make. Look, the social inflation and the pressure that you’re seeing in the industry from ‘16 to ‘19 is real. That’s something that comes through in the reserve studies. A few points about our portfolio. Last year, we had pluses and minuses in our insurance reserves. We had very modest movements, I’d say, in those specific years for longer tail lines, the casualty lines. And we also had positive offsets coming from some shorter tail lines, workers’ comp as well, et cetera. And so one of the points to make here is that we do have a broad-based portfolio that allows for pluses and minuses over the course of time. We also benefit from a couple of things. I think we’ve – since 2020 when Juan started, I’d say the prudency of our loss picks has been quite good. We try to be conservative, particularly on the longer tail lines, and we want to hold those picks until we have quite a bit of certainty. And so that conservatism, I think, is helpful when you’ve got this level of uncertainty in the marketplace. And then I think the proportion of the business that we wrote in 2020, 2021 and onwards, particularly in insurance, is significantly larger than the set of reserves that we have for, say, ‘16 to ‘19. So the kind of relative scale is really quite meaningful. And one of the reasons that’s important is you really saw rate take off pretty much, I would say, it probably started more Q4 2019 and has been compounding throughout those quarters since that time. And so that, I think, helps the equation. And then overall, we’re obviously vigilant in how we track rate versus loss trends and the margin there in over time, and we make adjustments as needed in the ELRs, in the reserves and so forth. And so that’s what gets us comfortable with where we are.
Gregory Peters: Fair enough. Thanks for the answers.
Juan Andrade: Thanks, Greg.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Michael Zaremski with BMO. Please go ahead.
Michael Zaremski: Hey, guys, good morning. Thanks. Maybe touching on that subject. We see, I think, in your numbers on the paid to incurred levels ex Cat and PYD that they’re creeping up a bit, but still well below I guess, pre-pandemic ratios. So are you kind of broadly seeing? I know there’s – it might be tough to paint a broad brush. But are you seeing a bit of a inching up in loss cost inflation, maybe ex property Cat again that’s a different discussion.
Mark Kociancic: Yes, that Mike, it’s Mark again here. That’s definitely a concern, a trend. You have different levels of inflation. So whether it’s obviously, the social inflation, I think, is well understood. Then you’ve got excess, what I would call, excess inflation driven by CPI or certain segments, medical loss inflation, wage inflation, depending on which lines all of this pertains to. And so those are things that we monitor. Clearly, there’s an elevated risk environment as we’ve seen some of these increase, in other words, more moderately. So it’s something we take into account with loss picks setting and the monitoring of rate adequacy. But again, I would reiterate the excess of rate versus loss trend.
Juan Andrade: Yes. Let me jump in there, Mike. This is Juan because I think that’s a very interesting point. And to build on what I said in my prepared remarks at the beginning of this call, we are ahead of trend in a very comfortable way, right? So for instance, our insurance rate level when you take out comp and financial lines, which are really not core to us right now, we increased rate by over 12%. And loss trend for us in insurance on an aggregate basis is significantly lower than that. And then you can leverage on exposure on top of that. And that gives you a pretty good level of comfort on how far ahead of that we are, which basically means you’re building margins. So obviously, we look at loss trends on a very frequent basis, as I’ve mentioned on other calls in the past. We keep very close track of it. But we are comfortably ahead of trend right now with rate and then you add exposure on that, that gives you another buffer.
Michael Zaremski: Got it. I guess we’ve – I think most investors feel comfortable that what you’re saying is happening. It’s just we’re not yet really seeing much reserve releases from Everest, which that’s not a knock, just so it’s sometimes tough triangulating some of the math. I’m just curious on the pricing environment also kind of excluding property Cat. We’re seeing some conflicting data points like the Marsh McLennan commercial pricing index was kind of flattish sequentially quarter-over-quarter, although, on the other hand, some of the carriers – larger carriers especially have seen a bit of an acceleration broadly for your portfolio, maybe even more on the pro rata side. Are you – is pricing changing much sequentially?
Juan Andrade: Let me start, Mike, this is Juan, and then I’ll have Jim and Mike Karmilowicz to add a little bit of color. If I’m not mistaken, I think the Marsh numbers are global numbers. And so you are going to have variations in those numbers from Latin America, Asia, Europe, et cetera, et cetera. The rate environment that we continue to see is actually quite good. And as I just said a couple of minutes ago, we have seen sequential improvement in pricing in primary insurance and certainly on the reinsurance side of things. So that is the environment that we’re living in right now and that we’re seeing as we trade on a daily basis. But Jim can give you some color on the pro rata’s and then Karm can give you some more color on the primary side.
James Williamson: Yes, Mike, it’s Jim. So look, I think in the conversations we’re having with our cedents and the analysis we’re doing at renewals, I think fundamentally, as Juan had indicated, the key trend is that rate is moving in the direction it needs to keep up with loss cost and hold loss ratios in place on that front. And what I would just caution in terms of looking at industry indices as a measure of this is portfolio mix really does matter. And if you look at, in particular, some of the areas of the "casualty market" that are under pressure and are not experiencing some of the reacceleration that Juan discussed, things like D&O, or workers’ comp where we have very little exposure. And so that can move an index. But what we’re focused on, obviously, is our own portfolio, and we continue to feel good about where those metrics are heading.
Michael Karmilowicz: Yes. And as far from the primary insurance group, I focus on a couple of things. We always stress the importance of cycle management. So when you talk about D&O, which we’ve been talking about for the last year as well as workers’ comp. You’ve seen that as an example, workers’ comp go from what was 27% years ago, now down to on the monoline guaranteed cost down to 4%. And then when you see opportunity where we’re really leaning in besides the property side, the first party, aviation, marine, things that really actually we know we can drive rate to terms and really take advantage of the marketplace. So I think based on Juan’s comments about what we’re seeing not just with rate in itself and the exposure change, I think we see the benefit and we see opportunity, particularly in the foreseeable future.
Michael Zaremski: That’s helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS. Please go ahead.
Brian Meredith: Yes, thanks. A couple of here for you. First one, Jim, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about some of the private transactions top-up deals that you did in the quarter. And are those continuing? And maybe you can kind of give us a sense of if they’re not continuing kind of how that would have benefited your growth. I just don’t want to make sure I’m not for my forward estimates, assuming those are continuing. Maybe they are, I don’t know.
Juan Andrade: Sure thing, Brian. Jim?
James Williamson: Yes. Thanks, Brian. Yes, look, we’re seeing a variety of types. So to the first part of your question, one of the biggest features, and I think one that points to this pent-up demand for capacity issue is a number of our large global clients have come out into the market either in a closely brokered or in some cases, a private placement situation looking to top up their existing Cat programs. And I think the reality is they would have liked to have bought those top-ups at 1/1. I think they were advised and probably appropriately so by their brokers that wasn’t the time to get that – try to get that done. And so they waited. We started seeing it really at 4/1 right around that time, and it’s continued and it’s been nice activity. And then at the other end of the spectrum, as I had mentioned earlier, some of this is we have a variety of partners coming to us with even large facultative placements, smaller treaties, et cetera, where they just want to deal with per risk exposures and peak zones and get a little more creative and on how they manage their total risk profile, but still keep the economics acceptable. And so it’s continuing. I would say, though, look, the reality is the bulk of this market, particularly in North America, is an open broker market. The big renewals are driving the bulk of all the results that we’re reporting. I would just view these other transactions is a nice tailwind. I think they’re also more importantly a key indication of what we expect to have happen in the future in terms of supply and demand. And so they’re extremely useful that way.
Juan Andrade: Right. I would – this is Juan. I would amplify that last point that Jim made because this is exactly what we have been saying all along, right? What this really illustrates is the fact that the fundamental macro environment that we’re all operating in has not changed, right? You still have high Cat activity. You have a heightened risk environment and our cedents are looking to also manage earnings volatility. And so therefore, they’re still coming to market to try to figure out a way to do that, while at the same time, they’re also trying to attack the property market on the primary side at the same side. So look, all of these are signs, and I think Jim is exactly right that the demand is still absolutely there and they want to trade with carriers like us, right, highly rated, great quality, et cetera.
Brian Meredith: Great. That’s really helpful. And then the second question, I’m wondering if you could talk a little bit about kind of where we are in the international build-out on the insurance business. So looking at operating expense growth is up 20%, call it, a little over 20% year-over-year. Should that continue here for the foreseeable future, just big year-over-year increases as you continue to build that out? And kind of where are we in the process?
Juan Andrade: Yes. Thank you, Brian. Look, I think for us, it’s still early days. We really began a very methodical build-out of this strategy really at the beginning of last year. We are now essentially in France, in Germany, in Spain, in Chile, in Singapore and in Australia at this point in time with a couple of other markets coming online later this year. We’re really very excited about the opportunities that we see. And frankly, the market reaction has been phenomenal. I’ve traveled the world over the last two years, as I normally do, meeting with our brokers, our people, our clients, et cetera. And frankly, the reception has been terrific. They love the fact that we have the A+ paper. They like the name of the company. They like the people that they’re trading with because they know us. And so from that perspective, the opportunity set has been there. Part of that methodical build-out has been the systems, the target operating model, the people, the underwriters, et cetera, et cetera. And so all of this is really, frankly, within our expectations. When we think about particularly the expense comment that you’re making. But we do see that beginning to trend down over time, I think as Mark had indicated in last quarter’s call. And we’re doing this in a very disciplined way. We’re managing the expenses. We’re managing the build-out in a very careful way, but we’re very excited about what we’re seeing. And frankly, the reaction that we’ve had in each of these markets.
Brian Meredith: Thank you.
Juan Andrade: Thanks, Brian.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Meyer Shields with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Please go ahead.
Meyer Shields: Great. Thanks. One introductory question, I guess, Jim, you talked about being more cautious on some of the cedents in Florida. I was hoping you could update us on how you’re thinking about the reforms themselves holding up? In other words, how comfortable you are with the Florida market as long as the individual companies are okay.
James Williamson: Yes, Meyer. Thanks for the question. Look, and I’ll kind of break that into two parts. First, would – I’ll tell you a little bit more about what we did and why and then get to the reforms. So, one of our most important, I think, underwriting screens when dealing with those Florida specialists, particularly the Demotech rated Florida specialist is our financial underwriting. And particularly given the stress these folks have been under over the last couple of years and the experience from last year, just a number of clients that we did business with in the past didn’t pass that screen. A little over 1/3 of our Demotech-rated clients didn’t pass that screen. And so we were just no longer able to support their programs. And so we ended up deploying less capacity to those folks. Now we we’re in a terrific market. So we simply reallocated it to both Florida and non-Florida opportunities. So I think, a really good trade for us overall. In terms of the reforms, look, we think they’re terrific reforms. We think the political class in Florida exercised a lot of fortitude, encouraged to tackle this problem head on. It was absolutely necessary. I think given the fraud and abuse that was happening in the state, it was heading to a place where you were going to have an insurance and reinsurance crisis. So we’re positive on the reforms, but we’re also – we’re folks that make decisions based on facts, and it’s not yet 100% clear how the reforms will play out in loss costs. I don’t expect the plaintiffs bar in that state to simply acquiesce to the reform. And so we need to see that play out. So as the results of the reform reveal themselves in actual loss activity if they show that loss costs are coming down, obviously, that would make us more favorable on the Florida market, all other things being equal. And if that’s not true, obviously, less so. The only other piece I would add to that, though, is the commitment we have to Florida, I think, is the right size. I don’t necessarily – not necessarily looking for signs to double down on the state either sort of irrespective of what happens.
Meyer Shields: Okay, perfect. That’s very helpful. Second question, and we talked a little bit about sort of broad concern about casualty loss trends. I was hoping you could update us on your appetite for loss portfolio – writing loss portfolio transfers and how you see demand there evolving?
James Williamson: Yes, Meyer, it’s Jim again. Look, it’s an area of the market where we’ve done a few transactions over time. It is really not something we focus on. It’s obviously highly competitive. And you’re typically competing with companies who do not carry the kind of rating and quality balance sheet that Everest has and so that changes their economics. We would rather build strong forward-looking franchises with the best global and local cedents across multiple lines and that’s where the bulk of our effort and focus is on. So I just don’t see that being a big piece of what we do going forward.
Meyer Shields: Okay. Fantastic. Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. I just had one follow-up on the insurance segment, right? You guys have laid out that 91% to 93% combined ratio target, right, with that financial plan a couple of years ago, obviously, the market is much better today. And I know there were some one-offs this quarter in the Q1 that impacted the reported results. But do you have a sense when given the market dynamics, when we could perhaps see that margin come in towards the lower end of the guided range?
Mark Kociancic: Yes. So Elyse, it’s Mark. Look, I think there’s some very good fundamentals that we have on the insurance side. You do have a little bit of noise coming from a few factors. So let me just develop this a little bit. So a few points to make. One, we’ve got a very solid top line premium. And you can see pretty good growth in property more expected. It’s not necessarily translating to the earned right now as some of that’s coming in from our international expansion. And so that’s going to be a driver. And that exacerbates the expenses a bit as we’re putting in some of the foundational pieces for the expansion. But that, no issue there. I think that’s more timing. The key thing is that the business that we’re writing internationally and domestically gives us very good confidence. And so from that standpoint, the mix changing, the expected margin, the growth overall is what I think is going to drive us to that lower end of the range. And I think to add to it even further is really the conscious de-risking that we’ve done on the Cat side for insurance. And so when you take a look at this quarter, for example, a zero print on the Cat loss and a pretty low number in Q1 and some of the tactical changes we’ve made and how we’re constructing our Cat appetite for insurance, that’s another meaningful driver of how we get there. And then maybe the last part, I think you can see this in all the commentary we give written and verbal the cycle management capabilities that we have in the insurance division are quite strong. You’ve got a fairly diversified set of lines of business that allow us to transition into higher-margin lines when the markets are favorable in that respect and minimize other areas that are less favorable. And so I think those pieces are really what’s going to get us to the lower portion of the 91%, 93%. And we’re still quite comfortable with that working assumption that we gave you on the IR Day two years ago.
Elyse Greenspan: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back to Juan and Mark for any closing remarks.
Juan Andrade: Great. Thank you for all the questions and the excellent discussion. And I’ll close this call by reiterating the confidence in our strategy and our team, frankly, the exceptional talent that’s driving our execution. We remain no offense and we remain disciplined and opportunistic in this hard market. We have an unwavering focus on creating sustained value for our stakeholders, and that is top of mind. I look forward to seeing all of you again to discuss our third quarter results. Thank you.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-05-02 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and welcome to the Everest Re Group First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call.  Please note today’s event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Matt Rohrmann, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Matt Rohrmann: Good morning, everyone and welcome to the Everest Re Group Limited first quarter of 2023 earnings conference call. The Everest executives leading today’s call are Juan Andrade, President and CEO; and Mark Kociancic, Executive Vice President and CFO. We are also joined by other members of the Everest management team. Before we begin, I will preface the comments on today’s call by noting that Everest SEC filings, including extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. Management comments regarding estimates, projections and similar are subject to the risks, uncertainties and assumptions as noted in these filings. Management may also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These items are reconciled in our earnings release and financial supplement. With that, I will turn the call over to Juan.
Juan Andrade: Thank you, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Everest started off strong in 2023, with significant growth, increased underwriting profits and operating ROE over 17% and total shareholder return in excess of 14%. We continue to diversify and expand our plan with both of our underwriting businesses delivering profitable broad-based growth. In reinsurance, our leadership position was abundantly clear in the ongoing hard market flight to quality. Our team’s consistent execution resulted in record gross written premiums and expanded margins. We continue to invest in scaling our primary business while remaining disciplined. We capitalized on the diversification of our portfolio and strong pricing environment. This led to stronger underwriting profits over last year. Everest is uniquely positioned to succeed in this market. We are bringing the full power of the Everest global franchise, together with underwriting discipline and the best talent in the business to drive sustainable returns. With that, I will turn to our first quarter financial highlights beginning at the group level. Group underwriting profit, net investment income, operating income and net income all increased meaningfully in the quarter. Growth was excellent and we continue to see great opportunities for continued expansion. We grew gross written premiums by almost 20% in constant dollars year-over-year, led by the reinsurance division, which achieved record quarterly premiums. Continued rate increases, exposure growth and strong underwriting discipline create margin expansion and keep us ahead of loss trend. We delivered $443 million in net operating income, up over 9% from prior year. The group combined ratio was 91.2%, a 40 basis point improvement from last year. It includes 3.7 points of catastrophe losses from the Turkey earthquake and the New Zealand floods and typhoon. We have no meaningful loss activity from the spring storms in the U.S. as our derisking efforts continue to manifest themselves in both our reinsurance and insurance results. We improved our attritional loss ratio 30 basis points year-over-year, reflecting pricing momentum and improving terms. Underwriting profits were $273 million, which are among the company’s highest orderly results over the past 5 years. Turning to investments, our high-quality portfolio produced net investment income of $260 million, a 7% improvement from prior year, driven by higher new money yields. Now turning to our reinsurance business. Reinsurance delivered an outstanding first quarter performance, with significant top and bottom line growth. We capitalized on our well-positioned and scalable reinsurance franchise, our leadership position, the heart of property cat market and our deep client and broker relationships, resulting in excellent outcomes for the portfolio at the January 1 and April 1 renewals. The precise and disciplined execution by our reinsurance team positioned Everest to succeed in this dynamic market. We targeted attractive opportunities to grow with trusted partners and materially improved risk-adjusted returns. Our practice of setting clear and consistent expectations early with clients and brokers led to significant improvements in pricing and terms and conditions across our portfolio, while building long-term relationship equity. That excess of loss pricing is excellent with risk-adjusted rate changes at January 1 of plus 50% in North America, and over 40% international. Casualty lines, average rate increases continue to exceed trend. Importantly, our team was distinguished as the preferred reinsurance market by being proactive and constructive with our customers. The value we created with our partners gives us a competitive advantage, helps us deepen our relationships and creates new opportunities. Our momentum continued at the April redo, where pricing remained strong, up 44% in North America and 26% in international. This builds on prior rate increases in 2022 with expected returns consistent with the levels we saw at January 1. We grew strategically, most notably in specialty lines, such as marine and aviation, with strong risk-adjusted returns. We expect to benefit from improvements in ceding commissions for the remainder of the year. We expect the strong market conditions to continue through 2023 and into 2024, and we remain on offense in this robust market. Reinsurance top line results were excellent, up 23% on a constant dollar basis, with $2.6 billion in gross written premiums. As I mentioned earlier, this is a quarterly record. Growth was broad-based by line and geography, up double digits across every business unit. Property cat premiums were up 28% from last year, along with casualty and property pro rata premiums at 22% and 19%, respectively. We delivered a 17% increase in underwriting profit to $207 million on a 90.8% combined ratio, a 60 basis point improvement from 2022. This included pre-tax catastrophe losses of $108 million, net of estimated recoveries and restatement premiums for the Turkey earthquakes and New Zealand floods and typhoon. Our deliberate efforts to optimize our portfolio and reduce cat volatility continue to improve our portfolio economics. Both the attritional loss ratio at 58% and the attritional combined ratio at 85.9% improved down 90 basis points and 30 basis points, respectively. Remember, many of the rate and margin improvements made at January 1 and April 1, will take several quarters to earn into our financial results. This should be a meaningful benefit for earned premium throughout the year. As we head into the upcoming renewals, our value proposition and relationships in the market have never been stronger. We will continue to bolster our global leadership position and maximize our portfolio’s performance. Now turning to insurance, where we delivered another solid performance in the first quarter. We achieved a 92.4% combined ratio in line with our previous assumption, resulting in an underwriting profit of $66 million, up 12% year-over-year. We continue to grow and develop our world-class talent, capabilities and value proposition to enhance our portfolio and increase average share of the global insurance market. We grew the insurance segment by nearly 12% in constant dollars, and generated over $1 billion in premiums for the eighth consecutive quarter. Growth was broad geographically driven by a diversified mix across property and specialty lines, particularly strong in marine, energy and construction. We remain cautious in certain lines, including monolines worker compensation and public company D&O. We also benefited from pricing improvements in the first quarter. We achieved an 8% rate increase, excluding workers’ compensation across the portfolio, led by property and excess liability with continued strong rate across other lines. This is the second sequential quarter with an increase in the overall level of rate changes achieved. We expect the hard market in reinsurance to put upward pressure on primary insurance pricing. This dynamic should extend the favorable pricing environment and insurance for the foreseeable future and will also benefit our pro rata business in the reinsurance segment. Despite severe weather in the U.S. in the quarter, our cat losses were immaterial at $2 million. The overall cat result reflects our disciplined portfolio management actions to reduce volatility over the last several years across the company. The attritional loss ratio was 64.2 up modestly year-over-year, primarily due to a current accident year adjustment to a single medical stop-loss program, which we non-renewed. Mark will provide more detail on this in a few minutes. Throughout the first quarter, we continued to prudently manage the business, balancing investments in our people and infrastructure as we build the company for the future. We are streamlining and scaling our operations to serve the market with greater efficiency, connectivity and agility as we grow. We are well positioned to seize attractive opportunities in this environment. We are expanding our breadth of innovative products and advancing our leadership across the global P&C market anchored by our underwriting discipline. Our sites are set firmly on shareholders, clients and colleagues as we take full advantage of the robust opportunities in this market. With that, I will turn it over to Mark to review the financials in more detail.
Mark Kociancic: Thank you, Juan and good morning everyone. As Juan mentioned, Everest had a strong start to the year. The company reported operating income of $443 million or $11.31 per diluted share in the quarter. The operating ROE was 17.2% for the quarter, while total shareholder return, or TSR, stands at 14.1% year-to-date. We improved our overall attritional loss ratio while generating double-digit growth in constant dollars in both segments as pricing and terms remain attractive in a number of lines – business around the globe. The company’s strong performance in the first quarter was led by our team’s high level of execution in our core markets, and we have a number of tailwinds that are back throughout the remainder of the year. Looking at the group results for the first quarter of 2023, Everest reported gross written premium of $3.7 billion, representing 17.5% growth year-over-year or 19.5% growth in constant dollars. The combined ratio was 91.2%, which includes 3.7 points of losses from natural catastrophes. Group attritional loss ratio was 59.7%, a 30 basis point improvement over the prior year’s quarter, led by the reinsurance segment, which I’ll discuss in more detail in just a moment. The group’s commission ratio improved 40 basis points to 21.3% on mix changes, while the group expense ratio was 6.4%, up modestly year-over-year as we continue to invest in our talent within both franchises. Moving to the segment results and starting with reinsurance. The reinsurance gross premiums written grew 23.2% in constant dollars during the quarter. The strong growth came from the successful execution of our 1/1 renewal strategy. A significant amount of the premium growth came from property and casualty pro rata treaties, which will earn in more gradually in excess of loss treaties over the coming quarters. As Juan said, this will be beneficial to earn premium for the rest of the year. We generated double-digit growth in all three of our operating divisions, North America, International and Global Fac. The combined ratio was 90.8%, which includes 5 points related to the Turkish earthquake and New Zealand floods, as Juan noted earlier. Despite these events, our loss experience came in lower than our planned cat mode. The attritional loss ratio improved 90 basis points to 58% as we continue to achieve more favorable rate in terms as well as shifting the book towards accounts with better risk-adjusted margin potential. The commission ratio was 25%, broadly in line with last year. The underwriting related expense ratio was 2.8%, modestly higher year-over-year, largely driven by the timing of certain expenses. We remain focused on operational efficiency across the entire company. Moving to Insurance. Gross premiums written grew 11.5% in constant dollars to $1.1 billion, which is impacted by the seasonality and tends to be our lowest quarterly production. Growth was primarily driven by property and specialty lines in the quarter as pricing gained additional momentum from the fourth quarter and remains well ahead of loss trend. The combined ratio was 92.4%, up 50 basis points year-over-year. The attritional loss ratio was higher this quarter at 64.2% as we took a onetime increase in the current accident year on our medical stop-loss business of $15 million. A portion of our medical stop-loss portfolio saw an increase in large loss activity. We isolated the poor claim performance to a single block of business, took decisive action and nonrenewed it. Best of the medical stop-loss book is performing within expectations. When assessing any book of business, we want to make sure we are as proactive as possible at triangulating and mitigating any losses as soon as possible. Commission ratio improved 70 basis points, largely driven by business mix. The underwriting-related expense ratio was 15.9%, which is within our expectations as we continue to expand our global footprint and continue to proactively invest in a number of growth initiatives across the business. We expect to achieve a mid-15% insurance expense ratio by year-end 2023. And we also reaffirmed the 91% and 93% combined ratio assumption for insurance. And finally, to cover investments, tax and the balance sheet. Net investment income for the quarter was $260 million, with interest income coming in at $264 million, alternative assets at $7 million before expenses of $12 million. We continue to see the benefit of higher new money yields in the fixed income portfolio, while alternative returns should pick up in coming quarters, assuming the broader market remains positive. Overall, our book yield improved from 2.5% to 3.8% year-over-year, and our reinvestment rate remains well north of 5%. We continue to have a short asset duration of approximately 3 years. And as a reminder, approximately 20% of our fixed income investments are in floating rate securities. For the first quarter of 2023, our operating income tax rate was 9.2%, benefiting from the geographic distribution of our income streams and thus favorable to our working assumption of 11% to 12% for the year. Shareholders’ equity ended the quarter at $9 billion or $10.5 billion, excluding unrealized depreciation and depreciation of securities. At the end of the quarter, unrealized losses in the fixed income portfolio equate to approximately $1.5 billion, $250 million lower as compared to year-end 2022. Cash flow from operations were strong at just under $1.1 billion during the quarter. Book value per share ended the quarter at $229.49, a sequential improvement of 7.2% adjusted for dividends of $1.65 per share. Book value per share, excluding unrealized depreciation and depreciation of securities stood at $266.64 versus $259.18 per share at the end of 2022, representing an annualized increase of approximately 3%. Net leverage at quarter end stood at 22.2%, modestly lower on a sequential basis. In conclusion, Everest ended the first quarter of 2023 in a strong position, with good momentum heading into the upcoming quarters, we continue to see good opportunities to invest in the platform and scalability of our company. That summarizes our first quarter results. And with that, I’ll turn the call back over to Matt.
Matt Rohrmann: Thanks Mark. Operator, we are now ready to open the line for questions. 
Operator: Thank you.  And today’s first question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question, starting with reinsurance. I appreciate the comments on the call, pointing to it taking time for some of these rate increases to earn in. Just hoping to get a little bit more color on just the cadence of this and how you expect like the strong rates you talked about at 1/1 as well as at 4/1 to earn into your margin, right? So how should that 58% underlying loss ratio that you saw within reinsurance trend over the balance of the year?
Juan Andrade: That’s great, Elyse. This is Juan Andrade. Good to hear from you. Let me kick it off in first of all, by saying our operating performance for the quarter was excellent. As I just talked about in my opening remarks, we had significant top line growth. We had underwriting profit, operating income and net income all up meaningfully quarter, generating a 17% operating ROE and a 14% TSR. And I mentioned all of this because we’re just getting started. And so directly to your question, it’s important to understand that the current environment, particularly in reinsurance, is providing us with meaningful margin expansion. We expect to grow rapidly in 2023 as our reinsurance franchise is very scalable. And our combined ratio should continue to improve on the strength of the rate and improved terms and conditions and mix of business. Now directly to your question, I think it’s also important to understand that the earned premium that we saw come through in the first quarter of the year was really mostly from the fourth quarter of 2022, which basically means that as this earns in into the second quarter, third quarter and fourth quarter, it’s going to be earning in at those much higher rate levels that we experienced at January 1 and that we are now experiencing at the April 1 renewals at the same time. So again, I think the timing of this is going to be over the next few quarters for the rest of the year, but I expect this to be very accretive and to have a positive impact on the portfolio. But let me ask Jim Williamson to maybe add a little bit of color just to give you some perspective, particularly on the 4/1.
Jim Williamson: Yes. Thanks for the question, Elyse. And I think to add some color to what Juan laid out, just want to give you a little more perspective on what we’re actually seeing under the covers, particularly starting with the Jan 1 renewal and then continuing. And a little bit of a view, if you don’t mind, on where we see this market going. As Juan indicated, we had excellent operating performance in Q1, the Jan renewal and really in the lead up to the January renewal which really translated into us having a broad set of opportunities. And when I say broad, I really mean just about every class of business starting clearly with prop cat, but also including casualty, specialty lines, financial lines really in every market around the world. And our growth was very broad-based that way, including our North America treaty business, our international treaty business as well as facultative. And so when you think about us attacking that, clearly, Jan 1 renewal we talked about a plus 50% in North America, plus 40% international on property cat. That continued into the April renewal where we were over 40% in North America, mid to upper 20s internationally, which included markets that started taking rate in 2022. So that was exceptional. At the same time and very important and Mark had touched on this in his opening remarks, we also saw terrific opportunities in both casualty and property pro rata. And so we took those opportunities. And I think our ability to constructively engage our clients and cedents gave us preferred positioning around those opportunities. And what are we seeing? Well, on the casualty side, rate continues to stay ahead of trend. That’s what our clients are experiencing. Ceding commissions are also starting to come down. And so those were terrific opportunities. We leaned into that. On the property side, our view is we’re at the very beginning stages of a major correction in the primary property market. And we will get an opportunity to participate with our clients alongside them on a pro rata basis. And again, a very attractive ceding commission. So that was a meaningful part of our Q1 growth was in pro rata. And then as we go forward, the 4/1 renewal was outstanding, 5/1 renewal a little bit smaller, but also excellent results. And we’re seeing a very consistent theme where property renewals as we go through the renewal period are achieving or exceeding the expected return levels we saw at January 1. And then I’ll end at 6/1 because it is relatively imminent. But our view is that it will be very consistent with that. We think the market will continue to dislocate, we will have incredible opportunities to grow with our best-in-class clients and really allocate our capacity to superior returns. And again, I would expect that to be at or above what we saw at January 1. So all a tremendous amount of really high-quality opportunity that we’re capturing. But to Juan’s point, it is going to take time for that to earn into our portfolio. And you started to see it a little bit in the first quarter. Obviously, the effect of Jan 1 begins to earn in. An important point I would make on that earning is we are also at the same time that we’re attacking this incredible opportunity. We’re also being very prudent on our loss picks. Remember that cat XOL does not get booked at least at Everest with a 0% attritional loss ratio. We are booking a very prudent attritional loss ratio. And our hope, obviously, is that we don’t need those dollars, but we want them to be there in the event that there are attritional cat losses that don’t meet our cat threshold. And so over the next quarter, two quarters, three quarters, you will start to see that become a bigger and bigger part of our portfolio. And that will exert downward pressure on our loss ratio and our combined ratio.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. That’s helpful. And then my second question is on the insurance margin, right? You guys had called out the medical stop loss, the impact in the quarter. So if we adjust for that, should we assume that the starting point for the second quarter and the rest of the year should be a 90% or better current accident year ex cat combined ratio in insurance given that, that medical stop lock issue isn’t expected to repeat?
Mark Kociancic: Elyse, it’s Mark. Good morning. So look, we have the one bump in the medical stop loss this quarter. It’s roughly $15 million charge. We are confirming, and I mentioned it in my script in the prepared remarks, 91% to 93% combined. So we feel very good about the margin that we’re adding, the growth that we’re adding both domestically and globally. So I think the attritional loss ratio is showing good improvement, definitely sustainable with the margins that we have, and we feel confident about remaining in that 91% to 93%.
Elyse Greenspan: Thank you.
Juan Andrade: Thanks, Elyse.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Yaron Kinar with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Yaron Kinar: Good morning, everybody. My first question goes to the loss picks. And I’m just curious if you saw any increases in liability or financial lines loss picks, both in insurance and reinsurance?
Jim Williamson: Yes. So Yaron, this is Jim Williamson. Thanks for the question. I’ll start with reinsurance. So when I look at our loss picks for the first quarter, I’d really indicate a few things. One, within casualty, obviously, we’re always evaluating in a very granular way, our picks even at the subline level. And there were a number of puts and takes within casualty. But the overall casualty loss pick as it earned into the first quarter is very consistent with where we were last year. And our view is we’re continuing to see rate in excess of trend. That’s a good guide. At the same time, it’s a pretty high-risk environment. And so we’re being prudent about that. On the financial line side, that’s for us, in reinsurance, that really means our mortgage portfolio. And again, we saw incredible opportunities in 2022, in particular, with to GSEs, which is a very high-margin business. But again, we’re very prudent in the loss selections there and our loss picks 2023 are exactly the same as our loss picks in 2022 even though we’ve been moving further away from loss. And then lastly, on property, on the XOL side, we do see improving loss picks over last year. But again, we’re still being, I think, relatively prudent and we don’t book cat XOL at zero. We’re just a little under 20 for an attritional loss pick there, which is an improvement over last year.
Yaron Kinar: Actually, I do have a second one, if I could. And just on premium growth, if I may. One, the XOL premium growth was clearly a bit lower than the pricing you saw in property cat. And I just want to confirm if that’s a function of moving to higher layers? Or is it a function of shrinking limits? Or what’s behind that?
Jim Williamson: Yes, Yaron, it’s Jim again. Look, I guess the way I would describe that is really in a couple of ways. One, the first thing we do when we’re confronting the breadth of opportunity that I described in the earlier question, is we look to create our own capacity. So a lot of that is moving away from any area of the portfolio where we’re not seeing the expected returns we want. An example of that, which was really a factor in 2022 as we were trimming some of our pro rata portfolios, which do have a heavy amount of premium with them. And then obviously, the second factor, as you described is we are moving further away from loss. And so you do tend to see lower premiums per dollar of exposure, all other things being equal. But what I would also say is all of these things are clearly not equal. The rates online that we’re seeing in our portfolio overall from a cat XOL perspective are up year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, even though we’re moving further and further away from loss. So that’s what’s driving what we expect to be a very strong premium growth, both in the first quarter and through the rest of the year. But what I would also say, and I think this is crucial, is our modeled expected profit is growing much faster than our written premium. And that’s because you’re seeing the scissoring of margin expansion happening in those cat XOL treaties, I think that’s a really terrific result and our expectation is, and it’s certainly been proven out. Jan 1, April 1, May 1, we believe June 1 and really through January 1, 2024, we expect that scissoring effect to continue.
Yaron Kinar: Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Mike Zaremski with BMO. Please go ahead.
Mike Zaremski: Great. Ceding commissions improving. I believe on the reinsurance side, we mentioned a couple of times in your prepared remarks. Can you provide any updated color and let us know if one impacting the financial statements and if you expect that to continue into the midyear renewals?
Jim Williamson: Yes, Mike, this is Jim Williamson. Thanks for the question. Yes, we have seen improved ceding commissions primarily driven on the casualty side, but also on the property pro rata side. Now remember, when we talk about improved ceding commissions, and we mentioned it in our fourth quarter call, when we were talking about the January 1 renewal, we’re giving you indications on a written basis. And so what we had said last quarter, and I would repeat it, is that we’ve seen about 1 point improvement in casualty ceding commissions and a little less than that on property, mainly because properties, ceding commissions were already relatively lean. We found them to be pretty attractive. So that’s on a written basis. Now that’s going to take time, similar to the other comments that we’ve made, particularly when you’re talking about pro rata premium that really earns over 2 years, it takes time for that to be reflected in the financials. So you really haven’t started to see that yet, but we expect it to emerge over the coming quarters.
Mike Zaremski: Okay. That’s helpful. Also another follow-up on the – in the prepared remarks, the optimism about the property side about beginning stages of a major correction, maybe you can kind of elaborate there, why we’re in the beginning stages. Is this simply because some of the primaries are seeing their reinsurance rates go up a lot, and there is clearly a lot of replacement cost inflation. So the primaries are getting ahead of – trying to get ahead of an issue or – what are you seeing there? And why do you see that growth being so attractive if some of your primary partners see themselves as kind of being a bit behind the inflation curve?
Juan Andrade: Yes. Mike, this is Juan Andrade. Let me start and then I’ll ask Mike Karmilowicz to add something to this answer as well. Look, I think it all starts with the fact that we do have a structural supply and demand imbalance, that’s taking place in both insurance and reinsurance, frankly, on property cat, right? So on the supply side of things, you have essentially less capacity being deployed by rated companies. You also have less of the ILS capital coming into the market. And on the demand side, we have all the issues that we’ve all lived through together, right? You have inflation, which is putting upward pressure on values, there is volatility in the environment, social inflation and other things. So our ceding partners basically are requiring to buy more insurance, more reinsurance along those lines. So that structural supply and demand imbalance, I think, is really what begins part of the equation. Now Jim has talked about what we have seen on the property side in reinsurance, which is very attractive from a pricing perspective, and we expect to see that through January 1, 2024 maybe beyond. On the primary side, we’re seeing basically the same things. We’re now basically seeing property rates up in the high teens into the 20s. And if you’re in wholesale, it’s plus 30, right? So you’re definitely seeing that. And keeping in mind that we have both a wholesale and a retail channel, we are getting that rate on both sides of the equation. So from our perspective, that also makes a lot of sense for us. Also keep in mind that we have also been derisking the insurance side of our business, not just the reinsurance side. It’s one of the reasons why you don’t see us picking up losses from the spring events in the U.S. Basically, we had $2 million of cat loss in the Insurance segment. So we are seeing pretty significant rate increases on the primary side. We have continued to de-risk and our strategy and property has moved more towards middle market retail than anything else. So all of these things, I think, is what makes it fairly attractive for us. But Mike, maybe you can add a few more...
Mike Karmilowicz: Sure. No, I think that’s well said, Juan. I guess I would just add a couple of other comments, Mike, to that. One, we continue to push out on the retail side. At the same time, given the market conditions, we’ve been able to continue to deemphasize the concentration of risk, particularly in the peak zones, the cat prone zones, particularly in the wholesale market. In addition to that, we’ve actually now basically helping out with our foundational work we do with our international expansion. We’re now spreading that out and diversifying our portfolio across the globe, giving us a lot better balance and overall more risk-adjusted returns that are more consistent and sustainable over the long haul.
Mike Zaremski: Great color. Thank you.
Juan Andrade: Thanks, Mike.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Brian Meredith with UBS. Please go ahead.
Brian Meredith: Hi. First question, just looking at Florida renewals with the legislation that went through on what are your expectations or what that means for potential capital moving in? And how do you think Everest still position itself for that 6/1 renewal, meaning quota share versus excess of loss?
Jim Williamson: Sure, Brian. It’s Jim Williamson. Thanks for the question. Yes, look, I mean, first of all, let me just say that our view on the reform that has occurred is it’s incredibly constructive. I think the fact that the government in Florida was able to get such a broad-based perform past is just excellent work. And we think over time, that will be incredibly healthy for the Florida insurance market and will provide much needed relief for our homeowners there. At the same time, we think it’s going to take time for the effects of that reform to prove itself. We don’t expect the plaintiff bar to sit idly by while the reforms are implemented. And I think it remains a little bit to be seen on exactly what that will mean. And so we’re being very cautious on that. Now we have been a very consistent provider of capacity to the Florida market. And our expectation is that will continue. And our view on pricing, terms and conditions in Florida, for 6/1, we expect really modeled returns to exceed what we saw at Jan 1. So we think 6/1 will be better than Jan 1. The headline rate increases may not be as large because we already took significant rate in ‘22 but the economics of those programs should be outstanding. And so our view is as long as that has proven to be true, we will continue to deploy a similar level of capacity to that market than we did in prior year. Now in terms of our participation, we’re almost exclusively an XOL market in Florida. We do have a couple of targeted quota share deals, but they are a relatively small part of the portfolio. And I don’t really expect that mix to change.
Brian Meredith: Great. Thanks. And then my second question. I’m just curious, of the cat loss, how big was Turkey. And then on that, I’m just curious, given that those are types of programs that have fairly low rate on lines and I’m not sure what the return dynamics are there. Why would you be running that type of business now given just the strength of pricing and the attractive returns in areas like the U.S. and Europe and in other areas of the world?
Jim Williamson: Yes, sure, Brian. It’s Jim again. Yes. So, on the Turkey quake, a couple of things, one, our loss was $70 million for the Turkey quake. And what I would describe to you in terms of that market is we have been a long-term participant in the Turkey cat market. We have earned outstanding returns in that market, similar to the things that we have done in other parts of our portfolio, that were coming in over the last 2 years, we have really significantly reduced our participation in Turkey, primarily in our quota share treaties, which we have cut back significantly. But we are still an XOL player. We have made a lot of money. Even after this event, our profit position is very strong and the return profile is very good. The other thing that I would indicate on that $70 million losses, if you were to compare what happened in Turkey versus what happened, say, in the U.S. in the first quarter, I think it’s an important contrast to point out. That Turkey quake was probably something like a 1 in 50 events. You have 50,000 people killed in Turkey alone, another 10,000 in Syria is a huge human tragedy, our view is that is a real cat loss. And that’s where Everest and its value proposition is meant to be called to help that country recover. And I would contrast that with the U.S. storms in the first quarter, which really, in our view, should be an attritional event for the primary market. And you saw that play out in our portfolio. So, that gives you a sense of how we are playing those dynamics and really focusing on leveraging our capacity, we are getting high return and also where you have actual cat losses.
Brian Meredith: That makes sense. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Meyer Shields with KBW. Please go ahead.
Meyer Shields: I think Juan, you touched upon this a little bit with reinsurance, but I was wondering if you could talk about how, I guess from the conditions our expected returns are evolving in the international insurance market?
Juan Andrade: Say that again, Meyer, please.
Meyer Shields: I am trying to get a sense of – look, I think that has a great sense of what’s going on in property, but for other lines in insurance, I am not sure I have a great handle on the opportunity that you are seeing there in terms of how expected returns are evolving.
Juan Andrade: Yes, absolutely. I am happy to start and then I will ask Mike Karmilowicz to jump in. Look, I think there is a few dynamics to keep in mind in international markets. By definition, they tend to be more short-tailed in nature. So, that means that they are going to carry lower ELRs than what we have in North America because of our long tail focus in North America traditionally. So, I think that’s an important thing to keep in mind. When we look at the broad trends though, we see pricing actually to be quite good in places like Europe, Latin America and Asia for that short tail business. And so for us, that remains pretty attractive. And as we were saying earlier, I said in my prepared remarks, one of the great things that we are building right now is really a very diversified global insurance company by geography, by product line and by distribution wholesale retail, which enables us to play and deploy capital where we find the most attractive areas. So, for example, in the U.S. in the quarter, when we see public D&O and maybe workers’ compensation, not as attractive as other lines of business, we can move away from those lines, be cautious as I have said, and deploy that capital into other lines of business, which could be again, short tail property in Europe or in Latin America or even within the U.S., given what I said earlier. But that gives us a sense of how we manage the portfolio to get the most economic benefit for the company.
Mike Karmilowicz: Yes. And I think, Meyer, I would just add a comment on the short tail piece. Not only are we seeing the opportunity within property, but also within marine and aviation businesses as well, given our nature of some of these lines, which we don’t have legacy issue too, particularly for marine and for specifically aviation. We have tremendous upside. We have hired great talent. We have got good teams that have great people and capabilities to Juan’s point. And given what’s happening in the reinsurance market, you think on the short-tail lines, you are just now starting to begin to see that rate environment starting to play through with just giving us ample opportunity to be able to capitalize on the marketplace right now.
Meyer Shields: Okay. That’s very helpful. Thank you. And then one small follow-up, and I may be trying too hard. But I think both Juan and Mark reaffirmed the 91% to 93% in insurance for this year’s combined ratio, so I was hoping you could update us on the reinsurance side?
Mark Kociancic: Yes. Meyer, it’s Mark. Good morning. So look, on the reinsurance side, we have got a great rate environment right now. And I think Jim articulated a lot of the points that are behind that. We have clearly got loss experience, supply-demand factors impacting capacity, and our Q1 results are really demonstrating some solid growth. And our reinsurance franchise is very scalable, so we are able to take advantage of that. I think the rate is well established. We define that quite a bit in our press release and in our opening remarks. And you are going to see property I think, become a larger component of our combined ratio over time, we are still using prudent loss picks no matter what, because you do have the loss experience of the past cannot go down to the bottom line that quickly, but it is shorter sale business on the property side. So, we would expect to realize margin notwithstanding the loss experience of the current year over time. So, I think what we have got is fairly meaningful strength underpinning our combined ratio going forward. So, as you see the net earnings earning out with the increase of 2023 premiums, whether it’s the pro rata side or the excess of loss with this strong rate environment, the shift towards more property versus casualty and the combined ratio. I think you will see improvements in the combined ratio within reinsurance specifically. And we definitely see the margin expansion through the renewals, and we know that’s going to filter down through the combined ratio over time. So, I see this combined ratio question kind of solving itself through actual results in the coming quarters on an improved basis.
Juan Andrade: Meyer, I would add just to Mark because I think that was well said. This is one. And I would repeat what I said to Elyse earlier in the call is that our combined ratio should continue to improve on the strength of the rate improved terms, mix of business, everything that Mark was talking about. And you look at the combined ratio that reinsurance had in this quarter, and I think that gives you a starting point.
Meyer Shields: Okay. Fantastic. Thank you so much.
Operator: And our next question today is a follow-up from Yaron Kinar with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Yaron Kinar: Thank you. I just want to ask a follow-up on the earning of the pro rata premiums and reinsurance over a 2-year period. I thought it would be 1 year. Is there a multi-year treaty component there, or is that just how pro rata is earned? I guess it’s a bit new to me.
Mark Kociancic: Yaron, it’s Mark speaking. So, it’s a standard accounting convention to earn pro rata on what’s called an 8s basis, so over an eight-quarter period of time. And it’s not a multiyear treaty. It’s definitely a 1-year treaty, but your cedents are obviously producing business throughout the year, so they could produce premium, for example, in December, and it takes time to earn that out. So, the premium recognition or earnings is really standard in the business for pro rata and it’s earned on an 8s basis. And in the first quarter, without getting too technical, you have kind of a slow ramp-up because you would essentially start that earnings really at the midpoint of the first quarter, the 45th day of a 90-day quarter and then it ramps up over time throughout this eight-quarter period. And so you have got last year’s pro rata, whether it’s property or casualty, still learning into the ‘23 earned, for example, you got the ‘23 writings earning out. And so that shift will occur through the year, combined with whatever the loss picks are and the weighting for those specific segments.
Yaron Kinar: Got it. That’s helpful. And then one other follow-up, if I may. I think you called out some timing issues with expenses. When do you expect that to normalize?
Mark Kociancic: Well, I will break it into two parts, so corporate and underwriting. So, on the corporate side, look, we have two components. The largest of which is really interest expense. We have a meaningful component of floating rate debt through the FHLB and then a floating rate sub debt and that’s based on three-month sulfur. And so that increased, I would say, roughly $3 million a quarter on the run rate versus, say, Q1 of last year. I think that stabilizes for ‘23. It’s difficult to see sulfur moving that much this year. So, I think what you see in Q1 will hold for the remaining of the year, potentially go down if sulfur goes down. Corporate expenses, I think last year’s run rate of approximately $16 million a quarter is a pretty good run rate for this year. So, I see pretty good stability, generally speaking, for the corporate side. On the underwriting, two pieces, reinsurance, insurance. So, I think on the reinsurance side, we feel good about our expense ratio in general, you see a slightly elevated number in Q1 really for platform expenses for the most part. But I think somewhere in the 2.6%, 2.7% expense ratio type area is a good number for reinsurance in 2023. On the insurance side, we see that elevating a bit into the mid-15% area. We started off the year at a 15.9%, and I think that’s a combination of two things talent acquisition and then a bit on the platform expense as we are building out and scaling our operations in internationally and also domestically, but we are adding meaningful talent, especially at a senior level globally within the insurance franchise. So, I think that will pay off over time, but you do pay for it early on in terms of the expense load. I would point out a couple of things. So one, we feel – we still feel very good about the technical ratio and insurance profitability that’s coming in from the commission and ELRs on that standpoint. And hence, my comments in the prepared remarks of affirming our assumption of 91% and 93% combined for the insurance division as a whole. So, we see a bit of a mix here in terms of elevated underwriting expense, but still good on 91% and 93% based on sound fundamentals of diversified businesses and the good margin that we are seeing in that business. And I think you will also see a pretty good growth rate in the – for the remainder of the year. Typically, we start seasonally with a lower production in Q1 for insurance, and then it tends to ramp up Q2, Q4, in particular. So, we do feel that there will be some economies of scale occurring as the division grows even more.
Yaron Kinar: Thanks for taking my additional question and for the comprehensive color.
Operator: And our next question is a follow-up from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi. Good morning again. So, I want to go back also to the reinsurance discussion. I appreciate right that you guys are saying some of these contracts are going to take a couple of years to earn in. But maybe asking it in a different way, you guys printed a 58% underlying loss ratio in the first quarter. When this business is fully earned in, and we see the full impact of the rate increases in your financials, what can that 58%, what can that number drop to?
Mark Kociancic: That’s – look, Elyse, that’s – it’s a difficult question to answer. Let me frame it with a few of the components that will be taken into consideration. So, I mentioned to you the composition of the business itself. So we do see property coming in stronger. And I think both Juan and Jim really articulated the level of rate increase that we are seeing. I think the growth is self-evident. You are seeing very strong rate. Jim is talking about risk-adjusted returns that are significantly higher. So, we believe the margins there are superior, really, really good. On the flip side, you are still seeing significant casualty growth, especially on the pro rata, and we are using prudent loss picks there because we are in an elevated risk environment. We are getting paid to take that risk. And so you got a mix of business that is still meaningfully impacted by casualty. And so those are the kind of factors that mix and then the rate itself, which we feel good about, that are going to determine that over time, not to mention whatever the loss experience. But again, the fundamentals are great. This is truly a generational hard market, in particular. For reinsurance property, we are just getting started. We love our positioning and the ability of our franchise, how we are globally positioned to take advantage of it and really be selective and adding value to our clients in this process. So, I think that combined ratio will solve itself based on the sound fundamentals.
Elyse Greenspan: Thanks. And then my – one other for me, your PMLs, given your expectations for what you expect could transpire at midyear, it sounds like you guys are still pretty positive about the reinsurance pricing environment, where would you expect your PMLs to trend once we get through the June and July 1, catastrophe reinsurance renewals?
Jim Williamson: Sure, Elyse. This is Jim Williamson, great question. So, first of all, we do see tremendous opportunity, and we are leaning into that, and we have selectively deployed incremental capacity, always within the defined appetite of the group, and we have talked a number of times about our willingness to put both our earnings and capital at risk, and we have plenty of room within that defined appetite to maneuver, and that’s certainly what we have been doing. The other thing that I would say that’s a repeat of what you have heard from me in the past, but we always start with creating our own capacity. In any portfolio, there is good, better and best deals. And I can tell you the good deals are not getting capacity anymore. It’s really moving to the best deals. And so what that’s allowed us to do is selectively expand available capacity. What does that mean, that means gross PMLs go up modestly. It wasn’t a huge move, as you saw 1/1 when we printed our PMLs. I expect that trend to kind of play out through the rest of this year. As I indicated earlier, if 6/1 meets our expectations for pricing and terms, I expect total capacity deployed to be consistent with last year, which I think will produce meaningful increases in premium even more meaningful increases in expected profit, very modest or no real change in PMLs. And then as you roll through the rest of the year, I would expect, again, modest increases in gross PMLs, with even larger increases in premium and profit. So, that should give you a view. I don’t expect a wild move on the PMLs by any stretch of the imagination.
Elyse Greenspan: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, today’s final question is a follow-up from Mike Zaremski at BMO. Please go ahead.
Mike Zaremski: Great. Just one quick one. Just kind of thinking through the bullish outlook, generational hard market that term was used dislocation. Just curious, is there – would there be a scenario in the cards where Everest would want to opportunistically raise capital? The debt capital was – levels were increased last year, which looks like a great move, just curious if there is any scenarios in which equity capital need to be raised as well.
Mark Kociancic: Mike, it’s Mark. So look, we feel very good about our positioning in this market, our ability to execute our plan. We have got the franchise on a global basis. We are a leading reinsurance market. So, I think the platform is clearly well demonstrated to meet this opportunity. We have got a lot of financial flexibility, and I will just leave it that we are always exploring and evaluating our market opportunities and our capital structure to make it better.
Mike Zaremski: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Juan Andrade for any closing remarks.
Juan Andrade: Thank you, and thank you all for being with us today. I think as you can see, our operating performance was excellent in the first quarter. We are off to a strong start, and we are on offense. You have heard some of our commentary here regarding the market and regarding the bullishness. The momentum is strong and our ambitions were high. We are building on our first quarter momentum to continue delivering exceptional value for all of our stakeholders. So, with that, I thank you for your questions, for your time and for the support of the company, and we will see you soon at our second quarter results. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today’s conference call. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.

===== 2022 Q4  (2023-02-09 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Everest Re Group, Ltd. Fourth Quarter of 2022 Earnings Conference Call.  Please note today's event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Matt Rohrmann, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Matthew Rohrmann: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Everest Re Group, Ltd. fourth quarter of 2022 earnings conference call. The Everest executives leading today's call are Juan Andrade, President and CEO; and Mark Kociancic, Executive Vice President and CFO. We're also joined by other members of the Everest management team. Before we begin, I will preface the comments on today's call by noting that Everest SEC filings including extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements, management comments regarding estimates, projections and similar are subject to the risks, uncertainties and assumptions as noted in these filings. Management may also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These items are reconciled in our earnings release and financial statements. With that, I'll turn the call over to Juan.
Juan Andrade: Thank you, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Everest's excellent fourth quarter performance capped another strong year of consistent execution of our strategy and continued positive momentum. We advanced our objective of creating sustainable value for our shareholders with disciplined underwriting and targeted growth driving margin expansion in both businesses. We increased diversification in each of our segments both geographically and by product line. When you combine all of this with healthy and consistent rate increases and improved terms, our risk adjusted return profile improved across the Board. Both franchises delivered solid top and bottom line performance. We profitably grew our primary insurance division and executed an outstanding January 1 reinsurance renewal. This further reinforced our global market leadership and positions Everest well for the future. Our actions resulted in solid underwriting profit for the year, over $1 billion in operating income and a double-digit operating return on equity for both the quarter and the year, an excellent result. We achieved these results despite market volatility, economic and geopolitical uncertainty and industry catastrophe losses totaling over $140 billion in the fifth costliest CAT year in history. In short, we accomplished a great deal in 2022 and built a wide runway for future opportunity. We are uniquely positioned with accelerating momentum and top tier talent driving this business. Everest is more agile and well-equipped than ever and we have the ability and the drive to seize attractive opportunities and deliver on our commitments in 2023. Now, I will briefly recap our financial highlights focused on the full year beginning at the Group level. In 2022, we grew the company by 9% in constant dollars ending the year at approximately $14 billion in gross written premium. We generated $477 million in underwriting profit with a 96 combined ratio. This is a near 2 points improvement year-over-year despite an active CAT year. The attritional combined ratio of 87.4% also improved from the end of 2021 and we achieved a 70 basis point improvement year-over-year in the group loss ratio. The operating expense ratio remains best-in-class at 5.8%. Finally, our high quality investment portfolio generated $830 million in net investment income. Our actions to optimize the investment portfolio over the past three years and position it for a rising rate environment have paid significant dividends. Now turning to our underwriting segments, beginning with reinsurance. Our reinsurance division's focused execution in 2022 further enhanced our global market leadership and preferred partner position. We continue to optimize our portfolio while achieving solid top and bottom-line growth. For the full year, reinsurance growth was 5% on a constant dollar basis with $9.3 billion in total gross written premiums. This growth was driven by broadened opportunities with our core cedents and our nimble allocation of capital to achieve the highest returns. We took deliberate actions during 2022 to shed underperforming business. This also positioned us well to take advantage of the strong trading conditions at January 1. These actions resulted in over $300 million in underwriting profit for the year and a combined ratio of 96.4%, there's a 1.7 point improvement from '21. For the full year, both the attritional loss ratio at 58.7% and the attritional combined ratio at 86.2% improved down 90 basis points and 10 basis points, respectively. Our deliberate underwriting actions significantly reduced our CAT losses, demonstrated by our less than 1% market share from Hurricane Ian in the third quarter, the second largest hurricane in U.S. history. Our focused Reinsurance strategy continues to pay dividends. Throughout 2022, we leveraged our market position, deep client and broker relationships and strong balance sheet to building more profitable and higher margin book, which culminated in an outstanding January 1 renewal. I'll provide more color on 1/1 in a few minutes. Now turning to our primary insurance division. In 2022, we've made tremendous strides expanding our reach, capabilities, product set and breadth of global talent while hitting important financial milestones. We finished the year with insurance growth of 18% in constant dollars and $4.6 billion in premiums. This is supported by new quarterly gross written premium record in the fourth quarter. Growth was balanced and diversified across the business by product line and by geography. After four years of significant and cumulative rate increases, we achieved high-single digit average increases excluding workers' compensation throughout the year. In addition to rate, exposure growth driven by revenue and payroll increases created additional margin against loss trend, pricing increases in the quarter were led by commercial auto, general liability and property. Our proactive cycle management actions contributed to our continued improved underwriting profitability, our ability to pivot quickly is a key advantage. Everest continues to benefit from an influx of top talent with the market expertise, track-record, underwriting acumen and relationships to execute our strategy. We achieved the milestone full year underwriting profit of $164 million, which is a new annual record for the Insurance Division with a full year combined ratio of 94.8%, down 2.3 points year-over-year. Our attritional combined ratio also improved 80 basis points year-over-year to 90.4%. We are enhancing our operations to become even more connected and efficient on a global scale. It's an exciting time for our primary business. We continue to see significant opportunities and I look forward to even greater momentum ahead. 2022 was a year of multiple wins, we've reduced volatility, diversified the portfolio, expanded margins and enhanced our risk adjusted return. We got there with consistent and precise execution. We deployed our capital in areas where we could get the best risk-adjusted returns. We also reshaped our property portfolio through continued diversification via growth internationally. All this accomplished while increasing our top and bottom-lines and we improved net exposure to our balance sheet. As I mentioned before, we remain risk-on for property CAT as pricing, terms and conditions provide attractive returns within our defined trading range. Turning to 2023, the January 1 reinsurance renewals were executed by our global reinsurance team with equal precision, and as a result, we have a significantly stronger portfolio heading into 2023 and beyond. We approached the January 1 renewals from a position of strength. With a superior value proposition, well-prepared to support our clients and taking advantage of excellent market conditions around the world. We set clear goals for our portfolio and we achieved every one of them by leveraging Everest global market leadership and setting early expectations with clients and brokers which drove significant pricing improvements. In addition to rate, we also substantially improved terms and conditions. We targeted attractive property opportunities both domestically and internationally at materially improved risk-adjusted returns. We drove higher attachment points and reduced exposure to named and secondary payrolls. Significant property CAT rate increases were evident across all geographies. In North America, the property CAT XOL risk-adjusted rate change was up approximately 50%. The average attachment point for our global property CAT business also increased meaningfully, resulting in significantly reduced risk exposure. At the same time, the expected return for our CAT portfolio increased materially. In casualty and professional lines pricing and terms and conditions continue to improve overall. And we leveraged our property market to strengthen and further diversify the portfolio. Internationally, the 1/1 renewal exceeded our expectations throughout Europe and Asia. We grew our regional portfolios through increased participations and by expanding our base of new clients. We also saw significant rate movement in specialty lines exposed to the Russia, Ukraine war particularly in marine, aviation and political violence. I am very pleased with the performance of our outstanding reinsurance team. Everest distinguished itself in this renewal by our early and consistent communication with our brokers and clients. We set expectations heading into 1/1 and constructively work with them to find solutions. As a result, we improved our portfolio and expanded margins while deepening our relationships with brokers and clients. Looking forward to future 2023 renewals, we expect reinsurance pricing momentum to continue. We see abundant opportunity to continue growing and diversifying our portfolio in all markets, focused on further growth in Asia and Europe, while capitalizing on the continuing market dislocation in property. Given significant firming of the reinsurance market on January 1 and the heightened risk environment, primary insurers should also see firming prices in 2023, and they will need to maintain underwriting discipline. I am proud of what Everest achieved in '22. We delivered on our strategic objectives, while laying the groundwork for sustained profitable growth. I attribute Everest success to our outstanding team under consistent and relentless execution in every aspect of the business. The outlook for 2023 is bright, and I look forward to taking this company to the next level. Now I will turn the call over to Mark to take us through the numbers in more detail.
Mark Kociancic: Good morning, everyone. Everest finished off 2022 with very strong results across the board in the fourth quarter. Operating income was $478 million or $12.21 per diluted share for the quarter, equating to an operating ROE of 19.4%. For the full year, operating income was approximately $1.1 billion or $27.08 per diluted share, with an operating ROE of 10.6%, while the annualized TSR or total shareholder return was 5.4%. Juan highlighted, we have a number of strengths in both our insurance and reinsurance businesses, bolstered by our team's consistent execution around the globe. We remain very well positioned to take advantage of the market opportunities ahead. Looking at the Group results for the fourth quarter, Everest reported gross written premiums of $3.7 billion, representing 9% growth in constant dollars. The combined ratio of 87.8% for the quarter represents 4.1 points of improvement over the prior year's quarter, driven by lower CAT losses as well as a continued improvement in attritional loss experience primarily in reinsurance. Group current year loss ratio was 59.6%, a 90 basis point improvement over the prior year's quarter, led primarily by the reinsurance segment, which I'll discuss in more detail in just a moment. Group's commission ratio was 21.6%, up modestly on mix changes, while the Group expense ratio was modestly higher year-over-year at 6%. Moving to the segment results, and starting with Reinsurance. In the fourth quarter, the Reinsurance gross premiums written grew 3.7% to $2.4 billion in constant dollars. The growth was driven primarily by property pro rata business. Combined ratio was strong at 86.4%, an improvement of 5.1 points year-over-year primarily on lower CAT losses. Current year loss ratio improved 1.5 points to 58.2%, as we continue to achieve favorable rate and terms, optimize mix and scale various lines as well as shifting the book towards accounts with better risk-adjusted return potential. The commission ratio was 25%, up modestly, largely driven by mix and the underwriting expense ratio was 2.8%, broadly in line with the prior year's quarter. Moving to insurance, where we continue to build solid momentum. Gross premiums written grew 20.5% in constant dollars to nearly $1.3 billion in the quarter. As Juan mentioned, a record level of production in the fourth quarter for the division. Combined ratio for the quarter was 91.4%, a 1.4 point improvement from a year ago. The current year loss ratio was 63.4% in the quarter, slightly higher year-over-year due to mix and a onetime adjustment relating to our Lloyd's Syndicate. Commission ratio improved 1 point, largely driven by business mix. The underwriting-related expense ratio was 15%, which is within our expectations as we continue to expand our franchise and invest in a number of growth initiatives across the business. And finally to cover investments, tax and the balance sheet. Net investment income for the quarter was $210 million versus $205 million a year ago, as we continue to benefit from higher new money yields, an increasing resets in our floating rate securities within the fixed income portfolio. Private equity investments yielded a negative $30 million P&L impact in Q4, and they are reported on a one quarter lag. Overall, our reinvestment rate continues to trend higher year-over-year, as new money yields remain in the 5% range, while the book yield was 3.5% at the end of the fourth quarter. We continue to have a short asset duration of approximately 3.1 years. And as a reminder, that 22% of our fixed income investments are in floating rate securities. Fourth quarter, our operating income tax rate was approximately 11%, within our assumed range of 11% to 12% over the course of the year. And regarding the balance sheet, we completed the last of our granular reserve reviews across our entire portfolio, which affirm the overall strength of our balance sheet, underpinned by our disciplined underwriting and prudent reserving philosophies. Overall, our reserve adequacy remains solid. We did strengthen our asbestos and environmental reserves, which makes up approximately 1% of total net reserves by $138 million to position that runoff book comfortably within the average range for industry survival ratios. This was offset by favorable development from a variety of areas, primarily from short-tail lines. We also had other marginal adjustments in both segments, resulting in 0 net prior year development. We continue to remain prudent given the uncertainty of inflation and the heightened risk environment the entire P&C industry currently faces. In short, we remain confident in the strength of our reserve position. Moving to shareholders' equity, ended the quarter at $8.4 billion, driven primarily by the strong earnings in the quarter as well as a modest recovery on the value of available-for-sale fixed income securities as rates moderated slightly. Net unrealized losses in the fixed income portfolio as of December 31 were approximately $1.7 billion down from a net unrealized loss of $2 billion at the end of the third quarter 2022. Operating cash flow was strong at over $1 billion during the quarter and it stands at $3.7 billion year-to-date. Book value per share ended the quarter at $215.54 per share, while the book value per share, excluding unrealized depreciation and depreciation of securities, stood at $259.18 versus $252.12 per share at the end of 2021, driven by the strong underwriting results mentioned earlier. Long-term debt to total capital at quarter end stood at 23.3%, broadly similar to the level last quarter. In conclusion, Everest ended 2022 with a very strong fourth quarter. We have the platform, balance sheet and the team to continue to take advantage of the current environment, and we have a lot of momentum as we look ahead into 2023. That summarizes our fourth quarter results. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Matt to begin our Q&A session.
Matthew Rohrmann: Thanks, Mark. Operator, we are now ready to open the line for questions. 
Operator:  And our first question today comes from Yaron Kinar with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Yaron Kinar: Thank you. Good morning. Two questions, if I may. The first one, just listening to your commentary on 1/1 renewals and expectations that the reinsurance market remains hard, at least into midyear. I guess as I look at the PMLs that we saw in -- for 1/1, they still seem to be down quite a bit relative to mid '22 levels. Is that the right comparison or should we think about kind of what the PML will look like in midyear '23 relative to midyear '22? And could you give us some maybe thoughts on how we should see those develop?
James Williamson: Yes, Yaron. This is Jim Williamson. Thanks for the question. Maybe to set a little bit of the stage, I'd like to add some color around 1/1 to add to the comments that you heard from Juan and Mark because I think it's an important context when we're talking about PMLs. And to reiterate what Juan said, it was simply an outstanding renewal. We executed with incredible precision and achieved a number of important objectives in the renewal that really resulted in a step change in the risk-reward equation for Everest. As you heard, we received significant rate increases in our U.S. property CAT business on the order of 50%. We essentially improved every metric that we use to measure our CAT portfolio. Our average attachment points were up. Our attachment probabilities were down. Despite all of that, rate online increased. Our expected combined ratio dropped materially. Our expected ROE increase materially. Our expected loss in dollars went up slightly, as we deployed incremental capacity to targeted clients. And our dollars of expected profit per dollar of expected loss increased very meaningfully. Similar factors played out in our international markets, where rate increases significantly overachieved expectations as we were coming into the end of the year. And on average, our international markets took 40 points of rate including over 30 points of rate in the U.K., which hasn't seen a major CAT loss in decades. So simply put, on the property CAT side, it was a fantastic 1/1. And I think we expect those conditions to play out through the remainder of this year and into next year. So just exceptional. And so when you think about the resulting PMLs of that, what I would share with you is the comparison you always want to be making is quarter-to-quarter because what you're looking at is an analysis of our in-force book. And what I would -- the way I would characterize our PML movement is the PMLs that we publish were essentially flat. And you see some ups and downs in those PMLs on a net basis, they were essentially flat. And that translates into more deployment of some gross capacity, offset by improved AUM in Mt. Logan, and that gets you to a roughly flat P&L picture. My expectation is we'll probably remain in that sort of territory. We feel really good about our ability to get those incredible economics without really having to stretch the CAT appetite. And as you'll see in the investor presentation in terms of where we are in our earnings and capital at risk measures, we continue to trade well within our defined range, which we're very comfortable with. So it's really the best of all worlds where we're able to get rate that improves economics, overcomes the inflationary factors that you see in the market and do it while maintaining our risk position in a pretty stable manner. So really could not be happier with the results we achieved.
Yaron Kinar: Thanks Jim, that's very helpful. And my follow-up to that then would be, if I were to try and take that commentary and color and translate that into the combined ratio, so I think you've stated that you expected 91, 93 reported combined. Would you be surprised to see that come in well below that 91 to 93 range in a "normal CAT" year in '23? And would you expect to give us an updated number at some point this year?
Juan Andrade: Yaron, this is Juan Andrade. Look, what I would echo is a couple of things. I mean if you look at the 20% net income ROE that we generated in the fourth quarter, 19% operating ROE, which, again, it's an excellent result, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, particularly in the market environment that we're in right now. In addition to that, you layer the amount of rate that Jim and I just talked about, over 50% on U.S. CAT XOL, over 40% in our European businesses, et cetera. You talk about the terms and conditions that I referred to earlier in my remarks, which are also significant changes. And all of this is very much accretive to our portfolio. In addition to that, you also look at the work that has been done on the primary insurance side and just the margin improvement that we've been able to drive through 2022. So all of that leads you to a place that I say, we're in a good place. And I would not be surprised if we end up being on the better end of that range.
Yaron Kinar: And would you expect to give us an update at some point and a hard number?
Juan Andrade: Yes. For us, we're expecting to do another Investor Day towards the end of this year. And at that point, we will be updating our numbers and our financials. This will be the third year of our three year numbers that we put out there initially back in 2021.
Yaron Kinar: Thank you very much. And good luck in the year ahead.
Juan Andrade: Thanks Yaron.
Operator: Our next question today comes from Brian Meredith, UBS. Please go ahead.
Brian Meredith: Yes, thanks. Juan, it sounds like you're going to update premium guidance also in November?
Juan Andrade: Yes. Look, I think by then, we're going to have a pretty good idea of how the environment is shaping. But I think, Brian, if you go back to, again, in my prepared remarks, we just renewed 53% of the reinsurance book at very attractive terms. And as I said in my comments, we also expect that 4/1, 6/1 and 7/1 will continue to be very favorable for the reinsurance industry. So I think that also gives us a pretty good idea as to where that might be shaping. In addition to that, I would also say on the primary side, we also would expect pricing to continue to improve, as I mentioned in my remarks, and frankly, we already saw some of that in the fourth quarter, right, where we saw commercial auto, property and general liability make some significant improvements quarter-over-quarter on the pricing. We're in a heightened risk environment. You've got pressure from the reinsurance hard market. And so I would expect that all of these things will lead to a very good trajectory on the growth. But yes, we will be providing additional guidance later in the year when we do our Investor Day.
Brian Meredith: Great. Thanks. And then second question, Juan, I'm just curious, how do you think about allocating your PML on the property side between the insurance and the reinsurance business? I mean would you hold back some on the reinsurance because of opportunities? On primary is there one that you prefer a little bit more than the other? How do you think about that?
Juan Andrade: Yes. No, that's a great question, Brian. One of the terms that we like to use inside our company is that we do quite a bit of dynamic capital allocation. So this is, frankly, a fundamental discipline that we have with our enterprise risk management framework. On a very regular basis, we're essentially looking at by line of business, where we're coming in against expected returns, et cetera. And so that's how we start deciding who gets the capital. What we do not do is peanut butter this around the company, right? So we will look at the market opportunity. We look at where we think we can get the best economics, the best risk adjust good returns, and that's essentially how we deploy the capital. And it's an important point because I think you heard both me and Jim Williamson talk about the precision with which 1/1 was executed. And I think it's important to step back to understand that in order to get to the heart of your question. And it's the fact that we have pretty good control of our business around the world. So we are able to decide whether we're going to deploy more capital in the U.S. versus in the Continental Europe versus in Asia versus Latin America, depending on the market conditions. And we apply that same rigor across the segments, whether it's in primary insurance or whether it's on the reinsurance side of things. And that's ultimately how we make those decisions. But I would invite either Jim or Mark to maybe provide some additional comments on that as well.
James Williamson: Yes. No, Brian, it's Jim. I think that's spot on. I think clearly, what you've seen is a situation, particularly as we came into 1/1, where it took the primary market a little while to start to adjust to what was coming in terms of insurance rates. And our primary insurance business has been very disciplined on their portfolio management. And in some ways, that's freeing up capacity and thereby capital that we were able to very effectively deploy in reinsurance at 1/1. And that's, I think, really brings to life that dynamic capital allocation that Juan is mentioning. And we are very nimble that way, and it allows us to really achieve best-in-class returns.
Brian Meredith: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Meyer Shields with KBW. Please go ahead.
Meyer Shields: Great. Thanks, and good morning. First question is, I know this is only one piece of the changes at 1/1, but I'm trying to get a sense of the significance of higher reinsurance attachment points. Is there any way of maybe recasting 2022 losses in this new framework, just to give us a sense of how much difference that particular step make?
James Williamson: Sure, Meyer. This is Jim Williamson. It is a very important point. And actually, I think the fourth quarter gives us a little bit of a demonstration of that because we began a lot of these strategies really long before 1/1 '23. And if you think about how we execute in 1/1 '22 and the actions that we told you we were taking, it was all about moving away from lower-performing programs, particularly pro rata deals; moving away from high volatility structures, particularly around retro, around aggregate programs; making sure that we were deploying capacity where risk-adjusted returns warranted it, which is why we withdrew some capacity at 1/1 '22 and then started deploying it back into the market as conditions improve. And what does that do? For losses like -- what happened in the fourth quarter with Elliot. In our view, losses like that should be primarily retained by seeds. That's really not a type of loss that should be a fundamental loss to the reinsurance market. And you saw our Q4 CAT loss for reinsurance was relatively small, $10 million. And that is the type of loss we want for events like that. So that gives you a sense of how we think our book will perform over time. So if in 2023, there's a number of, what we would call, frequency CATS the $1 billion, $2 billion events, our expectation is our participation in those events will be lower than they would have been prior to 1/1 '23 because the average attachment point moved up our cedings are going to be retaining more of those losses net into their portfolio, which is where those losses belong. And that allows us to really preserve our capacity for major industry events, which is one of the products designed for. So that should give you a flavor of how we expect the portfolio to perform.
Meyer Shields: Okay. That is very helpful. The second question is there -- and I apologize if I missed this. I'm just looking for any thoughts on ceding commission changes, both as a reinsurer and on the insurance book?
James Williamson: Yes, Meyer, this is Jim. I'll start and then turn it over to my colleague, Mike Karm. Yes, so we did see really excellent results in our casualty renewal as well. Obviously, a lot of attention being paid to property and rightfully so. But we enjoy a premier position with many of our seats on their casualty portfolios, and we participated in this cycle of market hardening over the last few years by taking increasing share of casualty programs for those core clients, mainly on a pro rata basis. And one of the things that's happened is all that margin is getting accreted in the primary market as you've seen ceding commissions go up, we think that made sense. It was a reasonable trade. It was still resulting in more margin for us. So we like that. What we're starting to see now is still very attractive opportunity. We did continue to participate very meaningfully at 1/1 in the programs I'm describing. In fact, in a number of cases, we increased participation and I think, grew our portfolio in a really nice fashion. But what we also saw is obviously the amount of margin expansion in the primary market is narrowing a bit. And so we started to see ceding commissions certainly leveling off. I really only have full -- a small handful of instances where they continue to increase, and that was usually when they were already below market to begin with. What we saw mostly was a modest improvement in average ceding commissions across the portfolio, and we think that's justified. And our expectation is that, that phenomenon of moderating ceding commissions will continue to play out as we go forward. So with that, I'll turn it over to Mike.
Michael Karmilowicz: Sure. Thanks, Jim. For us, it's rod striking the right balance about retaining harder and earning profit while managing our volatility and really actually, as we continue to scale up our businesses. With given the reinsurance market and what's happening, we're certainly not immune to what is going on. But I would say we're also not reliant on reinsurance like others. And given our financial strength and our capital -- strong capital base, we will continue to be -- have all the flexibility in the world here to drive what we need to do as an organization. And for us, again, it's about being thoughtful as we retain more premium for our risk. There'll be more accretive to our portfolio and whatever economics nor to our benefit will continue to drive. So I think given where we are in the position of how we scale up our businesses, we feel we're in a good position, and I don't think there'll be anything material that we're concerned about driving our overall strategy.
Juan Andrade: Yes. Meyer, this is Juan. I think look, just to round out the answer, I think at the end of the day, bottom line is we saw improvement in cede commissions in this renewal.
Meyer Shields: Okay. Fantastic. That was very thorough. Very helpful.
Juan Andrade: Thanks Meyer.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question, I want to go back to the 1/1s, right? You guys spoke about the expected return increasing materially I'm not sure what color or numbers you want to give us, but like -- could you say what the expected return on your business would be in a normal CAT year? Or, for instance, if we looked at the 11% return you guys generated in '22, what would that be if last year's events recurred? Just something to give us a sense of just how much better the expected return is in '23 relative to '22 given, right, the better pricing and the improved terms and conditions?
James Williamson: Sure. Yes. Elyse, this is Jim Williamson, and I'll provide you some of that color. And maybe at the risk of repeating some of what I said, but I do think it's really critical. If you think about our objectives coming into renewal were pretty straightforward, and they're very similar to what we focused on last year. Continue to optimize the portfolio and move away from underperforming programs; control volatility, particularly around how we structure deals and for that -- for us, that means mainly avoiding aggregate structures and minimizing the amount of capacity we have deployed at really high return probability layers like the 1 in 3 type of player, that's not really where we want to be playing. And then ensuring that we're moving capacity to the best-in-class programs. And that same phenomenon that we've consistently executed through 2022 played out in January 1. And so we were able to take capacity from, let's say, the bottom tier of our programs and reallocate it to the best opportunities in the market. We did it with significant rate increases as Juan and I have mentioned 50% in the U.S., 40% in international markets. As you mentioned, there was also significant movement in terms and conditions. In particular, in the U.S., a significant portion of our deals are on -- now on a named peril only basis. We've also eliminated write-backs of exclusions on a number of areas that will over time result in better economics. And so the heart of your question of what does that mean for the portfolio in practical terms? Obviously, every year will present us with a different set of actual catastrophes. And so as opposed to looking back, what I would tell you, how I would expect the portfolio to perform is that frequency pass, which have really been deviled the reinsurance industry, will increasingly be retained by our customers. So we're getting a lot more rate to now focus on the types of losses that reinsurance was designed to cover in the first place. We would also expect for major losses that similar to what happened with Hurricane Ian, and we're very thoughtful about how much of a share of the major losses that we want to be taking, and I would expect that to look quite good as well. And then lastly, what I would say for all of this, we have a meaningful increase in the amount of cat premium available to pay these losses and still make a strong return. So hopefully, that gives you the color that would help you to triangulate what is an excellent expected return position as we move through 2023.
Juan Andrade: Elyse, and this is Juan. Let me piggyback on Jim's answer and because I think he was quite thorough. And I would point you back to that 20% ROE that we just talked about for the fourth quarter. And then we put it in perspective, right, because while we don't give specific guidance on what we think the ROE outlook is going to be for the coming year, we still generated double-digit ROEs despite the industry facing a top 5 catastrophe year. And I think you got to put those results in the context of all the activities that we have been talking about really over the past three years on how we have been managing this company, reducing the volatility, being very disciplined in portfolio management, being very disciplined with where we deploy our capital. And with the material improvements that we achieved at 1/1 that we just talked about and that we expect to expand upon in the coming renewals, we expect that steady improvement to continue. And so I would say all signs point to a significantly improved risk-adjusted return across the portfolio. So just a little bit more color on that.
Elyse Greenspan: Thanks. And then the equity portfolio went down from $1.3 billion to like $281 million in the quarter. Why did you guys take that portfolio down in the fourth quarter?
Mark Kociancic: Good morning, Elyse, it's Mark. So we have a strategic asset allocation table that we're pretty disciplined with. And it allows us flexibility to move between asset classes, whether it's on the fixed income side, private equity, public equity, private credit, et cetera, et cetera. So tactically, we had a large reduction of the equity portfolio in the fourth quarter, shifted into other assets that we felt were more attractive, but still consistent with that strategic asset allocation that we've been focused on since the 2021 Investor Day. So we will probably move around a bit in 2023, but stay disciplined to that SAA.
Elyse Greenspan: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question today comes from C. Gregory Peters with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Charles Peters: Well, good morning, everyone. I'd like to go back to, I think, in your comments, you talked about the annual ground-up reserve review that you do every year. And especially on the primary side, obviously, inflation is been a big issue in the statistics that came out in '22 couldn't have been anticipated in fiscal year '20 and '19. So can you talk to us about the process? What were the puts and takes for you to come out where you did? Some perspective there would be helpful.
Mark Kociancic: Yes. Good morning. It's Mark. So let me get into that just in a few ways. The process itself is year-round. And so we're looking at reserves throughout the year, performing reserve studies. It's quite comprehensive in terms of aligning, underwriting, pricing, reserving claims in the course of that process. So you've got many different stakeholders involved. And then it's quite ground up in terms of the analytics that go into it. And then I'd bring you back to principles that we set out back in 2020 about setting up prudent loss picks holding them in a disciplined fashion over time until we see a seasoning in the different lines of business. And for us, those are kind of a ground up rules and processes that we use to evaluate. Now in terms of what we did in Q4, I mentioned the asbestos and environmental reserves strengthening. So we've got roughly $20 billion of carried net reserves. We strengthened that by 138. We had some offsets, favorable offsets coming from shorter tail line and we had smaller, more marginal adjustments, pluses and minuses in both segments, but nothing approaching the 138 in the process. So overall, we feel very solid in terms of our loss position. And we obviously take into account macro factors like loss inflation by making sure that we've got prudent loss picks in our reserves. And then we do dynamic modeling. And I think one of the benefits that we have in our company is really the diversified nature of the lines of business that we have and the reserve profile that we have. There is no single emphasis on one class, and that diversification helps to absorb any potential volatility that might come from loss inflation factors, in general. So that gives us, I think, just a better mix or diversification of reserves to handle these types of issues.
Charles Peters: Got it. I guess -- so my follow-up question, well, sticking with the specialty insurance platform. We look at your primary growth 18% for the year, I think, 19% for the quarter. I think after we get through earnings season, that's going to be a pretty outstanding result relative to some of your peer groups. So could you spend a minute and talk to us about where you're seeing growth? I guess, not only looking back to '22, but when we think about '23?
Michael Karmilowicz: Sure. Thank you for the question. So a couple of things. We have a lot of moving pieces in the organization, but the reality is our underwriting profit focus is, first and foremost, the number one thing we tend to focus on. And given that with all the things we have from scaling up our existing businesses and given our market share and given the opportunity we have with our expansion, you're starting to see a lot of these things play out. So when I think about the opportunity for that growth, it's not without discipline and cycle management that comes along with that growth. But for us, we see what the market opportunity lies in front of us. So we have the expertise we can deploy anywhere in the world now with the expansion now starting to play through and some of the things we've done, you're starting to see that come into play. And in addition to that, we have the ability to have the flexibility rather to drive this in a local region. So I think growth has been great, 32 straight quarters. The specialty businesses where we see areas like we opened up and you saw adding to that, which would be aviation and energy and construction, complementing our credit political risk and surety, helping offset some of the things that are happening with like transaction liability, then you go over to some of the market and property. And when we have and see these things that are actually opening themselves up, we can do this anywhere in the world. And I think for us, our benefit has been our agility and the way we actually are able to capitalize with our speed to market. And we'll continue to do this. We're going to refine our offering, whether it's retail or wholesale. We're going to figure out where the opportunity is globally. And if we don't like what we see from a risk-adjusted return basis, we'll pull back, and we'll do the right thing. You've seen that with our cycle management and comp. You see that we're doing in D&O and if we don't see those things, we're going to sit there and we'll continue to look for opportunity where it best fits and the growth just comes with that. And so we'll continue to drive that opportunity where we see it, and it's about playing offense and not defense.
Juan Andrade: Yes, Greg, this is Juan Andrade. I would add a couple of thoughts because I think that was well said by Mike. Look, I think at the end of the day, there's a couple of key factors. One, we're highly diversified within the Primary Insurance division. And so that means that we can find opportunities in the market where they exist. And as Mike pointed out, it's always about profitability. So for instance, is you're not seeing a good environment for financial lines right now, but you're seeing a very good environment for things like property, casualty still and other lines of business. So that allows us to essentially pick our spots and be able to do that. The other point that I don't think can be underestimated is really the agility of our company. And I mentioned that in our prepared remarks, our ability to be able to pivot. We're pretty lean, we're pretty entrepreneurial, we have great relationships with our distribution, and we have a lot of good talent in this company. And all of these things are basically what enable us to continue the momentum that you have seen from us really over the last number of years.
Charles Peters: Got it. Thank you for the answers.
Juan Andrade: Thanks Greg.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Mike Zaremski with BMO. Please go ahead.
Michael Zaremski: Hi, good morning. Maybe first question, thinking about capital management and capital uses. Should we expect a bit more kind of operating leverage? So when we look at the premiums to equity ratio, is there room for that to inch up given kind of better economics you're attaining? And also just thinking about capital uses in '23, should we be still thinking that the growth will kind of eat up most of the capital versus buybacks?
Mark Kociancic: Mike, it's Mark. So a few points here. I do think we've got ample capital to take on the opportunities of 2023, and it includes more than just the traditional balance sheet. You're looking at what we call our capital shield, so Logan ILWs, CAT bonds, et cetera. Operating leverage, there's definitely more room on the balance sheet to expand that leverage. I think one of the key points to keep in mind is really the risk-adjusted return profile is improving. So you're seeing exposure being managed thoughtfully and the rate and the expected return go up significantly. And that's one of the key points that I think allows us to expand that operating leverage. We're also fairly well diversified with multiple income streams. And so I do expect the net income projections for the year to provide significant retained earnings to support growth. And we'll see how that growth comes about because there are other levers that we can pull if the opportunities in the market are even more significant than what we think they could be. But just in terms of your buyback comment, look, it's always on the table. We can pull that lever, but this is the best market we've seen in a generation. And so the value creation that comes out of the organic growth plan that we've got and the fact that we're ready for it in terms of balance sheet, teams, franchise, the whole ball of wax, you couldn't have a better alignment. So I think you'll see us really attack this opportunity in 2023 full borne. So I'll leave it there.
Michael Zaremski: That's helpful. My follow-up is on the alternative reinsurance, maybe ILS marketplace, given Mt. Logan is one of the leaders in that space. Is there -- are you seeing dislocation in that marketplace? And do you see that kind of persisting? I know there's some puts and takes on how that impacts someone like Everest. But what's going on in the ILS marketplace that you're seeing? And does that -- is that part of the reason you feel that the discipline within the overall reinsurance marketplace will continue?
James Williamson: Yes, Mike, this is Jim Williamson. Thanks for the question. I mean clearly, ILS has been a dislocated market coming into 1/1. And for many of the reasons that have affected everyone participating in this market, there have been a lot of CAT losses over the last few years. And I think, particularly around the margins, you had a lot of investors participating in ILS vehicles and maybe didn't quite understand or weren't quite prepared for the prospects of having multiple years in a row of CAT activity, which is not uncommon. These clusters happen. And so that has definitely, I think, put a number of investors in a position where they're on pause. You also have, obviously, the phenomena from those CAT losses, there's a lot of trapped capital that is just sidelined no matter what rates, terms and conditions are doing, they just can't deploy that capacity because it's preserved against prior events. And so that has definitely created and helped to contribute to a capacity crunch in our industry. Now from our perspective, that affects us in two ways. On the one hand, in our primary reinsurance business, our balance sheet reinsurance business, if you will, we're seeing all the phenomenal results that we've talked about plus 50, U.S. property CAT pricing plus 40 international terms and conditions getting better attachment points rising. And that's all happening because there's more demand for reinsurance capacity than there is supply. And part of the reason that's occurred is because of the crunch in ILS. The second thing that it does is it makes it a little more challenging for us to raise funds in Mt. Logan because investors are sidelined or they have trapped capital. In terms of that trade, we'll take that trade all day long. Driving improvement in our core reinsurance business is our first priority. And it also inures to the benefit of our Mt. Logan investors who are consistently invested in the ILS space, they get better returns as well. So we like that. At the same time, what I would say is, we have been getting traction in Logan. We did raise money in 1/1. And the team is doing an excellent job of conveying our value proposition to potential investors. And in particular, unlike a lot of other vehicles in the market, our investors get the same results that Everest gets. We're not making money when they're not making money. So that's a real focus of ours. And I think that's very compelling. We have a strong pipeline of investor interest, and our expectation is that Mt. Logan will grow over the course of time, and that's a key priority for us.
Michael Zaremski: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.
Ryan Tunis: Good morning, guys. Just a few, hopefully, quick ones for Jim. First question, just, I guess, following up on Mayer and Elyse's line questioning on how the changes in the portfolio might map to the actual CAT numbers. So you mentioned that you're shying away from kind of like the 1-in-3 type of risk, but -- what I'm struggling with is that like in the supplement, the 1 in 20 looked like it grew about as much as the 1 in 250. So from the PML disclosures alone, it's difficult for me to really see what's going on. So I don't know the right way to ask it, maybe -- could you give us some idea over the past few years, like how much of your CAT losses have come from sort of those frequency layers that were even more frequent than 1 in 20? I'm not really sure, but just any numbers would be helpful.
James Williamson: Yes. Sure, Ryan. Yes, it's Jim, obviously. Look, it's an important question. And so I'm going to give you a few threads that I think really help describe what's happening in the portfolio. So obviously, and I can't restate it enough, exceptional execution at 1/1 which really followed on really strong execution in 2022, as we reposition the portfolio and rightsized our CAT risk for our company and a go-forward and sustainable basis, and that's really critical work. What I would do, if you want to think about movement of P&L, first of all, I wouldn't look at it on a year-over-year basis. Too much has changed since 1/1 '22. I'd really look at our more recent PMLs, whether you want to pick 10/1 or 7/1. And I think that shows what is essentially a flat profile of PML deployment at a variety of return periods, whether it's 1 in 20 or 1 in 250, 1 in 250 is down by about $50 million from 10/1. 1 in 20 is essentially the same number, it's down by $5 million. And so that gives you some sense of what we expect. What I would say in terms of the balance of where CAT losses have been going in the industry is, it's not so much that what percent is the 1-in-3 event versus the 1-in-20 event. It's where are you getting appropriately paid? Where are you getting reasonable risk-adjusted returns? And so for us, our portfolio has shifted clearly toward the areas where risk-adjusted returns are strong and warrant the risk we're taking. And that's the 1 in 20 to 1 in 250 range. We feel really good about that. The other thing to keep in mind that's been happening against the backdrop of all this is the discipline required in the underwriting and the terms and conditions to ensure that you're inflation loading, your programs appropriately. Those are all things which will also over time and order the benefit of our portfolio. Now obviously, the actual result is going to be highly dependent on which events occur. But if we have a year where you have a couple of large events, but you also have a frequency of smaller CATS, we think our portfolio will perform better now -- meaningfully better now than it would have a year ago and that's because of all the actions we take in the rate all the improvements we've made. So hopefully, that gives you some perspective on how to interpret those PMLs.
Ryan Tunis: Yes, that's helpful. And then just lastly, can you give us an update on kind of how you're thinking about your original Hurricane Ian impact?
James Williamson: Yes. Sure. Yes, Ryan, it's Jim again. Yes, we feel very good about it. I mean, obviously, it seems like it was a long time ago, but it's still relatively early. As you've seen, there have been puts and takes in the industry in terms folks adjusting their view of what their ultimate loss is going to be in terms of our clients' scenes, and so we're watching that very closely. A key thing to keep in mind, which we communicated in the last quarterly call when we talked about Ian is in terms of any upside risk to the numbers we've put up, we feel very good about that because of the protection that we received from our cap-on program. As we had indicated, in the last call, we have about $350 million of potentially exposed cap-on limit, which will engage if PCS reaches $48.1 billion in their estimate. They're currently at $47.4 million and we'll recover on a pro rata basis up to $64 billion or $63.8 billion. So we don't really have any kind of material concern about upside to that number, whether it ultimately there's a good guy in there, it's going to take quite a bit of time for that to play out, but we're watching it very closely.
Ryan Tunis: Appreciate it. Thanks.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to management for any final remarks.
Juan Andrade: Great. Thank you all for your questions and the excellent discussion this morning. This is Juan Andrade. I am very optimistic about the opportunities ahead and our ability to continue driving a world-class platform. Our strategy is clear. Our businesses are growing with strong resilient portfolios, and we have an attractive risk-return profile. This is all underpinned by our strong culture, which is an increasingly significant competitive advantage. We will expand on this foundation to accelerate our progress and create increased value for our investors, colleagues and clients around the world. Thank you for your time with us today and for your continued support of our company. I look forward to speaking with all of you again when we discuss our first quarter 2023 results. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-10-27 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Everest Re Group Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. . Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Matt Rohrmann, Senior Vice President, Head of Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Matthew Rohrmann : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Everest Re Group Limited third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. The Everest executives leading today's call are Juan Andrade, President and CEO; and Mark Kociancic, Executive Vice President and CFO. We are also joined by other members of the Everest management team. Before we begin, I will preface the comments on today's call by noting that Everest's SEC filings, including extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements, management comments regarding estimates, projections and similar are subject to the risks, uncertainties and assumptions as noted in these filings. Management may also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These items are reconciled in our earnings release and financial supplement. With that, I'll turn the call over to Juan.
Juan Andrade: Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. The current heightened and complex risk environment underscores the value of Everest's balance sheet and our commitment to support our customers with solutions vital to navigating this turbulent period. Everest's diversification strategy and underwriting discipline mitigated our exposure to one of the largest hurricane losses in U.S. history. With our well-defined strategy, we are poised to take advantage of the hardening market, focused on segments with the best risk-adjusted returns. Both underwriting businesses delivered sub-90 attritional combined ratios, and we are profitable on a year-to-date basis. Led by top talent, we continued to grow and diversify globally by business and product line. We are focused on executing our strategic plan as we build the company for the long term. Our purpose is to provide protection and stability in the face of uncertainty. And as someone with roots and family in Florida, the devastation caused by Ian is heartbreaking and our thoughts are with all those affected. I am grateful to our colleagues around the world who are supporting our customers and communities as they rebuild. We have improved the company's risk profile across both Reinsurance and Insurance, reducing our cat exposure with a more durable, resilient portfolio capable of absorbing a historic industry loss like Ian and containing it to an earnings event at just 1% of our estimated industry loss and with our Reinsurance segment being below 1%. We apply the same consistency and discipline to how we develop the overall portfolio, manage expenses, invest our capital and expand operational efficiencies. In short, we're managing what is in our control and building flexibility into the business. Everest value proposition has never been more important to our clients and partners, and we are committed as both insurers and reinsurers to being where we are needed. Now I'll turn to the company's financial results, first from the group and then for each of the underwriting businesses. In the third quarter, we grew gross written premiums by over 6% in constant dollars. Growth was broadly diversified, led by continued double-digit growth in Insurance. We continued to benefit from positive rate and increased exposure growth. We are ahead of loss trend, and that is before the effect of all the deliberate portfolio management actions we are taking to improve margin. The combined ratio for the group was 112%, including the previously announced pretax catastrophe losses net of recoveries and reinstatement premiums of $730 million, primarily from Hurricane Ian. It is important to note Everest has additional hedging protection in place in the form of cat bonds. We did not include a cat bond recovery in our net loss estimate. However, recovery start if the PCS industry event for Ian exceeds $48 billion. Mark will provide additional details. Again, the actions we took in both our businesses to reduce cat exposure have meaningfully benefited us. In Reinsurance, we significantly scaled back our retro, reduced participation in aggregate programs, shed cat exposed pro rata and exposure to lower layers of cat programs and achieved significant rate increases, higher attachment points and improved terms and conditions in the past several years. Reinsurance gross and net PMLs have reduced significantly across the entire curve. And in Insurance, we decreased gross PMLs for Southeast wind by over 40% since last year. Gross exposed limits in our U.S. property portfolio are down more than 35% year-over-year. Put this in concrete terms, our share of the industry loss for Ian is lower than any other major land falling hurricanes in more than 15 years. And we will continue to optimize our portfolio. Turning to our underlying performance in the third quarter. The group attritional combined ratio improved to 87.6% year-over-year with improvements in both segments and a new historic low for Insurance. The group attritional loss ratio was strong in the quarter at 60.2% with a 70 basis point improvement from last year. This includes an outstanding 110 basis point improvement year-over-year in Reinsurance. The group expense ratio in the quarter was stable at 5.5% and remains a competitive advantage. An elevated level of catastrophes during the third quarter resulted in a pretax underwriting loss of $367 million. Net investment income was $151 million, driven by stronger fixed income returns as new money yields continued to improve. As expected, this was partially offset by volatility in the equity markets. On a year-to-date basis, we generated net investment income of $620 million despite severe turbulence in all markets. Finally, operating cash flow for the quarter was strong at $1. 1 billion. We continued to execute our strategy despite the challenging environment, evidenced by our year-to-date profitability. Now turning to our Reinsurance business. Reinsurance gross written premiums increased 3.4% over last year on a constant dollar basis, excluding the impact of reinstatement premiums. Growth was broadly diversified, led by 16% growth in our global casualty and professional lines book, where we are focused on key seasons or achieving strong underlying profit improvement with pricing outpacing loss trend. This was offset by targeted reductions in our property book, which was down 8% over prior year as part of our strategy to improve the diversification and economics of our overall portfolio. We continued to benefit from a flight to quality, and we grew with our core clients. We're affording those new and expanded opportunities across their portfolios. This strategy serves us well. We bring clients a strong balance sheet, flexibility and expertise allowing us to target higher-margin opportunities in all lines of business and geographies. This is a key advantage of broad diversification. Fine ratio of 115% was driven by the previously announced pretax catastrophe loss net of recoveries and reinstatement premiums of $620 million from Hurricane Ian as well as the European hail storms Hurricane Fiona and Typhoon Nanmadol. Year-to-date, Reinsurance generated $14 million in underwriting profit. Our attritional combined ratio of 86.8 improved 30 basis points from the prior year, including a year-over-year attritional loss ratio improvement of 110 basis points to 59. 1%. Our attritional loss picks reflect our deliberate actions to improve the portfolio's risk-adjusted profitability. We continue to see improving loss ratios, while the pressure for increased commissions is easing. Everest is well positioned to benefit from the underlying rate increases and improving terms and conditions in the market post Ian. Events from the year will affect the January 1 renewal in a variety of ways. In North America, we expect the property market to be dislocated, particularly in property cat due to recent losses, combined with economic inflation, increasing demand and a meaningful contraction of capacity. Underlying casualty pricing should remain strong. Internationally, there are nuances depending on class and region, and we will flex accordingly. We are well positioned with the balance sheet capabilities and relationships to capitalize on the momentum fueling improved economics across property and casualty in a targeted and disciplined manner. Because of the balance between property and casualty in our book, we have the ability to dynamically deploy capital both across line and geography and can remain nimble and opportunistic as market conditions warrant, always within our defined risk appetite framework. Jim Williamson is available to provide additional details during the Q& A. Turning to our Insurance business. where we continue to achieve double-digit growth with sustained margin expansion. Growth in Insurance was strong. We achieved a new third quarter premium record for this segment with over $1.1 billion of gross written premium, up 13% in constant dollars.  Growth was broad and diversified across most lines and regions and was especially strong in U. S. casualty. Excluding D&O and transactional liability where the macro environment, a slowdown in M&A activity, IPOs, et cetera, has had an impact on deal flow, our growth was 20%. This is a testament to our underwriting discipline as we focus on trades meeting our underwriting return objectives. We are benefiting from additional premium on many inflation-sensitive lines, particularly in property, general liability and workers' compensation. We continue to exceed loss trends. Renewal rate and exposure ranged from high single digits to double digits for the quarter depending on line and geography, excluding workers' compensation, which is now a small part of our portfolio. In addition, both earned and new business rates meaningfully exceed renewal rate changes. The new business rate level bodes well for continued margin expansion as these policies renew and lost to more normalized levels in the future. Increasing rates are important, but risk selection, improving terms and conditions limits management and growth in inflation-sensitive exposures also contribute meaningfully to sustaining and increasing margins. Insurance growth was partially offset by continued actions to optimize the portfolio, including reductions in U.S. property catastrophe exposure. The impact of natural catastrophes, primarily Hurricane Ian, led to a $110 million pretax catastrophe loss net of recoveries and reinstatement premiums in the quarter and resulted in a combined ratio of 103.5%. As I mentioned earlier, underwriting actions to diversify our property portfolio made a significant difference in our results. We will continue to hold our portfolio to manage volatility. This discipline is reflected in our year-to-date underwriting profit of $95 million, and it is indicative of our progress in portfolio composition. The Insurance division's third quarter attritional combined ratio of 89.8% is the best in its history and a 50 basis point improvement from the third quarter last year. The attritional loss ratio for the quarter was 63. 2%, up slightly compared to Q3 2021, driven predominantly by business mix relative to last year. The year-to-date attritional loss ratio, which is less affected by timing and business mix, improved by almost a full point over last year. We continued to diversify internationally with progress in Europe, Latin America and Asia. We recently opened two new Everest Insurance operations in France and in Germany in addition to our operations in the Netherlands, Chile and Singapore. Our success continues to be powered by investments in great talent, and we continue to fuel our growth with sophisticated data, analytics and systems that support streamlined and best-in-class service across the organization. Michael Karmilowicz is on the call to provide more detail during the Q&A. Our discipline and seamless execution are essential to performing in today's environment. We are targeted in our approach. We're highly diversified by geography, business lines, product and in our people. We have a cultural advantage in how we manage the company. We view this as essential to cultivating excellence in our business, and we are proud to have been recently recognized as an industry leader in this area. I am very optimistic about Everest's ability to deliver superior value to our shareholders, clients and colleagues. Now I will turn the call over to Mark to take us through the financials in more detail. Mark?
Mark Kociancic: Thank you, Juan, and good morning, everyone. As Juan mentioned, given the impact of Hurricane Ian, Everest reported an operating loss of $5.28 per diluted share in the third quarter. We remain profitable year-to-date with operating income of $14.91 per diluted share, which demonstrates the resiliency of our diversified businesses and the disciplined execution of our strategy. Net income stands at $101 million year-to-date, while total shareholder return, or TSR, was minus 1% year-to-date, given the cat losses as well as continued volatility in the equity markets. Despite those headwinds, we improved our attritional combined ratio in both segments again while generating disciplined growth as pricing and terms remained attractive in a number of our core lines of business. Based on the underlying performance of the business, our team continued to execute at a high level despite the cat and macro volatility, and we remain well positioned to take advantage of opportunities present in the current marketplace. Looking at the group results for the third quarter of 2022, Everest reported gross written premiums of $3.7 billion representing 6% growth in constant dollars. The combined ratio of 112% for the quarter includes 27.4 points of losses from previously announced natural catastrophes, primarily from Hurricane Ian as well as European hailstorms, Hurricane Fiona and several other cat events around the globe. While it is still early days following Hurricane Ian, our industry and company net cat loss estimates are $55 billion and $600 million, respectively. Everest also has up to $350 million of cat bond protection that will begin to attach starting at a $48 billion PCS industry loss threshold for Ian. This recovery would be recognized on a pro rata basis up to a $64 billion PCS industry loss level. PCS has currently estimated the loss at roughly $41 billion. This potential recovery is currently not included in our $600 million Ian loss estimate, but it does provide significant downside protection should the industry loss grow. I would also like to mention that our exposure in Florida, which is primarily homeowners based, mitigates our exposure to auto and flood losses. And that our participation to the NFIP is deminimis. Group attritional loss ratio was 60.2%, a 70 basis point improvement over the prior year's quarter, led primarily by the Reinsurance segment, which I'll discuss in more detail in just a moment. The group's commission ratio improved 30 basis points to 20.9% on mix changes, while the group expense ratio was stable at 5.5%. Moving to the segment results. Starting with Reinsurance. The Reinsurance gross premiums written grew 3.4% to $2.6 billion in constant dollars. Growth in the quarter was driven primarily by casualty pro rata as well as strategic growth in other international lines. Combined ratio of 115% includes 32.5 points related to natural catastrophes, largely attributable to Hurricane Ian. The attritional loss ratio improved 1.1 points to 59.1% as we continued to achieve more favorable rate and terms as well as shifting the book towards accounts with better risk-adjusted return potential. Commission ratio was 23.9%, broadly in line with last year. The underwriting expense ratio was 2.4% as earned premium gross and we remain focused on operational efficiency across the entire platform. Moving to Insurance, where we continue to build solid momentum. Gross written premiums grew 13.1% in constant dollars to $1.1 billion in the quarter. The combined ratio for the quarter was 103.5% up modestly year-over-year due to the cat losses I mentioned earlier, but the attritional combined ratio improved 50 basis points to 89.8% for the quarter and 120 basis points year-to-date as rate and exposure continued to outpace trend, further supported by our focus on risk selection and favorable loss experience. The attritional loss ratio was slightly higher year-over-year due to mix of business. The commission ratio improved 1 point, largely driven by business mix and increased ceding commissions. The underwriting-related expense ratio was 14%, 10 basis points of reduction over the prior year, which is within our expectations as we continue to expand our global footprint and continue to proactively invest in a number of growth initiatives across the business. And finally, to cover investments, tax and the balance sheet, net investment income for the quarter was $151 million. We are continuing to see the benefit of higher new money yields in the fixed income portfolio, while the lag in reporting for alternatives was a modest drag on results in the quarter. Overall, our reinvestment rate continues to trend higher as new money yields, which were roughly 4% just a few months ago were now north of 5% in today's market. We continue to have a short asset duration of approximately 3.1 years. And as a reminder, 22% of our fixed income investments are in floating rate securities. Private equity investments yielded a negative $30 million P&L impact in Q3 as equity markets have declined in 2022. As a reminder, they are reported on a one quarter lag. For the third quarter of 2022, our operating income tax rate was approximately minus 22% due to the geographic mix of income and loss significantly impacted by the cat losses and thus favorable to our working assumption of 11% to 12% for the year. Shareholders' equity ended the quarter at $7.6 billion, driven primarily by the third quarter rise in interest rates. There was a corresponding negative $671 million impact on the value of available-for-sale fixed income securities. Year-to-date, unrealized losses in the fixed income portfolio equates to approximately $2. 2 billion. However, operating cash flow of $1.1 billion was very strong during the quarter, and it stands at $2.7 billion year-to-date. We also repurchased $58 million of our own stock during the quarter as well as approximately $6 million of subordinated debt. Book value per share ended the quarter at $195.27 per share while the book value, excluding unrealized depreciation and depreciation of securities stood at $245.29 versus $252.2 per share at the end of 2021 due to the lower net income and foreign exchange headwinds of a stronger U.S. dollar. Net leverage at quarter end stood at 25.1%, an increase in the leverage ratio driven by the unrealized fixed income market value declines noted previously. In conclusion, Everest ended the third quarter of 2022 with favorable underlying results, notwithstanding the notable catastrophes. We have ample capital to take advantage of the current environment, and we continue to see good opportunities to invest in the platform and scalability of our company. That summarizes our third quarter results. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Matt to begin our Q&A.
Matthew Rohrmann: Thanks, Mark. Operator, we are now ready to open the line for questions. We do ask you to please limit your questions to one question plus one follow-up, and to join queue, if you have any additional questions. 
Operator:  Our first question comes from Michael Phillips from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. 
Michael Phillips: First question, Juan, is sitting around the dislocated property cat market. And I kind of want to get on to, I guess, both your willingness and ability to take part of that. You've been talking a lot about reducing volatility and kind of shy away from that business, but now things have changed. And I would ask on your willingness, how much do you want to grow in that business, but I think the answer is probably going to be what the function of how rates move at the beginning of the year. So maybe you could share with us, is there some kind of threshold you have in mind where you would like to participate pretty aggressively to be willing to grow in that property cap market? And then assume that you do want to, how much is your ability to do so inhibited by the markdowns in book value and AOCI impacts, especially with what we're seeing from S&P recently. Thanks.
Juan Andrade: That's great, Mike. That's a pretty comprehensive question. So let me give you some thoughts on that, and then I'll invite some of my colleagues as well. Let me address the growth question first. And as I just said in my prepared remarks, we absolutely continue to see significant opportunities for growth in 2023. And Everest is very well positioned to achieve that growth given the market, as you just described it, also the strong client relationships and broker relationships that we have, relationships that have been built over decades. We also have the strength in the portfolio and we have expertise across lines and geographies that allow us to deploy capacity where we're seeing the best opportunities. So again, very bullish about the growth opportunities that we see going forward. In the property cat space, specifically to your question, the hardening that we're already seeing is going to intensify post Ian, and we've seen that in the discussions that we've been having initially in Monte Carlo, but certainly post CIAB and individual discussions that we've been having with our cedes. Our key priorities with regard to property cat are pretty straightforward. Number one is continue to harden our portfolio from a limits, structure, rate and term standpoint. Basically, continue the work that we've been doing now for the past several years. Number two is get paid significantly more for the risk that we're already taking. And number three, prudently grow with core cedes where we see the opportunity, where we see the alignment of entries, et cetera, all of this, however, within the trading range that we have outlined with respect to natural catastrophe exposure. Look, Mike, the bottom line is the market affords us tremendous opportunity right now and we will select the best options to maximize our returns and appropriately manage the volatility. So from a growth perspective, that's how we're looking at the market right now. I would invite Jim Williamson to talk a little bit more specifically about pricing and some of the other questions that you had as well.
James Williamson : Sure. Thanks for the question, Mike. It's Jim. Yes, I would reiterate some of what Juan said to start by just really conveying how tremendous we think this market opportunity is. And I think in the U.S., that is really a complete dislocation of the property cat market, and it's going to allow us to do a number of things. Juan describe the categories, let me give you a little bit more detail because I think it's critical. On the first part, in terms of hardening our portfolio, even while the market has been taking rate over the last couple of years, I think we've still been living, for the most part, with soft market terms, conditions and contracts. So that's a key priority. We're making progress on that front. I think you'll see us continue to trade away from some of the areas of the market, which really makes us susceptible to climate change, things like aggregate programs, cat exposed pro rata, some of the peak risks that comes along with the retro book. And then on the second piece, which is really about getting paid more, to put some context around that, I would say the expectation that the market had for pricing going into Monte Carlo in terms of average rate increase is now the minimum for programs that really haven't been affected by loss and it will go up from there. And while I expect clients to try to mitigate some of those rate increases by taking higher attachment points, which we're in favor of, my sense at this point is that rate change will be top line accretive for us even if we are making changes to the portfolio. And then the last piece around growth with target cedants, that's a very real opportunity for us. We're -- in front of us. We're already having discussions with our core trading partners around the world. There is an intense demand for capacity in general and Everest's capacity specifically, and we are being very thoughtful about picking up high-quality opportunities. So I think all of that nets up to a higher margin portfolio, a portfolio that's, I would guess, more likely to be bigger after 1/1 than it is today, but also one, as Juan indicated, that's well within the defined trading range that we set out in 2021.
Juan Andrade: And maybe what I would add to that, Mike, is that at the end of all of this, we can see additional premium coming in because of this, but also reduced exposure overall, which for us is a terrific trade.
Michael Phillips: Okay. It's pretty comprehensive. Second question then. You talked about the cap on recovery -- potential recovery, given where PCS might have. Are there other potential recoveries that might come that might be more likely for Ian relative to other prior hurricanes that you've experienced? I'm thinking maybe takes that you have more LAE versus loss mix this time that could come back if litigation doesn't take off or things like that. So other possible recoveries like that, that might happen more so for this storm than prior storms.
Juan Andrade: Yes. Thanks, Mike. Look, I think a couple of thoughts, and I think Mark Kociancic alluded to some of these in his statement. Look, the cat bond that would start attaching in excess of $48 billion I think it's a primary downside protection that is definitely worth keeping in mind and thinking about. As you know, PCS is the trigger for that. PCS right now is effectively at $40.9 billion, rounded up to $41 billion. And we could potentially foresee that loss growing to that trigger point at $48 billion. And as Mark mentioned, that would be a pro rata recovery up into the $60 billion range, and it would be significant downside protection. So I think that's one of the most important things to keep in mind. The other thing that I think Mark mentioned that's worth spending a little bit of time on is our exposure to Florida is particularly to the specialty carriers that focus on homeowners. So to the extent that this is more of an auto loss where it has a higher proportion of auto losses as we are seeing already in the market, that's essentially a good thing for us. The other thing that is a good thing for us is essentially a higher percentage of flood losses as we're also seeing in the market right now and also the fact that we don't really have a significant participation at all in the NFIP. So I think all of these things bode well for the estimate that we've put up there. The other part of it is we do have a good LAE load into our estimates as well, given the dynamics of the Florida environment as well. So from that perspective, we continue to see this as being a prudent estimate that we have out there right now. But let me ask my colleagues and see if they would add anything to that answer as well.
James Williamson: Yes. Sure, Mike, it's Jim Williamson again. Just to add a little bit of flavor to what Juan has already described. On LAE loading in particular, I think we've obviously leveraged a lot of the data we have to come up with a loading for LAE that we think is extremely prudent. And so if there is better-than-expected activity on that front, which I think is possible, that would definitely enure to our benefit. The other thing I would sort of say to put this in some concrete terms, I mean I think our view would be if the loss ends up being smaller than we've indicated in terms of total industry loss, our view is that our share would remain relatively stable over a reasonable range. So that means our net loss would ultimately come in smaller. And then to Juan's earlier point, there's also upside protection in the form of cap bonds if PCS calls an industry loss that ends up being larger, which sort of caps our upside dollar value of net loss. So I think it puts us in a really confident position relative to the net loss that we had indicated.
Michael Karmilowicz : And this is Mike Karmilowicz. I would just add on the Insurance division side, we certainly benefit from third-party reinsurance as well. We do obviously have different structures, but not to get into details, but we do have quota share per risk and other kind of extra wells that we'll be able to get some benefit from as well.
Operator: The next question comes from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. 
Elyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good morning. So my first question, I guess, picking up on the Reinsurance side. So it sounds like, right, you guys will try to manage any increase within your risk tolerances. But you could write more business, I think you said with the existing clients. So as you see the market evolving next year, how do you envision that coming together in both your cat load and your P&L? Would they be higher? Or how do you envision managing those next year?
James Williamson: Yes, Elyse, this is Jim Williamson. Yes, first of all, to reiterate some of what I said earlier. I mean, I think this is a fantastic market opportunity. And what that translates into is an ability for us to really set terms and conditions in a way that are obviously going to be highly favorable. And I think that'll include an ability for us to manage our total exposures, Juan had indicated while still driving higher revenue.  And more importantly, much better margins, much better contracts, terms, conditions, attachment points, etc. And so I would say, my sense is we're not going to have to stretch our total risk load, whether you measure it in PML, or the cat load, in order to drive the types of outcomes we're describing, which again, could include some really nice growth, as well as margin expansion. 
Juan Andrade : And I think -- this is Juan, Elyse, and again thanks for the question. Again, our goal is to expand risk adjusted returns, right. It's really to expand our margin. And that's really the significant opportunity that we see in front of us. And as I just said to Mike a few seconds ago, the reality is, with the current pricing, the current terms, we think we can grow the top line without necessarily growing the exposure. And our strategy to continue to manage volatility for the long term, to diversify the company is still very much in place. But we do have the nuances of this market, which will allow us to make those trades where we think we can expand margins, and we can continue to grow, given the conditions in place right now.
Elyse Greenspan : Thanks. And then my second question, you guys pointed out mix impacting the insurance underlying loss ratio. How should we think about the underlying loss ratio trending from here as you're getting price above trend, and we're also thinking about mix shift. Would you expect improvement in that number? I'm not just talking about the Q4. I'm also thinking about 2023 as well.
Juan Andrade : Yeah, no, thank you, Elyse. And look at what I would guide you to is what I said in my prepared remarks. And this is Juan. We just look at the year to date attritional loss ratio for the insurance division. And that's basically 80 basis points better than the prior year. And the way we get there is through a lot of the levers that I've talked about in the past, right. It's the cycle management. It's the diversity of our -- of our business. We're able to move pretty nimbly to lines that have better risk adjusted returns, better profitability, et cetera, et cetera.  Our commitment is to continue to improve that profitability and the margin within the insurance division. And I think, as I said, in prior calls, you go back to the end of 2019, where that was running around the 96. Now you're running sub-90, on the attritional combined ratio for the division. And that's what you should expect. I mean, that's the commitment. And that's where we're driving this to going forward. But I would invite Mike Karmilowicz to maybe to add to that.
Michael Karmilowicz : Yeah, I would just add a couple things. One, this is a long term game. We continue to focus on this business that drives the right margins. And the other piece too, is we focus heavily on the combined ratio as well. So it's the entire package. And yes, you've seen over the last from a rolling perspective in the last 24 months, we've actually brought our combined ratio down 24 point -- I'm sorry, 5 points alone. So our goal is to continue to drive the ultimate loss ratio, and the overall results of the organization. Exactly what Juan said. 
Elyse Greenspan : Thank you. 
Juan Andrade : Thanks, Elyse.
Operator: The next question comes from Brian Meredith from UBS. Please go ahead.
Brian Meredith : Yes, thank you. A couple questions here. Just first I'm just curious, how does Mt Logan going to fare in this event? And I'm just curious on that topic, how does that kind of interplay with Everest's willingness to write kind of gross cat exposure in the marketplace?
James Williamson : Sure, Brian, this is Jim Williamson. And a couple of things. Mt Logan is structured, essentially, on a quota share basis. And so the results that Everest generates for its own balance sheet are the same results that our Mt Logan investors experience, which is I think, a differentiator for us because it creates an incredible alignment of interests. And it means in situations where we have a large loss events, the investors in Mt Logan are getting the exact experience that we're having on our site.  So it'll be very consistent that way. One thing that I would mention, obviously, any given quarter and the third quarter in particular, can have elevated cat losses. You really need to look at it over time. And I would say, on a year-to-date basis, while we have had significant cat activity this year, we've also collected a great deal of cat premium, and that is to the benefit of our Mt Logan investors.  And so I think, I don't think there'll be any surprises in that for them. And then, just a little comment on the external environment around ILS and fundraising. We have a very robust pipeline of ILS investment opportunities. I think there's a lot of interest in the offering that we have in Mt Logan, and in particular, based on the factor that I just mentioned around alignment of interests, it is a more challenging environment to raise ILS capital, just because people are getting at a rethink.  But that's what's driving a lot of the hardening and the dislocation we've seen in the market. I think the good news is, from our perspective, we think about gross lines management. Really is an independent factor. And so whether we raise, X or Y amount of money in Logan is not going to affect how we think about our gross line underwriting. We're really looking to drive gross profits. That translates into net profit for our balance sheet as well as good results for our Logan investors. And we're going to continue that approach.
Brian Meredith : Great, thank you. That's helpful. And then Juan, I'm just curious, you may have kind of alluded this to your comments. But what are your thoughts on the casualty reinsurance market here? Are these events going to have a favorable impact on pricing? And in terms of conditions in the casualty reinsurance market, and it sounds like you're well-positioned to take advantage of that, if that's the case?
Juan Andrade : Yeah, Brian, I would agree with you. Look, I think number one, I think we are very well positioned for frankly, the reasons that I stated earlier, right? We're well diversified. We have the clients and the broker relationships. We have the balance sheet. And so from that perspective, we feel very good about where we are. And you saw it in the numbers that we quoted this morning, right? So global casualty book, and reinsurance grew by 16% in the quarter. And the reason for that is because we do see the opportunity continuing, right?  We do expect primary rates to keep up with trends in 2023 in the casualty lines. We expect reinsurance terms and conditions to be stable to improving. And that will allow us to continue to deploy additional capacity into the space.  And look, when you think about the macro factors that are impacting that, there's a lot of risk in the environment, right. So if you think about social inflation in the U.S., if you think about economic inflation around the world, companies are being very disciplined, right. And so from that perspective, we do expect that pricing, terms and conditions to remain favorable throughout 2023. I think that's, again, a great opportunity for us to continue executing on our strategy, which is diversifying the book. If you look at our numbers in the supplement now, our reinsurance division is basically now split 50-50 between property and casualty. And that's important, because we're not a one trick pony, right? We have levers to pull, and we're pulling them. But let me invite Jim to also maybe deepen that answer. 
James Williamson : Sure. Thanks, Juan. Yeah, Brian, I think what our expectation is, and what we're starting to see, even in the 11/1renewals, for example, it's relatively light, but we are seeing some indications is that we've really started to see the leveling of ceding commissions play itself out, we expected that to begin to occur. That is in fact occurring. In fact, we're starting to see some examples of ceding commission's receding a little bit, which we think is quite healthy. And I do think to a degree that's tied to what's happening in the property cap market. And when we engage our cedants, you know, we really try to come up with constructive solutions across lines for those customers.  And in many cases they're absolutely willing to discuss ceding commission reduction on core casualty programs, in some cases related to an increase in available cat capacity or a restructuring of another program. And so all the cards are on the table that way. And I do think that, combined with the ongoing strength in the underlying market that Juan talked about, means that casualty will be a great opportunity for us in 2023. 
Brian Meredith : Thank you. 
Juan Andrade : Thanks, Brian.
Operator: The next question comes from Josh Shanker from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Josh Shanker : Yeah, thank you. I wanted to hear a little bit about your outwards reinsurance purchasing. What might happen to that next year, to the extent to which you're reliant on the ILS markets and as the next few years go by, and perhaps investors in those markets pull capital out? What it means for the degree to which you protect yourself in retro and reinsurance line?
Juan Andrade : Thanks, Josh. This is Juan. Let me let me start that and then I'll ask Mike Karmilowicz to talk more about the cedant reprogram within the insurance division. Look, I think as we've talked about in the past, we are not dependent on retro, on the ILS market, et cetera, to deploy capacity. And I think that is one of the significant advantages that we have here at Everest where we have a capital shield. We have the balance sheet to be able to do what we need to do. Some of our peer competitors are not in that situation. And it's going to be a very difficult renewal in some ways to January 1, because they're also still in the point of trying to line up the retro and the capacity, so they know how much they can deploy. We are not in that situation.  And so we're actively working in the market to be able to deploy capacity, according to the strategy that that we outlined a few minutes ago. But let me ask Mike to jump in and talk a little bit about the cedant reprogram that we employ within the insurance division.
Michael Karmilowicz : Yeah. Thanks, Juan. Thanks, Josh, for the question. I think specific to the reinsurance business, the reality is just like Juan said, we're not relying on third party coverage, even though we do purchase and manage our portfolio that way. It doesn't help it or doesn't -- is not necessary for us to execute our business plan. So we see that market having impact and I think we'll see some things -- I don't think it'll be material. But for us, having the wherewithal, the financial strength of Everest, and having all the different scale that we've created over the last couple of years gives us the availability to be able to execute our plans, with not being reliant on it.  I do will tell you, I do think it'll have impact and behavior on a lot of peers who are relying on reinsurance.
Josh Shanker : Thank you. And just a question on the investment portfolio? Is there any arbitrage opportunity for you to crystallize and recognize investment losses in order to have the opportunity to redeploy to higher yield? Or is it just a matter of taking expiring bonds and redeploying them at the current opportunity?
Mark Kociancic: Josh, it's Mark. So we have that opportunity set. But we do have a few other considerations in that kind of decision tree. So one, you've got the strength of the operating cash flow coming in and the maturing portfolio. So that's feeding quite a bit of cash into the current reinvestment structure that we have in money yields.  The second point is, where are we with rates in general, I think the FOMC caught the market off guard in late September with their rate rise. And you have a question here is, are they done? We've seen them kind of undershoot throughout the year. And so it's also a question of when you go in. Having said that, I would say that we are looking to lengthen duration a bit on the fixed income side. And we do have the significant allocation to floating rate securities, the '22 points which rises in that environment. So I think we're quite comfortable with both the pace and the direction that we're moving in. But your first option is definitely something that's on the table if we want it.
Josh Shanker : Thanks for the answers. 
Juan Andrade : Thanks, Josh.
Operator: The next question comes from Michael Zelensky from BMO. Please go ahead.
Michael Zelensky : Hey, good morning. Follow up to the last question on the investment portfolio. I'm curious, what's the duration of the floating rate portfolio or maybe the yield to that we should think about in the floating rate portfolio.
Juan Andrade : Well, the duration is de minimis. You're dealing with a 0.1, 0.2 type of effective duration calculation on it. The yield itself on a standalone basis is quite attractive, just depending on the type of CLO we're dealing with. So it's pretty much an investment grade portfolio. The triple As, the triple Bs, you're going to get different series of yields between them. So you can get anything from six handles to even upwards of a nine on depending on the type of credit quality that's being discussed.
Michael Zelensky : Okay, interesting. Thank you. Moving to outside the investment portfolio, clear in the commentary that you feel rates are in excess of loss trends, which bodes well for margins. You know, I heard your commentary on ceding commissions from the reinsurance side. Kind of just curious, have rates and maybe I just need to read that -- reread the transcript. There's a lot of good stuff in the prepared remarks, have rates on the primary side decelerated a bit 3Q versus kind of the first half of the year or are they holding kind of that. 
Juan Andrade : Mike, this is Juan. No, they're actually quite steady and frankly, in some lines, they've actually improved. And so we have not seen a deceleration in the third quarter over the second quarter.
Michael Zelensky : Okay, okay. Interesting. And just, it sounds like you guys don't want to quantify what the dollar amount of recoveries would be between like the $48.9 billion if it hits it, versus your $55 billion peg on the industry losses? Is my thinking about that correctly? Will it just be significant?
Juan Andrade : No, no, during my prepared remarks, Mike, I was making the point that we have a $350 million limit on our cat bond between industry loss of $48.9 billion and approximately $64 billion. It's really a pro rata recovery, depending on where PCS ultimately sets their industry loss peg, right. So currently, they are below that $40.9 billion, if I recall correctly. So there is downside protection. And obviously, our loss pick for the industry is at a $55 billion. So you'd have full recovery in essence with, maybe some basis risk between our pegs and whatever the cap on is coming out with. That gives you a sense of how it could develop.
Michael Zelensky : Okay, understood. Thank you for the color. 
Juan Andrade : Thanks Mike.
Operator: The next question comes from Meyer Shields from KBW. Please go ahead.
Meyer Shields : Great, thank you. A couple of I think quick questions. First, in the context of Matt Logan or ILS investors, are there new investors that are now looking at the asset classes that you're either speaking with or observing?
Mark Kociancic: Hey, it's Mark Meyer. So there's definitely, I think a lot of emphasis on sophisticated investors who have been in the asset space for quite some time. We have, I would say, a pretty good pipeline, a high degree of interest, particularly given the opportunities they have with Everest. The fact that we have such a strong alignment with the underwriting of our cat book in reinsurance division. So from that standpoint, like I said, nice pipeline and sophisticated investors and lots of money to deploy.  Tactically, at different layers, and we're fortunate that we can meet those different types of appetite, because of our scale.
Meyer Shields : Okay, that's very helpful. Thanks. And then just a small question in terms of operations when you've got an event like Hurricane Ian, how should we think about the impact on the acquisition expense ratio related to just big cat losses?
James Williamson : Yeah, Meyer, it's Jim Williamson, I think you might be referring to, primarily on the reinsurance side, in terms of what our condition ratio would be in a quarter where we have a significant cat event and reinstatement premiums. And look reinstatement premiums do come with acquisition costs. They tend to be significantly lower than our average. And so on balance they would tend to bring down the average acquisition cost of the division. So I think that's the question you're asking, if it's not, though, please let me know. 
Meyer Shields : Yeah, no, that's helpful. I was actually asking about incentive compensation and whether it is a change to year-to-date numbers because of the loss.
James Williamson : Pardon me. Meyer, say it one more time.
Meyer Shields : I was asking you about whether any of the incentive costs have been accrued in the first half of the year or reversed when you've got a single large loss?
James Williamson : Yeah, okay. I see your point, Meyer. On a reinsurance basis. I think that's a relatively minor issue. And so that would not be the factor transcribing. And so there's that component. I would say, I don't know, Mike, if there's anything that you would add on the insurance side. 
Michael Karmilowicz : I don't have anything to add on the insurance side. 
James Williamson : Yeah, I think it's a relatively minor thing. 
Meyer Shields : Perfect, thank you so much.
Operator: The next question comes from Yaron Kinar from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Yaron Kinar: Good morning, everybody. I want to circle back to the cat load. And clearly we're seeing an improvement in the cat load and an improvement in the market share. No doubt about that. At the same time, I think if we look at year-to-date cat losses. And extrapolate into fourth quarter we are getting to about 10% cat load range for the year. And that's awful. I think a relatively normal industry cat last year of call it, $100 billion $110 billion.  And that just -- I think it's still coming up a little bit ahead of what you had guided to for the year. So I was hoping to get a better understanding of that delta. And I appreciate the fact that you haven't captured any of the cap on recoveries on Ian yet, but I would think that those only start recovering if the loss really starts spiking to the point that we are well above an annualized -- normalized cat load.
James Williamson : Sure, Yaron, it's Williamson. Thanks for the question. It's going to, I think, take a couple of key points to unpack the question, because it's an important one. And I'll start with a little bit of a description on how we arrived at the 6% to give you some perspective on that. And so we leveraged both external cat modeling capabilities is the same ones that are used across the industry, as well as our own internal analytics to perform a ground up assessment of our in-force portfolio, which gives us an average view over an extended period of time of what we expect our net cat losses to look like.  So it's important to remember, it's an average. And in any given year, obviously, actual results will vary from that average. In terms of the alignment of that load to total industry losses, or the idea that we're in a period where industry losses are going to range, whether it's -- you think it's $100 billion or $120 billion a year, how does that comport to our cat load? It's very consistent. Our view is that that is a relatively normal year. But what you have to keep in mind is what events make up the $100 billion or $120 billion, is incredibly important.  And I'll share some specific examples just from this third quarter. We're tracking around the world 74 events that occurred during the quarter that are considered cat by the industry. Only three of them resulted in losses to at-risk for the quarter. And we've talked about those. And so what that means is that there are a lot of events that occur in the industry that will drive loss for primary insurers, or some reinsurers that don't result in losses to at-risk. And that's because we have a -- we have a definition of a cat. It has to be over $10 million involving multiple seasons.  Obviously, our book, in various parts of the world is structured to avoid more attritional type of cat losses. So that gives you a sense of that. And in a year, where you have a cat or nearly Cat 5, Florida landfall hurricane, that's obviously going to be much more of a reinsurance event, and drive more loss into the reinsurance market, which is what's resulting in our cat, actual cat loss being in excess of our cat load. So hopefully, that allows you to square the circle. And there's no question that there you could have a year with $120 billion of cat losses, where our cat load is less than 6%. It really is that dependent on what events are driving it.  And then the last piece, as you do mention, we're not including any cap on recovery in our estimate of net losses. And my view would be if PCS continues to develop upward, and those trigger our cat loss, remember, we called in at $55 billion. So my gross loss wouldn't move just because PCS gets to $49 billion, which gives us I think, a good degree of prudence. And then again, above our 55 level, I think that's when the cat recovery really holds our dollar value net losses at the level that we've indicated. So we feel very good about that number, and there's a lot of prudence built into it.
Yaron Kinar: Great, that's very reassuring. Thank you. My second question, it's amazing what a difference a quarter makes. I think last quarter, I asked about the 8% to 12% CAGR and reinsurance carrier target and reinsurance for three years may be coming in a little bit below that expectation. You know, again, a quarter makes a big difference. Just given the different market dynamics, do you think that, that 8% to 12% CAGR maybe on the low end now?
James Williamson : Yeah, Yaron, it's Jim again. I mean, I think the first thing, I would just remind everybody out that, that was an assumption that we made, that was built into our strategy for getting to a total shareholder return. We have a lot of levers to drive those returns outside of reinsurance growth rate. So that would be one key point. The next is we have driven significant growth. If you think about when we made that call, we were really beginning at the -- launching off point was the end of 2020. So we have driven, very significant growth.  It was very front loaded, because we saw that market opportunity, particularly in casualty. So that's very relevant. But to your broader point is do I believe that our prospects for growth in 2023 are greater now than I would have believed the last time we talked about it? Absolutely. I think the market opportunity that we all know is in front of us, will give us the opportunity to drive more top line at better margins, probably with less total exposure on the property side. And then as Juan and others as indicated on the casualty side we think there's a renewed opportunity to continue our growth rate.  In the specialty lines, there's a tremendous amount of dislocation that's occurred, due to the war in the Ukraine and other factors. We think that will present some very interesting opportunities. And then we continue to invest in our business, which gives us new capabilities to deliver value to our customers, drive top line growth. So I think, yeah, a quarter does make a huge difference on that front. 
Mark Kociancic: And Yaron, the last thing I would say, and I've said it before, it's all about risk adjusted return, and expanding margins and profitability. And we see the opportunity to be able to do both.
Yaron Kinar: Thanks so much, and best of luck. 
Mark Kociancic: Thanks, Yaron.
Operator: The next question comes from Ryan Tunis from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.
Ryan Tunis: Yeah, I guess first question, can you just give us an idea of -- on the reinsurance side from Ian, the complexion and the loss between domestic Florida carriers, national carriers, and how concentrated is it in individual programs?
James Williamson : Yeah, sure, Ryan, it's Jim Williamson. The first thing to indicate, just when we think about our view of the industry loss, we do think this is primarily going to be a residential driven loss, with obviously a very large component of home. But probably a bit of an outsized auto loss as well. For our particular portfolio, we will definitely be concentrated in the Florida specialist. For the most part, this is a general comment, but for the most part, our large national clients won't see significant attachment in their programs. Obviously there'll be some loss, but not that significant. They manage their exposure in Florida very carefully. So there is that factor.  And as Mark had indicated, in his comments, I think that's actually quite a good thing for us. Because potential creep around the loss related to things like auto, for example, or commercial flooding, are not going to be a factor for us. So if that -- if those two factors were to drive uplift in the ultimate industry loss, that really shouldn't have an impact on our net loss. So I think I think about that as a very good thing.
Ryan Tunis: Got it. And then just a follow up I guess, kind of a risk management standpoint, if I look at the 10 Q, it would predict a southeast wind loss of this size, somewhere between one every 101 -- every 250 years. Obviously Ian is not that rare. So is there any thinking internally about maybe dusting off these models or just putting a little bit more weight toward common sense?
James Williamson : Yeah, Ryan's well one, just with respect to where you ended that question, we use the models for a number of things. But underwriting judgment, expertise, and a whole lot of common sense go into how we manage risk, how we set our risk thresholds, how we price our business, how we decide whether or not to participate in programs, etc. But in terms of your point, look, I think what Ian shows, if you look at our current loss estimate, and $55 billion, and our net P&L statistics, it's showing more like a 1 in 41 than 50. Which I don't think the return period on a storm like this is that remote. I think it's more like a 1 in 20 loss range. And the delta between those two figures is really our prudence around the cap on recovery, because again, we're publishing that PML.  Our expectation, you know, as Mark has indicated, to give you that number is if PCS catches up to our view of the ultimate industry loss, there's going to be a meaningful cap on recovery, which would lower our net loss, which would square with our P&L our published P&L. So that's why you're seeing a little bit of a headache. It's not anywhere near 1 in 100.
Ryan Tunis: Got it. I mean the 10-Q says this was 1 in 20, the loss should have been, the net loss should have been half what it was. 
James Williamson : And to Mark's point, right, we have $350 million of cap on limit that will begin attaching just under $49 billion of PCS event and will exhaust just around $64 million. So that is a meaningful number. And my view would be, remember, we've tagged industry loss at 55. So if PCS begins to catch up to us and development in their numbers is not unprecedented, they can travel upward a long way without having any impact on our view of our gross loss. But we would begin to recover, lowering our net loss. And so I think it tracks to my view of what a 1 in 20-ish type of event would look like.
Ryan Tunis: Thanks, Jim.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Juan Andrade for any closing remarks.
Juan Andrade: Thank you for your questions and a great discussion today. I think as you can hear from this management team, we are very bullish about the future and the opportunity for all of our stakeholders. The passion, the innovation from our team is palpable in every facet of this business.  Thank you for your time today and for your continued support of our company. WE look forward to talking to you at the end of the next quarter.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-07-28 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Everest Re Group Second Quarter 2022 Results Conference Call. . Please note, this event is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Matt Rohrmann, Senior Vice President, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Matt Rohrmann: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Everest Re Group Limited second quarter of 2022 earnings conference call. The Everest executives leading today's call are Juan Andrade, President and CEO; Mark Kociancic, Executive Vice President and CFO. We're also joined today by other members of the Everest Management team. Before we begin, I'll preface the comments on today's call by noting that Everest SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. Management comments regarding estimates, projections and similar are subject to the risks, uncertainties and assumptions as noted in these filings. Management may also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These items are reconciled in our earnings release and financial supplement. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Juan.
Juan Andrade: Thank you, Matt, and welcome to Everest. We're excited to have you on board. And good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Everest delivered strong results in the second quarter with positive momentum across our key objectives. We expanded margins in both of our underwriting businesses, and our insurance segment delivered another standout performance. We further scale our platform with strong overall and underlying results, continuing the positive trajectory for this business. In reinsurance, we seized opportunities to improve the diversification and profitability of our book, while reducing volatility. In a complex environment, Everest's global talent, disciplined underwriting and market leadership provide strength and stability to our customers. Our relevance and impact have never been more important. Improvements in underwriting profitability and operational efficiency, supported by our investment portfolio, delivered $386 million in net operating income and a 15.3% annualized operating ROE. We achieved these results through consistent and relentless execution of the strategy that was articulated at our Investor Day last June. Our strategy is to profitably scale our insurance platform and capitalize on our reinsurance leadership position to continue building a broadly diversified and consistently profitable company that provides leading returns in the sector. Our results quarter after quarter demonstrate we're accomplishing what we set out to do. Operational excellence is also a core component of our strategy. Efficiencies resulting from investments in our systems and technology make us more resilient, so we can respond nimbly to changing market conditions and cease emerging opportunities. Coupled with our ability to attract and retain great talent, this gives Everest a competitive advantage. This is increasingly important against the backdrop of macro volatility, achieving ambitious growth in profit today requires companies to operate with both the strong offense and defense. Our second quarter financial results demonstrates ever stability to strategically do both in a complex environment. I'll share some highlights now, first from the group and then for each of the underwriting businesses. Second quarter results for the group were strong and underscore the earnings power of our company. We grew gross written premiums by just over 10% in constant dollars. The growth was broadly diversified in both divisions and is supported by continued momentum in insurance as well as underlying margin improvement in both businesses. We continue to benefit from positive rate, exposure growth and deliberate portfolio management actions, keeping us ahead of loss trend. The combined ratio for the group is 91.8% and includes $85 million of weather-related natural catastrophe losses, primarily in South Africa, Canada, Europe and the United States. Overall, our catastrophe losses for the second quarter and year-to-date remained well below our cat loss ratio target for the year, despite an estimated $39 billion of insured industry losses in the first half of 2022. According to Aon, this level of natural catastrophe activity is 18% above the average for the 21st century. We also recognized a $45 million IBNR accrual for the Russia-Ukraine war. We have limited direct exposure to the Ukraine and expect any potential losses to be a manageable earnings event. Mark will provide additional details in a moment. The group attritional combined ratio was 87.2%, a 40 basis point improvement from the prior year. This includes a 1.9 point year-over-year improvement in insurance. The group attritional loss ratio also remained strong in the quarter at 59.8%, with continued improvement in both segments. The $240 million in underwriting profit for the quarter is a direct result of continuous portfolio management. Net investment income for the group was $226 million, balanced between fixed income and alternative investments. Now turning to our reinsurance business. Reinsurance gross written premiums were up in the second quarter by over 5% in constant dollars. Our growth is broadly diversified, which allows us to target higher margin opportunities in each region and line of business. We are not reliant on one market or one product to drive our growth and profitability. For example, second quarter growth is driven by our international operations, particularly our casualty book, where we're focused on key seasons for achieving strong underlying profit improvement and results ahead of loss trend. We also grew our global facultative business and our mortgage reinsurance business, where there has been a significant pickup in deal flow. This growth is partially offset by a reduction in property pro rata as we continue to optimize that portfolio. I talked about the advantage of flexibility. This is where our ability to manage market dynamics makes a meaningful difference in the quality of our portfolio. The reinsurance attritional combined ratio was 86%, including an attritional loss ratio improvement of 30 basis points year-over-year to 58.8%. This contributed to a strong underwriting profit of $175 million, supported by successful midyear renewals. With respect to these renewals, market conditions have steadily improved over the course of 2022. We are seeing improved economics for property cat. Everest's position as a preferred market has allowed us to reposition our participation in key programs, further away from frequency losses and achieve better expected profit or reduced cat exposure. Our underwriting teams deploy capacity with discipline. Casualty market remained stable with some tightening of terms driven by market concerns over social inflation and emerging risks. The market is showing signs of discipline, especially in pro rata, where cedes appear to be stabilizing. Our underwriting teams are data-driven, carefully tracking and analyzing trends to ensure we manage the underwriting cycle. In summary, we are positioned to capitalize on opportunities as we maintain our strong underwriting discipline. We are well placed going into the January renewal, and we expect further improvements in the market. Now for our insurance results. During the quarter, we continued to deliver on our strategic objectives, generating record underwriting profit and continued growth, while investing in our talent, technology and analytics. We achieved strong gross written premium of $1.2 billion, a quarterly record for our insurance division, up over 20% in constant dollars. This growth was broad and diversified across our target product lines, channels and regions. We had strong growth in our U.S. casualty, specialty lines and in our international business. We also continue to see significant opportunity in the E&S space where we are well positioned. Growth was driven by several factors, increases in underlying exposures across many lines of business, including general liability, property and workers' compensation, strong renewal retention and positive rate in excess of loss trend across the portfolio. In the quarter, we achieved a rate increase of 7.3%, excluding workers' compensation, and a total of 6% with high single-digit increases in property, professional lines, umbrella and commercial auto. These rates remain well above pre-pandemic levels. It's also important to note that in addition to renewal rate change, there are other levers we deploy to ensure that margins continue to expand, such as coverage terms and conditions, limits management and attachment points, risk selection, new business pricing, which continues to be higher than renewal pricing, and the benefit of additional premium from inflation-sensitive exposure basis. Insurance growth was partially offset by continued portfolio management, including our reductions in U.S. property catastrophe, where we achieved an approximately 36% reduction in our gross 1 in 100 U.S. Southeast Wind PML over the last 12 months. In addition to robust growth, insurance continued its strong profitability trend. We achieved a record low attritional combined ratio of 90.2%, approximately 2 points lower than second quarter 2021 and with a 1.5 point improvement in the attritional loss ratio. These results are aligned with our financial targets and build on our continually improving attritional combined ratio trajectory since the end of 2019, where we have gained over 6 points of underlying margin expansion in the combined ratio. This is a direct result of the consistent and cumulative actions I just spoke about. These improvements resulted in $66 million in underwriting profit, the second best quarterly profit in our insurance division's history. We also made solid progress in the quarter with important milestones that advance our international expansion strategy. Everest insurance received regulatory approvals to operate in Singapore and Chile, where we are officially open for business. Asia and Latin America are both significant opportunities. We are well positioned with the talent, customer-first platform and proven track record to cease this opportunity in new markets. I have personally witnessed the excellent reception of our presence by local brokers. We will continue to bridge gaps in regions around the world, where we are uniquely positioned to serve clients and brokers with our strong balance sheet and broad suite of insurance products and capabilities. Our leadership team is driving the strategy forward and Everest continues to be a net acquirer of talent. During the quarter and since the beginning of the year, we welcomed a significant number of new colleagues, all of whom are accretive to our organization and inclusive culture. From underwriting to pricing and claims, we are innovating across the entire organization to deliver a world-class experience and value to our stakeholders. Our second quarter results demonstrate that Everest is nimble and strategic, diversified and well positioned to perform in any environment. We entered the second half of the year with momentum. We are leveraging our talent and the full breadth of our enterprise to strengthen every area of the business and bring our partnership to more people and businesses around the globe. Now I will turn the call over to Mark to take us through the financials. Mark?
Mark Kociancic: Thank you, Juan, and good morning, everyone. Everest had another solid quarter, rounding out a strong start in the first half of 2022. The company reported operating income of $386 million or $9.79 per diluted share in the quarter. The operating ROE was 15.3% for the quarter, while total shareholder return, or TSR, was 6.6% year-to-date. We improved our attritional loss ratios in both segments, while generating double-digit growth in constant dollars as pricing and terms remain attractive in virtually all of our core lines of business. Based on the fundamental performance of the business year-to-date, our team continues to execute well, and we remain on track to achieve on the goals we set out in our strategic plan despite macro volatility. Looking at the group results for the second quarter of 2022, Everest reported gross written premium of $3.4 billion, representing 8.1% growth year-over-year or 10.3% growth in constant dollars. The combined ratio was 91.8%, which includes 2.9 points of losses from natural catastrophes and 1.5 points from the Russia-Ukraine war. While significant uncertainty remains around the Russia, Ukraine war, we felt it prudent to put up a provision, which is all IBNR, given the lack of claims to date and the ongoing nature of the event. The provision was driven by our marine, political risk and trade credit books in the Reinsurance segment. There is no direct exposure in our Insurance segment. The group attritional loss ratio was 59.8%, a 50 basis point improvement over the prior year's quarter, led primarily by the Insurance segment, which I'll discuss in more detail in just a moment. The group's commission ratio improved 20 basis points, 21.6% on mix changes, while the group expense ratio, which remains a competitive advantage for Everest, was 5.8%. Moving to the segment results and starting with Reinsurance, the Reinsurance gross premiums written grew 2.5% to $2.2 billion or 5.2% in constant dollars. Growth was driven primarily by casualty pro rata and strategic growth in international lines. The combined ratio was 91.8%, which includes 3.7 points related to natural catastrophes and 2.1 points related to the Russia-Ukraine war, as mentioned earlier. The attritional loss ratio improved 30 basis points to 58.8% as we continue to achieve more favorable rate in terms as well as shifting the book towards accounts with better risk-adjusted return potential. The commission ratio was 24.8%, broadly in line with last year. The underwriting-related expense ratio was 2.4% as earned premium grows, and we remain focused on operational efficiency across the entire platform. Moving to Insurance, where we continue to build significant momentum, gross premiums written grew 19.6% to $1.25 billion or 20.5% in constant dollars in the quarter. The combined ratio improved 2 points to 91.5%, primarily driven by a 1.5 point reduction in the attritional loss ratio to 62.7% as rate continues to outpace trend further supported by our focus on risk selection and favorable loss experience. The commission ratio improved 50 basis points, largely driven by business mix and increased ceding commissions. The underwriting related expense ratio was 15.1%, within our expectations as we continue to expand our global footprint and continue to proactively invest in a number of growth initiatives across the business. Finally, to cover investments, tax in the balance sheet, net investment income for the quarter was $226 million, and we are starting to see the benefit of higher new money yields in the fixed income portfolio. Overall, our reinvestment rate improved sequentially from 2.9% to 3.7% during the quarter and today is well north of 4%. We continue to have a short asset duration of approximately 3.1 years. And as a reminder, that 20% of our fixed income investments are in floating rate securities. For the second quarter of 2022, our operating income tax rate was 10.1%, benefiting from the geographic distribution of our income streams, thus favorable to our working assumption of 11% to 12% for the year. Shareholders' equity ended the quarter at $8.9 billion, driven primarily by the second quarter rise in interest rates, particularly toward the long end of the curve. There was a corresponding negative $717 million impact on the value of available-for-sale fixed income securities. Year-to-date, unrealized losses in the fixed income portfolio equate to approximately $1.5 billion. Cash flow from operations was $715 million during the quarter, and book value per share ended the quarter at $224.59 per share, a sequential decline of 6.3% adjusted for dividends of $1.65 per share. Book value per share, excluding unrealized depreciation and depreciation of securities, stood at $257.27 versus $256.01 per share at the end of the first quarter, representing an annualized increase of 2%. Debt leverage at quarter end stood at 22.5%, an increase in the leverage ratio driven by the unrealized fixed income market value declines noted previously. In conclusion, Everest ended the second quarter of 2022 in a strong position. We have ample capital to operate in the current environment, and we continue to see good opportunities to invest in the platform and scalability of our company. That summarizes our second quarter results. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Matt.
Matt Rohrmann: Thanks, Mark. Operator, we're now ready to open the line for questions. .
Operator: . Our first question comes from Yaron Kinar from Jefferies.
Yaron Kinar: First question, just looking at the reported combined ratio in the first half. I think it's tracking a little below the midpoint of the 91% and 93% guidance range. That said, I do think that the second half of the year tends to have a little more catastrophe losses in it. So how confident are you in achieving that 91% to 93% target?
Juan Andrade: Yaron, this is Juan Andrade. Look, I think we feel very confident about it. And the reason I say that primarily it's really all the reductions we have done in our property catastrophe book, right? If you look at our comments that we have been making consistently, we have been managing the volatility down, particularly in the reinsurance book in a pretty significant way. If you look at our investor presentation, you see our trading range and where we are now compared to where we were in 2017, '18, '19, even '21 and '20. So I think that part of it is a big help. If I think about the insurance division as well, as you heard in my prepared remarks, we have already taken down our gross PML in the Southeast by about 36% in the first half of the year. And so those steps, I think, are critical, frankly, to us being able to achieve that 91% to 93%. But I would invite maybe Mark to add any additional comments to that as well.
Mark Kociancic: Yes. So in addition -- Yaron, in addition to the PML reductions that we've seen on the cat side, I think we're making some solid progress on the attritional loss ratios as well. And you can see that evidenced over the last several years, 5 years in particular when you look at insurance on a stand-alone basis. And so we don't see that changing. We feel like we've got a lot of momentum, good process, a lot of opportunity in the market, and we feel good about it.
Yaron Kinar: Understood. And then my second question, also a guidance-related question. So I think your premium CAGR targets, 3-year targets, are for 8% to 12% growth in reinsurance, 18% to 22% in insurance. I think you were a bit ahead of target in '21, a little below target now in '22, so -- particularly in reinsurance. So with that in mind, how confident are you in those 3-year targets, especially as there is growing concern around a recession?
Mark Kociancic: Yes. They're not targets. They are assumptions rather that we had in place for the 3-year plan. So in other words, to achieve the plan itself, it's not like we have to grow at that level. We're very much focused on total shareholder return profitability target for the group. To your point, when you look at the assumptions that we had 8% to 12% for reinsurance and 18% to 22% on insurance, last year, we exceeded those by a significant margin, pretty close to 25 points of growth last year for both divisions. This year, insurance is, within its 18% to 22%, I think we'll get there. The reinsurance side is a little bit lower, but that's not a problem for us. We've done a lot of things there, which I'm sure Jim will articulate as we go on through the call, but we can certainly achieve our objectives even if premium growth is somewhat muted because we're very much focused on profitability.
Yaron Kinar: Understood. And maybe just one clarification there. The assumptions you were using were those on constant currency? Or is those absolute?
Mark Kociancic: Well, yes, those would be constant currency.
Operator: The next question comes from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo.
Elyse Greenspan: My question is on the capital side of things. You guys mentioned that you have ample capital. We didn't see any buybacks in the quarter. So just hoping to just get an update on how you guys are balancing using your capital for organic, inorganic growth as well as capital return from here?
Mark Kociancic: Elyse, it's Mark. Let me take that one. So share buyback, you're right. We didn't have anything in the second quarter. It's still very much an option for us. I think I put in my monologue, to your point, the ample capital to support the business. So we have, as I said, ample capital, we still think that there's a lot of attractive opportunities in the market to grow. You're seeing a very nice growth in the insurance space, which we expect to continue significantly, especially on the international side. And so that's where opportunities for us really present themselves in an attractive way. If there is a point in time where we feel the buybacks are -- provide that much more value in addition to balancing our franchise development, we'll execute them. There's no issue on our side for that.
Elyse Greenspan: And then my follow-up is a margin question, but a little bit of a different way, right? You guys laid out a 91% to 93% combined ratio target at your Investor Day. That included right around at the midpoint, right, a 6.5 point cat load. So I back that out, right, that would be an underlying of 84.5% to 86.5%. You guys were 87.3% ex-Russia, Ukraine through the first half of this year. And you did mention some things like mix, right? If you're shifting away from property, right, that would perhaps lift your underlying, and we're also dealing with higher inflation trends and when you put this guidance in effect. So can you just walk through the drivers of kind of hitting the mid-80s from an underlying combined ratio perspective that's included within that 3-year plan?
Mark Kociancic: Yes. So there's multiple components here to your point. So you've got everything from the attritional loss ratio, acquisition ratio, the cat load itself. And I think back in February for the Q4 results, we made a remark that the cat load of 6% to 7% that we had in the Investor Day presentation last June was likely to trend down as we start to reduce our PMLs on the cat side. So that number, I think, is firmly less than 6% in our anticipation for '22 and probably for the foreseeable future. So that's going to provide some relief within that 91% to 93%, but you're also seeing a couple of other things. On the mix of business, you're seeing a shift. On the reinsurance side, for example, from a 60-40 property, casualty ratio in the book is something that's closer to a 50-50. And so that has its own dynamics in terms of the prospective attritional loss impact overall. When you take into account the mix of business, and then the types of treaties were underwriting and the focus on profitably, we feel very good about the 91%, 93% range, even though we have some meaningful changes here, both in the level of expected cat and the proportion of longer-tail business. So we're comfortably in that 91% to 93%.
Operator: The next question comes from Meyer Shields from KBW.
Meyer Shields: Two quick questions. One, in your introductory comments, you talked about growing in international casualty. And I was hoping you could update us on social inflation internationally, both whether or how it's trending and how it compares to domestic social inflation?
Juan Andrade: Yes. Thanks, Meyer. And that comment was specifically related to the Reinsurance segment of our business, where we continue to see pretty significant opportunity. And as I said in my prepared remarks, what we're doing is very consistent with our prior strategy of partnering with specific seasons that we understand, that we know and that we also see getting rate in excess of loss trend. So from that perspective, we're pretty confident about that book of business. With regard to the social inflation question, I think that's more of a U.S. litigation issue than it is outside of the U.S., even in developed markets of Europe. So when we think about that particular driver of loss in the book, we tend to think about it more from a North America standpoint that we tend to think about it from an international standpoint.
Meyer Shields: Okay. No, that's good news. The second question -- sorry, let me try that again. You mentioned, I think, that ceding commissions for the Reinsurance segments are leveling off, and Mark noted ceding commission is actually helping to some extent the insurance acquisition expense ratio. Should we expect that benefit in insurance to level off? Or can we see different dynamics in these 2 segments?
Juan Andrade: Yes. So maybe a broad comment on that, and then I'll ask my colleagues to jump in as well. So I think on the comment about the market appearing to settle down on cedes. I think that is right. And I think that is what we saw during the quarter, primarily as our cedents are thinking about the same things that we're all thinking about, the risk environment, inflation, et cetera, et cetera. So from that perspective, we see the discipline that's going on with the primary companies, and we definitely see less of an uptick, if you will, on cede commissions. With regard to the insurance, I think that's largely a function of mix and where we saw the growth come in, in the quarter. I think you will see some fluctuations quarter-to-quarter, but we happen to see some very good growth in particular lines of business where we do get decent cede commissions from that, and that's really where you saw the offset. That's also been a little bit of a trend. If you look at the last 2 or 3 quarters, we've also been benefiting from that essentially. And that's part of our portfolio management to essentially drive our lines of business within the primary insurance business to areas where we think we can get better profitability. But let me ask maybe Jim Williamson to add a little bit of color on what he's seeing in the market from a cede commission standpoint.
James Williamson: Sure. Yes, Meyer, this is Jim. Look, I think one of the comments that Juan made, obviously, that you're picking up on is this idea that ceding commissions are starting in the process of leveling off. We certainly saw that in the U.S. and some of our international treaty casualty businesses, pro rata ceding commissions are beginning to level, and that's certainly a very good thing for us. But I would say that, that's a broad comment. When you get under the covers of that, there are clearly still areas of the market where ceding commissions are increasing. And so the mix component, particularly when you relate it back to what you expect out of our insurance business is going to be very important. The other thing that is critical, and it's something that I commented on last quarter is, this also varies deal by deal. And there's no question that there are still cedents who are achieving some increases in those commissions. Oftentimes, that makes sense on the reinsurance side for us, and we'll write it. Sometimes it doesn't and we won't write it. But I think that's also a factor you have to keep in mind when looking at the trajectory in our Insurance division.
Operator: The next question comes from Josh Shanker from Bank of America.
Josh Shanker: Yes. And  little bit probably misrepresenting things. If we go back to the last few years, obviously, the marketplace and you have decided that property re is less attractive and property cat is less attractive than it used to be. But it's gotten to the point where it seems like a number of your competitors are pulling out, making an opportunity. At the same time in your prepared remarks, you spoke about moving away from frequency risk. And I don't want to give away the secret sauce. But where do you get paid in property cat effectively? And what has to happen for this market to be attractive again instead of the market where largely you're cautious about putting capital to work?
Juan Andrade: Yes. Thanks, Josh. And I think you broke up a little bit, so let me make sure that I answered the question that you're asking, if I -- this is one, by the way. Look, I think if you go back to the strategy that we have been articulating, a big part of that is really sustainability of earnings going forward. And a big component for us to be able to accomplish that is really to reduce the volatility in our earnings, which basically has come from property cat and the impacts of climate change and the storms that have been out there basically since 2017. And as you heard from my prepared remarks this morning, they certainly haven't abated, right? I mean whether you believe Munich Re's number of $34 billion or Aon's at $39 billion, it's still been a pretty active first half of the year. And then if you look at our cat losses for the first half of the year, and they're certainly underweight based on our market share and what we've been able to accomplish. So that part of it, we feel pretty good about the execution of the strategy. The other thing that I said in my prepared remarks is that we're basically getting much better pricing, much better risk-adjusted returns for total exposure -- for less exposure in total, right? And I think that becomes pretty relevant to us. The other point that I would make, Josh, is we have articulated a trading range that we feel very good about for property cat, thinking about earnings at risk and capital at risk. And our objective is to trade within that range. As we trade within that range, we're also looking at the environment that's out there for us, and we're positioning our book to be further away from lost higher layers. Given the shortage of capacity that's out there in the market, we're actually getting a pretty good rate online on those layers that are further away from loss. So for us, that's been a very good economic trade. But let me ask Jim Williamson to add a little bit more color on that for you.
James Williamson: Yes. Josh, thanks for the question. It's Jim. In terms of the first part of your question on where we think we get paid, that is a little bit of the secret sauce, as you say, but to give you some broad comments and echoing a little bit of what Juan said, I think at the lower end of a lot of programs, what we saw is the impact of climate change, in particular, is just creating a frequency of smaller cat losses that make those, in our view, very unattractive risk to be taking. And so we've, for the most part, moved away completely from what we consider more frequency layers, call it, 1 and 3, 1 and 4 attachment type point. And then at the very top of programs, that's where there's obviously significant capital market competition as well as the opportunity for real excess volatility, particularly if you start looking at things like aggregate structures, et cetera. So it's really between those 2 points where we see excellent opportunities that we've been able to . And in some cases, that includes growing with our core clients. And then to the second part of your question on what needs to happen for our approach to change. Juan obviously laid out the idea that we've articulated the trading arrangement that we're comfortable with for the long term. That's very important. We are in a very targeted way given the hardening that we've seen in the market, deploying additional capacity with our best clients. But again, that's very targeted. I would say that in many places in our portfolio, we're perfectly happy getting paid more for the same or, in many cases, less risk, and I think that's very accretive, and that's been a major strategy. But then the last thing I would just sort of remind us all about is the idea that the reason the market is hardening is because people are being very thoughtful about deploying capacity. And so when we get asked the question of, well, why not deploy more capacity into what is a really good market? You just have to remember, the reason the market is really good is because people are not deploying a lot more capacity into it. And so we're thoughtful about that dynamic.
Josh Shanker: And this is going to be a bit of a  question, I guess. But I mean 2006 is too much to ask for. But if pricing were at where it was in 2010, 2011, does that kind of market give you any incentives to reembrace volatility?
James Williamson: Yes. Josh, it's Jim again. I'll just reiterate what we said, which is in a situation like that, we have articulated a trading range of volatility that we're willing to accept on an earnings at risk and a capital risk position. But that's a long-term strategy we're pursuing. We don't plan to change it. And the other thing I would say is in a situation, the more dislocated property rates become, the more I'm getting paid for the exposure I'm already taking. That's more margin. And in many cases, and we've seen this in the more recent renewals, where we've taken capacity off the table, but total renewed premium increase. So not only are you getting more margin, you're getting more total premium for less exposure. We really like that trade.
Juan Andrade: And I would build on that a little bit, Josh, by saying that if you go back and look at the trading range that we've put out there, there's flexibility in there, right, to the comments that both Jim and I just made. We have capacity, we have the dry powder. And it's just a question of the trade, right? If it's attractive for us on a deal-by-deal basis, we can deploy capacity. And as Jim said, we have for specific risks, but we will stay within that trading range. The key strategy for us is a broadly diversified company that can deliver sustainable earnings, right? And I think we got to keep that in mind and that's really what we're executing against.
Operator: The next question comes from Brian Meredith from UBS.
Brian Meredith: A couple of me for you. First, one, I'm just curious, maybe get some updates on you with respect to your loss trend assumptions, obviously, a company that you're pretty familiar with increased your loss trend assumptions. And on that topic, too, if you've got a 7.1% rate, I know you said there are some other things that are happening here. What's your cushion right now rate versus where you think trend is running right now or could potentially be here soon?
Juan Andrade: Yes, Brian, let me give you my thoughts on all of that. And look, I think first, it's important to remember that we have been consistently prudent in our loss pick selection process. And I think that's important to remember. As I've said in prior quarters, really starting in 2020, we deliberately strengthened our current accident year loss picks to reflect the heightened risk environment that we've been operating in. But the other important point is that we've also been consistently achieving pricing in excess of the assumptions that we built into those loss picks. And we haven't lowered our loss picks as we've talked about in prior calls. So we're thoughtful about the environment, and we're thoughtful about how we manage through it. And frankly, this has been a prudent choice, and I'm glad we did it. In addition, if you think about back to the end of 2019, we have been watching and increasing, our loss trend assumptions also in reaction to supply chain disruptions, social inflation, general material inflation, and we responded very quickly to those signals. And those changes drive our pricing and our underwriting decisions. So this is something that we started early in '20, '21, '22, and we have a process where we very frequently throughout the year, revised those loss cost assumptions. But despite the increase in those loss trend assumptions that I just articulated, our pricing performance continues to outpace that. And that's the case for both written and earned pricing, but it's also important to note that new business pricing also remains stronger than what we articulated for renewal pricing. So all of these things are important to keep in mind. The other thing is that it's important to note the growth in exposures that's resulting from inflation, right, especially when you think about lines of business like general liability, workers' compensation and property, that also has a mitigating effect on loss cost because we're getting additional premium for that exposure. And so when you think about the exposure growth, our rate achievement, this increases the margin further in our favor in excess of current loss trends. And I think that's very important to keep in mind because it's all these things together. And finally, the last comment I would make is that beyond rate, beyond exposure growth, you have all the things that I talked about in my prepared remarks today, but also in prior calls, things that we're doing from a portfolio management, including improving terms and conditions, higher deductibles, all of that, limits and attachments. All of that helps to sustain our underwriting margin. And so from our perspective, the final thing I would tell you is that since we are fairly well diversified, and you just heard it in the cat discussion with Jim and I, we can actually shift our capital to where we see the best opportunity from a pricing and terms and conditions standpoint, and that is what we're doing. That's basically what's creating the margin that you're seeing from us quarter after quarter. So again, I think it's a combination of the increased pricing, exposure growth and all the underwriting actions that we're taking, that are keeping us above the current loss trends.
Brian Meredith: Great. And then Mark, I'm just curious, looking at the investment portfolio, obviously, a big increase in fixed income investment income this quarter. How much of that kind of increase that we saw in the yield, do you think is directly related to the  ? And can we expect a continued kind of big increases in your investment yields here?
Mark Kociancic: Well, it's difficult to say what the pace is. But clearly, we've got a tailwind behind us. And there's, I think, several factors pushing it higher. So we've got a new money yield that's well into the 4s in the portfolio. Roughly $3 billion of our fixed income portfolio is converting to cash through maturities and interest coupons over the next 12 months. And then you've got a run rate on operating cash flow, which is a little over $3 billion a year, annualized 12 months, I guess. So if you take those factors into account, that's going to provide some sense on what the yield pickup is going forward. I think we also have some ability to extend duration as well and pick up a few points on that. So I see still a good trajectory on that. What's unclear is just how persistent the current rate environment is going to be.
Brian Meredith: Makes sense. One, I'm just curious, going back to my last question I was going to ask you. Are you willing to give us what you think trend is running right now?
Juan Andrade: Look, we don't really disclose our -- how we price. What I've articulated in the past, it's running mid to slightly above mid-single digits.
Operator: The next question comes from Mike ops from Morgan Stanley.
Michael Phillips: First question, look, you guys aren't the only company that's talking about reduced volatility and kind of trimming back on property cat and you're growing nicely in reinsurance on the casualty side. I guess, especially in light of Juan, your earlier comments and a pretty common comments on social inflation and Juan, you even said emerging risk. Can you just help us think about how -- what specific steps you're taking in reinsurance casualty to kind of mitigate any surprises on the negative side there? I don't think pricing is what we hear on the property cat side, on the casualty side and reinsurance and more risk there. So just help us think about how -- what you're doing specifically mitigating risk in the near term for that business?
James Williamson: Yes, Mike, this is Jim Williamson. I'll really break that down into 2 things. The first is what our cedents are doing. And then the second is maybe a little repetitive around our loss pick process. But one of the things to keep in mind is most of the casualty growth we've been experiencing is through quota share participation alongside of our cedents. And so you really need to examine strategies that they're employing to stay ahead of loss trend and to ensure that current accident year picks can be sustained, particularly as you get into an environment where there's material inflation happening. And so what I would emphasize for you and some of what we've already discussed is, we've seen obviously a significant and extended period of time where rates have been going up meaningfully. We're years, 3.5 years into a rate on rate on rate environment, and that is very meaningful. We've also seen really significant reunderwriting actions by many of our cedents. That's risk selection, that's attachment points, that's limits, that's terms and conditions. And that builds a significant amount of underlying margin into the treaties that we're writing. And then obviously, in our own underwriting process, we're very thoughtful about which cedents we partner with. We're choosing them very carefully, and we price all of our deals from the ground up to ensure that there is strong margin in those deals. And that margin calculation that we're performing includes our forecast around what's going to happen with inflation, whether it's social or material. And as we indicated earlier, we were very quick to react to changing trends around inflation and all of that gets factored into our pricing. So I think that's really critical. And then the second part of it obviously gets back to what Juan was discussing earlier, which is our loss pick process. We've been very, very prudent about strengthening loss picks early on in this cycle. We've obviously performed better than expected against those picks from a pricing perspective. And again, that's not reflecting all the underwriting I described as pricing has outperformed assumptions, but we haven't reacted too quickly to that price improvement by lowering our pick. So we're kind of going in with some very prudent loss picks. And it's really the combination of those 2 factors in our view, gives us the confidence we need to continue to sustain that casualty book.
Michael Phillips: Okay. Switching over to insurance, if I could. You've grown nicely in your specialty, casualty segment there. And it's not just this quarter. So it's been going for a while. So I guess, quickly, just to make sure there's nothing one-off in this quarter, which I assume there's not. But can you maybe drill down then a little bit more detail and kind of some of the specific sublines that are inside what you call your specialty, casualty?
Michael Karmilowicz: Sure. Thanks for the question. This is Mike Karmilowicz. Yes, within specialty, casualty segment, it includes mainly GL, the driver, umbrella, excess and commercial auto are the main factors that drive most of that business. And again, similar to the comments you made on the primary side, we're seeing a lot of the investment and so forth and just the rate and return in a lot of areas around that. As you've seen with the overall rate we've gotten in the last 3.5 years, we continue to see a lot of upside and opportunity across that, again, being very selective and very cautious about managing limits and how we approach the market.
Juan Andrade: Just to build on that, I don't think there was any particular one-offs in the quarter for that particular line of business. I think it was a pretty stable execution across all of that. The other things that we think about to are some of the specialty lines, like trade credit and political risk, M&A transactional liability, we saw some pretty good growth in there as well across the portfolio.
Michael Karmilowicz: I think the one key thing for us ultimately is having a really well balanced and diversified portfolio across multiple segments and multiple geographies. And given the market share opportunity of a $900 billion market and where we stand today, we see considerable upside, and we're in a position of strength. So we are very optimistic about opportunity.
Operator: . Our next question comes from Ryan Tunis from Autonomous Research.
Ryan Tunis: Could you just talk a little bit on the IBNR provision for Ukraine, the assumptions that went into that, the type of range of outcomes around that? Is that a contemplation of a small number of potential claims or, I guess, a larger number of smaller ones? Just give us some feel for how that could potentially evolve.
Juan Andrade: Yes, Ryan, this is Juan. Let me start, and then I'll ask Jim to give you a little bit more color. I think as we've talked about really from the beginning of the year, there's a lot of uncertainty to this event, obviously, from the perspective that the war still ongoing. You really can't get claims adjusters on the ground. And we have gotten less than a handful of notices at this point in time. But these estimates are based on essentially ground-up assessment similar to frankly what we did during COVID, cedent by cedent to really try to understand the exposure by different lines of business. And it really does present sort of the best estimate that we have at this point for the lines that we articulated. But let me have Jim give you a bit more color on that.
James Williamson: Yes. Sure, Ryan, it's Jim. And I think Juan hit on something very important, which is the comparison with the process we used during COVID, where we review each and every treaty that could be affected by what's happening in the Ukraine. We are in communication with our cedents, obviously, studying all other industry data as it becomes available. It's -- obviously, there's not a lot of information at this point, and there's a great deal of uncertainty. But for -- in particular, the marine line, the political violence line and trade credit. We had enough information to make what we thought was a good estimate around potential loss exposure and that's where we made our selection for the second quarter. Obviously, as Juan indicated, we only have a small number of actual submitted losses. Those are all advisory losses. They don't include actual loss numbers. And so we'll continue to monitor and make adjustments if it becomes necessary.
Ryan Tunis: And then on the casualty, reinsurance side, casualty pro rata growth. Can you just help us understand, I guess, like the dynamic there? We had, I think, 4 quarters in a row where growth is above 50%, and now it's moderated some. What exactly was the story there? Did you add a bunch of new business last year and now it's just getting rate on that? Or -- yes, I'm just kind of trying to understand the dynamics there.
James Williamson: Yes. Sure, Ryan. This is Jim again. The way I would describe it is, and it goes back to some comments that we've made a number of times around cedent selection. But that is one of the most fundamental aspects of how we conduct reinsurance underwriting is picking the right cedents to partner with, particularly when you're talking about a quota share structure. And so as the casualty market began to dislocate, pricing improved, terms and conditions were changing, et cetera. We worked with what our view are the best underwriters in the industry, and we took meaningful positions on their treaties. And so a lot of that unfolded in 2020 and certainly in 2021. And so as you achieve that, obviously, you now have a really, really strong position with an individual cedent, and you may choose to sustain that position versus necessarily increasing it year-over-year. And so some of the increase you'll get going forward on that particular cedent might be more in the form of just the growth of their own business, the growth of exposures, et cetera. So that is a major factor. However, even in addition to that, we continue to see some really nice opportunities in casualty on -- typically on a pro rata structure, and we're pursuing those opportunities, and we'll continue to do that.
Juan Andrade: Brian, this is Juan. I would just jump in at the very end. If you look in the supplement, our growth in casualty pro rata has actually been quite good for the first half of this year. We're at about $1.2 billion compared to about $954 million last year about this time. And it's really what Jim has been articulating.
Operator: There are no more questions in the queue. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Juan Andrade for any closing remarks.
Juan Andrade: Great. Thank you all for the questions and a great discussion today. I'm very optimistic about our future opportunity as evidenced by our growing global team, our consistent performance and track record. It's an exciting time to be at Everest. And as we continue to accelerate our strategic ambitions, we're creating more opportunity for our investors, clients and employees around the world. Thank you for your time and for your continued support of our company.
Operator: Conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-04-28 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and welcome to the Everest Earnings Conference Call. I would now like to turn the call over to Jon Levenson. Please go ahead.
Jon Levenson: Good morning, and welcome to the Everest Re Group Limited 2022 first quarter earnings conference call. The Everest Executives leading today's call are Juan Andrade, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Kociancic, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We are also joined by other members of the Everest management team. Before we begin, I will preface the comments on today's call by noting that Everest SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. Management comments regarding estimates, projections and similar are subject to the risks, uncertainties and assumptions as noted in these filings. Management may also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These items are reconciled in our earnings release and financial supplement. With that, I turn the call over to Juan Andrade.
Juan Andrade: Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Everest is off to a strong start in 2022 with first quarter results to reflect our relentless focus on profitability and margin expansion. Excellent performance across our underwriting businesses and investments contributed to a $406 million in net operating income and a 16.2% annualized operating ROE. Our discipline and resilience standout in a challenging and complex environment. We are a source of strength and stability in unprecedented times. The world is facing distorted volatility with the effects of the pandemic compounded by a web of macroeconomic, geopolitical and societal issues. Adding to this are climate-driven industry catastrophe losses. The first three months of 2022 were active, with estimated economic losses over $30 billion and insured losses over $14 billion. Significant events occurred in the quarter in Western and Central Europe, Australia, Japan, and the United States. The historically quiet first quarter, has not been quiet for the past six years. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, January, February, and March of 2022 were each in the Top 10 warmest months in the official observed record dating back to 1880. Amplifying these challenges is the brutal Russian invasion of Ukraine, and the upheaval, death and destruction facing the Ukrainian people. It is heartbreaking to witness the inhumanity and the cruelty that is unfolding in Europe. This war destabilizes global economic systems and financial markets and threatens democracy, peace and decades long efforts towards share prosperity, ever stands in solidarity with the Ukrainian people. As underwriters, the protection and stability we provide has never been more important. This turbulent time is when our unwavering focus on consistent disciplined execution is most important. Our focus was evident across our underwriting businesses in the first quarter. Both performed well and continue to lead with expanding margins and highly relevant, diverse risk solutions across lines and geographies. In the insurance business, our focus on delivering profitable growth, expanding margins, and best-in-class products and services, advanced our mission to be the markets global diversified insurer of choice. In reinsurance, we strengthen our global leadership position and maintain a laser-focus on diversification, reducing volatility and maximizing profit. This deliberate cloning of our portfolio is an ongoing strategy; we successfully applied to the April 1st renewal. We brought the same discipline to our investments which continued to perform well in the quarter. Our portfolio is diversified and well positioned for the current rising interest rate environment. During the quarter, we continue to embed technology in our underwriting processes, and to increase our capabilities, productivity and efficiency. Our momentum is powered by the extraordinary efforts of our people. They are the bedrock of our inclusive culture, and they drive our success. As we announced last week, we lost a very special colleague, with the passing of Don Mango, our Chief Risk Officer and Chief Actuary. Don was a legend in our industry and at Everest. I had the privilege of working with him to evolve our enterprise risk management framework to what it is today. He's going to be greatly missed by all of us. To carry Don's vision forward, we have appointed Ari Moskowitz, as Everest Group Chief Risk Officer. Ari is an accomplished leader with deep actuarial expertise. In his former role as our Reinsurance Chief Operations Officer and Chief Pricing Actuary, Ari played a key role in integrating risk discipline across the business and embedding it into everything we do. He has also helped to advance our culture of diversity, equity and inclusion as a founding member of our DEI Council. I look forward to working with Ari to continue advancing our risk management agenda. Let's turn to our financial results for the first quarter of 2022, beginning with our Group results. In the first quarter, we delivered $406 million in operating income with a 16.2% annualized operating ROE. This includes over $235 million in underwriting income, a significant improvement over prior year and $243 million in net investment income. Our combined ratio of 91.6% is a six-and-a-half point improvement over last year. The attritional combined ratio was 87.4% and our attritional loss ratio was 60%, a 70 basis point improvement over prior year. We also posted a competitive operating expense ratio of 5.8%. Rate continued to outpace expected loss trends in the first quarter, and our margins continue to expand. In addition to rate, we are also benefiting from additional premium on lines of business with inflation sensitive exposure bases, such as general liability, property, and workers compensation. And we also continue to benefit from intentional underwriting actions, to manage limits, and granular segmentation of our portfolio to ensure we are writing the most profitable business. Our focus on profitability and expanding margins is clear. We grew gross written premiums by 9%, 15% in our insurance division, and 6% in reinsurance. This growth was solid and broadly diversified in both of our underwriting divisions. Diversification allows us to target higher margin opportunities in each geography and line of business. We are not reliant on one geography or line to drive our growth and profitability. With regards to the Russian invasion of the Ukraine, the war is an ongoing and evolving event. There are significant uncertainties regarding actual and potential losses and on whether health coverage would apply. We have completed a detailed coverage review of our businesses, and we have limited exposure to this work. To-date, we have received only one loss notice for a de minimis amount. Based on what we know at this point in time, we expect that any potential financial loss to Everest, as a result of these events, would be a manageable earnings item. But due to the high degree of uncertainty around both exposure and coverage, a reasonable estimation of potential loss is not credible at this time. We are continuing to work with our brokers and seasoned partners to assess any potential exposure. To sum, our Group results in the first quarter were strong and created meaningful momentum for the year ahead. The combination of our financial strength, capital position, outstanding market reputation, global offering, and deep relationships, uniquely positions Everest to capitalize on market opportunities. Let's turn now to our reinsurance results. In the first quarter, we grew gross written premiums by 6%. Growth was strong in casualty and financial lines globally, particularly casualty pro rata, which continues to be supported by strong underlying rate and underwriting and increased Everest participation on treaties. This is offset by deliberate and targeted reductions in our property/catastrophe exposed business as we further reduce the volatility in our portfolio. These actions resulted in significantly improved economics. The combined ratio was 91.4%, a 6.1 point improvement from last year and includes 110 million of pre-tax catastrophe losses net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums from Australia floods, European storms, and tornadoes in the U.S. Our attritional combined ratio was 86.2%, including an attritional loss ratio of 58.9%, which is a 60 basis point improvement over last year's first quarter. Additionally, our expense ratio was 2.4% during the quarter. This continues to be a strategic advantage for Everest. We achieved excellent underwriting profit of $177 million. Driving this result is our priority on maximizing profits, while managing volatility. We successfully executed on this strategy during the January 1 renewal season, and continue to make meaningful progress throughout the first quarter. Specifically, we continue to grow our targeted classes of business and geographies. Our international treaty business grew by over 22% in the quarter. We expect this to become a bigger share of our business over time. Global facultative grew by 10%. We are making targeted investments to expand our facultative capabilities around the world, including industry-leading talent to our team. Those investments are already paying off. Casualty grew globally with our pro rata book up 48% year-over-year, and our casualty XOL book was up 8%. We continue to be measured and selective in our property and specifically in cat-exposed property. In the quarter, those lines decreased year-over-year. And we further owned our portfolio to maximize expected profit, while reducing volatility. We continued this strategy during the 401 review in property, total written premium, limits exposed, AAL, and our PMLs were all reduced and expected profit and dollars increase. This resulted in more profit for less exposure by any account that's an outstanding trade. We also achieved growth in our casualty book with higher participation alongside some of the industry's best primary underwriters. We expect conditions for upcoming reinsurance renewals to offer targeted opportunities for Everest to deploy capacity at superior margins. We move forward with the underwriting discipline and expertise to write profitable margins and we have the tools, talent and capital solutions to build continued profitability. Now let's to our Insurance division. We continued our thoughtful intentional long-term build with the insurance franchise with an absolute focus on underwriting profitability. Our combined ratio of 91.9% was excellent representing an eight point improvement from last year. The attritional combined ratio of 90.9% improved 130 basis points from a year-ago and including attritional loss ratio of 63.1%, a 120 basis point improvement from prior year. These improvements resulted in strong underwriting profitability of $59 million in the first quarter, a new record for the quarter. Our focus on profitability and margin expansion is clear. We have improved the attritional combined ratio by over five points since the end of 2019. We also have delivered robust and diversified growth in the quarter, up 15%, with gross written premiums once again over $1 billion. It's important to note that excluding strategic and intentional underwriting actions taken this quarter to reduce volatility and optimize the portfolio; our growth rate is higher at 25%. As we have said, Everest Insurance remains long-term growth mode. But we will reduce exposure where it makes sense as we continually reshape the portfolio to maximize profitability. Growth in the first quarter reflects our relevance in the commercial insurance market, and was driven by exposure increases, rate, strong renewal retention, and new business across our core segments, lines and geographies, most notably across our long tail lines. In the quarter, we achieved a rate increase of 9% excluding workers compensation and a total increase of 6% in our core P&C portfolio, notably, financial lines were up 15%, Umbrella Excess was up 10% and Commercial Auto was up 9%. Rate continues to exceed expected loss trends across all lines, with the exception of monoline guaranteed cost workers compensation, which now represents only 7% of our portfolio in the quarter. We made excellent progress against our objectives for the insurance business and we remain vigilant in driving and improving margins as we scale this business. There's a significant runway ahead of us to grow profitably in the global P&C market, and we're capitalizing on it. As we strategically expand our offerings, we continue to build out our global platform from underwriting to claims. This includes leveraging key technology and analytics to improve productivity, speed and accuracy and enhance the customer experience. We are finding new ways to innovate with improved structures and new offerings directly addressing gaps in the market. We continue to diversify and deepen our relationships with distribution partners globally. We are infusing analytics to take a more quantitative and metrics based approach to sales that brings the entirety of adverse to customers where, how and when they need us. As our first quarter performance shows, we've built the runway to advance our objectives, supported by our profitable underwriting operations, investments, market relevance, strong balance sheet, and our values based culture, all powered by a world-class global team. I am fully confident that Everest's ability to create exceptional value and deliver returns for our shareholders. As I said at the top of the call, more than ever, the world needs a partner it can depend on with the breadth of experience, capabilities, and dedication Everest brings to the market. In times of uncertainty, we are a source of strength and stability for our customers, shareholders, colleagues and the global community. Now I will turn the call over to Mark Kociancic to take us through the financials in more detail. Mark?
Mark Kociancic: Thank you, Juan and good morning everyone. Everest had an excellent start to 2022 as we continue to make progress towards the objectives in our three year strategic plan. We had strong underwriting income, and another good quarter of good investment returns, leading to a 16% annualized operating return on equity. Most of our underwriting businesses and our investment portfolio contributed to the strong result this quarter. Now for a review of the first quarter results. For the first quarter of 2022, Everest reported gross written premium of $3.2 billion representing 9% growth over the same quarter a year-ago. By segment, reinsurance grew 6% to $2.2 billion reflecting a 32% year-over-year growth in casualty, and an 11% reduction in property. Insurance grew 15% to an even $1 billion with notable growth in specialty casualty offsetting intentional underwriting actions to reduce exposure in property and optimize the profitability of our portfolio. Everest reported net income of $298 million equal to $7.56 per diluted share and a total shareholder return of 8.6%. On an operating income basis numbers are $406 million for the quarter, and $10.31 per diluted share, with an annualized operating return on equity of 16%. Included in net income and consistent with the 5% reduction in the S&P 500 during the first quarter, Everest experienced $109 million after-tax unrealized loss on our common equity portfolios. Note that these are not realized losses rather fair value declines, which flow through net income, thus lowering our total shareholder return during the first quarter. We incurred $115 million of pre-tax CAT losses net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums in the quarter. The Australian floods in the first quarter represent the largest flood loss on record for the Australian insurance industry at just over $3 billion U.S. Our CAT provision includes $75 million for this event. The other CAT events in the quarter were the European storms at $30 million and late March U.S. winter storms in the amount of $10 million. Of the total $115 million of CAT losses incurred in the quarter $110 million are in the reinsurance segment with $5 million from the late March U.S. winter storms within insurance. We also note that there is no net prior year development in CAT losses this quarter. We continue to see improvement in the attritional loss ratio across the Group, along with the lower expected CAT low given our emphasis on volatility reduction, and we reconfirm our assumptions for the Group combined ratio in the range of 91% to 93% for the full-year 2022 as well as for 2023 as noted in our strategic plan. Our first quarter 2022 GAAP combined ratio was 91.6%, which includes 4.1 points of CAT losses and no net prior year development. Our attritional loss ratio of 60% was a 70 basis point improvement over the first quarter of 2021, with improvements in both the reinsurance and insurance segments. The reinsurance attritional loss ratio decreased by 60 basis points and in insurance it was 120 basis point improvement. In both segments, we continue to see rate outpace loss trend. Turning to commissions. The overall Group commission ratio was 1.2 percentage points higher year-over-year, largely driven by the 1.9 point increase in reinsurance commissions. The 24.9% acquisition ratio in reinsurance for the quarter is broadly in line with our expectations for 2022 and reflects the underwriting actions we've taken over the past few quarters notably the increased ratings of casualty pro rata business. The first quarter 2021 reinsurance commission ratio of 23% benefited from approximately a 120 basis points of non-recurring commission adjustments. The balance of the year-over-year variance is primarily due to changes in business specs. For the insurance division, the acquisition cost ratio of 12.5% improved from the year-ago figure of 13.2% largely driven by increased ceding commissions. Everest continues to have a very competitive operating expense ratio of 5.8% for the quarter, versus our target of approximately 6% for the Group. Year-over-year the reinsurance expense ratio is lower 2.4% versus 2.9% driven by favorable operating leverage as we continue to scale the business. The insurance expense ratio is marginally higher 15.3% versus 14.8% and within our expectations as we continue to expand our global footprint. Regarding the impact from Russia's war on the Ukraine and in terms of reinsurance and insurance losses as Juan described, Everest has gone through an extensive analysis of exposures and coverages and at the present time, we simply do not have enough information to make a credible estimate of losses. Our investment portfolio is the one area where we have enough information for an initial assessment of losses. Given the repricing of Russian corporate securities Everest total direct exposures to these instruments is $15 million on a book value basis. And as of March 31, we booked a $9.5 million impairment with $5.5 million remaining in fair market value. During the first quarter of 2022, Everest continue to generate strong operating cash flow in the amount of $846 million. Our strong cash flow also has the benefit of allowing us to invest into the rising rate environment, increasing overall portfolio yield. Investment income for the quarter was $243 million, a strong start to the year with good balance between fixed income of $148 million and $100 million from alternative investments. Overall, our expected fixed income reinvestment rates are close to the 3% level. Everest's investment portfolio is well positioned for the rising interest rate environment. In addition to a high-level of operating cash flow within the existing core portfolio, we have a short passage duration of 3.1 years, and also nearly 20% of our fixed income investments are in floating rate securities. For the first quarter of 2022, our net income tax rate was 8.3% benefiting from the geographic distribution of our income streams and thus outperforming our working assumption of 11% to 12% for the year. Shareholders equity ended the quarter at $9.5 billion driven primarily by the first quarter rise in interest rates and negative impact on the value of fixed income securities, particularly those towards the short end of the yield curve. Two year treasuries rose 160 basis points, and 10-year treasuries rose 83 basis points during the quarter, resulting in an $811 million after-tax fair market value reduction. A relatively low asset duration of 3.1 years means that this change should amortize towards a more neutral balance over the next few years, and we hold our available-for-sale securities to maturity for the most part, and we benefit from strong profitability, underlying operating cash flow, and balance sheet liquidity. Therefore, I don't view this transitory decrease in book value as a constraint on our ability to grow or upon our financial strength. The resulting book value per share ended the quarter down at $241.52, a decrease of 5.9% adjusted for dividends of $1.55 per share. The book value per share excluding unrealized appreciation and depreciation of securities stood at $256.01 per share versus $252.12 at year-end, representing an annualized increase of 6.2%. Debt leverage at quarter end stood at 21.2%, an increase in the leverage ratio driven by the unrealized fixed income market value declines noted previously. In conclusion, Everest ended the first quarter of 2022 in an excellent financial and strategic position. We have ample capital to operate in the current environment. And we continue to see good opportunities to invest in the platform and scalability of our company. And with that, I'll now turn it back to Jon.
Jon Levenson: Thanks Mark. Operator, we are now ready to open the line for questions. We do ask that you please limit your questions to two or one question plus one follow-up and then rejoin the queue if you have any remaining questions.
Operator: Thank you. . Your first question comes from Yaron Kinar from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Yaron Kinar: Thank you. Good morning. Mark, maybe going back to your comments on the investment portfolio. So you gave us the new money rate, where do you see the current fixed maturity yield and what -- how much of the portfolio turns over in the given year?
Mark Kociancic: So I say going -- thanks Yaron. Going back to the reinvestment rate, we're roughly at 3%. I see that increasing over time certainly with pressure upwards on interest rates; I see that only going up for us. On a current basis, the market value or the market yield is greater than the core and so there's upward momentum on that side. In terms of the portfolio itself I'd say roughly one-ninth to one-eighth converts to cash for 2022 and then when you combine approximately we would expect something around the $3 billion operating cash flow level for the year that's a significant amount of investable funds. And I'd also make reiterate the point that I made in my opening remarks that we've got roughly 20% of the fixed income portfolio in floating rate securities which will help that reinvestment yield.
Yaron Kinar: Thank you. That's very helpful. And then my second question maybe for Juan, in your prepared remarks, you talked a little bit about the cat loss this quarter. Can you maybe help us think about where, how you see catastrophes in this particular first quarter relative to expectations for the first quarter? Were they above normal, in line?
Juan Andrade: Yes, Yaron. Thanks for the question. As I said in my prepared remarks, it was an active quarter, right, and we did end up as an industry having over $14 billion in cat loss. That translates to about $30 billion in economic loss. So I would say this is elevated for first quarter. And as I said, look, I looked at the data going back a number of years and all of this. And as I said that first quarter that typically is quiet hasn't been quiet right. So I would expect that $14 billion is definitely more active than what you normally would see.
Operator: Your next question comes from Joshua Shanker from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Joshua Shanker: Yes, thank you. Looking at pro rata casualty business, prices are up for the underlying business from where they were a year-ago. But ceding commissions are also up, is the profitability between those two timeframes basically neutralized by the ceding commission. And has the ROI and capital being put into that part of the reinsurance business going up the same or is it lower than it was a year-ago?
Jim Williamson: Yes, Josh. This is Jim Williamson. Thanks for the question. And it's a good one. Look, what we've seen and what we've been reporting is two factors that you described. There's a tremendous amount of margin creation happening in the primary casualty market driven by rates, but also by changes to limit re-underwriting, et cetera. And that's definitely playing through. And we're seeing that in our data. At the same time, cedings are looking to recapture some of that margin creation, the increased ceding commissions, and we've seen that dynamic play out. And what I would tell you broadly speaking, really only to Everest portfolio, our view is that trade is resulting in improving economics for us, meaning the improvement in the underlying market is exceeding growth rates and ceding commissions. Now, that's not true on every deal across the market, which is why the thoughtfulness and the selectivity of our underwriting is so important. And we measure each and every deal. And what we're looking for in this environment is margin expansion. And in those situations, where we see ceding commissions running ahead, and deteriorating margins, we're choosing not to participate. I would say broadly at this point, overall it's still a pretty rationale market out there that way. And so we see some real good growth opportunities continuing.
Joshua Shanker: And then on the property and property/cat side, if you lower your volatility to cat exposures, but the capital that you are, isn't really being freed up because of that capital, obviously you're using for other items. Isn't there a possibility that the capital charges are low for the additional business, that you might be leaving money on the table as you trade volatility? I mean, I guess maybe not referring but that seems like you did that, you could use $1 of capital that's associated with casualty business, also to underwrite property and that yes, you've lowered your volatility, but you've also lowered your long-term earnings power.
Jim Williamson: Yes, Josh, it's Jim again. Look we have a very robust capital modeling and risk management process that we operate at the Group level and we are really evaluating capital deployment across all of our lines at a very granular level between both reinsurance insurance and our investment portfolio. And we certainly take into account, total capital usage and optimization when we're making those decisions. So when we talk about deploying relatively more capital to casualty versus property, we're accounting for the fact that you do get diversification benefits, and you do get opportunities to deploy capital, in some cases, multiple areas. And so we're not seeing any area in the portfolio where we're failing to deploy capital at the most efficient level, when you look at the growth.
MarkKociancic: Josh, it's Mark. Let me just add one remark to that. I think in addition to what Jim said, it's really more of a marginal movement. What we're seeing here with slightly reduced property/cat and an expansion on the casualty side. So as Jim pointed out, the portfolio is still very well diversified and we're very focused on accretive return expectations for everything we write in excess of our TSR. So for us, it's still highly efficient to proceed in this way.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ryan Tunis from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.
Ryan Tunis: Hi, guys. Good morning. I was hoping on the insurance side, you can talk a little bit more about some of the re-underwriting actions you're taking. And whether or not we expect that to potentially impact the growth rate in that segment over the remainder of the year?
Juan Andrade: Yes, Ryan, it's Juan Andrade. And let me start. And then I'll ask Mike Karmilowicz to join. Look, I think the first point is, we still feel very bullish about the growth opportunities in insurance, as I said in my opening remarks. I think in some ways, we're only scratching the surface of the potential that's out there. And it's one of the reasons why we now have international expansion underway and frankly, while we continue to gain traction in the U.S. market. We're good underwriters. And what you saw us do this quarter is what any good underwriter does. You're looking at your portfolio, you analyze it. In some cases, there's going to be things that you like, and then have a good economic return and there's things that we don't like. And so therefore, you exit them, because we see better opportunities to deploy capital and move in that direction. So if you think back at that 15% growth rate for the quarter, some of that was impacted by the fact that we did reduce volatility as well in the insurance side similar to our strategy in reinsurance. And the other part of it was driven by one specific account that we decided to non-renew and move away from it. But that's the general theory. But we do feel very bullish about the growth rates in insurance. And I would ask Mike to maybe jump in and add some additional color.
Mike Karmilowicz: Sure. Thanks, Juan. Thanks for the question. A few things I would say. First off, as you know, our focus is basically always has been focused on underwriting with underwriting companies as Juan pointed out, and I would reiterate to you guys we've had 29 straight consecutive quarters of growth, most of those sales have been double-digit. We are very focused on cycle management, you see us talk about it with workers comp. We've taken actions to Juan's point on property in other areas. But I don't see this anticipating slowing us down. We see ample opportunity in the marketplace. We are well positioned with a lot of capital and a lot of trust. And so we will continue to execute that and where we see opportunity, we'll take advantage of it. But we don't foresee any of that changing anything we do every day.
Ryan Tunis: Got it. Then on the reinsurance side, obviously a good margin quarter there. Just maybe a little more insight into, what specifically drove that. Was it a lower loss pick, as you're recognizing for portfolio's less volatile and better underwritten, or was there anything one-time in nature that helped?
Jim Williamson: Sure, Ryan, this is Jim Williamson to give you some of that detail. Look, I think a lot of this is the result of some of the conversations we've been having with you over the last few quarters, which is we've seen very consistently, strong margin improvement in the underlying primary casualty market. That's rate that's limits, that's terms conditions, et cetera. And we've been very prudent in how we've revealed that improvement in our loss picks. And we've said, we've waited, and we've been waiting for that data to prove itself to start to see it in our numbers, et cetera. And so I think what you're seeing this quarter is the result of that prudence. And it's the result of that underlying improvement. And so on a year-over-year basis, we have seen an improvement in casualty pro rata in particular, and underlines as well, that have allowed us to basically settle on lower loss picks for those lines. We're still being prudent. We're still being disciplined. And we're still not taking full credit for the trends we see. But we are starting to flow through some of that margin. To give you a sense of quantum. On a year-over-year basis, we saw about a 140 basis point of margin improvement due to lower expected loss picks. And that was then partially offset by the change in mix, because if you look at Q1 2021 versus 2022 there is a dramatic change in our mix. We were about 60:40 property casualty this time last year. It's closer to 50:50 now, and that's certainly an offsetting factor as casualty carries a higher loss pick. But I think all of this is a result of the market trends we've been discussing. And we see those trends continuing as we head into the year and we continue to see pricing in excess of even elevated loss trends.
Ryan Tunis: Thanks. I really appreciate that level of detail, Jim. Congrats.
Jim Williamson: Thanks, Ryan.
Operator: Your next question comes from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. So my first question, if I look on a Group consolidated basis, right your -- the underlying combined ratio actually did deteriorate a little bit year-over-year. So I was hoping you could just give us a sense of just kind of an outlook for the accident, your ex CAT combined ratio. And then it seems like a big chunk of that deterioration wise was because the acquisition ratio ticked up around 120 basis points. Can you just give us a sense of the outlook for that acquisition ratio over the balance of this year?
Mark Kociancic: So Elyse it's Mark. A few points that you asked there. So first of all, let me just start with the CAT and then we'll get into the acquisition ratios. On the CAT, I made this point last quarter that our expectations for 2022 with the CAT ratio for the Group of less than 6%. And so that's, I think, a meaningful reduced expectation versus last year, and definitely on a historical basis. So there is some reduction that that's expected there. On the acquisition ratio, I would say, a couple of points. We have, if I start with reinsurance. I would say it's broadly in line with last year, probably a little bit higher, you're seeing us trend at 24.9% here. Last year, I think we were in the low 24. That's principally because of mix of business. I did mention some of the one-offs we had in Q1 last year that would drive it. On the insurance side, we still see a declining net acquisition ratio. And that's a combination of things. You've got both ceding commissions coming in on certain lines of business, depending on the mix. And then just lower broker commissions versus our expectations on some of -- some other lines as well. But I'd say there's probably downward pressure in general on the primary side for acquisition ratio.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay, great. And then my second question, on the reinsurance side, a little bit of a follow-up to Ryan's question, he talked about right, reflecting, just more of the improvement on the casualty side. And as we think about the mix shift to casualty and we also think about, like the impact that that can have on your margins, as we're thinking about going forward. I'm assuming that you guys still see right, the line of sight into kind of hitting, getting that segments that 91% to 93% combined ratio target.
Jim Williamson: Yes, Elyse this is Jim Williamson. We would definitely reiterate our commitment to that target, and we're very confident in it. And it's a combination of factors. One, while casualty does carry a higher attritional loss ratio, and a slightly higher attritional combined ratio. Those numbers are coming down year-over-year, you see the improvements that we were talking about earlier flow through the book, and we began to reflect that in our loss picks. And while I cited a 140 basis point improvement year-over-year to our pick based on improved loss picks. It's higher than that for casualty. And so we're seeing that happen. And so that's critical. And then the other part, when you think about the total combined ratio to what Mark just said, which is for the Group, our targeted CAT loss ratio went down and that's also true of reinsurance. And so, when you ladder all that up, our expectation is, certainly that those won't be headwinds to achieving our goals. We're very confident on that. The other thing I would just say, and this is particularly important, I think, as we roll through the summer. We're still very much a leader in the property CAT market. And we take meaningful lines. We've been doing that in improved economics that 401 as Juan indicated in his opening remarks. We were able to take less risk by any measure, whether it's PML, AAL, et cetera. But we're going to getting paid more profit dollars, more expected profit dollars will flow to the bottom-line. And that will certainly have an impact on our traditional and ultimate combined ratio. And we see good opportunities through the rest of the year to continue to execute that strategy. So I think all of that comes together to give us a lot of confidence in the targets we set out.
Operator: And your next question comes from Mike Phillips from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
MikePhillips: Thanks. Good morning everybody. Juan, given the pretty positive comments and kind of trajectory of insurance segment, margins expanding and rates still at a loss cost trends. What's your appetite for kind of keeping more of the gross business over the next couple of years in the Insurance segment it's been pretty consistent for quite a while. Any thoughts on kind of moving that up over the next couple of years?
Juan Andrade: Yes, Mike, thanks for the question. And it's obviously something that we look at on a pretty regular basis, particularly as we go through all of our ceded reinsurance renewals on all of this, and we have made changes in our different treaty protections, et cetera, et cetera. The way we tend to look at this from a philosophical standpoint is, as we get additional rate, additional terms as we continue to feel very good about our own underwriting, then by definition, we would want to keep more of that net with a company and you see us doing that in certain lines of business. But we balance that against the volatility and the appetite that we want to have on any particular line of business at the same time. So the short answer is we are constantly making tweaks to that depending on our line of business, depending on the geography, et cetera. But we feel pretty good about where we are right now. And I would invite maybe Mike Karmilowicz to add a little bit of color as well.
Mike Karmilowicz: Sure, thanks. Yes, I would only add to that, that we continue as we continue to scale up a lot of our existing businesses and get more critical mass. To Juan's point you'll see his take on that we've done that already in a few different pockets. And I see that continuing as we continue to grow and gain scale.
Mike Phillips: Okay, thanks. Thanks for that. And then sticking with the insurance, Juan, you talked about, again rate over loss trend, I think you said 9% rate ex-comp ahead of kind of the long-term loss trends, can you share with us how you're viewing that long-term loss trend, what number you're looking at there? And how is that changed given recent times and the world in increased risk? What do you use in for your long-term loss trend right now, is that 9% range?
Juan Andrade: Yes, thanks Mike. Good question. Look, we feel pretty good about where we are, as I said that, I would actually say that rate is outpacing expected loss strength comfortably for us across the board. Right, so you're right, excluding comp, it's a 9% increase in rate that we saw in the quarter. And it's hundreds of basis points lower on that, where the trend would be basically. I would tell you that we have consistently updated our loss trends assumptions, really since 2019, 2020, 2021 upward reflecting higher loss trends in our pricing models and exit year loss trends. So we monitor that pretty closely. But I can tell you, we're comfortably above loss trend right now really, across all lines of business, with the exception of workers comp, which is the only one that I flagged earlier.
Mike Phillips: Juan, sorry just to jump in and make sure I understood you. You said something about hundreds of basis points. Can you say that again of what you meant there?
Juan Andrade: Yes, so look if you're running at a 9% increase in rate, our loss trend is lower than that by several 100 basis points, basically.
Operator: Your next question comes from Brian Meredith from UBS. Please go ahead.
Brian Meredith: Hey, thank you. Juan, I was just curious, I appreciate the color you gave on Russia, Ukraine exposure. And there's a lot of uncertainty, I know right now and your exposure gets diminished. But I'm just wondering, as you think about your portfolio business, where are you kind of looking at where you're focused at? Where could there potentially be some exposure?
Juan Andrade: Yes, no absolutely, Brian, I'm happy to give you a little bit more coloring and context and all of that. Let me reiterate though, something that I said in the earlier comments. We don't see this event as changing our profit objectives for the year. And I think that's probably the most important thing to take away. The other part of that is any loss estimate that we can give you or frankly, any of our competitors give you at this time is really purely speculative, right. And the reason for that is the worse ongoing physical damage and economic disruption are uncertain. It's changing in the investigation application of key coverage is still in its infancy, right. So that's essentially kind of where we are with all of this. As we have done that very detailed assessment of coverage that I talked about earlier in my remarks, I can tell you that for instance, on the primary side on insurance, we would have close to zero exposure in any event, very, very little. On the investment portfolio, Mike I'm sorry, Mark certainly talked about that. And you saw the impairment that we did in the quarter as well. And on the reinsurance side, we would have limited exposure and the way I referred to that is, we have very few like one or two former Russian scenes that are no longer clients of ours. So that's a very little exposure from that perspective. And then when we look at sort of lines that could be exposed to all of this, you certainly look at the some of the aviation lines that could be exposed. Although that's a relatively small business for us in the quantum of overall reinsurance. You could also look at potentially some marine lines that could be exposed. You could look at some trade credit, political risk type stuff. But we're much less concerned about that. And then you would look at some of the political violence covers as well. But we're also relatively small on that. So let me ask Jim Williamson to actually even go deeper into that, and just give you a little bit more granularity.
Jim Williamson: Yes, sure, Brian, this is Jim. And I'll repeat a little bit of what Juan said and give you a little bit more detail. Because obviously, these topics have been heavily covered, there's a lot of speculation happening in the media around potential losses. On an aviation basis as Juan mentioned a relatively small, there's one small part of our book. There is significant uncertainty around the extent of potential loss, in terms of actual units of aircraft exposed and that numbers been changing. The application of coverage notwithstanding some of the posturing that you've seen, I think there are real questions related to which coverage will apply, and to what amount. We've also taken very significant actions in our own aviation book over the last two years, to position it to withstand shock losses in a much better way. And so that gives us a lot of confidence. On a marine basis, particularly given when you look at haul, we do have, and we know that there are trapped vessels in the Black Sea, for example, there's a lot of uncertainty about -- around the size of those vessels, whether they'll ultimately losses on those vessels, or on land cover, cold war et cetera, can also be in the marine area. There are properties in the Ukraine, obviously, that could potentially be exposed. As we've evaluated our book though, we don't really have concentrations of property in the area where the conflict is ongoing. And so it's both uncertain, but also at this point appears very manageable. On a trade credit and political risk basis I think our teams have done an outstanding job of managing that exposure. On the terms of those contracts, as you likely know give primary insurers a lot of options when there's dislocation in the market, there's been a lot of cancellation activity and so that exposure, that potential exposure has been shrinking by the day. We've also seen a lot of payment activity continuing in those contracts that haven't been canceled. So that's a good sign. And then, lastly, on political violence, again, that'll probably apply primarily to property exposures. In the Ukraine, there's a time limit on those covers. And again, as we've evaluated potential exposures, we don't have heavy concentrations in the major cities that have been subjected to the conflict in a meaningful way. We haven't had any reported losses other than one, which was less than $300,000, of potential loss from a political violence perspective. So you know, looking very, very manageable at this point, and tremendously uncertain. And so we're just continuing to have dialogue with our team. We're assessing it and we'll keep a very close eye on it.
Brian Meredith: Thanks, that was really thorough. And then Mike, my second question, I'm just curious on your stock actually had a point this quarter where it's dropped pretty significantly, and I was little surprised that we didn't see more share price -- buyback in the quarter. Maybe just remind us kind of your thoughts on kind of capital here and Mark and kind of managing it? And do you have like, ability to kind of really go in the market and buyback some stock when we get this market volatility?
Juan Andrade: Yes, Brian. So let me start and then I'll ask Mark to add. So the short answer to your question is, yes, we absolutely have the capability to go in and do buybacks. As you saw us do last year as well. Frankly, our stock was trading at a pretty good level. During the first quarter, there certainly had a bit of a dip as the war started sudden and you saw us come in, and we did have some buying activity, even though it was relatively small. But when you think about how we think about capital management, that philosophy hasn't changed in from what we have been articulating. Frankly, since I've been the CEO of this company. And we reiterated on our Investor Day last year, which is our number one priority, really is to privilege our underwriting businesses, as we see accretive growth opportunities and everything that we have been sharing with you this quarter and in past quarters, is that journey that we have to continue to expand margins improve the underlying profitability of this company, and you've seen us do that. So from our perspective that really is sort of priority number one. Beyond that absolutely we will consider share buybacks. We will consider other things at the same time. But let me ask Mark here to jump in.
Mark Kociancic: Brian, not too much more to add to that. Although I will say that we see excellent opportunities on organic expansion right now within both insurance and reinsurance. Doesn't mean we can't do both. But there's a really nice marketplace for us in our view. And so I'd say capital is really being privileged for that right now.
Operator: And your last question comes from Meyer Shields from KBW. Please go ahead.
Meyer Shields: Thanks. So I want to start with one question on reserving. And I'm not quite sure how to phrase this. But if we break down reserving in sort of like a mathematical analysis, and then the judgments associated with that, can you break down I guess, the absence of enormous or significant reserves development into those categories? Another way that it is, are there indications of redundancies, that you're just hesitant because of elevated risk? Or are the indications not there?
Jim Williamson: Sure, Meyer, it's Jim Williamson. Wanted to step back, just to reiterate our reserving process, which is very robust and has been strengthened meaningfully over the last few years. We're taking a very disciplined approach to reviewing all of our carried reserve positions every quarter. We've implemented a number of automated tools to allow us to do that. We are closely monitoring IBNR consumption at a very granular level across both reinsurance and insurance, by line, by accident year, et cetera. And then, of course, we have our ground-up reserve studies that were conducted, none were actually completed in the first quarter, but we will start getting completed reserve studies in Q2, and that's on an accelerated schedule, accelerated over last year, which was also accelerated from the prior year. So a lot of eyes on our carrier position. Now, when you look at you start slicing our IBNR, and our very reserved position in the all those pieces I described. You're clearly going to see movement on redundancies in some areas, deficiencies in some others, et cetera. But overall, I would reiterate what we've said in prior calls, which is we're very confident in the strength of our carrier reserve position. And we have seen no information, really, since the end of 2020. That would cause us to take any action, any meaning material action one where the other from a reserve change perspective. And so and that's certainly through this quarter. And so again, we'll continue to monitor it. And if that changes we'll certainly, you'll be the first to know.
Juan Andrade: Meyer, the other thing. This is Juan Andrade. The other thing that I would add to what Jim has just said is keep in mind the discussion that we've been having about rate in excess of loss trend. And we have been saying that very consistently, really, for the past three years, essentially. And so by definition, you are building margin, and you are extending margin there. As we have also said before, we haven't taken that to the bottom line mainly because of all the issues that we're talking about with regards to inflation and severity, and all these other things at the same time. But from our perspective, and as Jim alluded to in his answer to Ryan with regard to the casualty loss pick, we do look at this. And we do change it, we do tweak it right. So it's only a matter of time, as we get the data as we examine things as things season that you're going to start seeing that coming into the bottom line. So I think that probably gives you also a more forward perspective. And again, bring it back to the rate versus trend discussion.
Meyer Shields: Okay, that's very helpful. A second unrelated question, we're in an environment of at least, I think probably expected continued interest rate increases and your liability duration, have you set the mix towards casualty and also extending, when is the right time to really significantly increase your investment portfolio duration? Do you do it now; do you wait for further interest rate increases?
Mark Kociancic: So it's Mark, Meyer. I think as long as we're broadly within alignment of asset and liability durations we're in a good spot. I don't think there's a lot of benefit when you look at where the yield curve is right now in terms of the short end and the flatness of really going long. So for us, it's really looking for kind of a mix of things. So you're obviously looking one, to match generally the duration of between or the ALM matching, in essence; two, yield credit quality, liquidity of the securities and the actual alpha you think you can capture in the securities that you're looking at specifically any specific asset classes. So we look at it probably more granularly. I wouldn't get hung up on for example; we got an asset duration of three, one this quarter and a liability of four. That yield curve is really not appealing to stretch it out for the extra basis points that we see.
Operator: And there are no further questions. At this time, I will turn the call back over to management for any closing comments.
Juan Andrade: Great, thank you for all your questions and the excellent discussion. I think as you can tell from our tone, we are optimistic about the opportunities before us. We definitely see a trajectory for continued growth and expanded profitability. We're continuing to build this company, accelerate the progress and create greater value for our investors, our clients in all of the markets that we serve. So thank you for your time with us today and we look forward to seeing you at the next earnings call.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q4  (2022-02-10 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Everest Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the call off to Jon Levenson with Everest.
Jon Levenson: Good morning, and welcome to the Everest Re Group Limited 2021 fourth quarter and year-end earnings conference call. The Everest Executives leading today's call are Juan Andrade, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Kociancic, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We are also joined by other members of the Everest management team. Before we begin, I will preface the comments on today's call by noting that Everest SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. Management comments regarding estimates, projections and similar are subject to the risks, uncertainties and assumptions as noted in these filings. Management may also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These items are reconciled in our earnings release and financial supplement. With that, I turn the call over to Juan Andrade.
Juan Andrade: Thank you Jon. Good morning everyone. And thank you for joining us today. 2021 was a pivotal year of profitable growth and continued momentum for Everest. We finished the year with a strong quarter and achieved record growth in both our franchises, drove expanding margins and solid underwriting profitability and generated exceptional investment income. This led to a $1.4 billion in net income for the year and a milestone 14.7% total shareholder return against the 13% target. These results reflect the strong earnings power of our diversified businesses to create value for our shareholders, even in years of elevated natural catastrophes. With a more profitable book of business coming out of a well-executed January 1 reinsurance renewal season, and expanding global value proposition, a strong balance sheet and exceptional talent, we entered 2022 well positioned to deliver on our strategic objectives. Before I provide details about our results, I want to acknowledge the contributions of my global colleagues this year. 2021 was challenging for our industry. Despite the continued global pandemic and significant climate driven catastrophes, we advanced our strategic priorities with disciplined execution and delivered first class products and solutions to our customers. In 2021, we accelerated many of our strategic priorities, building on a discipline foundation that drives greater profitability and less volatility in our business. We make key investments in the people, technology, and infrastructure that are optimizing all three of our core earnings drivers, reinsurance, insurance, and investments for superior performance. First, our underwriting franchises. We continue to build on our market leading position in global P&C reinsurance. As a preferred provider with diverse product offerings and relevant client driven solutions, our insurance franchise is scaling and diversifying, increasing margins, and driving relevance in more markets through a focus underwriting and distribution strategy and an expanding footprint. And the market is responding with increased demand for our products, evidenced by strong growth in both franchises, and consecutive quarterly top line records in insurance this year. Focused execution in 2021 led to a solid underwriting outcome that is particularly meaningful in the context of a $130 billion catastrophe year. Our continued diversification, volatility reduction, and disciplined underwriting are yielding profitable returns. A recent example is our success executing a clearly defined and measured strategy into January 1 renewal average this year to a focus plan. This resulted in our current portfolio being stronger, more diversified, and more profitable. Our commitment to operational excellence and an entrepreneurial model that keeps us agile and responsive to our clients ready to pivot with rapidly changing market conditions is a big part of how we accomplish this. To this end, we made material inroads in 2021 on our path to becoming a digitally enabled organization through superior data, analytics and technology that are bringing more depth and dimension to how we manage segment and model risk with greater speed and precision. With regard to investments, performance was excellent in 2021 driven by a prudent approach to optimizing a well-balanced, high credit quality investment portfolio that supports our franchises and helps to drive meaningful returns. Reflecting on Everest accomplishments in the past year, I am proud of the diverse, inclusive and purpose driven culture that supports everything we do. Our continued emphasis of ESG as a core pillar of our long term strategy was most recently reflected by our decision to become a signatory to the UN principles for sustainable insurance. Finally, talent drives our performance. Everest is proud to be an employer of choice in our industry and throughout the year we attracted and events exceptional talents across the global organization who will help us to drive this next chapter of profitable growth and bring our offering to more customers around the globe. Let’s turn to our financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year 2021. Beginning with our group results. In the quarter, we grew gross written premiums by 25%. Growth was broad and diversified across both segments. In the fourth quarter, we generated $228 million in underwriting profit with a combined ratio of 91.1 and an attritional combined ratio of 87.4 reflecting continued margin expansion in our insurance division. Turning to the full year 2021, average grew gross written premiums 25% setting a new record for our company of over $13 billion. Net written premiums grew 26% year-over-year The group combined ratio was 97.8% including 1.1 billion in catastrophe losses which is less than 1% of the industry’s estimated $130 billion loss in 2021, reflecting our disciplined underwriting and reduced volatility. The group attritional combined ratio was 87.6 for the year. These results demonstrate the progress against our strategic priorities to continue to optimize the portfolio to drive margin. Prudently manage expenses and enhance operational efficiencies. Let’s turn to our reinsurance results. Our reinsurance division had a strong fourth quarter and finished the year solidly with gross written premium exceeding 9 billion a 25% increase over 2020. Gross written premium growth in the fourth quarter was excellent up 26%. This growth was broad based and supported by underlying rate increases and the economic growth, increased opportunities with our core trading partners, targeted growth on profitable property and casualty programs. The division generated a 176 million of underwriting profit in the fourth quarter with a combined ratio of 91.5. The attritional combined ratio for the quarter was 86.4 reflecting the continued performance of our portfolio, the successful execution of our strategy to participate in growth and margin improvement in the casualty market and on-going expense discipline. We ended 2021 with a 98.1 combined ratio and an attritional combined ratio of 86.3. These results reflect our progress in reshaping our risk profile to achieve superior returns. We continue to actively diversify our reinsurance portfolio with an improved balance of property and casualty exposures. We are disciplined and focused about getting appropriately for risk. We made meaningful progress advancing these priorities to the January 1, 2022 renewal period that started with a cleared and focussed strategy with three key objectives. One, continue reducing volatility in our overall book by decreasing cat exposure and growing less volatile non-catastrophe loss. Two, optimize our property portfolio to maximized returns. And three focussed capacity with top underwriters. The breadth of average preferred market position built over decades and strong trading relationships combined with our size and capital gave us a distinct advantage. Our team was precise above where we deployed capital and focused on improving the economics in our property book. We maintain discipline where pricing did not meet our returned vessels. Rate increases were favorable across most property and casualty lines, with financial lines and loss effective property lines seeing the highest uptake. For example, loss effective programs in Europe particularly in Germany. Many catastrophe programs were restructured to ensure participation on higher layers. Despite how late the property renewals came together, there was ample capacity available for most seasons outside of retro and loss impacted aggregate covers. While the casualty market was competitive with upward pressure on ceding commissions, continued underlying rate improvements helped drive better overall economics, notably in casualty quota share. We successfully achieved targeted growth in our Retail Continental European portfolio across P&C lines, as well as our U.K. excessive loss portfolio. Within property, we reduced our exposure to property retro, lower margin property, pro rata business and working catastrophe layers, while at the same time growing targeted clients at excellent terms. Overall, we meaningfully reduce catastrophe loss potential in our book and achieve gross premium [ph] reductions in key peak zones. We have a more profitable and higher margin book. I'm proud of the team's discipline during a dynamic renewable season. Now a few comments about Mt. Logan. Mt. Logan plays an important role in our long term growth aspirations, and is uniquely positioned given its excellent alignment with the average property portfolio. We have a strong pipeline of prospective investors. We remain optimistic about the prospects for Logan and we continue investing in the platform with new products customized to meet investor’s objectives. During the year, we also strengthened our leadership bench and key promotions and hires, in North America, Latin America and elsewhere internationally. And in Mt. Logan. These talents, positions and promotions were part of a successful effort to optimize and streamline our structure, which is already benefiting the organization. In summary, our reinsurance business is better positioned today to support strong underwriting income results, capitalize on market opportunities, and further expand our market leadership. Now let's turn to the insurance division. Insurance had an excellent fourth quarter, delivering both top line growth and bottom line profitability, supported by continued strong underlying performance and progress in the long term targets outlined in our strategic plan. Insurance growth in the fourth quarter was 21%. We achieved over 1 billion in gross written premium for the third consecutive quarter. This resulted in a record 4 billion in gross written premiums for the year, or up 24% over 2020. The growth in the fourth quarter was influenced by a few factors. First, we continue to benefit from increasing exposures as the economy rebounds. Second, strong renewal retention, favorable market conditions and double digit rate increases across all of our target classes, excluding workers compensation, where rates are slightly down. Third, sales execution, we deepened and diversified our distribution network. And we sharpened our execution with a quantitative and metrics based approach to sales. As a result, we improve our hit ratios by 24% and 32% year-over-year in our retail and wholesale channels respectively. Four, strong new business growth in both retail and wholesale channels, primarily in casualty, professional, and transactional liability, along with accidents and health, partially offsetting the growth was targeted portfolio repositioning in our U.S. property and catastrophe exposed business where we continue to reduce overall volatility and improve margins. This includes on-going portfolio management related to modeling [ph] workers compensation, which is now only about 7% of global gross written premiums. We delivered another strong underwriting result with a quarterly combined ratio of 92.8 and an underwriting profit of 52 million. Our underlying performance was also outstanding. The 90.4 attritional combined ratio is a 3.4 point improvement, compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 and an almost eight point improvement since 2019. Our loss ratio, commission ratio and operating expense ratios all improved, including a 3.8 point loss ratio improvement for the fourth quarter. We are committed to sustaining this positive momentum and we are sharpening our focus in two key areas to achieve it. First, is proactive cycle management. We are building a diversified business. As I mentioned, we continue to see growth in a number of our specialty lines, and we will grow more profitable crop classes of business over time. Our diversified product offering and relevance in both the E&S and Retail channels allow us to seize new opportunities in the evolving market. Second is increased efficiency and scale. For instance we are increasing efficiency by enhancing our claims process to improve productivity, speed and accuracy, resulting in better claims outcomes and higher customer satisfaction. An important part of this our continued investment in advanced tools, such as robotic process automation, artificial intelligence, and natural language processing, which creates greater operational efficiencies, and delivers better insights, enabling fact based decisions and best-in-class customer experiences. As to scale, we also expanded our footprint in Latin America, Asia, and Europe, where we see opportunity to profitably grow across the 800 billion plus global commercial P&C industry. We have a thoughtful expansion plan outside of North America that brings together existing capabilities, expertise and knowledge to a broader and more global customer base in places where we can grow profitably. Building our company for the future is a marathon, it’s not a sprint. I'm very encouraged by the ambition, the tenacity, and the hard work this team consistently demonstrates. I'm proud of our results, but we remain hyper focused on daily execution as we position our company for the future. An agile global company focused on providing exceptional service and risk solutions to our clients, a company that is respected for its influence and impact in the marketplace. That follows a strong risk management framework that delivers consistent and leading returns with a world class global team united by the passion to win. Now I will turn it over to Mark Kociancic to take us through the numbers in more details.
Mark Kociancic: Thank you, Juan and good morning everyone. Everest continued to make excellent progress executing its strategic plan during the quarter and the full year 2021 as we remain well on track to achieve our investor day strategic plan objectives, notably the full year 13% or greater total shareholder return, or TSR. I'll spend some time providing additional context on the underlying assumptions. But first, let's review the fourth quarter and full year results. For the fourth quarter of 2021, Everest reported gross written premium of 3.4 billion, representing 25% growth over the same quarter a year ago. By segment, reinsurance grew 26% to 2.4 billion and insurance once again reported gross written premium of 1 billion in the quarter, representing 21% year-over-year growth. For the full year 2021, Everest achieved 13 billion in total gross written premium, 9 billion for reinsurance and 4 billion for insurance. Turning to net income, for the fourth quarter of 2021 Everest delivered strong net income of 431 million equal to $10.94 per diluted share, and an annualized return on equity of 17.7%. On an operating income basis, the numbers are 359 million for the quarter, and $9.12 per diluted share, with an annualized operating return on equity of 14.8%. For the full year 2021 net income was 1.38 billion equal to $34.62 per diluted share, and a full year return on equity of 14.6%. Operating income for the year was 1.15 billion, or $28.97 per diluted share equal to an operating ROE of 12.2%. Book value per share ended the year at $258.21, an increase of 8.7% for the year adjusted for dividends. The TSR for the year stands at 14.7%, which as one noted exceeds our 2023 full year target and reflects the robust and well diversified earnings power of Everest. Let me focus on several key financial highlights of the fourth quarter. We incurred $125 million of pretax cat losses net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums in the quarter, with the primary event being the Canadian crop loss and the amount of $80 million. We've profitably underwritten the Canadian crop market for a number of years and view this as an attractive long term business. The crop loss event is one of the largest property casualty losses in Canadian history at nearly $6 billion with the underlying drought conditions unseen for 60 years. The other significant pretax cap loss, net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums in the quarter was from the quad state tornados, which took place in December, $45 million in total, $30 million in our reinsurance segment and $15 million in insurance. We also know that there was not any unfavorable prior period, or prior year development in the cat losses this quarter. For 2022 Everest expects a cat load of less than 6% in line with our 6% to 7% investor day guidance, and driven by a combination of reduced volatility from our cap portfolio, and expanding into other lines with higher risk adjusted margin. Consistent with prior quarters, we remain confident in Everest's overall reserve position. Starting with one's [ph] arrival at Everest, we've continued to strengthen and improve our reserve processes in a number of ways; in the establishment of prudent initial loss picks, a balanced and timely scheduled during the year to review our reserves, and taking decisive action when needed. All of this is driven by improved processes and analysis tools to allow our actuaries to focus on interpreting the numbers and making the most informed decisions. Our COVID-19 incurred loss provision remains consistent at 511 million total incurred. This number is unchanged since here in 2020. The majority of this reserve remains is IBNR. And we remain confident in our overall COVID reserve position. We reconfirm our strategic plan assumption for combined ratio, with the range of 91% to 93% for the group for the full year 2022. Our overall 2021 combined ratio stood at 97.8% driven by cat losses, ending the year at 10.9 points. The disciplined cap book underwriting achieved at January 1 is meaningful and will reduce volatility on an expected basis, thus further insulating Everest from outsized cat losses. Our attritional combined ratio stood at 87.6% broadly stable versus 2020. Everest continues to have a very competitive expense ratio; 5.7% for the quarter, and 5.6% for the year, below our working assumption of approximately 6% for the group, as shared in our strategic plan. Specific to this quarter, other underwriting expenses and reinsurance reflect some non-recurring charges and I expect the reinsurance expense ratio to remain under 3% for 2022. Investment income for the quarter was 205 million, ending an exceptional year with 1.16 billion in pretax net investment income. The Everest investment portfolio continues to be refined within the tolerances detailed in our June investor day, with a focus on asset liability duration matching, strong credit quality and liquidity and improving capital efficiency, all while enhancing yield for our core portfolio, which are assets backing reserves. For our total return portfolio, which is private equity focus, we see good opportunities for continued investment. And within our core portfolio, we have nearly 20% of our fixed income investments and floating rate investments, which affords Everest good insulation from a rising interest rate environment. We also continue to run duration at 3.2 years, somewhat shorter than our liability duration of approximately four years. Specific to our limited partnership investments, the excellent contribution during 2021 is from a well-diversified portfolio. And we see continued room to add to this asset class under our strategic plan targets. Finally, to conclude on investments we reaffirm our 2022 expected return on invested assets in the range of 2.75% to 3.25%. For the full year 2021, Everest generated an exceptional 3.8 billion in operating cash flow driven by strong premium growth. This cash flow in our $1 billion debt offering fueled our investment portfolio, which ended the year at 29.7 billion of assets under management. The Everest balance sheet ended 2021 in an excellent position, shareholders’ equity was 10.1 billion at year-end 2021 and we continue to optimize our capital structure with the $1 billion Senior Notes offering completed in early October. At a three and an eighth coupon, this 31-year offering further lowers our overall cost of capital, while expanding our underwriting firepower. Our financial leverage at year-end was 20.2% and we see that ratio within our 15% to 20% strategic plan assumption range by the end of 2023. As part of our capital management strategy, we also repurchase $25 million in Everest common shares during the quarter, bringing the full year total to 225 million. For the full year, our net income tax rate was 10.8% and we see 11% to 12% as a good estimate for net income tax rate in 2022. 2021 validated the progress Everest has made towards our 2023 strategic plan objectives. Our underwriting businesses are vibrant and profitable. Our investment portfolio was well optimized for the current market environment, and our balance sheet and franchise provide us with the optionality to grow into classes and territories where we see the highest returns. Everest is well positioned to seize market opportunities and navigate the current macroeconomic environment. And with that, I'll now turn it back to Jon.
Jon Levenson: Thanks Mark. Operator, we are now ready to open the line for questions. We do ask that you please limit your questions to two or one question plus one follow up and then re-join the queue if you have any remaining questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Josh Shanker with Bank of America.
Joshua Shanker: Thank you very much. Good quarter and great outlook and I’m thinking 25 million in shares repurchases in 4Q and I'm trying to figure out what the ROI on incremental capital use is for insurance, versus reinsurance versus ploughing [ph] into your stock at this price.
Mark Kociancic: Josh its Mark. Good morning and thanks for the compliments on the results. So we're --let me split this into a few buckets. So when we allocate capital, we're certainly privileging organic growth, and different opportunities competing against each other, whether it's the capital management aspect, or expanding the franchises in reinsurance, or insurance. And so our TSR objective of at least 13% is really the cornerstone on a risk adjusted basis when we look at these different opportunities. And so we have ample capital to deploy in both businesses and also for capital management actions, like share buybacks, were unconstrained in that aspect. And so I think in 2022, you'll see this philosophy continued.
Joshua Shanker: Are all options almost equal at these prices? Or like, is there a difference in where you'd prefer to put capital if you can only make one choice?
Mark Kociancic: Well, we definitely privilege the organic growth, because I think that expands the franchise, and we're going to create more long term value for shareholders. So I would definitely put that one. Within that you've got three buckets, insurance, reinsurance and investments which are equally competing for capital and for opportunities. I think the share buybacks are certainly on the table at the same time, and we're looking at it opportunistically during the year.
Joshua Shanker: And in that regard, and reinsurance renewals and trending, what's happening with ceding commissions? How is it impacting the returns in that business? And do you have an outlook for where that's going to impact numbers in the future?
Jim Williamson: Sure. Hey, Josh, this is Jim Williamson. Yes, just to give you a little bit of perspective, particularly around what we saw at one, one. We've been pursuing in a very deliberate fashion a strategy of growing with our core scenes particularly in casualty lines, and particularly on a pro rata basis. And we've had a great deal of success through one, one with that strategy and feel really good about the results that we're seeing. Look there's no question that there is a significant change taking place in the underlying insurance markets. Margins are expanding very quickly, we see rate well ahead of loss trend. Limits are being reduced. Coverage grants are being narrowed. And so all of those things add up to creating margin for our scenes, and then for us as we participate in those programs. And as you can imagine, there's going to be some trade around that with respect to ceding commissions. And so we have seen over the last couple of years, and we certainly saw a little bit at one one, some upward pressure on ceding commissions in the casualty market, we think they were they remain reasonable. For the most part, there were definitely programs that were beyond reasonable, and we don't participate in those programs, but mostly reasonable. And I think the bottom line is the margin that's being created, plus a little extra seeds still results in improving economics for us. On the property side, it was much more flat. As you can imagine, as people are seeking capacity and seeking to fill out their programs, we do see some improving economics in our book there. And the ceding commissions are not moving the same way they are in casualty.
Joshua Shanker: Thank you very much for the precise answers.
Jim Williamson: Thanks, Josh.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Michael Phillips with Morgan Stanley.
Michael Phillips: Thanks. Good morning. Kind of related question on reinsurance from the last month on ceding commissions. I guess on that, and Jim you just mentioned a bit of the profitability on the cedings. I guess I want to take that too, as the cedings kind of hold on to more risk and increase their own retentions, what does that mean for your outlook for how much of that was influencing growth this quarter? And what does that mean for your outlook for reinsurance growth and the year ahead?
Jim Williamson: Yes, sure, Mike, this is Jim again. To provide a little bit of perspective in terms of the fourth quarter growth rate for casualty, both on a pro rata and XOL basis, we achieved record levels of written premium, at what we view is very attractive margins. Those lines were essentially our fastest growing lines in the quarter. So I think that's an important fact. And look, at the end of the day, there are definitely cedings who think about how much of their own business they want to see to their reinsurers, particularly in the pro rata lines. And we did see around the margin, some movement away from pro rata structures, people shifting into XOL. However, one area that we focus very closely on is ceding selection. And what we're looking for when we choose to partner with a ceding with one of our core ceding in particular, are folks that consistently manage their reinsurance placements. And so we're trying to avoid cedings who are shifting quarter-to-quarter in terms of their participation. And we saw a lot of consistency among our cedings. I think the other piece that we've benefit from, given the strength of our franchise and our local trading relationships is in even in areas where maybe the total value of the session came down, there were areas where we were able to increase, share and sustain our revenue stream from our core clients. So all-in-all, I think a very successful fourth quarter and a very successful one, one from that perspective.
Michael Phillips: Okay, Jim thank you. It may be a little higher level question, maybe an industry question, I guess, as well. We've seen recently a lot of activity in the Florida market where some pretty big players are pulling out of the market. And one, I'm curious what you think that might mean for the industry, what we think that we think it means for maybe the next year or two for the industry, and maybe even specifically, any implications for your business in MLB [ph]. Thanks.
Juan Andrade: Yes, Mike. So this is Juan Andrade, and I'll start. Look, I think certainly what, what you saw take place in the industry in one one, and really, in the latter part of the fourth quarter was, frankly a lot of companies catching up on what we've been doing really over the last couple of years, which is looking at volatility and their book of business and making trade-offs and decisions on that. And again, this is something that we're ahead of the curve, as you've seen in our numbers, as you've seen in our calls and the dialogue that we've had. Look, the reality is that pricing in property cat has improved some, but it hasn't improved meaningfully enough to be able to justify and pay for the catastrophe exposure that we'll see that is really being driven by climate change. And so that has proven underwriters to be I think, a lot more prudent particularly in an environment like Florida and southeast wind in general. So I think the issue there becomes more of a public policy issue going forward, about capacity, the ability to ensure there's public policy questions with regard to zoning, with regard to construction, to essentially how we deal with a problem that we all have as a society that is related to the warming of the seas, rising sea levels, etcetera. But I would invite, I would invite Jim also to add maybe some commentary on that.
Jim Williamson: Yes, Mike, this is Jim. I'll just add a little bit more detail. I think one of the things that we clearly saw during the one one renewal was some meaningful dislocation in the retro market. And our expectation is that will play through into the Florida renewals in a very meaningful way. And so I do think there's going to be challenges as those renewals come up over the summer. And I think we're reasonably bullish that that could result in some significant rate increases, changes to programs, etcetera. That could present opportunity for us in a very selective way. Overtime, we've right sized our Florida or southeast wind portfolio. We are taking a level of risk that we're very comfortable with. And coming out of one, one, we do have dry powder that we can deploy selectively when we see great opportunities. And so if the sorts of trends that we're discussing here and the implication of your question come to pass, and there's a lot of dislocation in the Florida market, we might use it as an opportunity to selectively and in a very targeted fashion, pursue some incremental opportunity at great returns.
Michael Phillips: Thank you guys for the detail, appreciate it. Congrats on the quarter.
Jim Williamson: Thanks. Thanks, Mike.
Operator: Your next question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question you guys provided a 6% cat load guidance for 2022, which is at the low end of the target you laid out at Investor day. So I'm assuming that this implies that there's some mix shift going on, as you've discussed, to towards casualty in a way from some property cat related businesses really, probably within your reinsurance business. So how do we think about this mix shift impacting the underlying margin, and particularly the underlying loss ratio in reinsurance? Because I know you reaffirmed your overall guidance for 2022. But if the cat load is lower, does that mean, the underlying margin itself or the underlying combined ratio is a little bit higher due just to the mix shift going on?
Juan Andrade: Yes, Elyse, this is Juan in. Thank you for the question. So let me break it up in a couple of points. And then I'll ask Mark Kociancic to jump in as well. With regard to the guidance that Mark gave on the cat loss ratio, he said less than 6%. And that's basically related to a lot of the de-risking actions that I spoke to, in my prepared remarks earlier in this call. The reality is we have meaningfully reduced catastrophe loss potential in our book. We've achieved PML reductions in key peaks zones, and we've improved their overall portfolio economics. Catastrophe limits to COVID has been reduced, with a favorable reduction in expected average annual loss. So that is the key driver of the cat loss ratio coming down from our perspective. The other part of that is the fact that we are diversifying the book into non-cat lines of business. But as far as we're concerned, the margin that we expect to generate from the reinsurance division, if anything will improve in 2022, because of the actions that we have taken, but I'll invite Mark to up to add some additional color.
Mark Kociancic: Yeah, good morning, Elyse. Not too much more to add to Juan's comments, because I think he was quite complete. But we're definitely seeing somewhat of a mix shift between the growth of cat and the growth of other non-cat lines. We’re firmly in the 91 to 93. I think we have pretty good confidence on that going forward. So I don't expect that to impact the underlying profitability on the reinsurance side very much. And on a risk adjusted basis, I think this makes the most sense, given where we are with market opportunities.
Elyse Greenspan: Thanks. And then my follow up question on S&P is in the process of collecting comments on it's a revised capital model that it's looking to put out there. We're just hoping to get some comments on how this could impact Everest. I know since you guys are have the U.S. based, I think that that would impact you less than some of the Bermuda peers. But if you could just give us a sense of how you're thinking through the impact of the capital model on Everest? Thank you.
Mark Kociancic: Yes, it’s Mark again, Elyse. So we're watching this as it as it develops. There's only been kind of high level proposals that have been shared with the industry and we've obviously been very engaged in terms of direct discussion and industry, the discussions on it. I really don't see that much of an impact based on what we know today. S&P is definitely extending their timetable for industry feedback and will provide, I think, more detailed proposals thereafter. I think the biggest thing, and you've highlighted it in your question is really the debt issuance capabilities of Bermuda regulated companies. And it's an important factor to distinguish that Everest has a U.S. Holdco. That issues -- has issued our debt in the past, and we expect it to continue to be the main issuing legal entity for Everest going forward. That is within a regulatory domicile of the U.S. as opposed to Bermuda, so it should be unaffected. And therefore, we would avoid some of the concerns that have been elevated with that aspect. The other parts, that they've come out with last development factor charges that are somewhat higher with corresponding diversification benefits. We'll see how that impacts the industry, as long as they're based on sound economics, I think we'll be fine. The cat loss adjustments that they're making, into a broader timescale, 200 one in 200 to one in 500 years I think makes a lot of sense. And we're very careful on tail risk nonetheless. So I think we'll be fine there. The last piece is really more on the investment side. We've got some comments to make there. But we've got a broadly diversified portfolio that's high credit quality, so not too concerned, but S&P is very well respected, and they have a big impact on the industry. So you're going to see, I'm sure many companies comment on these proposals as time goes on. But for us, I think it's, we don't expect it to be very impactful.
Elyse Greenspan: Thank you.
Mark Kociancic: Thanks, Elyse.
Operator: Your next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS.
Brian Meredith: Yes, thanks. A couple of points for you here. First, Mark, I'm just curious, as an outsider, what's the best way for us to evaluate your excess capital position? I mean, look at your operating leverage is moving up. And that makes sense given the reductions in your P&L and kind of move it more towards insurance. How should we think about it that maybe should we continue to think about that operating leverage moving on?
Mark Kociancic: Well, we're in an access capital position; you know that we have the two debt raises. And I think we gave you pretty good guidance on the investor day in terms of our growth ambitions. And so for able to execute the strategic plan, I think we're going to be in good shape in terms of funding it. But we do have flexibility to grow more rapidly, as you saw last year, particularly in reinsurance where you saw approximately a 25% growth rate print, and we gave per annum guidance of 8 to 12. So there are times where we can really see what the market gives us. And then similarly on insurance, I think we're getting very strong growth there. Last year well over 20% and I think we've got a very good trajectory this year. I think that level of growth is probably the primary factor on how the excess capital develops in conjunction with the overall profitability of the group. So now we're in a, I think, a very good situation with excess capital, so no constraints on growing the group. And then we look at how the profitability evolves as we take into account future capital management actions, whether we're talking about buybacks or funding, more organic growth. I did mention last year, I’d say it might have even been Q4 in 2020. But I did see a lot of potential to improve the efficiency of the capital allocation in the group and you're getting to this point on operating leverage, there's probably some more that we can achieve and still be very capital efficient. And that's really kind of an all three buckets investments and the two divisions as well. So there is a bit more efficiency on that aspect that I would expect us to achieve in 2022. Thereafter, you're really talking about optimizing, but I like our position as it stands right now.
Brian Meredith: Great, thanks. Thanks for the answer. And the second question just on the 13% TSR that you guys have laid out what does that contemplate with respect to the interest rate environment. We obviously have interest rates have moved up subsequent to when you laid that out and that's an important part obviously of your TSR here. Its’ -- unrealized gains and losses on your on your book value. So how do we think about that?
Mark Kociancic: When we set up the plan last year, we took the base forecast for forward curves on interest rates. And that served as the underlying assumption primarily in the investment portfolio. And so I reaffirmed, for example, the investment returns. It's a factor that we have to manage in the execution of a plan. So whether it's underwriting or investments, and we're fine, with whatever direction that goes. Obviously if rates are rising, it's I think we got some more tailwind behind us. But it's one of the reasons when we went through the definition of the TSR that we excluded, the volatility that comes from unrealized gains and losses on the fixed income portfolio. And so that is where we expect not to be, we're creating real economic value, despite some of the macroeconomic volatility that can come from rates. And so that's why we set the TSR up the way, the way it is.
Brian Meredith: Great, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research.
Ryan Tunis: Hey thanks, good morning. A question for Juan. So you gave us the targets at investor day and since then, interest rates have gone in our favor. You've lowered your cat load you're exceeding the TSR goals, even in a tough 2021 cat year. Are we on a normalized basis looks an excessive 13%. So could you just give us some context on why you're having to revisit this targets?
Juan Andrade: Yes Ryan, thank you. Thanks for the question. Thank you for recognizing the accomplishments too, by the way. Look, what we said at Investor Day back in June, is that 13%, essentially was the floor and what we actually said it's greater than 13%. Now obviously we can't predict the future. But what we are very much focused on are the drivers and aligning those drivers to be able to drive that 13% or better from that standpoint. We had a good start in 2021. We've been able to do that. And we're very focused with the actions that we've been talking about on this call on the underwriting of the cap portfolio, some of the actions that we continue to take on the insurance side to improve the profitability of the book to seek profitable growth. And all of that is aimed for leading returns. Right? That's, that's really the focus on here. And so again, I go back to what we said, if we'd like to achieve at least the 13% TSR over that period of time, and we're off to a good start.
Ryan Tunis: Thanks. And then, I guess, just on the loss ratio, and reinsurance. Obviously there's the reserve charge a year ago. And yes, I guess it seems somewhat prudent to be to reserve the level of conservatism in 2021. Is there some aspect of 2022 that is potentially maybe less of a margin of conservatism that you might need to give us a little bit more confidence, and you want to show improvement ability to this year?
Juan Andrade: Yes. So let me start, and then I'll ask Jim Williamson to add more color. So look, I think we have been prudent in setting our loss fix. I think we have been prudent in how we analyze the reserves, the process that we put in place, we got a lot more insight, and more granularity into the data into the numbers to allow us to react. So I feel pretty good about that. When you look at the external environment, there's obviously things that as an industry, we all keep an eye on, right? You definitely keep an eye on social inflation. In the 2020, 2021 period, we definitely saw a drop in frequency and a slowdown in the courts. I'm not sure we have seen the courts completely open back up to full efficiency at this point in time. So you do keep an eye on some of the social inflation factors that are there, particularly as you're writing loss, long tail line. So that's an important component of that. The other component that you keep an eye on is real inflation, right? Material inflation, supply chain disruptions, all of these types of things, and the impact that that could have on trend. So from our perspective, what we have done is we certainly have adapted our loss trend selects for 2021, 2022 to make sure that we are continuing to select prudent loss picks given all those macroeconomic factors that are there. But in addition to that, we have continued to do a number of actions on the portfolio to ensure that the business that we're putting on the books meets our margin standards and it's very profitable, right. So you have heard from me, you have heard from Jim earlier in the discussion, some of the approach that we took throughout 2021 that we took to the one one renewal season that Mike Karmilowicz and his team has done also on the insurance side so that on-going portfolio management, that is just good underwriting is a key hallmark of all of this to ensure that we can meet the targets that we've set out. But with that, let me ask Jim to talk specifically about the loss ratio and reinsurance.
Jim Williamson: Yes, sure. Sure, Ryan, this is Jim. I'll just, I'll just add a little bit more detail to give you a sense of the discussion we're having each quarter as we look at our loss picks. As you can imagine, we set those picks on the basis of assumptions around rate change, as well as assumptions around loss costs. And as Juan indicated amply in his comments, it's really that loss cost uncertainty, given the risk environment, we're in that that gives us pause around how quickly to react to good news on the other side of the equation on the rate side, and the underwriting actions that our cedings are taking. And what we have seen consistently quarter-over-quarter is, the rate component of that equation has come in better than we've expected, better than we planned for. We also believe that the underwriting actions and the re-underwriting and the segmentation and all the work our cedings are doing is ahead of our expectations. And so what we're looking for is the emergence of proof in our loss costs, as those lines mature, particularly on the longer tail lines, that would allow us to begin reflecting that, that good news. And it's still very early. I know, obviously we all want to see it emerge. But when we talk long tail, it does take years. I would say there are indications that would suggest we're seeing some of that. And I think, certainly my expectation is that we'll begin to see some improvement in the underlying attritional loss ratio for reinsurance, on the casualty side of the result of that. And then certainly the underwriting actions we've taken on property, particularly what we did at one one. I mean, all of those things ladder up to improving economics, which show up primarily obviously in the cat loss ratio, but I think will also benefit our traditional loss ratio and property. So a lot of good momentum. But we do have to be very prudent in terms of the timeline on when we recognize these things.
Ryan Tunis: Thank you.
Jim Williamson: Thanks Ryan.
Operator: And your next question comes from Yaron Kinar with Jeffries.
Yaron Kinar: Thank you. Good morning, I guess maybe heading on Ron’s last question and until -- question earlier. So you ended 2021 with a consolidated report a combined ratio of just under 98 and head into 11% cat load, you're targeting a 6% cat load for 2022. So that essentially already gets you to that 91 to 93 combined ratio targeted range. So I guess my question is why wouldn't we see further improvement or see that target move down from 91 to 93 unless you see some headwinds coming on the other side?
Juan Andrade: Well, let me start with that. I don't think we see any specific headwinds other than what we've already discussed, sort of in the macro environment, right. And we are essentially working our book of business, working our underwriting, working sensibly all the levers that we have to be able to meet and exceed on all those targets. And you clearly saw that in 2021, with the 14.7%, on the total shareholder return. But we are doing, I think, a very good job in shaping this book of business to drive very sustainable results over time. And a key component of that is what we've done on the catastrophes portfolio over the last few years. You saw the benefit of that in 2021. You saw the actions that we have been describing that we took at one, one 22. And I think all of that is a positive. So I'm not necessarily seeing any headwinds per se, other than just the macroeconomic environment being able to react to that. But what we control I feel pretty good about.
Yaron Kinar: Right. Okay. And then I just want to further maybe clarify or try to better understand the guidance around the reinsurance top line growth, so 8% to 12% CAGR through 2023. Was the target, clearly you're well in excess of that as of the end of 2021? Is what you're saying ultimately, that the base is 8% to 12%, but if you see opportunistic, or if you see the opportunity to grow beyond that, you'll take it, or do you see maybe significant slowing over the next few years because market conditions potentially change?
Juan Andrade: Yes Yaron, let me give you maybe a broader perspective and then I'll bring it down to reinsurance and I'll ask Jim to jump in as well to give you a few thoughts on growth and how we're looking at 2022. Number one, I would start by saying that we do remain very comfortable with the growth targets that we set out on investor day, last June. And as you pointed out, we're well on our way to achieving them, given the growth that we had in 2021. The second thing I would say is you've also seen us respond to opportunities in the market in both our underwriting divisions to grow our company and expand margins. So if the opportunity is there, we're able to take it. And the reason for that is pretty straightforward, right? We're nimble, we're agile, we have the relationships, the products, the platform, the capital, and the people to continue to be able to do that. So that gives us I think, a pretty good competitive advantage in a pretty dynamic environment to be able to do that. A third point I'll give you is that, and this goes back to the capital allocation discussion we were having earlier. We do have a diversified franchise that really works to our advantage. And the way we think about allocating capital is really who can give us the best economic return, as Mark said, is it insurance, reinsurance, or investments within the company. But keep in mind that our focus is always the same one. It’s underwriting results. That's the core focus. That's what we really are driving. And it goes to also Ryan's question earlier about the margin. And so that brings us to the specific landscape of 2022. And so as I look at the landscape, I continue to see excellent opportunities for growth in primary insurance, both in the U.S., as well as internationally. And when we think about reinsurance, I've seen more selective, more targeted opportunities in that area. And we're going to pick our spots. Frankly, that's the bottom line. But I think what you're hearing from us is, look, we have traction in 2021 going into 2022. We have dry powder, as Jim mentioned earlier, and we intend to capitalize on the opportunities that we see. But at the end of the day, it's about underwriting income and underwriting results. But Jim, I don’t know if you'd like to add anything?
Jim Williamson: Yes, Juan. I’ll just provide a little bit more detail around how we're executing within reinsurance to give you some flavor for this. We've as Juan has indicated, we've been pursuing a strategy that's very deliberate around what parts of the market we want to capitalize on. And in 2021, and really, in 2020, as well, we saw an opportunity with the significant shifts happening in the primary casualty markets, to participate alongside some of the best underwriters in the business in a really meaningful way. And so we've grown our in particular casualty pro rata business will end, in the fourth quarter, that's almost three quarters of a billion dollars in premium, it's very meaningful for us. And that allows us to participate in all those economic improvements that we've been talking about today. So that clearly drove a lot of significant growth. So if we translate that, that then into how we executed in one one, the strategy is very consistent, we saw an opportunity to be thoughtful about where we're deploying cat capacity that will result in an improvement obviously, in the cat loss ratio, which we view as a very good thing. We were very focused on where we deploy our cat capacity. We absolutely moved away from retro and aggregate structures, moved away from working layers, continued to support our core cedings, optimize the portfolio, particularly in the pro rata space, and also target some selective growth in cat with key customers. And then on the casualty side, we continue to see some really nice opportunities for growth in a very targeted way, with our core cedings on some programs that that are new or emerging in the market. And, and we and we certainly react to those opportunities as well. So it's going to be very consistent, it's going to be targeted. And it's going to be sort of scaled relative to the market opportunity that exists. And as Juan said, we have dry powder. We've created nice margins, and we can react if new opportunities emerge during the renewal seasons for the rest of the year.
Yaron Kinar: Thanks for the helpful answers.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mike Zaremski with Wolfe Research.
Mike Zaremski: Hey, great. Good Morning. Juan, first question on the prepared remarks Juan you talked about in the primary insurance segment. I believe you've talked about improving your analytics and improve your hit ratios on sales by a meaningful mark. Maybe you can kind of elaborate it seemed like a meaningful increase and the hit ratio thriving sales and is that new business since you're tweaking the underwriting [Indiscernible] is it the booking guys maybe more conservatively to on the onset?
Juan Andrade: Yes Mike thanks. That's actually a very important thing you've highlighted because I think that also goes to the question that Yaron was asking a little bit ago about how we see the growth momentum into 2022. Look, I've said this before. Those who execute best when and distribution is a key component of all of that. So we're doing a number of things on the distribution area to be a lot more productive and be a lot more efficient. Number one, one of the things that we have done particularly in the U.S., is really expand our regional structure in the field, to be able to have more people on the ground, closer to our distribution closer to our brokers, to be able to plan our product offering and just be a lot more thoughtful about the solutions that we can sell, the solutions that are needed by them, etcetera. But backing all of that is essentially a shift into a much more quantitative approach to sales, where we now have very good data, very good intelligence at the underwriter level at the broker level, on what submissions we're getting, how we're looking at those submissions, how we triage those submissions, etcetera, etcetera. So the bottom line is that we're being much more effective at asking for what we want, what's within our risk appetite, and then being able to be much more efficient about what we bind based on what's coming into the funnel in the pipeline. And that's what you're seeing those hit ratios basically go up. So it's making this a lot more productive within our risk appetite. But I'll ask Mike Karmilowicz to add a little bit to that as well.
Mike Karmilowicz: Sure. This is Mike Karmilowicz, thank you for the question. I would just add a couple of things to that. Besides in distribution, we've been adding talent in addition, and changing the culture from more of a sales focus and customer mind set. So with that, the data analytics that Juan was talking about, we've been very much focused on simplifying our structure. So we can be a lot more efficient how we go to market in our offering is so we can bring it together and coordinate it more effectively, as an example. And what that's doing is we've developed sales pipelines. And we're being much more tactical with our distribution partners, which is allowing us to increase our hit ratio, and actually continue to improve, again, our success with our trading partners. So I think you'll see that as a continuation. So this is early days, but we're making a lot of progress in 2021 was an example of that.
Mike Zaremski: Okay, that’s great color. My follow up, is just an update curious on inorganic growth. Is Everest still open to any potentially sizable deals in strategic lines of business that could aid the long term hourly profile?
Juan Andrade: Yes Mike, it's Juan. And again, thanks for the question on that. Look, I'm pretty consistent on this theme. And you've heard me say this before, which is our strategy is organic, right. That's what we can plan for. That's what we're executing. And that is an insurance that is and reinsurance at this point in time. Now, that being said, as Mark pointed out, we do have access capital. And if we do see an opportunity along the way, that's interesting. Obviously, it's something that we will consider, but I'm not considering or looking at sort of transformative type things, etcetera. This would be more a full time does it help us in a particular geography, a particular product line, etcetera, etcetera. But the strategy remains an organic focus strategy.
Mike Zaremski: Understood. Thank you.
Juan Andrade: Thanks, Mike.
Operator: And your final question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW.
Meyer Shields: Thanks. Good morning. I appreciate you putting me in. Juan, in your comments you talked about a specific growth strategy for outside of North America. And I thought if we can get a little bit more color about the I guess regions lines, and specifically like the sort of risks that could hinder underwriting profitability in that new article as you penetrate those markets.
Juan Andrade: Yes Meyer, thank you. It's good to hear from you. Let me expand on that a little bit. So basically, we have been talking about really, since the past year, about a pretty thoughtful and disciplined strategy to essentially be the next phase of our development on the primary insurance site outside of North America. So we already have a presence in the U.K. We participate both into retail and the wholesale market. We have a company out of Ireland, as well. And what we're thinking about doing already are doing is basically extending our Irish company, essentially into the continent of Europe, but only into a very limited handful of countries where we can add value, and where we can believe can make a difference given our value proposition. In Latin America, we have now a small operation out of Chile. And similar sort of thought process on that thoughtful discipline, we think, well, we can add value. And we now have a base of operations in Singapore at the same time. And the idea for us is not to go around the world planting flags. It's really to select a few geographies around the world where we see a need for our product given either market dislocation, competitor dislocation, and when we can add value. And that's effectively what we're trying to do. From the perspective of what products we're targeting, essentially it's an upper middle market play more so than anything else, depending on the geography that will dictate, sort of the product range. If you are looking at the emerging markets in Asia and Latin America it’s going to be more of a first party play non cat. If you're looking at the more sophisticated markets in Europe, it's going to be a blend of first party lines and third party lines at the same time. But again, this is all a logical expansion from what we're doing in North America, and frankly, the success that we've had here.
Meyer Shields: Okay, thank you. That's very helpful. One quick question, if I can. We're seeing across the industry a lot of growth in I guess what people would term financial lines. And usually that means cyber gross, reinsurance communities actually went down for the quarter in the year. Juan, something that you could talk about maybe a strategy for cyber or other factors that are driving that decrease.
Juan Andrade: Yes, let me ask Mike Karmilowicz to provide some follow on that.
Mike Karmilowicz: Sure, thanks for the question. This is Mike Karmilowicz here. But cyber for us is a portfolio we entered about a couple of years ago. It's a very small portfolio. But we've been very diligent on our focus. It's more middle market driven. And the opportunity that we've been able to accomplish is really focusing on two key things from our perspective. One is really making sure the requirements, whether it's MSA or whether the risk profiles have all the hygiene and things that are necessary to make sure it's a required suitable risk is one thing we've been very sure to sell. So the market itself, with all the different rate increases, we've seen, has allowed us to sit there and really focus on just the things that we want to go after. So it's a very small portfolio. We're not -- we're just picking the rate and looking for opportunities. But I don't see that market is slowing down anytime soon. And we continue to look for the right risk profile with the right requirements around cyber hygiene. And if they don't meet that, will continue to kind of just move forward and manage it effectively.
Meyer Shields: Okay, fantastic. Thank you.
Operator: I would now like to turn the conference over back to management for closing comments.
Juan Andrade: Great. Thank you for all the questions and the excellent discussion today. As you can hear from our tone, we're optimistic about the opportunities before us. And we continue to build our company, accelerate progress and create value for our investors, clients and the markets that we serve. Thank you for your time for us today. And thank you for your continued support of our company. And we look forward to talking to you next in our Q1 results. Have a great day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-10-28 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Everest Re Group Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Jon Levenson, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Jon Levenson: Good morning, and welcome to the Everest Re Group Limited 2021 third quarter earnings conference call. The Everest Executives leading today's call are Juan Andrade, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Kociancic, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We are also joined by other members of the Everest management team. Before we begin, I will preface the comments on today's call by noting that Everest SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. Management comments regarding estimates, projections and similar are subject to the risks, uncertainties and assumptions as noted in these filings. Management may also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These items are reconciled in our earnings release and financial supplement. With that, I turn the call over to Juan Andrade.
Juan Andrade: Thank you, John and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. During the third quarter, Everest continued to make progress towards the strategic plan objectives detailed in the June Investor Day presentation. We achieved outstanding top line growth across both our insurance and reinsurance businesses, continued to improve underlying profitability for our insurance segment, continued diversification of our reinsurance franchise, demonstrated strong expense discipline, delivered excellent investment income results, opportunistically reduced our cost of capital, and returned capital to our shareholders. We continue to execute our plans, regardless of the external environment. Before I get into the results, I want to first acknowledge the human cost of the catastrophes in the quarter. For those people whose lives have been affected around the world, by the wind, fire, floods and earthquakes experienced in the quarter, these are life changing events and this is always top of mind for us at Everest. As insurers and reinsurers, we are here, as these communities work to rebuild, recover, and hopefully emerge even stronger, and for Everest, this is when our ability to execute really matters. Turning to the results for the third quarter, the strength and resilience of our fundamentals continues to prove our strategy is working, and our execution is on pace. As we shared there in the June Investor Day, we measure our success against the three year strategic plan with a simple goal; create value and drive meaningful shareholder returns over time. This starts by ensuring that our reinsurance and insurance businesses supported by our investment portfolio are doing exactly what we said they would do, drive forward momentum to fuel profitable growth. On our core, Everest is a growth company focused on sustained profitability with a well-diversified earnings stream. Beginning with our insurance division, which delivered record high quarterly top line growth, marking the second consecutive quarter of over $1 billion in gross written premium and the lowest attritional combined ratio to date, we continue to prove our relevance in the market and our ability to execute. There's significant runway ahead of us to grow profitably and we're capitalizing on it. We're well on our way to growing into the world-class specialty global insurer we've set out to be. Reinsurance delivered double-digit growth and we continue to further diversify our book across lines and geographies around the world, a key part of our discipline strategy to reduce volatility. This discipline was evident in the previously announced third quarter pre-tax net catastrophe losses of 635 million from Hurricane Ida and the July European floods, events totaling over 40 billion in industry insured losses. Everest is not immune to cat losses but the cumulative, deliberate and purposeful actions we have taken to reduce volatility have changed our company's risk profile. We have taken a disciplined approach to diversifying our book and reducing reliance on a single peak cap zone. For example, we have reduced our PMLs for southeast wind to almost half of what they were in 2017 from 11% to 5.9% of equity. We have scaled back our total property cat XOL premium, which comprises 17% of our total reinsurance premium today versus 26% at the end of 2017. Our book is better positioned and less volatile today than it was two years ago. We will continue to thoughtfully manage our risk profile to maximize returns. Turning to investments. Performance here was excellent. We continue to optimize our portfolio, and its earnings power as a key diversifier of our earnings. Prudent capital management is another important part of our strategy. Just after quarter end, we completed an opportunistic $1 billion debt raise at a three and an eight coupon. This is very efficient, long-term capital. In addition, we continue to opportunistically repurchase shares throughout the quarter for a total of $200 million year-to-date. If the engines of our strategy are our core underwriting platforms supported by our investment portfolio, our transformation efforts focused on operational excellence and underwriting discipline are the fuel for those engines. During a quarter when the industry sustained meaningful losses from catastrophes, this discipline made a material difference in our financial outcome. It is about commitment to consistent execution and building a company for the long term. Throughout the third quarter, we saw the benefit of this commitment manifest in several ways. We continue to prove we can play offense in a favorable market to pivot and respond to changing market conditions. We're executing on a value proposition that continues to be well received by our customer and broker partners. We have the talent and capabilities to deepen distribution relationships, and diversify our presence in key markets around the world. We have established our purpose-driven culture as a differentiator. We also see it in the top industry talent who have joined Everest, and who view the company as a great environment for development and opportunity. With that, let's dive into more detail around our results this quarter at the group and segment level. Beginning with our group results, growth in the third quarter continued to be strong and diversified across both of our businesses. We grew gross written premiums by 25%, a barometer of our market relevance. The increase in premiums was a product of our ability to capitalize on improving economic conditions, driving exposure, growth and new business opportunities, the favorable double-digit rate environment and high renewal retention. The combined ratio of 112 include 635 million of pre-tax net catastrophe losses from Hurricane Ida and the European floods during the quarter. The group attritional combined ratio of 87.9 reflects strong underlying profitability in insurance and our continued diversification in reinsurance, coupled with ongoing prudence in loss picks selection. Catastrophe losses during the third quarter resulted in an underwriting loss of 323 million. Net investment income for the quarter was again outstanding, up 25% to 293 million. And the expense ratio also improved this quarter. The meaningful progress this quarter is not a sprint, it's about consistency; day by day, quarter by quarter, being thoughtful and strategic about developing the portfolio, prudently managing expenses and pursuing overall operational excellence; these actions all add up. The cumulative effect is evident in our year to date results, and a few are worth highlighting now. Year-to-date gross written premiums are up 24%. Our business has continued to drive strong growth and momentum. We generated close to $1 billion in net income year-to-date. This is a testament to the earnings power of the company. Net investment income year-to-date has more than doubled from $420 million for the period last year to close to $1 billion today. Our expenses continued to improve and the group attritional combined ratio is also trending better year-to-date. Finally, for the nine months year-to-date, annualized total shareholder return on equity is over 13%. With that, I'd like to turn to the results in our reinsurance business. We had another excellent growth quarter in our reinsurance division with gross written premiums up 19%. We strengthened the franchise through underwriting actions to create a more diversified, resilient, and lower volatility business. The growth was broad and diversified, every geography and targeted line saw continued expansion in the quarter. The combined ratio of 115 includes the impact of third quarter pre-tax net catastrophe losses of 555 million from Hurricane Ida and the European floods. Our focused actions to de-risk our portfolio are reflected in these results. The share of our book exposed to Cat losses has declined. Diversification is key because the severity and frequency of these events are a reality. We see the impact of climate change in our data and we take a proactive and scientific approach to how we model and underwrite for it. Our dedicated team of experts continuously assess the science and integrate its effect on lost costs into our models. This focus will continue to be a key part of our strategy. Our attritional combined ratio for the quarter was 87, including an attritional loss ratio of 60. Our attritional loss pick reflects our deliberate and targeted shaping of our portfolio to maximize results. This includes a higher mix of pro rata structures, and an improved balance of property and casualty exposures. These underwriting actions position Everest to benefit from the underlying rate increases and improving terms and conditions achieved by a core seasons in the primary market. Combined with continued prudent loss picks, this result in a relatively higher attritional loss ratio, but with better long-term risk adjusted returns on capital. As you know, the primary market has benefited from multiple quarters of strong rate improvement, a reduction in limits and the strengthening of terms and conditions. Our strategy of focusing growth on core trading partners means we're benefiting from these effects alongside some of the industry's best underwriters, and we expect strong portfolio economics to emerge. Risk adjusted return expectations are improving in every line, in every geography. At the same time, we remain vigilant regarding market trends, including climate change, supply constraints, and social and material inflation. As a result, we continue to hold prudent loss fix. Finally, Mt. Logan continues to be an important part of our strategy, and we are thrilled to have brought in John Modin as its new leader. Jim Williamson is available to provide additional details during the Q&A. Now for our insurance division. Performance continued to be strong with exceptional growth and expanding underlying margins. In the third quarter, we wrote over 1 billion in gross written premium for the second quarter in a row and achieved the highest quarterly growth rate to date at 43%. The growth in insurance was fueled by a few factors. Number one, we continue to seize opportunities from increasingly favorable economic conditions. Second, we continue to grow through new business and demonstrate our relevance to customers and brokers. Third, we're benefiting from strong retention rates. This, coupled with continued favorable double-digit rate increases is creating the kind of opportunity Everest was built for and that we're poised to capitalize on. We maintain a strong focus on portfolio management as an important part of our strategy and driver of long-term profitability. We continue to proactively position the company to play offense and react nimbly to market conditions by driving our business mix stores product lines with better rate adequacy, and higher long term margins. Renewal rate increases continued to exceed our expectations for loss trend, up 12% in the quarter, excluding workers compensation and up 8% including workers compensation, which now represents 12% of our overall portfolio with model line comp down to only 7%. Rate increases were led by excess casualty, up 17% and financial lines up 14%. I've said it before, those who execute best in this business win and the quality of growth and insurance and our focused discipline comes down to simply excellent execution. During the third quarter, we expanded traditional underwriting margins with improvements in loss and expense ratios. This includes a 2 percentage point improvement in our attritional loss ratio of 62.9 and an improvement to 14 in the operating expense ratio. This resulted in the division's lowest attritional combined ratio to date at 90.3 and almost 4 point improvement over the same period last year. The underwriting loss of 17.2 million in the quarter was a result of the impact of pre-tax net catastrophe losses, including 80 million for hurricane Ida. However, the year-to-date underwriting profitability shows the indicative strength of our portfolio and ability to execute. We have a long runway in front of us, and we're investing in the talent, the systems and our worldwide capabilities to make us better, more efficient and more relevant in the market. Mike Karmilowicz is available to provide additional details during the Q&A. Reflecting on the progress we made against our long-term objectives, it is evident we're working with the right formula for success. Everest management team has the level of focus, deep expertise, and entrepreneurial approach to take us on our path forward and bring us even further. I am proud of the work we're doing building on a strong, inclusive culture that is constantly delivering for our clients and for our partners, pushing the envelope in digital innovation and our commitments as good corporate citizens. The opportunities are there, and Everest is well positioned to seize them. Now I will turn it over to Mark Kociancic to take us through the numbers in more detail. Mark?
Mark Kociancic: Thank you, Juan, and good morning everyone. Everest continued to make excellent progress executing its strategic plan and remains well on track to achieve its objectives. I'll discuss these topics in a few minutes but first, a recap of the third quarter results. For the third quarter of 2021, Everest reported gross written premium of 3.5 billion, representing 25.3% growth over the same quarter a year ago. By segment, reinsurance grew 19.2% to 2.5 billion and insurance once again reported gross written premium of $1 billion in the quarter, representing 43.2% year-over-year growth. Year-to-date, the group's gross written premium was 9.6 billion, up 24.4% compared with the 7.7 billion figure from the first nine months of 2020. Turning the net income, net income results for the quarter were impacted by the global cat events seen worldwide, particularly hurricane Ida in the US and European flooding in Germany and Belgium. As a result, for the third quarter Everest reported a net loss of $73 million and a net operating loss of 53 million equal to negative $1.88 and negative $1.34 per share, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, Everest reported net income of 948 million and operating income of 795 million, equal to $23.72 and $19.87 per common share respectively. Everest reported 635 million in net catastrophe losses during the quarter, as detailed in our October 14 earnings press release. The manageable losses from these events are strong evidence of the material de-risking of the portfolio over the past few years that Juan described and as evidenced by our reduced PMLs. Importantly, these results were well within average expectations from events of this magnitude and within our risk appetite. We also note that there is no prior period development in the cat losses this quarter, all are current accident quarter events. Beyond Ida and the European floods, there were a number of smaller events which did not breach the Everest cat event threshold of $10 million per event. Our practice for reserving for these smaller events is to include them in our attritional loss ratio estimates. And as such, these events did not materially impact our Q3 attritional loss ratio selections. I also note we have not added to our COVID-19 incurred loss provision, which remains at 511 million, with the vast majority remaining as IBNR. Third quarter results continued to reflect the impact of our underwriting and portfolio management initiatives. For the group, our underlying attritional profitability remains strong during the third quarter. Excluding the catastrophe losses, reinstatement premiums, prior year development and COVID-19 pandemic impact, the attrition total loss ratio for the group was 60.9% in the third quarter of 2021 compared with 59.3% in the third quarter of 2020. The year-to-date attritional loss ratio for the group was 60.6% compared with 60.2% a year ago, reflecting our overall mix of business shifts to longer tail casualty lines. The attritional combined ratio for the group was 87.9% for the third quarter compared to 85.8% for the third quarter 2020 and year-to-date, the attritional combined ratio for the group was 87.6% compared with 88% a year ago, as commission and expense ratio improvements offset the attritional loss ratio movements. For insurance, the attritional loss ratio improved 1.9 percentage points in the third quarter to 62.9% compared with 64.8% in 2020. The attritional combined ratio for insurance improved 3.9 points during Q3 to 90.3% as compared to 94.2% over the same period a year ago, given the favorable attritional loss ratio improvement and the reduced expense ratio. Our US insurance business which makes up the majority of the book continues to run very well with an attritional combined ratio in the high 80s. Turning to reinsurance, attritional losses in the reinsurance segment were largely driven by changes to the mix of business, notably proportionately more casualty premium plus 4.8% year-over-year. As a result, the third quarter 2021 attritional loss ratio was 60.2% compared with 57.5% a year ago, and the attritional combined ratio for reinsurance was 87.1% compared with 83% for the third quarter of 2020. The group's commission ratio of 21.2% for the third quarter was up 1 percentage point from 20.2% reported in Q3 2020, largely due to changes in the composition of our business mix with more pro rata property and casualty business, which has a higher commission ratio versus excess of loss. The group expense ratio was exceptional at 5.3% for the quarter, and down a full point as compared with 6.3% a year ago. The expense ratio continues to benefit from our continued focus on expense management, and the benefits of increased scale and efficiency from our operating model. For the third quarter investment income once again produced an exceptional result of 293 million as compared to 234 million for Q3 2020. Alternative investments accounted for 170 million of income during the third quarter, largely due to increases in the reported net asset values of our diversified limited partnership investments driven by the continued economic and financial markets recovery. As a reminder, Everest reports limited partnership income one quarter in arrears, so the current quarter results are based on the valuations as of June 30. Invested assets at the end of the third quarter totaled 27.8 billion compared with 27.1 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2021 and 25.5 billion at year end 2020. Approximately 78% of our invested assets are comprised of a well-diversified high credit quality bond portfolio with a duration of 3.3 years. The remaining investments are allocated to equities and other invested assets, which include private equity investments, cash and short-term investments. Our effective taxes on net income and operating income for the third quarter of 2021 were negative 16.2% and negative 21.4% respectively. The variance from our estimated tax rate of 11% for the year was largely due to the geographic distribution of income impacted this quarter by the catastrophe losses which were primarily underwritten on our US domiciled entities. For the first nine months of 2021, Everest generated 2.8 billion in operating cash flow compared to 2.2 billion for the first nine months of 2020, reflecting the strength of our premium growth year-over-year, and we also note that operating cash flow for the quarter was a record at approximately 1.2 billion. The Everest balance sheet remains exceptionally strong with ample capacity to continue to execute on market opportunities, shareholders' equity was just under $10 billion at the end of the third quarter, compared with 9.7 billion at year end 2020. Our attractiveness as a counterparty was endorsed by the markets, as evidenced by the debt raise in early October. Everest issued $1 billion of 31 year senior notes at a very attractive coupon of three and an eighth, lowering our cost of capital over the long term. With this additional capital, Everest pro forma financial leverage at the end of Q3 is just above 20%, in line with our long-term target of 15% to 20% and we will manage our leverage within this range as we continue to optimize our capital structure through the course of the strategic plan. And as with the offering from last year, we will deploy the proceeds into the business, given the organic growth opportunities highlighted in our strategic plan and the current favorable underwriting environment. Everest repurchased 625,000 shares in the quarter for a total of 160 million and year-to-date, the numbers are 791,000 shares and $200 million. Quarter-end book value per share was $253.40, compared with $260.32 at the end of the second quarter, resulting from 100 million in the change in unrealized gains and losses on the fixed income portfolio driven by changes in interest rates, plus the quarterly net income result. And I want to close with an update on our progress towards the Everest total return, or TSR target as detailed during our Investor Day. Through the third quarter of 2021, the TSR stands at 13.2% annualized, on track to meet the three year TSR target of at least 13%. The fundamentals of our long-term value creation plan remained strong, based on the diversified set of earning streams, reinsurance, insurance and investments along with an efficient capital structure. We affirm our strategic plan assumptions and TSR target over the three year timeframe as detailed in our June investor day. And with that, I'll now turn it back to John.
Jon Levenson: Thanks, Mark. Operator, we are now ready to open the line for questions. We do ask that you please limit your questions to two or one question plus one follow up and then rejoin the queue, if you have any remaining questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question is from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question is on capital. So we saw your capital return on the buybacks pick up in the quarter. Can you just give us a sense of how we should think about repurchase is from here and is that dependent upon how market conditions evolve over the course of the next year? And then tying into that answer, can you just give us constant commentary about potential M&A would fit into any capital return decisions that you guys are making?
Mark Kociancic: Thanks, Elyse. It's Mark speaking. So we did have a pretty meaningful share buyback this quarter. That's pretty much par for the course, given where we are with our strategic plan and very strong growth assumptions that you see there. Not much has changed, we are simply privileging organic growth, as we develop our franchise with our capital. We see very good conditions in the market in both reinsurance and insurance but the capital management side is something we can do alongside that expansion and so you'll continue to see share buybacks consistent with what we've done in the past moving forward, as time moves on. Regarding the M&A?
Juan Andrade: So let me address that, Elyse and this Juan Andrade. Look, as I've said publicly before, M&A is certainly part of our toolkit. Now we prefer to build our businesses organically and we see great opportunities in the market right now to be able to do that as evidenced by the growth rates that we have posted, not only this quarter, but really on a year-to date-basis. But it is something that we look at and if we find the right opportunity to advance our agenda and advance our business, we will certainly take a look at that, but our strategy remains primarily focused on growing our business organically.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay, thanks. And then my friend question, on an unwritten and earned basis in insurance, what's the GAAP versus loss trend right now? And how much more the book needs a season before you would take down your loss effect?
Juan Andrade: Yeah, Elyse, this is Juan again. So look, I would say that, we continue to see very strong double-digit rate momentum, as we quoted in my remarks, plus 12 for the quarter. And essentially, every line of business right now, with the exception of workers comp, is ahead of trend and it has been for a number of quarters at this point in time, so we expect that to continue. The way we look at our reserving and again, I think I've been pretty consistent about this, since I started as a CEO here almost two years ago, is we're very disciplined. As I mentioned in my remarks, we are also cognizant of the external environment, whether it's social inflation, climate change, CPI type inflation and everything that's out there right now, so we do prefer to let things season over time before we take action and bring that down. However, you also saw in the insurance numbers this quarter, the improvement that we made in the loss ratio, and again, this is consecutive, to prior quarters as well. And I would point the fact to, again, statements I've made in the past, it's not only about rate, it's about all the management actions, day to day in the portfolio, how we look at individual books of business, how we shape that portfolio, how we manage that, how we focus our attention our execution on lines of business that we believe have a higher potential for long-term margins. So, all of that is built into that and essentially, that is what you see reflected in the improvement than the loss ratio on an underlying basis for the insurance division.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay, that's helpful. Thanks for the color.
Juan Andrade: Sure, Elyse. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from Mike Zaremski with Wolfe Research.
Mike Zaremski: Great. Good morning. Maybe, on the reinsurance segment first, please. Thanks for the commentary about the change in business mix. So I guess I'm just wanted to be clear if should we be factoring in this kind of changing business mix in our - it's kind of a new baseline in our go forward, in terms of kind of the higher attritional ratio on some of the business you're putting on? It sounds like that that's the read through from the commentary on the call so far.
Juan Andrade: Yeah. Thanks, Mike. And again, this is Juan Andrade. Let me start and then I'll ask Jim Williamson to add some color. To reiterate some of what I said in my prepared remarks, what you see happening in the reinsurance attritional ratio this quarter, loss ratio this quarter, is really the result of deliberate actions that we're taking, right and those are deliberate actions to accomplish really three things. Number one, is to fully benefit from the strong market that we're seeing. We're seeing rates and long tail lines to be up, terms and conditions to have been improved, limits to have been shortened and so as a result of that, we're growing in our pro rata structures in casualty alongside some of the best underwriters in the primary market. You see it in the supplement. Our casualty pro rata business was up 63% for the quarter, so that's indicative of how we're playing offense and taking advantage of these market conditions there. The second thing for us that we're trying to accomplish is really, this is part of our deliberate strategy to reduce volatility, and diversify our book opportunistically, in the lines of business that we believe can deliver strong risk-adjusted returns. That's the other part that you're seeing there right now. It's us purposefully moving our book of business in a direction that we believe will give us long-term risk adjusted returns on capital that are quite attractive. And the third part of it, and this is related to the answer that I just gave to Elyse, again, as I've said, from the beginning, we are a disciplined underwriting company and we do maintain prudent loss picks in light of the external environment. So what you are seeing is that, particularly the long tail lines will carry essentially higher loss picks than the short tail lines and as we move that business over, this is the end result that you will see, but with an outcome that we expect to return that much better margins in the future while reducing the volatility of the company. The bottom line is we feel very good about the portfolio that we're creating right now and the embedded margin that we're creating. And we also feel very good about this being able to achieve the targets that we laid out on Investor Day and that Mark just affirmed.
Jim Williamson: Yeah, Mike, this is Jim Williamson. The only thing I would add to what Juan had said and really only to add some additional color is, we obviously are very close to our core cedants who are driving the really strong growth that we've had in areas like casualty pro rata. And when you unpack their results in terms of what they're seeing, from a rate change perspective, their ability to reduce limit profiles, to improve terms and conditions, these are not subtle changes, these will have a dramatic impact, obviously, on the quality of the book that we have today and we're very excited about that. And our expectation is that those conditions will persist. And so we want to continue to partner with those core cedants as they move through this market. But the last thing I would add, obviously, is we remain very flexible, and where we see good risk-adjusted returns, we're absolutely willing to shift our mix quarter-to-quarter, year-to-year and we will retain that flexibility as we move forward.
Mike Zaremski: That's very helpful. Just one follow-up, so with this business, it sounds like it's going to result in the near term and obviously, I don't want to just focus on the near term, but in a slightly higher attritional loss ratio, is it more capital efficient to and that you can write more business versus the rest of the business? Or it really should we just be thinking this is just better long-term business and eventually, it'll probably come through over time in a better combined ratio, in matter of years.
Jim Williamson: Yeah, sure. Mike, this is Jim again. So look, it is something we keep a very close eye on. We have a very disciplined capital allocation process within the company and for every line, we're continuously referencing back to how various lines of business consume capital and return on those lines. But this is not about trying to maximize top line. It's not a strategy related to that, it's really about pursuing best risk-adjusted returns. And in the market environment that we're moving in, we see a lot of excellent opportunity in the casualty lines and so it's about the pursuit of good bottom line performance, about good consistent results, about achieving our long-term strategic ambitions and about managing the volatility of the group. Those are really the decision factors that are driving the growth that we're seeing in casualty.
Juan Andrade: Yeah, Mike, and I would just add to that. Look, this is part of when we talk about execution. This is a proof point and this is exactly what we're talking about that we identify an opportunity, we identified a core group of cedants that are driving this forward in a very positive way. And we see the economic benefit that can result for the company by partnering up with them. This is how we're driving our business forward.
Mike Zaremski: Understood, good color. And one last follow up, given a lot of changes in business mix and some new management team members, I think, historically, there's been more - it looks like true ups on reserves at the end of the year in 4Q. Is that something we should be thinking about? Is there some type of kind of seasonality we should be thinking about, at the back half of the year, the back quarter of the year?
Jim Williamson: Yeah, Mike, this is Jim, again. Thanks for the question. One of the things that we've talked about in the past is the work we're doing to continuously improve our approach to reserving and one of the changes that we've made coming into this year is we've rebalanced our reserve study calendar to move away from having so much activity in the fourth quarter. And so year-to-date, we've completed about half of the number of reserve studies that we plan on completing for the year. As we do every quarter, we're reviewing the results of those studies and we'll continue to do that. So it's absolutely something we're changing over time and I think you'll see us continue to make progress in the next year to create a more balanced level of activity across quarters.
Mike Zaremski: Thank you.
Juan Andrade: Thanks, Mike.
Operator: Your next question is from Michael Phillips with Morgan Stanley.
Michael Phillips: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Let me start first question on the ILS market, anything you've seen there from fund managers in terms of just changing appetite to continue supply, given what's been a pretty tough last couple years, and certainly this quarter?
Juan Andrade: Yeah. Thanks, Mike. Let me start and then I'll ask Mark Kociancic to add his point of view as well. Look, I think definitely, what we're hearing from investors, particularly post Ida and post the floods in Europe, is basically a bit of a concern about the catastrophe activity that's out there in the industry. You have also seen the fact that some of that money has moved more towards the cat bond market and towards very much higher up in structures and there are still appetite there. As a matter of fact, we saw a lot of capacity and attractive pricing, again, at the higher levels and at the higher attachment points, etc. But I think in general terms, I would say you probably are seeing a little bit of concern right now in the ILS market with some of these investors but I would ask Mark to also add his perspective on this.
Mark Kociancic: Yeah, it's clear we've had underwhelming performance to say the least over the last few years in terms of cat activity, and the impact of climate change, I think is something that is still trying to be understood by the market in general. And then you've had examples of trapped collateral. And so I'd say that's somewhat slowed the inflow based on this recent history that we've seen, but, look, today's losses, I think, make morals pricing. And so I see this as kind of a cycle that will work its way out as information becomes clearer, terms become better and the volatility starts to reduce as a result of that better information entering the models.
Juan Andrade: Mike, and I would finish up by saying, this also creates an opportunity for rated carriers like us. The reality is, there's going to be a lot more demand for companies with the financial strength and the ratings like government to continue to write business going forward. So while there has been maybe more of a muted concern that we're hearing, on the other hand, it also presents an opportunity for us on the front end.
Michael Phillips: Okay, thanks, guys. Appreciate that. My second and final question. Juan, you mentioned, you're still seeing pretty good pricing in insurance ahead of loss trend, can you say you're assuming in on casualty loss trends in your advising?
Juan Andrade: Well, it's typically not something that that we have disclosed publicly but what I can tell you, Mike, is that we review this on a quarterly basis, I think, as Jim was basically talking about, this is really part of the analysis that we do every day or every quarter. And, we drew this up for everything that we're seeing from the perspective of social inflation, that we see from the perspective of what we're seeing in wage inflation out there, etc., etc. and so we try to stay very much on top of that.
Michael Phillips: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research.
Ryan Tunis: Hi, guys. Good morning. First question, just thinking about your guidance for 7% cat load. The average cat load over the past five years has been 15%. Just curious, why do you still think that that's a prudent best estimate?
Mark Kociancic: Well, so Ryan, it's Mark answering here. So, obviously, our cat budget and our cat planning exercise within the operating plan is modeled out based on expected losses. Clearly, there's been substantial volatility over several of the years, not all of them. Last year was a bit more modest, actually below plan. The 7% is how it works out mechanically between reinsurance and insurance. Having said that, we have taken our cat portfolio and reduced its risk profile over the years since - essentially since Harvey, Irma Maria back in 2017. And so that de-risking that we've taken has been quite conscious. And alternatively, the group and I think you saw this highlighted during the Investor Day, is really expanding in other non-cat lines of business. So I would expect Everest going forward, whether it's reinsurance or insurance to continue to de-emphasize cat as a significant driver of premium and profit but it's still a meaningful and attractive risk, despite the volatility.
Ryan Tunis: Got it. And then sort of reinsurance, it sounded like, you didn't have to change your loss picks because of the cash that didn't meet the $10 million threshold. Should we think about that as a more likely outcome in the fourth quarter, just given the pace of the activity we've seen here today, is there risk of that could be some loss picks change in 4Q in recent and other activity?
Mark Kociancic: I just want to make sure I understand your question. Are you wondering if our Q3 events that were smaller in size are going to bleed into Q4 or are you questioning what's happening in Q4?
Ryan Tunis: No, I mean, my understanding was that that you guys have like a loss pick budget for those attritional type losses and I was wondering if - maybe you haven't exceeded that yet but maybe you were close to that or might not?
Mark Kociancic: Yeah, yeah. Okay. So look in Q3, there were several other cat events globally. They were relatively small for us. I highlighted in my opening remarks that our cap threshold is $10 million and so there were a few that fell underneath that and those were easily absorbed into our Q3 attritional loss ratios, so I don't expect any development from there going into Q4.
Ryan Tunis: Got it. And then just wondering, I was curious about is it, from a reinsurance perspective and property cat treaty, when you have a storm like Ida, I'm just looking for some perspective here, how many treaty claims do you have? Is it that most of that loss is in five claims or are we talking about 70 or 80 treaties? Directionally trying to understand when you get losses like this, how concentrated is that in individual seats?
Jim Williamson: Yeah, Ryan, this is this is Jim Williamson. I mean, look, what I would say, if you're talking about an event like Ida, you're definitely going to see losses across a large number of cedants, I think that's to be expected. And then, a bit of an obvious statement, but really big cedants who have larger exposures will drive a meaningful portion of the total loss. But this was a pretty broad event, and particularly as it related to a major impact followed by a smaller flooding event. It's going to, I think, carry a fair number of cedants into loss activity.
Juan Andrade: The one thing that I would add to that Ryan is, think about the geographic - this is one I am driving, by the way, think about the geographic scope of the storm, making impact in Louisiana, extending through the mid-Atlantic and going up into the northeast, all the way along the way. So you're going to have different actors, right. So you're going to have some regional cedants, particularly in the Gulf states and then you have some of the national carriers who are impacted both in the southeast as well as the Mid Atlantic and the Northeast as well. So I would say it's a mixture of that basically.
Ryan Tunis: Thanks, Juan.
Juan Andrade: Sure.
Operator: Your next question is from Meyer Shields with KBW.
Meyer Shields: Two small questions and one bigger picture. A small question is, did the attritional loss ratios in either reinsurance or insurance include any adjustments to the first half of the year?
Jim Williamson: Yeah, Meyer. This is Jim Williamson. No, there were really no material adjustments related to activity that happened earlier in the year, it was really reflective of the third quarter activity.
Meyer Shields: Okay, perfect. And I know we're all sort of focused on cat, so I want us to question in a slightly different way. With S&P sort of rumbling that they're going to possibly increase capital requirements for cat because the industry might be under estimating it and given the apparently high possibility of call it above average losses for the year, how important is it to have a risk strategy to write any property cat at all?
Juan Andrade: Yeah, so let me address that Meyer, I think that's a fundamental question. Look, we are in the property cap business but we're also mindful that the external market conditions have changed over time, and they have changed for a number of reasons, right. You clearly have the impact of climate change, as we've discussed, it has manifested. We certainly see the impact of the ILS market that basically I think has muted the size of the rate increases that you see post events like Ida into that market. And so while we see it as an attractive line of business, we also see better returns in other lines of business going forward. And it's part and parcel of the reason why we have been on this de-risking journey that we have continued to talk about, to essentially change the profile of our company. So, all of that is in our minds. We are students of the environment. We are students of the science. We're also very disciplined in how we look at our portfolio and how we allocate capital between lines of business. And this brings us full circle back to the question that Elyse and Mike Zaremski asked earlier in the call, right. It's one of the reasons why you see us basically growing in the in the casualty lines of business at this point in time. So it's definitely part of the equation, it's definitely part of the strategy as we conceive our plan and we drive the company forward.
Meyer Shields: Okay. Understood. Thank you very much.
Mark Kociancic: Sure, my thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from Brian Meredith with UBS.
Brian Meredith: Thanks. A couple quick ones here. First one, I'm just curious, can you talk a little bit about how the current inflationary pressures that we're seeing economically impacted your business and influence your loss picks? And then on top of that, maybe add a little bit in your view toward inflationary rate right now, are you seeing any increase as courts reopened at all?
Juan Andrade: Yeah, sure. Let me address that Brian and I'll invite both Mark and Jim to also add their points of view on it. Look, I think it's important to recognize what inflation means to the industry versus what we see in the CPI index and the headline news that's out there. I think it's undeniable that we are in a period of inflationary pressure from a purely CPI perspective. You see it in our goods, you see the upsurge in demand, the restriction in supply that's going on up there and you definitely see a part of that. And it's manifested in used car values, and chips, and all of these things that are out there basically. From our perspective, we monitor from the asset and the liability side. On the liability side of our balance sheet, we're specifically focused on wage inflation and also on healthcare inflation, the cost of medical care, basically. Those are critical things that that we watch very carefully. Now, your question on how that translates into how we think about loss fix, etc., is excellent, because that is part of the analysis that we do on a quarterly basis, when we're looking at our loss fix and, frankly, when we're doing our bridging for future year plans and when we're doing our reserve studies, etc. And we try to build in those inflationary pressures into our numbers. And it's one of the reasons why we keep pushing for pricing and why we believe that this pricing environment will continue for at least another year, if not longer, for the longer tail classes of businesses. The other thing that's important to recognize is that also on the liability side, there are some mitigants in the book, right. So if you think about exposure rated lines, like general liability, workers compensation, etc., those will rise also with the impact of inflation and so there's some hedges that are built into that. But the primary hedge for us is how we look at our loss picks and how we do the analysis on a quarterly basis. When we look at the asset side of the balance sheet, that's also how we position our portfolio to make sure that we are as fireproof as possible and while we maintain the liquidity there. But let me ask Mark to add some commentary on the asset side, and then I'll invite Jim Williamson to talk a little bit more on the liability side.
Mark Kociancic: Yeah, so Brian, it's Mark. Look, on the asset side, this is something we think about because it's unclear how permanent or transitory the inflationary pressure that we're seeing is going to be going forward. And so we've got our portfolio, the asset portfolio positioned such that we think it can react reasonably well, versus a high inflation environment. And so there's a high degree of liquidity as well, that augments the kind of cash demands that you would have in a high inflation scenario. We benefit from shorter term asset duration and a relatively short duration on the liability portfolio plus a significant amount of assets exposed to equities or floating rate debt, which should be somewhat immunized in a high inflation environment. The other piece that I'll add, maybe before Jim steps in, is we have stressed the liability portfolio for different inflation scenarios and to see how it would perform and our ability to absorb it. And so that's something we do, in addition to the reserving side of the assumptions, etc., is to see how it can perform in different types of environments.
Jim Williamson: Yeah, Brian, this is Jim Williamson and I'll just address the second part of your question related to any bounce back that we may be seeing in our data related to the reopening of courts and frankly, the reopening and growth in the economy. And I think there is a degree of bounce back occurring, we certainly see it in areas like liability frequencies, we see it in medical utilization. It's not a tremendous effect. But it's also, I think, feeds into the rationale for being very consistent in how we set loss picks and not over responding to some of the good news that has come through in our data and you wait for that to mature, so that some of these transitory items like a bounce back in activity have time to play themselves out, and that's very consistent with our approach around loss election.
Brian Meredith: Makes sense. Thanks. And then my second question, when you've talked about growing your insurance business internationally, I'm just curious, do you have the platform right now to actually really see some good growth there or are there some areas that you need to expand? either organically or in organically?
Jim Williamson: Yeah, I think it's a little bit of both. So, we are very focused right now on the next step of our journey, on the primary side of our business. I think we've done a very nice job growing it in the US specifically over time, and we see significant overseas opportunity, right. The reality is that the market is quite big and it's also a diversifying opportunity. One of the things that you learn over time is that emerging markets and developed markets move to different rhythms. And so when developed economies are down, emerging economies are up, and it's a good diversifying hedge from that perspective, in addition to the insurance market opportunity that's out there. Right now, we have a company out of Ireland, that allows us to do business in the continent of Europe, we have our Lloyd's syndicate and so we're able to utilize that as a platform for expansion in Europe and in the UK. When you start thinking about expansion into Latin America and Asia, you are thinking more of a greenfield type opportunity at that point in time and our plans are very much in motion right now to be able - to grow that business organically but it also goes back to the question that I was asked earlier in the call as to how does M&A potentially fit into all of this and our strategy is organic, as I said, but we're also mindful of any opportunities that may help to accelerate our progress as we move forward.
Brian Meredith: Makes sense? Thank you.
Jim Williamson: Sure. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from Josh Shanker with Bank of America Securities.
Josh Shanker: Yeah. Thank you very much for taking my question late in the call. Growth obviously is very large in the insurance segments, particularly professional lines and specialty. But every line of business grew including workers comp, which you cited has being slightly below trend, I guess, in terms of performance. And given what we're seeing pricing, certainly it isn't up yet in workers' comp. Can you talk a little about the growth in workers' comp, which wasn't tremendous, but it was still growth in a pricing environment that may not be particularly favorable?
Mike Karmilowicz: Sure, Josh, thanks for the question. This is Mike Karmilowicz. Yeah, the growth in comp, there's a big part of that in the exposure change that's coming from just the payrolls and obviously people going back to work. And then the other piece, keep in mind is, a big part of our business that's been growing has been the loss readable and - loss sense and loss readable business on the risk management side. We continue to do the same thing we talked about as being very disciplined around our motto line, guaranteed cost comp. So again, most of that growth is just coming from specifically the overall exposure change.
Juan Andrade: Yeah, and I think Josh, what I would add to that, again, keep in mind what we've said in the past, not only have we de-prioritized the growth of worker's compensation for what we've said and what you've pointed out in your question, but within workers compensation, our focus has really been more on the loss ratable risk management type business where we can actually get better pricing than the mono line. And that's one of the reasons why in my prepared remarks, I emphasized the fact that while comp overall is now down to only 12% of the portfolio, mono line is down to only 7% of the portfolio, right. So it's important to understand that nuance with income at the same time.
Josh Shanker: Thank you. And this is maybe a bit cheeky. But you raised the debt and you had Ida and you bought back stock. I know, you said that your preference is to grow organically. But can you talk about when you bought the stock in the quarter? I mean, maybe I'm trying to get a little sense of appetite more so. Was it after Ida, was it before Ida, was it after the capital raise? I guess I'm looking for a little color there.
Mark Kociancic: Yeah, both, before and after, so at the beginning of the quarter and also in September. If I could just add Josh - sorry, it's Mark speaking. If I could just add a couple of points. We made it pretty clear during the investor day that we felt we could get a more efficient capital structure and part of that is increasing the debt leverage of the company into a 15% to 20% range. And when you look at the kind of print that we got the three and an eighth coupon that's very low, long-term capital costs, so for us, the combination of issuing the debt and using it to fund future growth expansion is really a function of providing a lower cost of capital for that organic growth in line with, I think, what is a more conventional capital structure with something closer to 20% debt leverage. I think the share buybacks that's really, look, a function of our confidence in our business. I wouldn't read too much else into it, the volatility that we had from the cats is something that we expect in this business, it was very much in a risk appetite. It never dissuaded us from any kind of capital management actions and so, we move forward here with a lot of confidence. And that was one of the points I was trying to make towards the end of my monologue regarding the affirmation of our plan, assumptions, the target and the path that we're on. We feel like there's an excellent opportunity in front of us, we're built for it, we're executing, and there's a lot of momentum.
Josh Shanker: Well, I appreciate all the clarity. Thank you very much.
Juan Andrade: Thanks, Josh.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.
Juan Andrade: Thank you all for your questions and the excellent discussion today. I'll wrap up today's call by reiterating our confidence in our ability to continue fueling profitable growth, seizing the opportunities before us and advancing our strategy. The goals that we've outlined are ambitious, but we've already made material inroads on our path forward. We're making investments in our talent, our culture, in our capabilities, because we believe those are the ones that will help us drive superior shareholder returns. I'm bullish about the future of Everest. Thank you for your time with us today and for your continued support of our company. I look forward to seeing you all again to discuss our fourth quarter and year-end results. Thank you
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-07-29 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Everest Re Group Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Jon Levenson, Head of Investor Relations.
Jon Levenson: Good morning, and welcome to the Everest Re Group Limited 2021 first quarter earnings conference call. The Everest Executives leading today's call are Juan Andrade, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Kociancic, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We are also joined by other members of the Everest management team. Before we begin, I will preface the comments on today's call by noting that Everest SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. Management comments regarding estimates, projections and similar are subject to the risks, uncertainties and assumptions as noted in these filings. Management may also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These items are reconciled in our earnings release and financial supplement. With that, I turn the call over to Juan Andrade.
Juan Andrade: Thank you, John. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining the call. Everest delivered an outstanding second quarter with strong growth and excellent underwriting and investment performance. We set multiple records for our company on both the top and bottom lines. These results serve as the foundation for our exceptional net income result of over $1 billion through the first half of 2021 and there are another important step towards achieving our three year strategic plan objectives and the delivery of superior results to our shareholders. Everest achieved an annualized total shareholder return of 22.5% through the first half of 2021 while exceeding our three year strategic plan target of 13%. We capitalized on market opportunities to expand our franchises in both reinsurance and insurance driven by relentless execution and the strength of our value proposition to our clients and brokers. Disciplined underwriting drove strong profitability in both reinsurance and insurance in our investment return was a quarterly record for the company. The standout performance this quarter demonstrate the progress we have made in executing our strategy and the quality of Everest diversified earnings. As I discussed at our Investor Day in June, our strategy has three building blocks. First is building our underwriting franchises. We are growing our Specialty P&C Insurance platform while expanding its margins. We are, solidifying our leadership position in global P&C reinsurance while we are growing and diversifying this business. Our investment portfolio is a core tool to generate solid returns and we're optimizing the portfolio while sharpening our strategy. Second, we continuously pursue operational excellence this starts with underwriting discipline, supported by system of management oversight and checks and balances beyond underwriting, we are transforming the operating model of the company to achieve greater scalability over time. We are also optimizing capital within our underwriting and investment portfolios. Capital is valued and respected. We are using the most efficient sources of underwriting capital from the capital markets including the ILS investors. In our industry those who execute best win. We're leveraging our flat agile organization to deliver best in class service and risk solutions to our brokers and customers. They routinely side our responsiveness and capabilities as a key reason why they choose to do more business with Everest. Finally, ESG principles are core of the Everest. This includes focusing on the culture of our company. Culture is one of our key differentiators and it is one of the reasons we can attract and keep top talent. Our culture fuels our success by helping our team be the best it can possibly be. We're investing in the talent of the organization as well as the diversity of our team. At Everest, we have three drivers of earnings. The first driver is about building a high-quality specialty commercial P&C insure the run underwriting excellence and a compelling value proposition. We are embedding data and analytics across the organization, enabling more effective pricing and decision-making, this means we make better underwriting decisions at improved loss ratios. We are improving our claims outcomes while delivering excellent service to our clients. And we're focusing our distribution efforts to be more sales and results oriented. Our second driver of earnings is average leading global P&C reinsurance platform. We enjoyed a leading market position of a fully scaled platform and we are focused on continuing to grow and optimize our reinsurance business. We are executing an underwriting transformation by improving operational oversight, governance and controls. Our Reinsurance Division is entrepreneurial and nimble, we will maintain it within a framework of pricing, reserving and process discipline. We're further diversifying into higher margin opportunities. And finally, we're expanding our risk financing by further partnering with capital markets and ILS investors. The third core driver of earnings is the investment portfolio. We have a high quality portfolio and we're focused on the efficient use of capital. The successful execution of our strategies in all three drivers of earnings is clearly evident in our results. I will now discuss our Group Reinsurance and Insurance First Quarter 2021 results. Starting with the Group results, we grew gross written premiums by 35% and net written premiums by 39%. Our growth was broad and diversified, stemming from one increased exposures and new business opportunities as the US economy recovers. Two, continued double-digit rate increases three expanded shares on attractive renewals and four, strong renewal retention. The combined ratio was 89.3% and eight point improvement year-over-year. The attritional combined ratio was 87.6% almost a full point, better than prior year with both segments expanding margins. We generated $274 million an underwriting profit compared to $51 million in the second quarter last year. Underwriting profitability remains at the core in everything we do. Net investment income was simply outstanding at $407 million compared to $38 million in the prior year second quarter. These strong operating results led to a net income for the quarter of $680 million resulting in an annualized return on equity of over 28%. Gross written premiums and reinsurance were up 40% over the second quarter of 2020, we are pleased with the ongoing execution of our 2021 plan. This growth was broad-based in the areas we discussed during our Investor Day as attractive. We achieved this growth while also coming off or reducing shares are less attractive business. We drove continued targeted growth in property CAT which we achieved while lowering our PMLs in peak zones, thus reducing expected volatility and improving risk adjusted economics. Much of our growth came from our core trading partners that are looking to grow with Everest because of our strong ratings and balance sheet, significant capacity and the ability to right across all lines. The attritional combined ratio ex-COVID 19 pandemic impacts was 86.1 for the quarter, a 60 basis point improvement year-over-year, resulting from our continued focus on loss and expense management. We see risk adjusted returns expanding in almost all treaties and classes of business globally. We're also benefiting from investments in data and analytics. As you can see in our results, our focused actions, improve the quality and profitability of the book. We are writing a more balanced portfolio with improved economics at an appropriate level of risk. We have achieved improved portfolio economics across all of our 2021 property renewal dates. We improved in every dimension, we increased topline, increased margin and achieve higher ROEs. In casualty and professional lines primary rate increases continue to outpace expected loss trends. Jim Williamson is available to provide additional details during the Q&A. Our insurance division continued its strong performance with excellent growth and underwriting results. We continued to expand margins as we execute our strategy. We wrote over $1 billion in gross written premiums for the first time in a quarter. This represents 25 percent growth year-over-year or 30% growth excluding workers' compensation. This growth is driven by disciplined cycle management, new business opportunities, continued double-digit rate increases and strong renewal retention on existing business. We're also starting to see a steady improvement in overall economic activity. The growth was well diversified and target classes of business where market conditions are prime for profitable growth, including specialty casualty, professional liability, property, transactional liability and trade credit and political risk. We are pleased with this diversification as it is a core tenet of our strategy. We also delivered strong underwriting results with a 93.5% combined ratio. A 10 point improvement over the same period last year, which was impacted by COVID. The underlying performance was also excellent with a 92.1 attritional combined ratio, a 1.6% improvement over last year and almost 4 points better than the second quarter of 2019. Renewal rate increases continued to exceed our expectations for loss trend of 14% in the quarter excluding workers' compensation and up 11% including workers' compensation. Rate increases were led by excess casualty up 22%, property up 16%, financial lines up 14% and general liability up 9%. We are building a diversified portfolio, steering our mix towards product lines with better rate adequacy and higher long-term margins. We also continued to manage average limits deployed to mitigate volatility. We are pleased with the progress we have made and the strategic direction and granular portfolio management should continue to possibly impact our results going forward. We continue to thoughtfully manage to workers' compensation line, which now represents 10% of our second quarter premiums, down from 14% year-over-year. While this line remains profitable we have pared back monoline guaranteed cost writings and shifted to more loss sensitive, loss ratable business where we share more risk with our customers with more focus on risk mitigation. Workers' compensation is an area of expertise at Everest and we're monitoring market conditions closely for potential opportunities, but these efforts illustrate our disciplined cycle management. Lastly, our strong position in both the E&S and retail channels continues to give us access to a wide opportunities. Michael Karmilowicz is available to provide additional details during the Q&A. In summary, Everest had an outstanding second quarter with strong growth and exceptional underwriting and investment performance. We have a vibrant and well diversified reinsurance and insurance businesses with experienced leadership and underwriting teams providing industry-leading solutions to our customers. We have significant momentum as we continue to execute our strategic plan. The company has excellent financial strength top talent and a prudent capital management philosophy. We are focused on sustained profitable growth. A more diversified, targeted and deliberate mix of business and superior risk-adjusted returns. We believe the relentless and disciplined execution of our strategy will result in maximizing shareholder returns. I am confident that Everest future and our ability to deliver on our commitments to customers and shareholders. Now, let me turn the call over to Mark Kociancic for additional details on the financials. Mark.
Mark Kociancic: Thank you. Juan, and good morning everyone. Everest reported excellent results for the second quarter of 2021 with robust premium growth, excellent underwriting results and truly outstanding investment returns, I'll provide more detail on these points over the next few minutes. The second quarter of 2021 Everest reported gross written premium of $3.2 billion, representing 35% growth over the same quarter a year ago. By segment, reinsurance grew 40% to $2.1 billion and Insurance reported its first ever $1 billion topline quarter representing 25% growth year-over-year. Turning to net income for the second quarter Everest reported net income of $680 million resulting in an annualized return on equity of 28%. We also reported net operating income of $587 million equal to operating earnings of $14.63 per share and an annualized operating return on equity of 24.5%. All three of our earnings engines provided meaningful contributions with significant underwriting income from both our reinsurance and insurance franchises capped off by net investment income of $407 million, a record quarterly net investment income result. The underwriting income during the quarter of $274 million reflects Everest disciplined execution of our strategy to grow and expand margins, combined ratio was 89.3% for the quarter compared to 97.5% last year. Catastrophe losses during the quarter, of $45 million or pre-tax and net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums with $35 million in the reinsurance segment and $10 million in the insurance segment representing additional IBNR provisions for winter storm, Uri. The Reinsurance segment cat loss includes a provision for minor events and preliminary IBNR for the European convective storms of late June. Finally, I know we have not added to our COVID-19 incurred loss provision which remains at $511 million with the vast majority remaining as IBNR. Second quarter results continue to reflect the impact of our underwriting and portfolio management initiatives. Our underlying attritional profitability remained strong during the second quarter excluding the catastrophe losses, reinstatement premiums, prior year development and COVID-19 pandemic impact. The attritional loss ratio for the group was 60.3% in the second quarter of 2021 compared to 60% in the second quarter of 2020. The year-to-date attritional loss ratio for the group was 60.5% compared with 60.7% a year ago. The attritional combined ratio for the Group was 87.6% for the second quarter compared to 88.5% for the second quarter of 2020 representing a 0.9 point improvement. Year-to-date attritional combined ratio for the Group was 87.4%, compared with 89.1% a year ago, representing a 1.7 point improvement. Our insurance the attritional loss ratio improved to 64.2% in the second quarter of 2021 compared with 65.1% year-over-year. The attritional combined ratio for insurance improved to 92.1% as compared to 93.7% for the same period of time. Our US Insurance business, which makes up the majority of our insurance business overall continues to run very well with an attritional combined ratio in the high '80s. For reinsurance the second quarter 2021 attritional loss ratio was 59.1% compared with 58.2% a year ago. The increase was due to a mix of business shift and more prudent initial loss picks. The attritional combined ratio was 86.1% for the second quarter, down from 86.7% for the second quarter of 2020. The group commission ratio of 21.8% for the second quarter of 2021 was down 100 basis points from 22.8% reported in Q2 2020 largely due to changes in the composition of our business mix. The expense ratio remained low over 5.5% for the quarter as compared with 5.8% reported a year ago and the expense ratio continues to benefit with our continued focus on expense management and the increased scale and efficiency of our operating model. For the second quarter investment income had an exceptional result of $407 million as compared to $38 million for Q2 2020. Alternative investments accounted for $266 million of income during the second quarter, largely due to increases in the reported net asset values of our diversified limited partnership investments and as a reminder, we report our LP income one quarter in arrears. And in 2020 the market and the world we're starting to experience the impact of COVID 19 while so far in 2021 results continue to benefit from economic and financial markets recovery. Invested assets at the end of the second quarter totaled $27.1 billion compared to $21.6 billion at the end of Q2 2020 and 25.5 billion at year-end 2020. Approximately 80% of our invested assets are comprised of a well-diversified high credit quality bond portfolio with a duration of 3.6 years. The remaining investments are allocated to equities and other investment assets, which include private equity investments, cash and short-term investments. Our effective tax rate on operating income for the second quarter of 2021 was 9.3% and 10.6% on net income, this was a favorable variance versus our estimated tax rate of approximately 11% based on the geographic distribution of income. For the first six months of 2021 Everest generated a record $1.6 billion of operating cash flow compared to $1.1 billion for the first half of 2020 reflecting the strength of our premium growth year-over-year. Our balance sheet remains very strong with a capital structure that allows for the efficient deployment of capital and ample capacity to continue to execute on market opportunities. Shareholders' equity was $10.4 billion at the end of the second quarter 2021 compared with $9.7 billion at year-end 2020. We repurchased $16.8 million of shares in the quarter. Our debt leverage ratio is 13.3% or approximately 15.5%, inclusive of our $310 million short-term loans from the Federal Home Loan Bank. Book value per share was $260.32 at the end of the second quarter compared with $241.57 at the end of Q1 2021 reflecting dividend adjusted growth of 8.4% and I'll close with one final number. The total shareholder return or TSR target that we detailed in our Investor Day a few weeks ago. Recall that TSR is defined as the annual growth in book value per share, excluding unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturity investments, plus dividends per share and for the year to date the TSR number is 22.5% annualized. And with that, I'll now turn it back to John.
Jon Levenson: Thanks, Mark. Operator, we are now ready to open the line for questions. We do ask that you please limit your questions to two or one question, plus one follow-up and then rejoin the queue if you have any remaining questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your line is open, please ask your question.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks, good morning. My first question was on the reinsurance underlying loss ratio. So, you guys mentioned that the increase in the quarter reflects business mix and more prudent and loss picks, I was hoping to just get some more color there. And then how should we think about the loss ratio kind of trending forward from here.
Juan Andrade: Yes, thanks. Elyse. This is Juan. So let me start out with that and then I'll ask Jim Williamson to add some additional color specific to your question on the loss ratio. Now, I would start off by saying that Reinsurance reported I think a very strong 86.1 attritional combined ratio in the quarter and 85.8 year to date and we achieved at the underwriting discipline, strong market conditions and a prudent loss picks selection. You've heard us talk about our strategy and the disciplines, we're implementing that squarely focused on continuing to drive world-class margins. But with that, let me ask Jim to give you some additional color on what drove the loss ratio.
Jim Williamson: Yes, sure. And thanks for the question. Elyse, I mean the first thing I would say, and this is very consistent with the way we've described our value proposition and our strength in the market and that's that we're very nimble in this market, we have portfolios and markets around the world across many lines of business and we look to trade in into those various areas to maximize our total economic returns and that was certainly the case in the second quarter. And you see it in terms of some of our line of business growth where areas like pro rata casualty, were up 64% just incredible results we saw a lot of great opportunities to expand participation with some of our core partners and we took advantage of that. Conversely property cat XOL, which is a line of business where you have a big appetite for, it's a very, very attractive line grew at 17%. So, an excellent result. But obviously lower growth and that's aligned with a very low attritional loss ratio and so mix is absolutely going to play a factor there and it's going to bounce around from quarter to quarter depending on where we see opportunities emerging in the market. So those trades very successful outcome for our company. And then, the next piece around loss picks and again a lot of consistency from us on this topic is we set very prudent loss picks and in particular, if you think about the environment we're trading in with inflation, social inflation, the reopening from COVID, there's a lot of uncertainty in the market in, particularly in some of the longer-tail lines like casualty pro rata where we're growing, our view is we really need to see the results of rate change and the results of underwriting actions by our seems to play through and mature in our book. And so you will expect, as we see those results come through we'll certainly be sharing those results, but it will take time given the nature of our business for that to prove itself.
Juan Andrade: Elyse, and maybe if I could jump back, and this is Juan and just add a couple of quick things, one, I think we also recognize that by growing casualty pro rata, we're also seeing lower volatility then from the growth in Property cat XOL but also keep in mind, what's going on in the environment. So I think this goes directly to your question on expected margin and we are confident based on all our metrics that we're looking at that, we are building future expected margin not only reinsurance, but also an insurance. We're still seeing rate exceeding expected loss cost. From my prepared remarks, you heard about the improvement in economics that we have seen across the board in our renewals last year and this year, particularly in reinsurance. We're basically increasing our margins while lowering our exposure. And again, I point you to the fact that an 85 combined ratio for the year on an attritional basis for reinsurance is excellent.
Elyse Greenspan: That's helpful. And then, my second question is on capital at your Investor Day in June you pointed to booking to increase your leverage as you work on your three year financial plan. So as we think about the leverage going up, I just want to get a better sense of timing. As you think about adding to your leverage, and as part of the answer to that question, would you guys consider adding to leverage to support capital return via potential share repurchases or would it just be coinciding with when you thought you needed more capital to support the strong premium growth.
Mark Kociancic: Hi Elyse, it's Mark. Just a couple of points on that. So I think the primary focus of the capital structure is really to support the organic growth of the business and so we'd look at it in context of supporting the growth and also from an opportunistic point of view of taking advantage of good market conditions to issue that type of debt. So I do foresee that happening over the course of this three year plan I think it makes a lot of sense. Having said that, we are still committed to active capital management so that includes share buybacks, but that would be, what I would call a secondary consideration. It doesn't mean we can't do it simultaneously but the first part is really all about franchise expansion through organic growth.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay, thanks for the color.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Phillips from Morgan Stanley, your line is open, please ask your question.
Michael Phillips: Thanks, good morning. I wanted to start with comp Juan, I heard your comments in the opening on how you're making some changes in comp and more loss sensitive accounts. But I guess you know there's been a lot to talk of maybe we're starting to see a change in pricing there. I'm not so sure if that's materializing for you guys. I hope you maybe you can give some color on, specifically on California. If you back out the... the COVID impact of California, it looks like the current, the current accident years are still trending pretty well, pretty good margin there. So when we, guys, just curious what you're seeing there and if that's, if that's the case, should we expect to see a turn in the market, especially for your accounts that others are talking about.
Juan Andrade: Yes, Mike. Thanks for the question and I'll give you some additional color and ask Mike to also jump in I start by agreeing with you. I mean, our comp business is still very profitable and I stated that also in our prepared remarks, but we are mindful of how we deploy capital and we do see that pricing has flattened in workers' compensation at this point. Actually, in June we saw it go positive for the first time, so we're looking at that closely and see if that's a hardening of things to come. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we'd like to comp business. But we're also smart about how we deploy capital and we're seeing frankly better return opportunities right now in other lines of business, which I quoted in my remarks, where we're seeing significant rate across the board, but we are starting to see not only the flattening. But again, I would point to the fact that in June, we also started to see positive rate across the board but let me ask Mike Karmilowicz to give you some additional color.
Mike Karmilowicz: Sure. Thanks, Juan. And thanks for the question. Yes. As Juan mentioned, this is a perfect example for cycle management and actually really fully focusing on where we see opportunity and we are starting to see that stabilize across the country, particularly in California. For the first time we think we're starting to see some pockets in green shoots and with exposure both coming on. we are encouraged by where it's going and ultimately, we think that will be prepared to take advantage of that. You also see our slowing down ultimately in our comp, as far as the first quarter over second quarter. We're starting to see some changes there. So we feel that there is going to be some change in the marketplace, particularly in California. Keep in mind too with California, some of the, some of the reports that just came out from some of the organizations around some underlying cost we've noticed too that some of the overall costs that are associated with, with such as reforms on pharmaceutical and other different things California's performed actually better from a loss cost perspective of some of these things. So, we think that by end of the year and on next year. Mike. We'll see some of the starting to benefit us and you'll see us go after the business if that opportunity presents itself.
Michael Phillips: Okay, great. Thanks guys, thanks for all the details there. Second question, should we expect to see any uptick on the insurance side on the amount of business you want to. So just net to gross premiums we expect to see that to tick up over the next year.
Mike Karmilowicz: Sorry, Mike. You cut out. Can you repeat the question. I'm sorry is this better. Can you hear me okay?
Michael Phillips: Yes. Okay, good. Insurance net the gross premiums. We expect to see that to tick up over the next year or so.
Mike Karmilowicz: Look, we have -- and you know we started a lot of segments over the years, we've been building this out organically. So we particularly trying to hedge ourselves with some of the Reinsurance in some of these clients we do. I think as you continue to see us gain scale we will definitely see the net tick up with to our growth over time. And as we continue to kind of take the lines in the market to use increase, you'll see that happen.
Juan Andrade: Yes, Mike, I would add that we're feeling very confident about the underlying book in the insurance division and particularly in this environment with better pricing, better terms, I think you can expect to see some of that going forward.
Michael Phillips: Okay, perfect. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker from Bank of America. Your line is open, please ask your question.
Josh Shanker: Yes, thank you. Two questions on reinsurance, and without naming names when you're growing as fast as you're growing, you need to be taking share from somebody else, who are the market participants? Again, without naming names but giving us a sense of what the market looks like who are by choice ceding share to growers like yourself right now would the marketplace looks like that's allowing you to take so much here?
Juan Andrade: Yes. Sure, Josh. I appreciate the question. So what I would say is, and we've been very consistent about this, we trade with a fairly select number of core partners and that's what's really driving our growth, whether it's in property casualty in markets in the US or around the world and we are absolutely a preferred market for our clients, we're preferred because we're nimble because we're creative, because we distribute authority to our teams, they make decisions, they move quickly and we're benefiting from all of those things. And in this environment. I think for cedents who are sophisticated about their buying. They are absolutely looking to trade up in terms of the quality of their partners and we benefit from that and so what we're seeing on programs around the world is we are getting increased signings with our core partners because of our broad capabilities, we're also able to trade into deals with core partners that we may not have been on before. And then, obviously, as they introduce new programs into the market, we're able to participate there as well. And so we find this to be a very favorable competitive environment that way.
Josh Shanker: And the second question, if you talk to a number of competitors in the marketplace, they tend to say that that the litigation environment is still come up from the pandemic, the frequency of reported loss is lower than it should be, but everyone's reserving for it with a I'd say that will accelerate as things sort of return to normal and some extent. As a reinsurer obviously, you're one step away from that and you're relying on the reporting of your students to help you frame your own losses. How does the gums up litigation environment inform how you are thinking your loss picks at this point and preparing for that future?
Juan Andrade: Yes, it looks -- that's a very key point to make and it's an important trend and I think folks who expected some of the downturn and frequency of some of these losses during the period of COVID who thought that that would continue. I think that's a significant mistake. And our view has never been that we should react to that temporary environment and so we've held our loss pick study which is sort of where we started the Q&A today. And so that prudence really puts us in a strong position, as things start to unwind, and you do see a little bit more activity in terms of litigation and things of that nature, we don't have to react the other way either. So that prudence that consistency benefits us when you see these very short-term changes in loss trend, we have to really be picking our losses for the long-term trends that we're experiencing and those trends have not ceased just because of the temporary slowdown due to COVID.
Josh Shanker: Have you seen any data that suggests this temporary slowdown as a person?
Mark Kociancic: No, look, I mean in terms of the Reinsurance business to the point that you made in your question the lag of reporting in terms of hard data, it's certainly too early to tell, but obviously we're in constant communications with our cedents. And I would say folks are starting to see some of the results of the reopening we're certainly seeing it in areas like auto for example but that's in the realm of anecdote at this point, Josh.
Juan Andrade: And, Josh, I would -- this is Juan. I would give you some color on the primary side where you are starting to see frequency come back to more normalized lever particularly around commercial auto general liability et cetera et cetera. So this goes back to the theory that we have since last year, which is the shutdowns and the lockdowns in the COVID pandemic did lead to a temporary change in frequency patterns maybe even severity patterns. But that's not going to be a steady state, I think you will see normalized frequency normalized severity come back.
Josh Shanker: Thanks for the answers.
Juan Andrade: Thanks, Josh.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields from KBW. Your line is open, please ask your question.
Meyer Shields: Great, thank you. Good morning. I'm asking this question not so much on the reserving side but from the underwriting side, the property pro rata book is growing. And what we've seen recently is obviously enormous volatility and loss trends for property lines, can you give us a sense in terms of how rapidly your cedents can can't respond to higher property losses with their pricing and underwriting?
Juan Andrade: Yes, thanks for the question Meyer, what I would say is, you really have to break it down into its components and I think there are some areas, particularly in the commercial lines, which is really where our book is focused they can respond pretty quickly. And it's, it's a combination of obviously rate which we're seeing very strongly in the market, it's a combination of terms, conditions, attachment points, limits, our cedents and because we do partner with very high quality primary underwriters, they are absolutely aggressively addressing changing conditions in the underlying property market. And so I think it actually happens reasonably quickly. But again, and I hate to sound like a broken record on this, is why we do maintain prudency in our loss picks, because some of these things take time to unfold. And we want to make sure that they get proven out. The other piece that's important. When we think about our own profitability in property pro rata is obviously loss pick is critical, but we also look at things like ceding commission, and so we've seen improvements in terms there and that allows us to get to a place where the overall economics are very attractive and which is why we're willing to grow the line.
Meyer Shields: Okay, that's helpful. And my next question with on ceding commissions. Are you seeing the same success in casualty you are in property with regard to I guess declining ceding commissions.
Juan Andrade: Well, it's obviously a very different market and you hear a lot of the market commentary and you heard it from us. Regarding the rate changes that are happening in a lot of the casualty lines here in the US and around the world. And so to the extent that cedents believe they're creating margin they're obviously going to be seeking increased ceding commissions. We've seen a little bit of that activity. It's very modest at this point and I think for cedents who think about their reinsurers as long-term partners which really describes our core partners, the ones that we've grown with over the last couple of years -- I think they're very balanced about that. And so, while there is some upward pressure and you definitely see people seeking improved ceding commissions in the marketplace. It hasn't had a tremendous impact on our casualty business, we still see great opportunities to write new business, and to expand lines in that market and we expect that to continue.
Meyer Shields: Perfect, thank you so much.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Phil Stefano from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open, please ask your question.
Philip Stefano: Yes, thanks and good morning of focused more so on the insurance side of how I was hoping you could help give us an impression of what inning we're in the business mix change benefit to the attritional loss ratio. I mean part of the question is that there has been a reticence to recognize the benefit of rate over trend in terms of conditions and et cetera. And I'm wondering if the attritional improvement slow down at some point once the business mix changes played out. But the recognition of the rate versus trend in other industry trends has not come through yet.
Juan Andrade: Yes. Phil, this is Juan, and good morning. Also, let me start out -- please recall in, I think it was last quarter's earnings call where we talked about all the levers that we're using to improve the profitability and the margins in our insurance division, but also within reinsurance. Right. So it's not just really about mix, it's also about the granular detail of managing the portfolio of making tough decisions on what account you stay on, where do you want to grow and being very purposeful about shaping the portfolio and being able to grow it. If I look back at what we have been able to do in the insurance Division over the last 18 months, the numbers are pretty clear we have been able to lower the attritional combined ratio by about 6 points over that period of time. Since, really the end of 2019 and a lot of it has been these very presumptive actions on the lines of business that we choose to operate in, not operate in etc. The example workers' compensation that we talked about earlier to Mike's question I think is a perfect example of that, right. So that gives you a sense that while. Yes, we have been prudent in our loss picks because we view the environment as I said earlier, a temporary environment because of COVID with the frequency changes that we saw in that time, the reality is, there's a lot of work, beyond that and beyond mix that helps us to shape the portfolio going forward. But let me ask Mike Karm to give you a bit of additional yes, sure.
Mike Karmilowicz: Thanks, Juan. Yes. So I think the short answer is that we still think we're in early innings. We started a lot of these businesses, we've seen obviously some of that improvement. Come through, and again this is dependent on what's happening in the marketplace. So as you can see, to see opportunity, and we see the opportunity get scale and continue to expand our footprint, I think you'll see some of this continue to play through over time. But again, we feel we're making great progress, but we're still in early innings.
Juan Andrade: Phil, thank you. In the last comment I would make to that is, as I said in my prepared remarks, we are seeing rate very comfortably ahead of trend particularly in insurance. So when you think about the expected margin that's being built in addition to the actions that I described on the underwriting side, I think that gives you a sense of where this could be going.
Mike Karmilowicz: And I think why it's a well for the last thing I'd say is we continue to hold the line on the loss picks for good reason, because we recognize it over time so I think you're seeing us do the prudent thing and do this in a long-term view.
Philip Stefano: Thank you. I appreciate it. And so the second question, looking more on the capital management side of the house. And so the commentary, or at least some of the commentary has been around the fact that, look, we can grow organically very quickly, but that doesn't mean we can't repurchase shares concurrently with that growth. We've seen some other Bermuda plays the bit more active in the repurchase momentum just given where valuations are and maybe you can help us think through uses of capital, given where valuations are and maybe to put it more bluntly, why is now not a good time to really step on the gas with repurchases just given where the stock is trading?
Mike Karmilowicz: Well, Phil, I mean it's a constant question for us because, look, step one is always supporting the franchise expansion, we're in the best market in almost a generation here. So we are privileging that growth you're seeing very strong top line growth on both segments Reinsurance and Insurance. Having said that capital management. We've been active. We could certainly be more active. I don't see any hesitation on our side to do that. I think you will see that in the future and we can complete both sides of that equation grow strongly without any constraints and manage our capital even more efficiently.
Philip Stefano: All right. Well, looking forward to seeing it. Thank you.
Juan Andrade: Thanks, Phil.
Operator: There are no further question at this time, I will hand the call over to the management.
Juan Andrade: Great, thank you. Everest is a growing and leading global reinsurance and insurance company with a seasoned leadership team, broadly diversified earnings streams and a clear strategy to drive growth and expand margins while reducing volatility. Our goal is simple, drive superior shareholder returns. We have the platform, the financial strength, the talent, the focus and the commitment to succeed.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-04-30 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Everest Re Group Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Jon Levenson, Head of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead.
Jon Levenson: Good morning. And welcome to the Everest Re Group Limited 2021 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. The Everest Executives leading today’s call are Juan Andrade, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Kociancic, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We are also joined by other members of the Everest management team. Before we begin, I will preface the comments on today’s call by noting that Everest SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. Management comments regarding estimates, projections and similar are subject to the risks, uncertainties and assumptions as noted in these filings. Management may also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These items are reconciled in our earnings release and financial supplement. With that, I turn the call over to Juan Andrade.
Juan Andrade: Thank you, Jon. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. Everest is off to a strong start in 2021, with robust growth, strong overall profitability, continued improvement in attritional underwriting margins and excellent investment performance. We achieved these results, despite the meaningful impact to the industry of the U.S. winter storms in the first quarter. Our thoughts are with those affected by the storms, as well as the Australian floods and I am very proud of the work our claims team is doing on the ground to help people restore their lives. Our first quarter results demonstrate the earnings power of Everest and our success in implementing our strategy to build a broadly diversified company with a relentless focus on operational performance and disciplined underwriting. We are bullish about 2021. We will continue to profitably grow the Insurance segment, while continuing to grow and strengthen our position as a leading global P&C reinsurer. Our diversified Reinsurance and Insurance franchises, financial strength, deep distribution relationships and leading customer solutions enable us to thrive in today’s market. I will now discuss our Group, Reinsurance and Insurance first quarter 2021 results. Starting with the Group results, we grew gross written premiums by 14% and net written premiums by 16% with robust growth across both segments. Our growth stems from, one, the combination of new business opportunities, two, improved terms and conditions, three, increased rate levels, four, expanded shares on attractive renewals, and five, high overall renewal retention. The as-reported combined ratio was 98.1%, including the previously announced U.S. winter storms and the Australian flooding catastrophe losses. We generated $45 million in underwriting profit, compared to $29 million in the first quarter last year. While the pandemic is not over and as we have done in prior quarters, we completed a rigorous analysis of our COVID exposure in the first quarter, resulting in no change to our COVID loss provision. Our COVID loss provision remains at $511 million, of which approximately 80% is IBNR. The attritional combined ratio was 87.3%, a 2.5 point improvement over the first quarter of 2020 with both segments continuing to show significant year-over-year improvement in loss and expense ratios. We continue to diligently manage our portfolios to improve returns with a broad array of underwriting actions. This includes managing attachment points and limits, improving on terms and conditions and targeting non-renewals of business, which does not meet our hurdle rates, as well as many other actions. Underwriting profitability remains at the core of everything we do. Net investment income was excellent at $260 million, compared to $148 million in the prior year first quarter. These strong operating results led to a net income for the quarter of $342 million resulting in an annualized return on equity of 15%. For our Reinsurance Division, the first quarter continued our strong growth, with gross written premiums up 16%. We were pleased with our successful execution of our January 1 renewal plan. The targeted and disciplined growth was driven by higher rate, increased shares on profitable deals, along with new opportunities in property, casualty, specialty lines and facultative business. The attritional combined ratio was 85.5% for the quarter, a 2.3 point improvement year-over-year. This came from improvement in both the loss and expense ratio. We saw better economics in most treaties and parts of business around the world. We were disciplined and reduce shares or non-renewed underperforming treaties or those where we did not get our target rate, terms, conditions, wordings, or exclusions. We also deployed additional capacity into lines with more attractive risk adjusted returns. This dynamic capital allocation resulted in an improved attritional combined ratio. Overall, we continue to write a stronger, more diversified and more profitable book. With regard to the April 1 renewals, we achieved 10% to 15% rate increases on Japanese wind treaties and 5% rate increases in earthquake treaties. Rates in other geographies continue to rise in both property and casualty lines. John Doucette is available to provide additional details during the Q&A. Our Insurance Division continued its solid execution in the market, resulting in strong attritional underwriting performance and premium growth. Gross written premium grew 10%. If we exclude workers’ compensation where we see less attractive pricing, gross written premium grew 20%. This growth is driven by disciplined cycle management, new business opportunities, ongoing strong rate increases in our target classes of business and high retention rates on existing business. We are also seeing a slow but steady improvement in overall economic activity. The growth was well diversified in our target classes, where market conditions are prime for profitable growth, including specialty, casualty, professional liability and property short tail. We are happy with this diversification as it is a core tenet of our strategy. Everest Insurance delivered an improved attritional combined ratio of 92.2% for the first quarter, a 2.7 point improvement over Q1 2020. These results continue to be driven by proactive underwriting actions and a continued focus on expense management. These actions are resulting in the continued expansion of our Insurance margins. The attritional loss ratio of 64.3%, improved 1.4 points year-over-year and the total expense ratio improved 1.3 points year-over-year. Renewal rate increases continue to exceed our expectations for loss trend, up 16% in the quarter excluding workers’ compensation and up 10% including workers’ compensation. The increased rate we achieved and the expected increase in margin is a function of market conditions and disciplined proactive underwriting actions across our businesses. After years of soft pricing and rising loss costs, pricing adjustments remain necessary. We expect this favorable pricing to continue throughout 2021. Consistent with prior quarters, rate increases were led by excess casualty up 33%, D&O up 24%, property up 13% and commercial auto up 13%. We are also seeing widespread rate increases in other lines of business. We are managing the Insurance business to build a diversified portfolio, steering our mixed or product lines with better rate adequacy and higher long-term margins. We also continue to manage average limits deployed to control volatility. We are happy with the progress we have made and we expect that the strategic direction should possibly impact our results going forward. Conversely, we have been thoughtfully managing workers’ compensation through the cycle. This portfolio now represents 14% of our first quarter premiums, down from 21% the year ago. We have pared back for writings in the monoline guaranteed cost base and shift in our portfolio to more loss sensitive, loss ratable business. Workers’ compensation is an area of expertise at Everest and we are monitoring market conditions closely for potential opportunities, but these efforts illustrate the disciplined cycle management we have implemented in the company. Lastly, our strong position in both the E&S and retail channels continue to give us access to a wide set of opportunities. Mike Karmilowicz is available to provide additional details during the Q&A. Everest had a strong start to 2021, with robust growth, strong overall profitability, continued improvement in attritional underwriting margins and excellent investment performance. We have vibrant and well-diversified Reinsurance and Insurance businesses with experienced leadership and underwriting teams providing industry-leading solutions to customers. We have sustained momentum. This company has excellent financial strength, top talent, and a prudent capital management philosophy. We are focused on sustained profitable growth, a more diversified targeted and deliberate mix of business and superior risk-adjusted returns. We believe that the relentless and disciplined execution of our strategies will result in maximizing shareholder returns. I am confident in Everest’s future and in our ability to deliver and our commitments to customers and shareholders. Now, let me turn the call over to Mark Kociancic for additional details on the financials. Mark?
Mark Kociancic: Thank you, Juan, and good morning, everyone. Everest had very attractive results for the first quarter of 2021, with strong overall profitability, continued improving underlying margins, robust growth and an excellent investment results. I will touch on these points over the next few minutes. For the first quarter of 2021, Everest reported a net income of $342 million, resulting in an annualized return on equity of 15%. We also reported operating income of $260 million for Q1 and operating earnings per share of $6.49. Starting with underwriting income, Everest had positive contributions from both Reinsurance and Insurance with $45.2 million of underwriting income. This reflects the improved underlying attritional loss and expense ratios, offset by the impact of catastrophe losses. The catastrophe losses of $260 million of pretax and net of Reinsurance and reinstatement premiums, with $213 million in the Reinsurance segment and $47 million in the Insurance segment. Vast majority of $250 million is coming from the U.S. winter storms with the balance from the floods in New South Wales, Australia. Also worth noting is that we have not added to our COVID-19 loss provision, which remains at $511 million, with approximately 80% of our pandemic loss estimate remaining as IBNR. First quarter results continue to reflect the impact of our underwriting and portfolio management initiatives. Our underlying attritional loss and combined ratios are strong and continue to improve, excluding the catastrophe losses, reinstatement premiums, prior year development and COVID 19 pandemic impact, the attritional loss ratio was 60.7% in Q1, compared to 61.4% in the first quarter of 2020. The attritional combined ratio was 87.3% for the first quarter of 2021, compared to 89.8% for the first quarter last year, representing a 2.5 percentage point improvement. For Insurance, the attritional loss ratio improved from 65.7% in the first quarter of 2020 to 64.3% this quarter. And the attritional combined ratio for Insurance improved to 92.2%, compared to 94.9% in the first quarter of 2020. Our U.S. Insurance business, which makes up the majority of our overall Insurance business, continues to run very well, with an attritional combined ratio in the high 80s. For Reinsurance, the first quarter 2021 attritional loss ratio was 59.5%, down from 59.8% a year ago. The attritional combined ratio on the same basis was 85.5%, down from 87.8%. The Group commission ratio of 20.5% for the first quarter of 2021, was down a 150 basis points from 22% reported last year in Q1, largely due to changes in the composition of our business mix plus higher ceding commissions received in the Insurance segment. The Group expense ratio remains low at 5.9% for the first quarter of 2021 versus 6.3% a year ago. The expense ratio continues to benefit from our continued focus on expense management, cost economies of scale as our premium base continues to grow. First quarter investment income had an excellent result of $260 million, as compared to a $148 million for the first quarter 2020. Alternative investments recorded a quarterly record $120 million of income in the first quarter, largely due to increases in the net asset values from our portfolio of diversified private equity investments, reflecting the strong economy and financial markets. As a reminder, we report our limited partnership income one quarter in arrears. Invested assets grew approximately 2% to $25.9 billion during the quarter, up from $25.5 billion at year end 2020. Approximately 80% of our invested assets are comprised of a well-diversified, high credit quality bond portfolio with a duration of 3.5 years. The remaining investments are allocated to equities and other invested assets, which include private equity investments, cash and short-term investments. Our effective tax rate on operating income for the first quarter of 2021 was 7.9% and 8.4% on net income. This was favorable versus our planned effective tax rate of approximately 12%, largely due to the geographic distribution of the catastrophe losses occurring within the United States. For the first quarter of 2021, Everest generated strong operating cash flows of $904 million, compared to $506 million for the first quarter of 2020, reflecting the strength of our premium growth year-over-year. Our balance sheet remains strong with a capital structure that allows for the efficient deployment of capital and ample capacity to execute on market opportunities. Shareholders’ equity was $9.7 billion at the end of the first quarter and broadly flat versus the $9.7 billion at year end 2020. Our debt leverage ratio stands at 16.5% and book value per share stood at $241.57 at quarter end. I close in noting that Everest repurchased approximately $24 million of common shares during the first quarter. And with that, I will now turn it back to Jon.
Jon Levenson: Thanks, Mark. Operator, we are now ready to open the line for questions. We do ask that you please limit your questions to two or one question plus one follow-up and then rejoin the queue if you have any remaining questions.
Operator: Great. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question here comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. My first question, if we went back to last year, you guys within your Insurance book we are getting 24% of price that was excluding comps, 12% with workers comp and if we were to assume a 5% loss trend that would have resulted in about 4 points of accident year underlying loss ratio improvement this quarter and when we look at the Insurance book in back of COVID you produced just under 1.5 points. So is it a -- is a good rule of thumb that you will apply less than a half of the improvement brought at the bottomline and the other half you would use to build some reserves conservatism?
Juan Andrade: Yeah. Thanks, Elyse. And this is Juan and good morning also. I think there’s a couple of things to keep in mind. Number one is, we had strong results across the Board. As I said in my prepared remarks, it’s a 2.5 point improvement in the combined ratio year-over-year. When you look specifically at the Insurance Division, that’s a 2.7 improvement that you are seeing there as well. But frankly is led by the loss ratio with 1.4 improvements in the attritional loss ratio. Now the mechanics of that improvement, I think, it’s along the lines of what we discussed in prior quarters. So, certainly, we are seeing very good rate. We saw as I mentioned 16% rate increases in the Insurance book in the first quarter and that continues to do quite well. As a matter of fact to put it in perspective that 16% is 2 times the rate that we achieved in all of 2019. So rate is part of that. But the bigger part of all of this is really the myriad of actions that we are taking on the underwriting side. As I mentioned previously, to continue to position our book of business both on the Insurance side and the Reinsurance side to have sustained profitability over the long term. And it’s important to keep in mind, one thing, right, we are deliberately shifting the portfolios toward segments that have better overall economics. In addition to all the underwriting actions that we are taking and that I have mentioned in the past and in my script to continue to improve sustained profitability. Now when it comes to loss picks, I think, it’s also important to keep in mind that we continue to hold the line on loss picks. We have clear indications that underlying profitability is continuing to improve, some of that you saw in this quarter’s results and some of that will need to be proven over time as the accident years continue to mature. So I think that’s probably the best guidance that I can give you on that. And with that, let me ask also one of my colleagues Jim Williamson to jump into this question as well.
Jim Williamson: Yeah. Good morning, Elyse. The only thing I would add and I think it’s important both in Insurance and Reinsurance, and I suspect it’s on the minds of everyone on the call today is, just this question of the loss trend and we talked about rate achievement exceeding the loss trend. But we have also talked over the last few years about the fact that the trend line has been accelerating in terms of whether it’s social inflation, inflation in building cost in terms of repair after natural disasters and things of that nature. And so that does two things, one, it will certainly consume a little bit more of the rate increases and we want to be prudent about that, that’s I would say a smaller effect. The larger effect though is the degree that, that places uncertainty around what the ultimate trend line will turn out to be, which is why we are going to take a very conservative position around making sure that we have proven out our trend selections over time, which would ultimately allow us to be looking on these accident years more favorably, but it’s going to take time for that to fully mature.
Elyse Greenspan: That’s helpful. And then my second question on the other part of your margin is on the expense ratio. If I am looking at your consolidated expense ratio was around 26.4 I think in the quarter? And so in line with the levels that you guys saw in the second half of last year, but well below where you were pre-COVID. I am just trying to get a sense of what kind of -- and obviously there is the commission and brokerage ratio and also the other underwriting expenses, but just trying to get a sense of where the expense ratio should level out once we are kind of through with COVID and what kind of a run rate level there?
Juan Andrade: Sure. Thanks, Elyse. I think it’s important. I think as you were describing just now to decompose the parts of the expense ratio. I think if we look at the operating expense ratio that 5.9. I think that 5.96, et cetera, it’s going to be pretty consistent for us. One of the things that you know about Everest and our company, it’s our disciplined expense management, whether it’s COVID or no COVID. The reality is we are pretty focused on being efficient. So I would expect that the operating expense ratio would be relatively consistent with those numbers that you have been seeing. The commission ratio is going to fluctuate based on the type of business that we are writing in any given quarter, right? And so, for instance, if you are writing on the primary Insurance business, lines that are growing faster but you are getting better seeds because of our Reinsurance structure that obviously will have an impact. On the Reinsurance side, obviously, the business mix that we write at the 1.1 renewals will also have an impact on that. But let me ask Mark Kociancic to weigh on that as well.
Mark Kociancic: Yeah. I would echo that, Elyse. I think that expense run rate is going to be hovering around that 6 points. You might see some quarterly volatility. But in general, that’s roughly the area I would expect it to go. There could be awaiting differential depending on the growth rate of Insurance, which comes with a higher general expense operating rate versus the Reinsurance Division. And then the other piece that I would just highlight is we are having a fairly strong net earned premium growth as we develop both franchises even more. So, these are things we are all keeping an eye on. So we wouldn’t get caught up in quarterly volatility, but that run rate of 6 is a pretty good bogey.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. Thanks for the color.
Juan Andrade: Thank you, Elyse.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Phil Stefano from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Phil Stefano: Yeah. Thanks and good morning. We have been spending a lot of time with the first quarter earnings call, talking about the concept of rate adequacy. And I was hoping you could give us your thoughts on just the proportion of business that feels rate adequate or the extent to which we are rate -- we are reaching rate adequacy and pricing momentum may start to decelerate, and of course, the offset to that could be exposure growth as the global economy starts to recover in the back half of the year and overall what this could mean for potential topline growth? I mean it’s more of an Insurance question than Reinsurance question, but appreciate whatever color you have.
Juan Andrade: Great. Phil, thank you for that. Let me start with the topline growth question and then we will come back to the margin expansion point that you had. As I mentioned in my commentary and the script, one of the things that we are starting to see is a slow and steady return of exposure growth. It is starting to get near pre-pandemic levels. And I think that’s something that, as well as the economic recovery is consistent, you are going to continue to see probably for the back half of the year. So I think that obviously bodes well for the Insurance industry as we are creatures of an economy and as there is more to ensure if more opportunity for growth. So I think again in the back half of the year, if exposure growth continues, you are going to see improvement in that. With regard to rate adequacy, et cetera, we have been seeing rate exceeding our expectations for loss cost trend now for a number of quarters, and obviously, it’s going to vary by line of business. But you are starting to see where the majority of your lines of business are rate adequate at this point in time. Now that being said, it’s important also keep in mind the starting, particularly for some of the longer tail lines, such as general liability, excess and maybe some of the D&O lines, where they may be needed more rates as an industry over time and we are starting to catch up and we are starting to get there. Now what you see in our numbers, frankly, is that, we have that steady improvement of underlying profitability continue to improve. As I have just mentioned to Elyse a few minutes ago, we are holding the line on our loss picks. We expect that over time we will be bringing that to the bottomline. But all of that bodes very well for expected margin growth over time. But let me also ask Jim Williamson to weigh in on this question.
Jim Williamson: Yeah. Phil, the only thing I would add. I think, Juan covered it really well, is just the idea that when you -- we are very disciplined underwriters. And so when you see us moving our topline the way that we have in the last several quarters, I think that’s a very clear indication to you that we feel great about the trades we are making, both in Insurance and Reinsurance. I mean, we would not be putting up that type of growth if we didn’t feel very good about adequacy levels and that’s probably the best indication that we can give you.
Phil Stefano: Okay. No. I appreciate that. Right. So my follow-up is going to be dialing in on the workers’ comp line. So we have now got four consecutive quarters of material declines. How should we think about the impact of remixing the book of business versus exposure versus price? And what has caused this line to come down and how should we think about this line in particularly as we move forward? Is it economically sensitive or is price just not have it at a rate adequate point where you feel comfortable turning the valve on and growing that business?
Juan Andrade: Yeah. Great. Thanks, Phil. Let me start and then I will ask Mike Karmilowicz to jump in on this call. Look, the first thing I would say is, we like workers’ compensation and we are experts at it at Everest. But we are also disciplined underwriters. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we see better pricing opportunities in other lines of business right now, property, D&O, specialty casualty. Those kinds of things. As I also mentioned, we are still writing comp. We are just changing the type of comp that we are writing going forward. Where we see less attractive pricing right now is in the monoline workers’ compensation space. So as a result of that, we have really shifted more toward loss rateable, loss sensitive business at that point. But as I also mentioned in my remarks, we are very much looking for the opportunities as the economy begins to heal and as things begin to improve. We will see an improvement in exposures also in the workers’ compensation line for us and when we see the opportunity and the pricing improving, firms improving, exposures beginning to grow, you will see us start to deploy more capital into workers’ compensation as well. But, look, this is how we are managing this company proactively, presumptively to focus on lines with better rate adequacy, with better opportunities for growth and with better margin. But, again, we like comp, we are just taking a pause on it right now from the perspective of monoline until we see conditions begin to improve. But with that, let me ask Mike Karm to jump in.
Mike Karmilowicz: Sure. Thanks. Thanks for the question. Yeah. I think only to follow-up, I think, that was well said is, we have been obviously managing overall exposure down as exposure growth is also shrunk as well. But the reality is we are starting to see that bottom out and to the point that was made by, Juan, as we start to see that opportunity, particularly pick up. I think we will cease that opportunity. We have been basically focused in the composition of the portfolio, really around low and moderate type hazard risk And so we feel very good about where we are and we are starting to see signs particularly outside of California where rate is starting to go up and nudge up and in California, we are seeing it starting to bottom out. But we are optimistic that, that toward the end of the year should start to change in California and that when the opportunity presents itself, you will see us certainly continue to gain some market share.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Phillips from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Mike Phillips: Good morning and thanks for the time guys. Kind of a follow-up to an earlier question, I think, one of the first questions on Insurance margins and just kind of want get a little more clarity on it. Juan, you mentioned, the year-over-year increase -- the year-over-year improvement in interest on loss ratio to 64.3% and you talked about how the loss trends are making things a little more cautious on your part. I guess is that way for the first time in over a year we saw an increase in the loss pick from -- sequentially from the prior quarter. It’s been coming down over quarter over quarter over quarter and this quarter it went up from 4Q. Is that simply yet because of your concerns on loss trends or is there anything else going on that would make your increases from 4Q?
Juan Andrade: Yeah. Thanks, Mike. Thanks for the question. I would start with saying, look, the appropriate comparison is more of a year-over-year comparison than the sequential comparison and that’s going to be driven more by mix of business than anything else. So I think that’s an important point. The second point that I would make is, look, we feel pretty good about the business that we are writing today, about the rate adequacy on that business and about the margin that we are building. My comments about holding the line on loss picks are really pretty straightforward. It’s the fact and I have been pretty consistent in this messaging over the last number of quarters. In this business you got to wait for things to season out over time and so in the meantime, it’s not just about rate, it’s about all those actions that we are taking on the underwriting side, portfolio management, limit management, attachment points, et cetera, to continue to improve the profitability in the quality of your book and that is what you are seeing. Those are the numbers that are being reflected not only in this quarter but in the last several quarters as well. And so going forward, we do believe we are building expected margin in those lines. And as we start getting more certainty on the fact that rate has indeed exceeded our trend expectations that margin will start coming through the bottom line basically.
Mike Phillips: Okay. Thanks, Juan. Switching it then to capital, I guess, as last quarter, you hadn’t deployed the $1 billion of debt and you mentioned here today that you have put some new deployment in the current -- new capital in the Reinsurance, I might have missed if you said anything on Reinsurance. But can you just tell us where you are with that $1 billion that you did back in October and where that stands today and how do you see that kind of being deployed this year, maybe more in gross or coming back a bit to anything else that you might do with that? Thanks.
Mark Kociancic: Yeah. It’s -- Mike, it’s Mark speaking. So first of all, the -- we still have ample room to deploy the capital. It’s not fully deployed. But there is no constraints in terms of our growth expectations this year our ambitions on both the underwriting side and on the investment side. So I’d say, we are just looking for the best opportunities in the execution of our plan and capital is not a constraint either in the execution of the business or on the capital management side in terms of buybacks or dividends.
Juan Andrade: Yeah. Mike and what I would build on Mark’s answer is, remember what we said back in October when we did the debt raise, it was purely opportunistic, right? We have plenty of capital to be able to deploy. And so, as Mark said, and I will affirm that, we are seeing great opportunities in this market. You are seeing the continued momentum on the topline in both Reinsurance and Insurance, and we feel pretty good about the capital backing all of that.
Mike Phillips: Okay. Thank you, Juan. I appreciate it.
Juan Andrade: Thanks, Mike.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Yaron Kinar: Good morning. My first question, I hope that you will be willing or able to answer it. I am going to give it a shot. I am looking at the slowdown in rate improvement 500 basis points quarter-over-quarter in Insurance. I am looking across some of your competitors, it sounds like there is a pretty wide range there of the rate of slowdown. And I am just trying to understand what would drive one company’s slowdown to be greater than anothers? Is it a business mix, are you accounting for rate in a different way? Any help there that you can offer in looking at those -- this wide variance of trends would be helpful?
Juan Andrade: Yeah. Yaron, happy to give you a perspective and then I will invite Jim Williamson to jump in as well. Look, starting with Everest, and as I mentioned to Elyse earlier in the call, 16% is very good. It continued significant momentum on the rate side of things. Business mix certainly will influence that, the type of business that you write in a particular quarter. For instance, in this case, if it’s more heavily weighted toward a property a short line type exposure, that carries a certain rate, that’s certainly going to impact the mix. Now, if I elevate the answer to your question and basically then talk more about the industry and look across companies, I think, again, business mix plays a part of that. I think execution place part of that, right? I think one of the most important things about our primary Insurance business and I talk about it often, I am very proud of them is how well they execute in the market. So I would say business mix is part of that, execution is part of that, portfolio management and how you look at risk is certainly part of that, and ultimately, risk selection which is a component of that. I think those are all the things that essentially go into play. But look, speaking from our perspective about Everest, we expect continued momentum and strong renewal rate growth throughout 2021.
Jim Williamson: Yeah. Not a lot to add, Yaron. Other than to say, when you start looking across companies, just to give you a sense of how we think about it within our own portfolio. I mean, obviously, we are well aware of the topline number for our Insurance Division, for example. But we really do look at it a much more granular level because of all the reasons that Juan sighted. And at the end of the day, we have got underwriters they have -- they are approaching the market in a very disciplined fashion. But they are selecting one deal at a time. They are focused on making sure they underwrite the deal appropriately that they attach the right terms and conditions to drive the total margin outcome and so it’s really only a debt level that the numbers are truly meaningful. So I would just be -- I’d just be careful about reading too much into the fact that there is variation across firms.
Yaron Kinar: Yeah. That’s fair. I appreciate the thoughts there. And then if I -- for my second question, if I could shift to a Reinsurance segment, helpful color around April renewals, just curious, as we are starting to look at 6.1 renewals and the turmoil in Florida. How do you see the potential for growth there, I mean, we are hearing that there is a lot of need for rate on the one hand, much more involved in citizens and cat bonds on the other hand. So what opportunity exists there as far as you can tell today?
Juan Andrade: No. That’s great. And I will invite John Doucette to jump into this question, please.
John Doucette: Yeah. Good morning, Yaron. Thank you for the call. So we are -- as you said, we had a good April 1, renewals. We are looking at not only June 1, but July 1, where we kind of finish out the treaty year. So our expectation is, we will be deploying about the same amount of capacity. And we will be focused on pushing rates, terms, conditions, because there are a lot of moving parts, social inflation, the climate change, the assignment of benefits issue. So our view is our book will probably be similar to last year and we will look to improve the economics.
Yaron Kinar: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker from BofA. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Josh Shanker: Yeah. Good morning, everybody. I will stick with Reinsurance. So the -- and then sort of a question getting up the loss ratio underlying didn’t improve all that much year-over-year, but of course, the expense ratio did. And I look at the business mix a lot of non-catastrophe, XOL business written, I think there’s a lot of business mix. Of course on Reinsurance, there is very different acquisition cost, different types of businesses. Can you talk a little bit educate us on cat versus non-cat property versus casualty on how the acquisition cost differ between XOL and pro rata, that kind of explains what’s going on I guess in the combined ratio which improved very well during the quarter?
Juan Andrade: Great. Thanks, Josh. And I will ask John Doucette to please answer this.
John Doucette: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Josh. So, yes, you are right, it is a business mix issue, a combination of -- and we do have different commissions and expenses, whether it’s an excess of loss or pro rata. But it’s more nuance from that. Really it -- there are deals that have very low commission structures, certain lines of business that the commissions even though they are on a pro rata basis. The commissions given it’s a function of the loss ratio is a lot lower and closer to an excess of loss business. So it really has to do with the mix and it also has to do with, we did see some improvement in ceding commissions on proportional deals, particularly on the property side where we need -- where the ceding commission is a function, is effectively rate change and so some of the proportional deals that needed some improved economics from a Reinsurance point of view. We did see some downward pressure on the ceding commissions that then flowed into the numbers you are seeing today.
Josh Shanker: So if I want to extrapolate the first quarter result into the full year, you write the most amount of premium Reinsurance in the first quarter. Are the changes we are seeing year-over-year in the first quarter indicative of how the loss ratio and expense ratio might play out as we move across 2021?
John Doucette: So I think the best estimate of where the loss and expense ratio would be this quarter, yes.
Josh Shanker: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields from KBW. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Meyer Shields: I know you touched on this, but when I look at the non-acquisition expenses in Reinsurance. So we saw a pretty big jump on a year-over-year basis and I was wondering is that tied to mix also or are there other factors driving that?
Juan Andrade: Meyer, just to make sure I understand your question correctly, are you looking at the non-acquisition expenses so are you focused on the 2.9?
Meyer Shields: Yeah. The ratio was flat, but the dollars were up a lot.
Juan Andrade: Yeah. So I think there’s a couple of things play here. Number one, I think, as Mark mentioned, we certainly are seeing a benefit from earned premium growth coming through as a result of the business that we have been writing, and frankly, the success that we had last year in growing the franchise. If you recall, we grew that franchise by about 15%. So you are seeing the benefit of that coming through. Specifically to the dollars being up in the quarter on the Reinsurance segment, I think, a lot of that is frankly noise, as Mark said earlier. There’s always going to be a bit of volatility in the expense ratio from quarter-to-quarter, so I wouldn’t read too much into that. But as both Mark and I said earlier, when you think about the operating expense ratio, trajectory, you know that 2.9, 3 is probably a good number for Reinsurance. Mark, I don’t know, if you would like to add anything?
Mark Kociancic: Yeah. I will just build off that a little bit because I think Juan captured it. I think for this quarter you are seeing a slight elevation just in terms of the volatility. I know there was very strong earned premium growth in Reinsurance, so perhaps it could have been less than 2.9. But there is nothing fundamental in there, you will still see this -- we should be coming in less than 3 for the year.
Meyer Shields: Okay. That’s very helpful. And then a big picture question, I can’t remotely disagree with the rationality of rate increases slowing down as more business achieves adequacy. But the history of this industry is that second derivative continues and eventually becomes disruptive, this is non-Everest question, but as a reinsurer you talk to a lot of companies and Everest has been focused on relationships. Is there any reason to be more optimistic about the post-hard market phase of the cycle whenever that emerges?
Juan Andrade: Yeah. That’s a great question. I think you are getting into psychology now, Meyer, not the Insurance, Reinsurance economics. But, look, I think from my perspective, there is a number of things that might be slightly different, right? If you look at the underlying conditions that drove the need for rate, right? So a number of years of soft pricing, inadequate pricing, inadequate rates, et cetera, that finally began to turn as you had the impact of the catastrophes in 2017,2018,2019, as you had the impact of social inflation coming through. Now you have the impact of the COVID pandemic and the correlated impact on both the asset and the liability sides of the business. So all of these things are at play, right? And I think, what you found is that, people have achieved some level of discipline and you are hearing it from us certainly, you have certainly heard it from our peers, particularly on the Reinsurance side that they have all approached to 1-1 renewals with a level of discipline. Frankly from some of our competitors that maybe we haven’t seen that level of discipline in the past. So I am an optimist and I think that some of that will continue as we go forward. There’s also been capital that’s coming in into the market, into the industry. But that capital has only been impacting on the margins and nibbling on the edges, so it has not been a significant amount of capital. So look, I think you still have some of the underlying factors to drove the need for rate. Rates are getting more adequate, as I mentioned earlier. But again, there’s still environmental issues that we all need to keep an eye on, particularly the more disciplined companies like Everest I think will be very focused on that going forward.
Meyer Shields: Okay. That’s very helpful. Thank you so much.
Juan Andrade: Thanks, Meyer.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Brian Meredith: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. I guess the first question I am just curious in the Insurance segment, the acquisition expense ratio, you talked about better kind of ceding commissions benefiting the acquisition expense ratio. Is that a kind of a function of kind of changes in your Reinsurance buying philosophy and should we continue to see that lower kind of acquisition cost benefit ratio going forward?
Juan Andrade: Yeah. So let me start and then I will ask Mike Karmilowicz to jump in. I think a big driver of that, Brian, was really the business that we wrote in the quarter and how that business then fits into the Reinsurance structure that we have in place. So I think that’s part of that. I think the other part of that is that our reinsurers for the primary business are seeing and have seen the quality of the portfolio and the quality of the book that we have put together and so because of that, we are able to get slightly higher seed commissions on that business. But let me turn it over to Mike and he can add some additional color and context.
Mike Karmilowicz: Sure. Thanks, Brian. Yeah. So I think definitely business mix to Juan’s point, it’s certainly a factor in that as you saw like excess cash in some areas we have had significant growth that we are getting a little bit of the benefit of that. Also there’s a little bit of us shifting to some of the more open market from programs, that growth in that business mix again will play into that. And then finally, what I’d say, you probably see us as we continue to gain scale, be less dependent, we tend to be very conservative and basically buying Reinsurance, and so I think you will see that net to gross number change as well as we continue to kind of evolve. But in general, I think, that the business mix is mainly a bit much driver for the quarter.
Brian Meredith: Great. Thanks. And the second question I have I know it’s really early in the process here, but just wanted to ask a quick question about taxes here and the discussion about corporate income tax rates going up and particularly the GILTI tax. Does the GILTI tax have a big asset for you guys and how should we kind of think about that in the event that we do get some big changes in the GILTI tax?
Mark Kociancic: It’s premature to say how that’s going to play out for us. Right now I don’t think it’s what we see on the table from the administration or at least public dialog is not good for the in general. But I don’t think it will have a material impact on us in terms of the way we are organized. So I would expect it to be marginal if something like that is implemented in the fall.
Brian Meredith: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And I am not showing any further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to management for closing comments.
Juan Andrade: Great. Thank you. Everest is well-positioned for this market and for the opportunities we have seen and improving economy. Despite the material, social and economic impact of the COVID pandemic, we continue to grow unimpeded, recruiting top talent and delivering value to our stakeholders. We have leading financial strength, a preferred market presence and a diversified global platform. We are nimble. We have deep distribution relationships, great people and a great culture. I am very excited by the opportunity ahead of us and I believe we are well-positioned to excel. Thank you for your time with us this quarter and for your continued support in the company. We will talk to you after the second quarter. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And this concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-02-09 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Everest Re Group Earnings Conference Call. This call is being webcast and will also be available for replay on the Everest website later today. I’d now like to turn the call over to Jon Levenson, Head of Investor Relations.
Jon Levenson: Good morning and welcome to the Everest Re Group, Ltd 2020 Fourth Quarter and Year End Earnings Conference Call. The Everest executives leading today’s call are: Juan Andrade, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Kociancic, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We are also joined by other members of the Everest management team. Before we begin, I will preface the comments on today’s call by noting that Everest SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. Management comments regarding estimates, projections and similar are subject to the risks, uncertainties and assumptions as noted in these filings. Management may also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These items are reconciled in our earnings release and financial supplement. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Juan Andrade.
Juan Andrade: Thank you, Juan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. 2020 had its share of global challenges that COVID-19 leads any discussion of the year. The pandemic affected all our communities, our way of life, and resulted in an unimaginable death toll. It affected all aspects of the world’s economies, including the insurance and re-insurance industry. Despite unprecedented challenges and through the resilience and dedication of our team, Everest delivered solid 2020 results with excellent growth and improved underlying profitability. Key steps we took last year include adding to our deep and talented management team, strengthening our balance sheet, enhancing our enterprise risk management and operational discipline, and further diversifying our business. Most importantly, we have been a valued partner to our distributors and customers during a very perilous time. With a strong foundation in place, we remain confident in continued operational and financial success across our business. We are bullish about 2021. We will continue to profitably grow the Insurance segment while continuing to grow and strengthen our position as a global and leading P&C reinsurer. As we think about our positioning in the market, amongst our clients, partners and investors, we are guided by the following principles, by which Everest will seize opportunities and increase the value of our company. First, we will deliver superior growth in book value per share over the cycle. Second, we are an underwriting company. One of our core competencies is the identification, underwriting, pricing and management of risk. Diversification by line of business and geography is critical. We have clearly defined and quantified risk appetite, and we maintain strong enterprise risk management and performance monitoring. Third, investment returns are a critical value driver and investment management is also a core competency. We are further optimizing our invested assets via portfolio management strategy that is complementary to our underwriting risk. With a sizable invested asset base and significant cash flow, we seek to add value and diversify the sources of income to the company. Fourth, we manage our capital to fuel long-term profitable growth while continuing to expand our third-party capital capabilities. And fifth, we will maintain our industry-leading financial strength. We complement our core strengths with a low-cost expense space in a flat entrepreneurial and responsible organization. Our diversified reinsurance and insurance franchise, financial strength, deep distribution relationships, and leading customer solutions enable our continued performance in today’s market. We have robust momentum coming into 2021, and we are well positioned to continue diversifying our business for sustained profitable growth. I will now discuss our group reinsurance and insurance results starting with the fourth quarter followed by our full year 2020 and how these results position us well for 2021. Starting with group results. In the fourth quarter, we grew gross written premiums by 13% and net written premiums by 16% with strong growth across both segments. Our growth stems from a combination of new business opportunities, improved terms and conditions and rate levels, expanded shares on attractive renewals and high retention rates on our existing book. Our underlying combined ratio was 86.3%, a four point improvement over the fourth quarter of 2019 with both segments showing significant improvement in loss and expense ratios. Net investment income was very strong at $222 million compared to $146 million in the prior year quarter. For 2020, Everest grew gross written premiums 15% and net written premiums 17% year-over-year. We delivered $514 million in net income and $300 million in operating income, despite the COVID-19 loss provision, the prior year reserve strengthening and an active cat year. Our dividend adjusted book value per share grew over 11%. We are focused on delivering superior growth in book value per share over the market cycle. The underlying combined ratio improved almost a point to 87.5% year-over-year with our Insurance segment, improving 2.3 points to 94.2%. Net investment income was in line with prior year despite the market volatility. These results demonstrate the earnings power of Everest in our ability to thrive in any market. We continue to diligently manage our portfolios to improve returns with a broad array of underwriting actions, including managing attachment points, limits, terms and conditions, targeted non-renewals and many other actions. This is the hard work of building and sustaining a profitable book. Underwriting profitability remains at the core of everything that we do. As previously announced, in the fourth quarter, we strengthened prior accident year reserves in our Reinsurance segment by $400 million. The reserve strengthening does not change our view of current accident year loss picks as we had already selected more conservative loss picks in response to general loss trends. We are confident in the prior year reserving actions we took in the quarter and the quality of the enforced portfolio. These decisive actions will serve as well. In the fourth quarter, we also added $76 million primarily for third-party lines to our COVID-19 loss provision. Despite a high frequency of storms in the fourth quarter, our manageable catastrophe losses of $70 million resulted from disciplined underwriting and the purposeful reduction of volatility over the last two years in our reinsurance portfolio. Mark Kociancic and Jim Williamson are on this call and can provide more detail on these actions during Q&A. For our reinsurance division, the fourth quarter continued our strong growth. Gross written premiums grew 12% in the quarter and 15% in 2020. The attritional combined ratio X COVID was 83.9%, an improvement from 87.4% in the prior fourth quarter. January 1 is our largest renewal date and this one was one of the strongest in many years. The rate environment improved across most territories in lines of business with loss impacted business seeing material increases. Capacity is abundant, but reinsurers remained disciplined on pricing and terms and conditions. There is a flight to quality wherever strong balance sheet in highly rated financial strength set us apart. Customer and broker demand for Everest capacity is strong, as highlighted by our increased shares and preferential signings on treaties, counterparties actively want to do more business with Everest. Our responsiveness, ability to deploy significant capital, and reputation as problem solvers in the market, were critical to a successful renewal season. We saw outstanding results in Latin America, in the U.S. and Canada, as well as meaningful growth in Continental Europe. We had notable wins on large deals and increased our share with core customers and in territories and classes; we found the most attractive including facultative business. We continued to expand and diversify the portfolio as we execute to achieve a stronger, more diversified and more profitable book. Specific to our January 1 property book, total limit outstanding increased with an increase in rate online and significant improvements in the combined ratio, ROE, risk adjusted return and increased dollars of expected margin. We have a stronger and more profitable portfolio. John Doucette is available to provide additional details during the Q&A. Our insurance division continued its solid execution, as evidenced by our results in both the fourth quarter and the full year of 2020. Gross written premiums grew 15% or 18% excluding terminated programs, with gross written premium of $872 million in the quarter and over $3.2 billion for 2020. Both fourth quarter and full year 2020 revenues are milestones for the insurance division. This growth is driven by discipline cycle management, strong rate in target classes and improving activity in certain lines of business, such as transactional liability, that was partially offset by reductions in economically impacted areas such as energy, sports, leisure, and entertainment. Everest Insurance delivered an improved attritional combined ratio of 93.8% for the fourth quarter, a 4.3 point improvement over the fourth quarter of 2019 and 94.2% for the full year 2020, a 2.3 point improvement over 2019. These results are driven by portfolio and expense management and are consistent with expanding insurance margins. We achieved record renewal rate increases of 21% in the fourth quarter, excluding workers’ compensation and up 14% including workers’ compensation, where we are seeing rates flat. Rate is outpacing our expected loss trend and renewal retention across the entire portfolio is strong. The rate we achieved as a function of market conditions and disciplined proactive underwriting actions across our businesses. After years of soft pricing and rising loss costs, pricing adjustments are necessary and we expect they will continue throughout 2021. Consistent with prior quarters, these increases are led by property, up 21%; excess casualty, up 50%; D&O, up 35% and commercial auto, up 17%. We are also seeing widespread increases in other lines of business, which has been slower to turn most notably general liability, now up 9%. we are managing the insurance portfolio to build a diversified business and steer our mix toward product lines that earn higher long-term margins. Our position in both the E&S and retail channels give us access to a wide set of opportunities. Mike Karmilowicz is available to provide additional details during the Q&A. We have a vibrant and well-diversified reinsurance and insurance business with experienced teams, providing industry-leading solutions to our customers. building on the achievements of 2020, we will continue diversifying our business for profitable growth and sustain momentum throughout 2021. The company is on solid ground with excellent financial strength ratings, top talent, and a prudent capital management philosophy. We are focused on sustained profitable growth, a more diversified mix of business and superior risk adjusted returns. The relentless execution of our strategies results in maximizing shareholder returns. I am confident that Everest future and on our ability to deliver the commitments to our customers, shareholders and the marketplace. 2020 showed us all just how resilient we truly are. Now, let me turn the call over to Mark Kociancic for additional details on the financials. Mark?
Mark Kociancic: Thank you, Juan, and good morning, everyone. As Juan discussed in our pre-release outline, Everest had strong underlying results for the quarter and the year with positive net income in Q4 improving underlying margin, continued growth and an excellent capital position. I’ll touch on these over the next few minutes. The positive quarterly net income result was achieved despite a prior year reserve strengthening charge of $400 million, a COVID provision of $76 million and catastrophe losses of $70 million. This clearly demonstrates the diversification and earnings power of Everest. Everest reported net income of $64 million for the quarter and $514 million for the year, resulting in a return on equity of 5.8% for 2020. we had a $44 million operating loss for Q4 given the charges and generated an operating income of $300 million for the year. Our net income in the quarter reflects strong investment income performance, and improved attritional loss and combined ratios offset by cat, COVID and reserve charges. The catastrophe losses of $70 million are pretax and net of reinsurance with $60 million from reinsurance and $10 million from insurance, driven by hurricanes Delta, Zeta and the Australian Queensland hailstorm. The estimate implied market share of industry losses is just over 60 basis points for Everest. This is an excellent result, reflecting the underwriting and risk management initiatives of the past two years. There was also no development from prior cats in the Q4 charge. Year-to-date, the results include catastrophe losses of $425 million, compared to $576 million during 2019. all amounts are pretax and net of reinstatement premiums. In the fourth quarter, we added $76 million to our COVID loss provision, reflecting the ongoing nature of this event and our consistent reserving philosophy. This additional provision is predominantly IBNR for third-party lines. This amount includes $56 million in the Reinsurance segment and $20 million in the Insurance segment, and in addition to the $435 million of pandemic losses estimated in the first nine months of 2020. our fourth quarter estimates were not impacted by the recent UK Supreme court ruling. As we had taken a prudent approach to loss assessment leading up to that ruling. for the full year 2020, the total pandemic loss provision is $511 million, of which more than 80% is classified as IBNR. Everest had an underwriting loss in Q4 of $219 million due to the prior year reserve adjustment charge as compared to an underwriting loss of $29 million for Q4 2019. As Juan mentioned, we booked a $400 million prior year reserve strengthening in the fourth quarter, exclusively for the reinsurance division, primarily within long-tail casualty segments, such as GL, auto liability and professional lines for accident years 2015 through 2018. the reserve charge also includes actions on non-cat property lines, primarily for the 2017 through 2019 accident years and driven by a few large losses to aggregate programs. Our reserve studies indicate that the insurance division overall has strong and adequate reserve levels. at a granular level, we address some redundancies and deficiencies with no overall financial impact. The lines we strengthened included professional liability in the 2015 through 2018 accident years. this was offset by releases and other lines. Turning to Everest’s market position and growth. On a year-to-date basis, gross written premium was $10.5 billion, up $1.3 billion or 15% compared to 2019. This reflects strong and diversified growth in both segments with Reinsurance up 15% and Insurance up 15% compared to 2019. Our underlying attritional loss and combined ratios are strong and improving. Excluding the catastrophe losses and impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, the attritional combined ratio was 87.5% for 2020, compared to 88.4% for 2019. Excluding the pandemic loss estimate, the group attritional loss ratio for 2020 was 60.1%, down from 60.2% for 2019 with insurance improving from 66% to 64.8%. for reinsurance, the 2020 attritional combined ratio excluding the pandemic loss estimate and prior year reserve charge was 85.2%, down from 85.5% in 2019. for insurance, the 2020 attritional combined ratio excluding the pandemic loss estimate was 94.2%, compared to 96.5% in 2019. our U.S. franchise, which makes up the majority of our insurance business, continues to run at an attritional combined ratio in the low-90s, excluding the pandemic loss estimate. The group commission ratio of 21.6% year-to-date was down from 23% in 2019, largely due to business mix, a one-time significant contingent commission in the Reinsurance segment during 2019 and higher seeding commission in the Insurance segment. the group expense ratio remains low at 5.8% for 2020 versus 6% for 2019, as we benefited from premium growth and continued focus on expense management. Q4 investment income had a strong performance of $222 million, compared to $146 million for Q4 2019. for the full year, pre-tax investment income was $642 million versus $647 million for 2019. The fixed income portfolio generated $542 million of investment income year-to-date compared to $520 million for the same period last year. limited partnerships recorded $91 million of income quarter-to-date, largely due to fair market value adjustments. Limited partnership result was due to the continued improvement of the economy and financial markets. As a reminder, we report our limited partnership income one quarter in arrears. Invested assets grew 23% to $25.4 billion versus $20.7 billion last year-end. This strong invested asset growth was due to $2.9 billion of operating cash flow and the proceeds of our debt issue. The pre-tax yield to maturity on the investment portfolio was just under 3%, down from 3.4% one year ago. Approximately, 80% of our invested assets are comprised of a well-diversified high-credit quality bond portfolio with duration of 3.6 years. The remaining portfolio is allocated to equities and other invested assets, which are largely private equity investments with the residual amount in short-term investments and cash. Our effective tax rate on operating income for 2020 was 7.7% and 12.1% on net income. for 2021, we expect our tax rate to be approximately 12%, which reflects an annual cat load of about six points of loss ratio. Everest generated record operating cash flows of $2.9 billion, compared to $1.9 billion in 2019, reflecting the strengths of our growing premiums in 2020 year-over-year, and a more modest level of claims paid. Everest enjoys very strong financial strength with ample capacity to execute on market opportunities. Shareholders’ equity was $9.7 billion at year-end 2020, up from $9.1 billion at year-end 2019. net book value per share stood at $243.25, up 11.4% versus year-end 2019 adjusted for dividends ever. Everest’s strong balance sheet was further strengthened by the 30 year $1 billion senior notes offering completed in early October 2020. This is long-term capital for Everest and enhances the efficiency of our capital structure with our debt leverage, now standing at 16.4%. And with that, I’ll now turn it back to John.
Jon Levenson: Thanks, Mark. operator, we are now ready to open the line for questions. We do ask that you please limit your questions to two or one question plus one follow-up, and then rejoin the queue if you have anything else to ask.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. My first question on, I want to touch on the reinsurance reserve charge. So one, I think in your opening remarks, you said that you guys had already selected more conservative loss picks. So, can you just – it would be helpful if you could provide more color there on them, will recent accident years just given right that there was strengthening of some of these long-tail lines going up to accident year 2018. So, can you just provide a little bit more color on what loss trend you’re booking to in some of these lines, but in your reinsurance book and how we could think about confidence in the more recent accident year?
Juan Andrade: Yes. thank you, Elyse. We go through a pretty detailed review of each of our segments. And frankly, one of the things that this new management team has done really in the past year is really, look at our carried reserves at a level of granularity that is pretty detailed. So, we basically look at the accident years, underwriting years, we’re using the latest information to better understand trends, predict ultimate loss ratios. And frankly, try to figure out in a much detailed way, the direction of travel for the underwriting portfolios. So, I start there by giving you a sense of the detail of granularity that we go through and basically coming up with a strengthening that we did in the quarter. Now, that being said, as we set the accident years, really beginning at the end of 2019, and as we’ve set the 2020 accident year, as we’ve set the 2021 accident year, we were already looking at some of the loss trends that are impacting the industry. And so we bake those in when we made those loss picks, that’s also one of the reasons why you don’t see us taking up current accident year loss picks as a result of the reserve charge.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. But can you give us a sense, I guess I know that there’s a many different business lines, but what kind of loss trends you’re booking to within reinsurance?
Juan Andrade: I don’t know if we specifically disclosed the loss trends that that we booked too. But what I can tell you though is that we are booking – our current accident year loss ratio is very prudently and we have been again, starting at the end of 2020 and going into 2021. We have not seen a significant impact on severity in the most recent accident years. And we’re very confident in, where we are at this point in time, both with the prior reserve actions that we took as well as the current year reserve loss picks that we have in place.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. And then my follow-up question is on the insurance, on the reserves there as well. So, I think Mark, you mentioned, there was no overall financial impact from the review. but I believe you mentioned strengthening on professional lines for 2015 to 2018 and they’re being releases and other lines. Can you give us the sense of the magnitude of the professional lines strengthening and then what were some of the other lines I’m assuming maybe, worker’s comp where you thought it was over leases?
Mark Kociancic: Yes. the magnitude is relatively muted. You’re looking at overall $3.2 billion of net reserves in the insurance segment for the group. And so the types of adjustments we’re talking about are in the teens, it’s quite small and the offsets are coming from other lines. worker’s comp would be an example of one, but again, very modest movements relative to the overall reserve level of the segment.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. Thanks for the color.
Juan Andrade: Thank you, Elyse.
Operator: Mike Phillips with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Mike Phillips: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. I guess, first on insurance still, looking at your core loss ratio and extra COVID losses, a really good improvement there, three points or so this quarter increasing in the last couple of quarters, I guess, how should we think about the margins there and I guess in the near term this year, as you focus on growth there, and we’ve got industry concerns on COVID and loss trends, and everything else in the casualty ones.
Juan Andrade: Yes. Sure. thanks. Mike, this is Juan Andrade. look, I think we are building meaningful margin momentum, and you can see that by our numbers for the fourth quarter and full year underwriting results, that improvement both in insurance and reinsurance is really driven by portfolio management, decisive underwriting actions, and intentional shifts in our portfolio mix. If we exclude workers’ compensation, we’re also seeing the rates are outpacing our expected loss costs, and as that rate has been earned on a growing premium base, that’s also going to have a positive impact on expected margin going forward. but also in – and I would point this out, because this a very important point in addition to rate, we’re also taking a broad array of underwriting actions, including more granular segmentation in the enforced book, management of attachment point, limits, terms and conditions, we’re doing targeted non-renewals and many other actions. So, we’re doing a number of things that you’re starting to see show up in the underlying profitability of both insurance and reinsurance that are by design, and that are very proactive. It’s not just all about rate, but it’s also about all the other tools that we have in our kit about improving underlying margins. But all of that being said and I think this goes to your question, Mike, it’s important to keep in mind that some lines do require more rate than others. It also depends on the starting point that depends on the loss cost trends, and we also have to recognize that we’re in an environment, where the impact of COVID and the time that it will take for some of these claims to emerge. There’s some uncertainty, right. We also have to think about the underlying social inflation cost. So overall, I feel very good about the margin momentum that we’re creating in this business. It’s not just about rate, but it’s also about all the underlying levers that we’re pulling forth. And I feel very good and very comfortable with both books of business going into 2021.
Mike Phillips: Okay. Thank you, Juan. I appreciate that. I guess second question specifically on your comp book, you guys have a pretty sizable concentration in one state. and I’m curious to hear what you are seeing in California in comps, given coming back from a shutdown and there’s been some concerns on loss trends kind of rising there in the state. So, anything you can share with what you’re seeing in that book?
Juan Andrade: Sure, Mike. let me start, and then I’ll ask Mike Karmilowicz to jump in as well. I would say overall on the comp book, a couple of key things to keep in mind is, we have reduced the percentage of comp in our book of business over the last year, 18 months. It’s now roughly down to about 16% of our mix, down from about 24%. And again, this has been done in a purposeful way, right. As you have seen less attractive pricing in the comp book, we have diversified into a business. And so you see our growth in lines like casualty, property, D&O, et cetera. The other thing that we have done in our comp book is we have also moved more towards loss, sensitive business, loss rated business on the comp side, and we’ve done less basically guaranteed comp business at that point in time. So, we’re actively managing the trend, we’re actively managing what we’re seeing in the environment, and obviously, trying to continue to drive a lot of profit in that comp book. But let me ask Mike Karm to jump in specifically on your question about California.
Mike Karmilowicz: Thanks, Juan. Thanks, Mike. Yes. look, it’s a continuation of what we said and shared in prior quarters about starting to see it bounce on the bottom, and we are seeing some pockets of some momentum upward. but in general, it’s still a slightly in the negative side, that’s why we’re taking the actions we have and just managing through the cycle. But we’re hopefully cautious optimistic of what we foresee possibly towards the 2021 towards the second half of the year.
Mike Phillips: Okay. Thank you, guys. Appreciate that.
Operator: Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Yaron Kinar: Hi, good morning, everybody. First question, it goes back to the reserves strengthening, can you maybe, talk about law specs for 2019, 2020, 2021 accident years relative to where they currently are for the 2015 to 2018 accident years in GL, commercial auto and professional lines?
Juan Andrade: Yes. Thanks, Yaron. I’ll start with that. And then I’ll ask Jim Williamson, who’s our new Chief Operating Officer to add some color on this as well. So, I mentioned before to Elyse’s question, particularly when we set the accident year loss picks for 2020 and 2021, we were more conservative than the picks that had been in place for the 2015 through 2019 accident years. And that was really a reflection of what we saw in the environment, some of the industry trends that we were seeing, et cetera. So, we took a more prudent approach in being able to set those. So, I would tell you that as I sit here today, looking at 2020, 2021, they’re stronger than the picks that we had in place for 2015 to 2018, but I would ask Jim Williamson to add some color on that as well.
Jim Williamson: Yes. Sure, Yaron. just in terms of a little bit more detail, I mean, I think one thing to keep in mind is, we’re performing this analysis at a very detailed and granular level. And so there’s a lot of moving parts in terms of picks that have come up over that period, where we’re now at a higher level, and then other areas, where we’ve taken so much rate, so many underwriting actions and the picks have come down. I think the key thing to keep in mind though, is that as Juan had indicated, we took a very conservative approach to the setting of the loss picks for the 2020 accident year, the 2021 accident year. And those picks are consistent with the level of ultimate loss ratio that’s coming out of the reserve studies. And that gives us confidence that our starting point is the right one. We’re taking rate in excess of our loss trend, right. So, those things give you a confidence that moving forward, we’re positioned in the right way in the portfolio.
Yaron Kinar: Got it. That’s helpful. I appreciate that. And then my second question actually goes to top-line growth. On your opening comments, did I get the – or I got the feeling from the opening comments that maybe, you’re deemphasizing growth in reinsurance over insurance in the foreseeable future. is that correct?
Juan Andrade: No, no. not at all, Yaron. what I was saying in my opening remarks is that we have a very good market right now in both insurance and reinsurance, and our intent is very much to continue growing as long as the opportunities are there for us to be able to do this profitably. We have a leading franchise in P&C, reinsurance. we’re the seventh largest in the world. We are aiming to continue to grow that presence, continue to take advantage of those opportunities. So absolutely not. As a matter of fact, I would also point you to my comments around our January 1 renewals and the fact that we had one of the strongest renewals we have seen in a number of years. And so look, as long as the market opportunity is there, as long as we can underwrite profitably, we’re taking advantage of that. We are very well positioned, whether it’s from a capital standpoint, a distribution standpoint, a talent standpoint, to be able to continue moving forward in this market with a lot of momentum.
Yaron Kinar: Thank you. I appreciate the comments.
Juan Andrade: Thanks, Yaron.
Operator: Josh Shanker with bank of America. Your line is open.
Josh Shanker: Yes. Good morning, everybody. My first question, I know you can’t speak to others books, but we see something in your book that looks similar to what we’ve seen in others. Most of the improvement during this year has come on the expense ratio side of the combined ratio, despite very, very strong rate increases already coming through in earned rates. I’m wondering if you can talk about why we’re seeing such large expense ratio improvements, whether it’s sustainable and just giving your many, many years of work in the industry. What’s going on here? This is not just an Everest phenomenon.
Juan Andrade: Yes. sure. Thanks, Josh. So, I would say a couple of things. We certainly have seen an improvement in the expense ratio and that’s really coming from two areas. One is on the commission side. And I think there’s different factors there. I think if you look at insurance first, a part of that is that we’re writing more direct business through our brokers and less DUA business overall. And so I think that’s part of what you’re seeing there. We also; in our insurance business, because of mix; get the benefit of improved cede commissions. I think our team has done a very good job in setting up their external reinsurance program. So, you see some of that coming through on the commissions. On the reinsurance side, I think it’s also pointed to mix; at the same time, on the commission line. but more importantly, to me, it’s really the operating expense ratio. One of the hallmarks of our company has been that we are lean. We’re disciplined on how we manage expenses. We invest where we need to invest in technology and people, and infrastructure, but we’re also very disciplined about how we do that. And that’s something that you saw us continue to accomplish in 2020 and up to 2021. That actually drives that expense ratio to where you see it today. We also experienced loss ratio improvement and you see that particularly, in the insurance business for 2020. And that is really related to all of those actions that I mentioned in my opening remarks, what I term is really the hard work of running a profitable book of business, right. This is managing attachment points and limits, and running off programs and books of business that you’re not comfortable with and always seeking out the best economic opportunities to continue to improve the profitability of that business. So, to me, those were all the actions that one has to take to continue to improve underwriting profitability and sustain a profitable book going forward.
Josh Shanker: And my second question, maybe, I’ll try and get back in line then, the 6% expected normalized cat load for the coming year. It’s obviously, materially lower than where Everest has been in the past. So that’s where it’s been trending, given the property cat renewals, which weren’t as good as some were hoping certainly better than they’ve been. Do we expect that long-term Everest volatility is going to stay low or we’re just at a place right now in pricing, where it just doesn’t make sense to take on a lot of cat risk?
Juan Andrade: Yes. So, let me start with that. And then I’ll ask John Doucette to jump in and add additional color to all of this. Josh, as you heard in my opening remarks, particularly at January 1st, we did increase the amount of limit that we deployed on the cat side. And we did that and feel very comfortable with it, because of the pricing, the terms and conditions that we’re getting. look, at the end of the day, volatility in of itself, is not a bad thing, as long as you’re getting paid for it. And from our perspective, we were getting paid for it in January 1; we were getting paid for it throughout 2020. Now that being said, our goal is to build a diversified book of business is not just to ride one pony if you will. And so if the opportunities are there on cat to be able to do it profitably, to get a good risk adjusted return, improve our ROEs, et cetera, we’re going to do it. And you saw us do that in the renewal seasons of last year and really going into January 1st. So, the appetite is there, but it’s there at a price, and it’s there at a point that makes sense to us economically. So with that, let me turn it over to John Doucette and have him add some color as well.
John Doucette: Yes. Thanks, Juan and good morning, Josh. Yes. look, we had a very good one-one with significant rate increase. we saw a double-digit growth across many, many lines of business. And in terms of property, we did see rate increases in the U.S. 5% to 10%, in retro 10% to 15%. And really, it was a question of how we allocated the book and where we decided to deploy the capacity. and so number one, where do we decide to deploy the capacity. We also saw very good opportunities in the primary property space. So, we deployed more capacity into both cat and to primary property quota share, which we liked the risk return on that opportunity. So, that’s number one. number two, as noted, we have increased the AUM and Logan, and continue to look for ways to increase that and look to have that continue to be a very strategic part of our volatility management, capital management, and that will help decrease the volatility that you’re seeing. And then number three, as Juan said, a lot of this is about diversification, diversification within the reinsurance, diversification by growing the insurance operation. So, it’s different lines, territories, products, and that will result in just a lower, dollars may be flat, but – or even up a little bit, but as a percentage of overall gross premium, the percentage of our cat load could be lower.
Josh Shanker: Okay. Well, thank you for all the answers. I appreciate it.
Juan Andrade: Thank you, Josh.
Operator: Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse. your line is open.
Mike Zaremski: Hey, great. Good morning. First is a follow-up to Josh’s question. So, I think a lot of us look at the historical cat load and listen to your guidance and obviously, you have a lot more info than us on the cat load of being six points. So, to the answer to the last question are – is Mt. Logan taking a portion of the historical cat load, right. So, it’s kind of – it’s going to other investors that aren’t equity investors. And is that maybe, the piece that we, as investors, don’t fully appreciate, because you’re ceding to kind of a new set of investors versus pre-Mt. Logan that was all going to Everest.
Juan Andrade: Yes. Thanks, Mike. This is Juan and again, let me start, and then I’ll ask John Doucette to jump in as well. What I would say that on that 6% cat load that Mark was referring to, it’s really a question of how we manage our exposure into reinsurance book and really, what we have been doing, frankly, over the last 18 months or so, to make sure that we’re in a better place, more profitable place, more sustainable place from a catastrophe standpoint. Again, I go back to what I said earlier. We like cat, but it has to be priced right, has to be managed correctly. You’ve seen a lot of things that we have done that have been frankly reflected in some of the catastrophe loss numbers that we’ve put out in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. we have moved up to higher attachment points. We’re writing less aggravated programs. we’re frankly writing a more profitable book and more sustainable book. And so that’s part of what you see there. The other part of that is our capital shield, our hedging strategy for the company. Logan certainly plays a role there. Our Kilimanjaro bonds certainly play a role there, and there’s other things that we’re doing at the same time. You will see that we grew AUM in our Logan book and our Logan vehicle to the beginning of this year. And that certainly, helps us well in essentially protecting our net position within the company. But let me ask John Doucette to jump in and add some additional color.
John Doucette: Yes. thanks, Juan. And so Mt. Logan, we’ve been – Mt. Logan’s been in effect since 2013. And it’s – it has grown and then came down a little bit in AUM and now has starting back up. So, I don’t think it’s a definitionally, it used to go to Everest and now, it goes to Logan. It’s part of a holistic suite of both what we’re doing on the growth side, capital management side and the hedging side. And it’s all – it’s part of that, but it’s clearly a core part of this, of how we’re thinking of capital management, volatility management going forward. But I mean, we also saw as Juan said earlier, while we did increase limits on the gross portfolio in our property book across property cat, retro and pro rata. we did increase that, because of the opportunity set, but we saw an increase in overall premium and a larger increase in expected dollar margin and percentage margin and an increase in the ROE. So, a part of it is how we’re thinking of what we want to keep on our balance sheet and other parts of the balance sheet. But I do think it’s more, I think then your – how you’re focusing on it. It’s more a function of the diversification. as a function of premium, it really has more to do with the diversification, the growth in the insurance operation as a percentage, the growth in reinsurance in different lines of business. We saw a lot of opportunities in casualty, continue to see opportunities in mortgage, professional liability, significant opportunities in fact, and all of that is on the – is growing the denominator of the 6% cat load that you’re talking about. And I think that is driving it more than specifically, in Logan or outside of Logan.
Mike Zaremski: Okay. That’s very helpful, those answers. And my last question is just thinking about the reserving additions that were added this past quarter, the $400 million, should we be thinking stepping back, are you adopting a new reserving methodology at all in a portion of the portfolio. I guess, sometimes we get questions at some of your peers, they kind of seek – they seek to, I think strategically kind of book, or maybe just overbook and be releasers, I’m just kind of curious is there – is there anything we should be thinking about that’s kind of changing on a go-forward basis versus how you historically picked?
Juan Andrade: Yes. Thanks, Mike. This is Juan. Look, I think from my perspective, the company has a very disciplined and multi-faceted approach to reserving and risk management, and that doesn’t change. But I bring you back to my earlier comments. There’s always opportunities for improvement on how you look at the data. So, from our perspective, the new senior management team that we have in place is very granular and very detailed in how we look at IBNR groups, and how we look at accident years by portfolio, by segment, et cetera, et cetera. And we’re making fact-based decisions based on the trending and the information that our reserving studies give us in what our actuarial department is able to provide to us. And so that is basically if there’s a change, it’s that, it’s the fact of that we’re being a lot more granular in how we look at the portfolios? How we make decisions based on the information that it’s there? And how we react to that basically?
Mike Zaremski: Thank you.
Juan Andrade: Thanks, Mike.
Operator: Ryan Tunis with Autonomous. Your line is open.
Ryan Tunis: Hey, thanks. Good morning. I guess another follow-up on the charge and the reinsurance. Just trying to get a little bit more texture, is this mainly a few large programs? There’s a little bit more broad-based and then also just maybe, you could give us some feel for how you’re reserved for those accident years, 2015, 2018, relative to the loss ratio in the indications from the seasons. how your loss picks compared to the loss ratios being reported to you in those years?
Juan Andrade: Yes. So Ryan, this is Juan Andrade. Let me start, and then I’ll ask both Mark Kociancic and Jim Williamson to add a little bit of color on this one. On the reinsurance strengthening that we took, it was really a factor of a few things. Number one, we had a few seasons with a poor experience in those accident years, and on those seasons, we have subsequently reduced our lines or essentially completely non-renewed the effected accounts. So that’s part of that. There’s also the fact that we had some pretty large losses coming through and some of those years, whether it was wildfires, MGM, et cetera. And that’s part of that. And then the other part of that is really just general social inflation or the trend that we saw out in the marker that was generating some higher severity losses than what we anticipated too. So that’s basically what we saw in our reserving studies, that essentially led to us taking the strengthening actions that we did. But let me now turn it over to Mark and then Jim, for a little bit of additional color on your question.
Mark Kociancic: Just a bit more on that, Ryan. I think in addition to what Juan was saying, when we took a look at these individual lines in accident years, we were looking also at the magnitude of uncertainty. So in other words, where are we within the ranges? And I think the strengthening that we put up in these individual years in lines, we feel pretty good about. So, we feel like there’s a good level of prudence that’s been set up for these and it solves the problem for us.
Jim Williamson: Yes. And so that’s sort of close it out with just a little bit of color around the piece of your question that sort of looks to translate, seen underlying loss ratio to what we’re experiencing. I mean, look, the reserving process is based on our own loss activity. And I think there are clearly areas where you can draw a more direct connection if you’re talking about, for example, a quota share book. So, in the cases we’re participating in a proportional fashion with our seasons and they’re seeing social inflation, average claim sizes have increased on the casualty side or in the case of water damage claims that are elevating property losses that’s going to be a more direct translation, where I think that starts to break down those when you start talking about 3D structures that are not a direct quota share participation. you can’t always draw those direct lines. And so I’d be a little bit careful about that, but if you think about the things in the general trends that have affected primary insurers in the 2015 to 2018 on the casualty sort of 2016 and 2019 on property, it’s sort of the same drivers of loss that we are seeing in our book are the ones you’re hearing from other companies. So, I think it’s consistent in that fashion.
Ryan Tunis: Got it. That was helpful and I guess talking about – like hearing you guys talking about how the loss fix in 2020 and also 2021 are more conservative. So obviously, you’ve taken a view on 2021. I’m just curious, thinking about the 58%-ish ex-COVID accident year loss ratio to reinsurance, should we think that given the higher 2021 loss pick, how easy or difficult do you think it’ll be to improve on that next year, also taking into consideration the rate backdrop? Thanks.
Juan Andrade: Yes. Ryan, this is Juan. Thank you. Look, I go back to some of my earlier comments, where for us, it’s not just simply about rate, but it’s also about all the other levers that we have within the underwriting portfolio and within the underwriting toolkit that we’re executing upon, right. So, if you think about how John and his team are positioning the team from an attachment standpoint, from a structuring into treaties, how they’re playing on pro ratas to be able to take advantage of the improvement in primary rates, et cetera, et cetera, all of these are things that are going into the improvement of our underlying margin and frankly, why I said at the beginning of all of this that we are building meaningful margin momentum in our underlying book of business. And I feel pretty good about that. So, the reality is we’re working at this every day, whether it’s in reinsurance and insurance, with the goal of continuing to improve our margins, improve our profitability, improve our loss ratios, et cetera, et cetera. So, you’re going to continue seeing taking actions across the board, again, not just necessarily all rate related, but there’s a lot of things we can do in the portfolio that also influenced that and we’re doing them today.
Ryan Tunis: Thank you.
Juan Andrade: Thanks, Ryan.
Operator: Brian Meredith with UBS. Your line is open.
Brian Meredith: Yes, thanks. Two questions. The first one, Juan, just curious, if we look at the return, you’re probably generating a new business right now. And then just curious what your thoughts are on that, is that better than actually repurchasing your shares at this point, given that you’re trading at a discount to book value?
Juan Andrade: Yes. So look, I think a couple of things, and then I’ll ask Mark Kociancic to jump in as well. From a capital management philosophy standpoint, our approach really hasn’t changed. Number one, we invest in our company and in the organic growth that we see there. We happened to be at a place in time, where we have terrific opportunities in the insurance side, under reinsurance side and you see from our numbers, we’re taking advantage of them. fact is we’re leaning forward. The fact that we grew 15% in a pandemic year with an economic recession, exposure reductions, I think is a very good outcome. And I think that gives you a sense of how we’re investing in our business to continue to grow and take advantage of those opportunities. At the same time, we also then look at other things that we can do to return capital to our shareholders. And I’ll let Mark talk a little bit about that.
Mark Kociancic: So Brian, I think both parts are on the table. Obviously, the emphasis on franchise expansion in a hard market is paramount, the sizing come along quite some time. On the capital management side, though your points are well taken and that’s clearly on our radar screen, I think share buybacks, the dividend policy, that’s still all in play and very much in our line of sight. But we do have, I think, a unique opportunity to capture a lot of benefits from this hard market.
Brian Meredith: And I guess you don’t have the flexibility to do both at the same time, grow and buyback?
Mark Kociancic: No, we do. Yes.
Brian Meredith: Okay.
Mark Kociancic: Yes. we have full capability on both sides. So, whether it’s attacking the market and taking advantage of opportunities and doing the capital management aspects that you’ve seen in the past.
Jim Williamson: Yes, Brian. And I would jump in there as well. As I’ve mentioned in the third quarter earnings call, we have the capital flexibility to attack this market and we’re doing it. As I mentioned earlier, based on the growth rates that you’re seeing, we also did the $1 billion debt raise back in October of last year. And that has not been deployed for growth yet, that has been invested in our portfolio, but we have dry powder. So, we have the ability to continue to do what we need to do in this market and take advantage of the opportunities that we see in front of us.
Brian Meredith: Real helpful. And then my second question, Juan. I’m just curious, could you give us some perspective on where do you think we are with respect to COVID loss recognition and what are the potential future exposures kind of related to COVID?
Juan Andrade: Yes. Thank you for that. Look, I feel very good and very confident, where we are with our COVID numbers. We were very consistent in our reserving throughout 2020. Our processes were very good, very thorough. As Mark mentioned in his remarks, we’re at $511 million for the year of 2020, over 80% of that is IBNR. We look at the claims activity, that’s been coming in. We have not been surprised. Everything has been tracking along sort of what we expected. So, I feel very confident about where we are with those COVID numbers. Now, all of that being said, the pandemic is still ongoing, right. That that has not eased, it continues. And things that we look at are there going to be other legal, regulatory legislative type things that happen that we haven’t seen yet, right. So, those are the things that are still out there potentially. The other thing that’s out there is the fact that as a reinsurer, we do get late information from our seasons. but all of that being said, I feel very confident about where we are with that $511 million that we took in 2020.
Brian Meredith: Thank you.
Juan Andrade: Thanks, Brian.
Operator: Derek Han with KBW. your line is open.
Meyer Shields: Hi, this is Meyer – is with me.
Juan Andrade: Yes. Hi Meyer.
Meyer Shields: Great. I’m sorry, I couldn’t catch the name. So, two quick questions. One, the cat load is consistent in terms of expectations on a year-over-year business – year-over-year basis. And I was hoping you could break that down between business exchanges that had been driving down the catalyst ratio in prior years and maybe, just a more pessimistic expectation of losses, because of climate change or other factors underlying trends.
Juan Andrade: Yes, that’s good. So, let me start with that. And then I’ll ask John Doucette to come back into it. Again, I think part of what you’re seeing in that 6% cat load that Mark alluded to, it’s essentially the end result of a lot of the management actions to proactive underwriting actions that the team has taken really over the last 12 months to 18 months to better improve and better manage the volatility of our portfolio. So, you’re definitely seeing that essentially come through at the same time. Now, regarding the point on climate change, we are very mindful of that, right. So, one of the things that our modeling does particularly under reinsurance division is really look at the impact of rising sea temperatures that you can clearly see from 1995 onto current. And based on that, we have adapted our modeling. We have updated our points of view on risk, on pricing to better be able to manage that. So, all of that is essentially baked into that, but let me turn it over to John Doucette and let him add a little bit of color on that as well.
John Doucette: Yes. Thanks, Juan. And yes, just continue on. So, two things we spend a lot of time thinking about in terms of how we manage the risk in our property portfolio. It’s all the aspects of climate risk. We spent a lot of time looking at wildfire and frankly derisking the wildfire exposure in our portfolio, spent a lot of time looking at the warm sea surface temperature, looking at droughts and the propensity for drought. So, a lot of how we deploy capacity, what should the right attachments, products, terms, conditions, and frankly, rate be looking at that. So, number one is climate change. And number two is, we’ve also been looking a lot at the different social inflation and risks that we’ve seen in the books. Things like assignment of benefits to LAE, the increase in LAE that we’ve seen in different areas, both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. And so that’s all factored into how we think about building the best portfolio, learning from the lessons that the industry has seen and really positioning our book on a go-forward basis. And it also, it has some loss trends for the reasons I just mentioned climate and some of the social issues, but it also – we also were seeing the uplift that we’re getting from improved rates, terms, conditions, occurrence clauses, hours clauses, et cetera, et cetera. So, all of that is we have several countercurrent that result in the 6% you’re looking at here.
Meyer Shields: Okay. That was very thorough. Thanks. And then the second, really quickly, can you give us some picture of expectations of ceding commissions, both what you’re going to expect to pay in reinsurance and collect in insurance on a year-over-year basis?
Juan Andrade: Sure. So, John Doucette, why don’t you start with that? And then we’ll go to Mike Karm for the insurance piece of it.
John Doucette: Yes. Thanks, Juan. So, it’ll vary by line by territory, et cetera, by loss experience of the clients. So, one of – there’s been significant underlying rate improvement, terms and condition improvement on casualty and professional liability. And so our view is that the casualty reinsurance market was rationale. for the most part, ceding commissions were about flat. But we did see an economic uplift at one just based on our exposure to the underlying terms and conditions. And then that would be very last dependent. If somebody had bad, poor loss experience, they could see a cut in the ceding commissions. And on property overall, we did see an improvement in the overall reinsurance terms and both in terms of like occurrence, limits as well as ceding commissions. And I think that really was just a function of the overall capacity dearth on a proportional reinsurance. So, we were able to deploy and wanted to deploy more into that space.
Mike Karmilowicz: Yes. I think it really comes down from the insurance perspective, really on the value of the reinsurance relationships that we are successfully maintaining all the ceding conditions commissions that renewed over the last several months. I would say one comment is, our books varied and we had certain portfolios, like I mentioned, we had the beneficiary of that for some of the things, Juan mentioned earlier about ceding commissions that we gained by some of the portfolio mix and certain lines like specialty casualty and other specialty lines, like transactional and credit and political risk. So, we didn’t have really top talent in these areas, which I think have generated better terms and conditions for us in some of our reinsurance. But I think as we continue the journey, we see opportunity and we certainly think there’s also opportunities for us to manage that more effectively.
Meyer Shields: Thank you very much.
Operator: We have time for one more question, Phil Stefano with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Phil Stefano: Yes, thanks. I just wanted to ask a follow-up to Brian’s question about the COVID charges. Can you just provide us with a reminder of how to think about, is there a date that you have booked this through? Is it just the calendar year 2020 losses, or to what extent was 2020 and the potential ongoing nature of the pandemic contemplated in the 511 reserves?
Juan Andrade: Yes. sure, thanks, Phil. let me ask Jim Williamson to address that question for you.
Jim Williamson: Yes. Phil, to provide a little bit of color, I think it’s important to understand the process we go through to arrive at these estimates, it’s incredibly granular. So, we are basically reviewing each and every reinsurance contract we have in each of our markets around the world. We do that multiple times each quarter. And the goal of those underwriter estimates is to get a total view of estimated losses for those contracts. And so it’s not really isolated to any particular time period. It’s focused on the extent of the contract and what we think those losses are going to be. So, I mean I think that’s the core of the answer to the question. I think it’s important to note though, that obviously our understanding of what that total is going to be is informed by the duration of the pandemic, et cetera, as well as the reporting lag that Juan pointed out. But our goal is always to try to estimate the totality of loss.
Phil Stefano: Okay. And as we think about the growth is coming into the business, and maybe, this is more focused on insurance and reinsurance, but the potential for economies of scale, as we think about nominal expenses moving forward, it feels like the insurance business has some investments in teams and the building out of the functions and things like that. Does it feel like that should slow down and we return – or we come to a point, where expense growth on a dollar basis, is much more inflation plus or minus, or their investments still to be made in helping us think about the economies of scale you can pull through.
Juan Andrade: Yes, Phil. I think that’s a great question. Look, the insurance division is now a $3.2 billion business, right. So that’s a good size insurance company. We are still making investments in technology and people, data, and analytics, product expansion, a number of things. And that’s not going to stop, right. Because we think we have a terrific opportunity in front of us, particularly in this market to continue to be able to grow that. Now, that being said, we also expect that we will continue to manage our expenses in a very disciplined way in the way we have been now. So, focusing on things like digital automation, those types of things to make us more productive, much more efficient, those are things that are very much top of mind, and they’re also being implemented as we go forward. So, there will be investment that will continue in business. We will be reaching economies of scale as you point out. I think we’re pretty close to that, and the focus is on how do we become more productive, more effective, more efficient as we grow that business.
Operator: And now, I’d like to turn the call back over to management for final remarks.
Juan Andrade: Great. Thank you. So, I think as you can see from our results, we have strong growth. We have strong underlying improvement and we have great momentum going into 2021. The company is very well positioned for this market. We have the financial strength, a preferred market presence, a diversified global platform, we are nimble, we have a deep distribution relationship we have great people and we have a great culture. We’re very well positioned. So, thank you for your time with us this quarter and for your support of our company.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-10-30 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Everest Re Group Earnings Conference Call. This call is being webcast and will also be available for replay on the Everest website later today. I now like to turn the call over to Jon Levenson, Head of Investor Relations.
Jon Levenson: Good morning and welcome to the Everest Re Group Limited 2020 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. The Everest executives leading today's call are: Juan Andrade, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Kociancic, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We are also joined by other members of the Everest management team. Before we begin, I will preface the comments on today's call by noting that Everest SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. Management comments regarding estimates, projections and similar are subject to the risks, uncertainties and assumptions as noted in these filings. Management may also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These items are reconciled in our earnings release and financial supplement. With that, I turn the call over to Juan Andrade.
Juan Andrade: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. For nearly 50 years, Everest has been a source of strength for our customers. This has never been more important than in today's public health, economic, social and natural catastrophe-impacted environment. Our business is running smoothly. We're performing well. And our people continue to demonstrate the passion, professionalism and resilience that differentiates Everest. I am thankful to our employees for their hard work and perseverance in delivering the solid results we're reporting today. I am particularly proud of Everest recently being named by Business Insurance as one of the best places to work in 2020, a meaningful achievement in the current environment. The economic recovery is uneven and there was significant natural catastrophe activity in the quarter. Despite this, Everest has continued to grow and generate operating profit. Our broadly diversified Reinsurance and Insurance franchise, our financial strength, deep distribution relationships, and our focus on providing solutions to our customers represent the foundation that position us well for the strength we see in the reinsurance and insurance markets today. In addition, we have added 2 exceptionally talented and seasoned global executives to our management team. Mark Kociancic, our new Group Chief Financial Officer, joins us from SCOR, where he was the group CFO since 2013. Jim Williamson, our new Group Chief Operating Officer, joins us from Chubb. Both of these executives have made an immediate impact to Everest. I want to thank Craig Howie for his commitment and contributions to the company. Craig has played an important role in the growth and evolution of Everest. Craig will remain with the company until the end of 2020 to assist Mark with a smooth and seamless transition. We have also further fortified our already strong capital base with $1 billion senior notes offering completed on October 7. This is very efficient long-term 30-year capital at a low 3.5% coupon. As I said in the second quarter earnings call, we have the capital to play offense in this improving market, and we also have capital flexibility. We chose to exercise some of this flexibility opportunistically, given the state of credit markets and the low borrowing rates available. We will seek to deploy these proceeds as favorable market opportunities continue to develop and in support of our overall strategy to grow book value over time. Our already strong company is now even stronger. Everest's strength is evidenced by our third quarter results for the group, where despite the high frequency of natural catastrophe activity, we achieved 16% gross written premium growth and improved attritional combined ratio of 85.8%, excluding cat and pandemic impacts, net investment income of $234 million, operating income profit of $97 million, net income of $243 million, book value per share growth of 7% from yearend 2019 or 9% adjusted for dividends, and a record shareholders' equity of $9.6 billion. Our growth in the quarter stems from a combination of new business opportunities, improved rate levels and high retention rates on our existing book. The underwriting loss for the quarter was driven by the previously announced $300 million in catastrophe losses. This is in the context of an estimated $35 billion industry loss in the third quarter. We also added $125 million to our COVID-19 loss provision, reflecting the ongoing nature of this event and our prudent reserving philosophy. This provision is predominantly IBNR. Excluding catastrophes and the pandemic impacts, our attritional combined ratios for the group in each of our segments, Reinsurance at 83% and Insurance at 94% improved year-over-year and are reflective of the earnings generating power of the Everest franchise. Underwriting profitability remains at the core of everything we do. On a 9-month year-to-date basis, Everest has grown 15% and delivered an 88% attritional combined ratio, excluding the pandemic impacts. Everest Reinsurance had 20% quarterly growth year-over-year. We executed our strategies to underwrite a high-performing book of business with higher economic returns and lower volatility. We executed on reinsurance opportunities in several classes, including facultative risk, property and casualty, and in certain territories, including the U.S., Canada and Latin America. Traditional capital from highly rated carriers like Everest has become more relevant and supply is tight. We see the favorable pricing environment continuing for the foreseeable future. We also continue to be disciplined and rigorously evaluate each transaction. John Doucette is available to provide additional details on market conditions during the Q&A. Everest Insurance had solid execution in the quarter with continued underlying margin improvement over 2019 and 6% growth year-over-year, despite exposure reductions in certain lines given the current economic environment. The attritional combined ratio, excluding the pandemic impact improved to 94% for the quarter compared to 96% in the third quarter of 2019. We are strategically managing the Insurance portfolio to build a more diversified business and steer our mix toward product lines that earn higher margins over the long term. Our significant position in both the E&S and retail channels give us access to a wide set of opportunities. For the quarter, the main insurance growth drivers were continued rate momentum of plus 19% excluding workers' compensation, and plus 13% including workers' compensation. We had strong growth across property, excess casualty and D&O, where market capacity is constrained and we are seeing the strongest rate increases and better terms. We had continued strength in the excess and surplus line space. And we also had strong renewal retention in both our retail and E&S businesses. Mike Karmilowicz is available to provide additional details on market conditions during the Q&A. Regarding the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the $125 million loss provision in the third quarter was comprised of $110 million for Reinsurance and $15 million for Insurance. Our overall COVID-19 loss provision year-to-date is $435 million, of which 85% is IBNR. Consistent with our analytical rigor, we continue to take a measured approach to our COVID-19 loss estimation that is based on credible, fact-based and supportable information. We instituted a thorough loss estimation process at the start of the pandemic. It is conducted team by team and contract by contract. As events unfold and more data becomes available, we are continuously testing our estimates. The claims data we're seeing is consistent with our expectations. It is also important to reiterate that as a reinsurer, our analysis is specific to each situation. And similar to reserving, we have established an equally prudent and rigorous claims process. We evaluate claims presented based on existing policy, and contract terms and conditions. Lastly, we remain comfortable with the exposure and loss reserves in our Mortgage business in the context of the ongoing economic uncertainty from the pandemic. In summary, Everest continued to perform well in the third quarter, despite the uncertainty in the world today. We continue to purposely seek the best opportunities to write business at attractive returns. We have a talented team, a diversified global platform and a strong capital position. All of which allows us to provide attractive solutions to our clients and capture the improving opportunities in front of us. Now, let me welcome Mark Kociancic to the call and turn it over to him for additional details on the financials. Mark?
Mark Kociancic: Thank you, Juan, and good morning, everyone. I am very excited to be joining the great team here at Everest with its excellent talent base and culture. I look forward to contributing to the company's continuing growth and success. I think my industry experience and skill sets will be assets to further augment the great foundation that has been built here at Everest. Everest delivered a strong set of financial results for the third quarter of 2020. We achieved significant net income and positive operating income, continued our growth into favorable market conditions and strengthened our already robust capital position. For the third quarter of 2020, Everest reported strong net income of $243 million. This is more than double the $104 million of net income for the third quarter of 2019. On a year-to-date basis, net income was $451 million compared to $792 million for the first 9 months of 2019. Year-to-date, net income included $67 million of net after-tax realized capital gains compared to $90 million in the first 9 months of 2019. Third quarter results were driven by strong premium growth across the group, strong investment income performance and improved attritional loss and combined ratios. We also had Q3 catastrophe activity of $300 million, pre-tax and net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums. And we added $125 million COVID-19 pandemic loss provision; year-to-date, our COVID-19 provision stands at $435 million. And as Juan stated, it's predominantly IBNR. The group experienced an underwriting loss in Q3 of $150 million due to the elevated level of natural catastrophes in the quarter as compared to an underwriting loss of $28 million in 2019. Turning to Everest's market position and growth. On a year-to-date basis, gross written premium was $7.7 billion, up $1 billion or 15% compared to the first 3 quarters of 2019. This reflects balanced and diversified growth in both segments, with Reinsurance up 15% and Insurance up 15% compared to last year. During the third quarter of 2020, the company reported $300 million of catastrophe losses. These losses are pre-tax and net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums and related to Hurricanes Laura, Isaias, Sally; wildfires in California and Oregon; and other events including the Midwest United States Derecho windstorm. The after-tax basis amount was approximately $240 million. On a year-to-date basis, the results reflected net pre-tax and net of reinstatement catastrophe losses of $345 million compared to $335 million during the first 9 months of 2019. Excluding, the catastrophe losses and the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, the comparable combined ratios were 85.8% for Q3 2020 and 87.1% for Q3 2019, an 88% through the first 9 months of 2020 and 87.7% for the first 9 months of 2019, mostly attributable to the Reinsurance business mix changes. Excluding the pandemic loss estimate, the group attritional loss ratio for the third quarter of 2020 was 59.3%, down from 59.7% compared to Q3 2019. Excluding the pandemic loss estimate, the group attritional loss ratio for the first 9 months of 2020 was 60.2%, up from 59.5% for the first 9 months of 2019, primarily due to the continued change in Reinsurance business mix year-over-year. For the Reinsurance segment, the Q3 2020 attritional loss ratio, excluding the pandemic loss estimate was 57.5%, essentially flat from 57.6% in Q3 2019. Year-to-date, it stood at 58.5%, excluding the pandemic loss, up from 57.5% for the first 9 months of 2019. This increase was related to the continued shift toward more pro rata business, which carries a higher loss pick versus excess of loss, but allows us to benefit directly from the firming primary market. The Reinsurance division has $323 million of year-to-date operating profitability, given its $294 million of year-to-date net investment income. For the Insurance segment, the Q3 2020 attritional loss ratio, excluding the impacts from the pandemic, was 64.8%, down from 65.9% in Q3 2019. Year-to-date, it stood at 65.2%, down compared to 65.6% for the first 9 months of 2019. Our U.S. franchise, which makes up the majority of our Insurance business, continues to run an attritional combined ratio in the low-90s, excluding the pandemic loss estimate. The Insurance division has $62 million of year-to-date operating profitability, given its $126 million of year-to-date net investment income. The Q3 group commission ratio of 20.2% was down compared to the prior year Q3 level of 23.3%. This was driven by business mix and Reinsurance, notably more facultative business written and earned, and also higher ceding commission received in the Insurance segment. The group commission ratio of 21.7% year-to-date was down compared to the prior year figure of 23%, largely due to the same reasoning. The group expense ratio remains low at 6.1% for the first 9 months of 2020, in line with our expectations. Q3 investment income increased strongly to $234 million versus $181 million for Q3 2019. For investments, pre-tax investment income was $420 million year-to-date as compared to $501 million for the first 9 months of 2019. The fixed income portfolio generated $408 million of investment income year-to-date compared to $383 million for the same period last year. As expected, net investment income increased substantially as we recorded $89 million quarter-to-date of largely fair market value adjustments of our limited partnership investments in this line. The limited partnership result was due to the impact of improvement in the economy and financial markets. As a reminder, we report our limited partnership income one quarter in arrears. The pre-tax yield to maturity on the investment portfolio was 3.1%, diminishing from 3.4% one year ago. We continue to hold a well-diversified, high credit quality bond portfolio with conservative duration at approximately 3.5 years. The current overall fixed income reinvestment yields are averaging approximately 2%. Other income and expense included $38 million of foreign exchange gains during the first 9 months of 2020 compared to a loss of $44 million for 2019. Regarding income taxes, our effective tax rate on operating income was minus 0.1% through Q3. There is a year-to-date tax benefit of $31 million related to the CARES Act that we reported in the first quarter. Excluding this benefit, the effective tax rate on year-to-date operating income would be 8.9%. Along with growth and profitability, positive cash flow was a highlight this quarter as we generated record operating cash flows of approximately $1.1 billion for the third quarter of 2020 compared to $633 million in Q3 2019, reflecting the strength of the growth in premiums in 2020 compared to 2019. Everest has a strong balance sheet, which was endorsed by the market with our very attractively received debt raise during October. Everest solidified its very strong capital position in the aforementioned opportunistic $1 billion senior notes offering in early October with a low coupon of 3.5% and 30-year tenure under very favorable market conditions. This represents very efficient long-term capital for Everest. The debt leverage ratio pro forma for Q3 stands at 15.1%. Shareholders' equity for the group was $9.6 billion at the end of the third quarter, up from $9.1 billion at year-end 2019. The increase in shareholders' equity in the first 9 months of 2020 is largely due to the $451 million of net income; the mark-to-market impact on the fixed income assets, which increased by $349 million from December 31, 2019 plus $387 million of paid dividends and share buybacks. Net book value per share stood at $239.98, up 7% from yearend 2019 or plus 9.3% when adjusted for dividends. Again, I'm very excited about the future of Everest and the opportunity to further help drive its performance off a strong base. Thank you. And now, I'll turn it back to Jon.
Jon Levenson: Great. Thanks, Mark. Operator, we're ready to open the line for questions. And we would ask if everyone can please limit their questions to 2, 1 question plus 1 follow-up. Thanks.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo, your line is open.
Elyse Greenspan: Thanks. Good morning. My first question, just looking for a little bit more color on the margin profile within, I guess, Insurance and Reinsurance. So you guys are getting a good amount of rate in both of those businesses, showing some good growth as well. So I'm just trying to understand just the level of margin improvement. I know we saw some in the quarter when we backed out cat and the impact of the pandemic. But I'm just trying to think about the impact of earned rate exceeding trend and how we should think about the margin, the potential for expansion in both Reinsurance and Insurance for the balance of this year and into 2021.
Juan Andrade: Thanks, Elyse, and this is Juan Andrade. Yeah and as you note, we saw good margin improvement in the quarter. And just to add a little bit of context for that, we are seeing that rate is outpacing our loss trend in most classes of business, particularly in the insurance sector, also in reinsurance. But we are not changing our accident year loss picks at this point in time. We believe, again, based on our prudent reserving philosophy that we need to let some of the season over time before we actually start taking it to the bottom line. However though, keep in mind that we also have other levers that we can pull in order to improve margin and improve profitability in our book of business. And it's things like portfolio management, always looking at your portfolio in detail, being able to tweak that. We could look at deal structures. We could look at limit deployment. We could look at industry class selection, terms and conditions, et cetera. So from that perspective, we're doing all of that in our goal to continue to improve underwriting profitability for both the Insurance and the Reinsurance segments.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. That's helpful. And then, my follow-up, I guess, just tied to that, was there any benefit from COVID in the accident year loss ratio? Just I'm thinking if there was any kind of frequency benefit within workers' comp or some short-tail lines that you took in the quarter? Or did you not take any of that within your results?
Juan Andrade: No, we did not take any frequency benefit into account in our results. We are seeing frequency benefits in certain lines of business, commercial auto, general liability, workers' compensation, et cetera. But keep in mind, there's also exposure reductions that are taking place at the same time, because of economic situation. And so, similar to my reply to the earlier question, we're looking at this and we're taking a wait-and-see approach before we change any of our loss picks or bake in any frequency benefits at this point in time.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. Thanks for the color.
Juan Andrade: Thanks, Elyse.
Operator: Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Yaron Kinar: Hi, can you hear me?
Juan Andrade: We can hear you, Yaron.
Yaron Kinar: Okay. Good morning. Thank you.
Juan Andrade: Good morning.
Yaron Kinar: So, first question is with regards to the COVID losses. Can you maybe talk a little bit about what lines of business those reserves were put up in?
Juan Andrade: Yeah, sure thing, Yaron. The lines of business were contingency, business interruption and a little bit of workers' compensation as well. And I would point, again, back to my remarks and remind you that, again, the vast majority of that provision was really in Reinsurance, which is about $110 million of the $125 million. And overall, 85% of our provision at this point year-to-date is on an IBNR basis. So I think that gives you a sense for, again, the prudent approach that we're taking on this.
Yaron Kinar: Okay. And have you booked, I guess, in contingency and BI, have you booked those at full limit losses today or is there potential for additional losses to come?
Juan Andrade: Yeah. The way I think about it, and I'd point you back to my remarks, Yaron, we have a pretty detailed and rigorous process by which we're estimating our reserves that is based on credible and fact-based information. So given that, what we're doing is essentially looking at the fact that this is an ongoing event. It's continuing. I mean you're certainly seeing the situation in Europe these days with some of the additional lockdowns and the spikes, et cetera. So from that perspective, it's an ongoing event. And so, what we do is we do a bottom-up, treaty by treaty, account by account, profit-center by profit-center type review and we true it up with the latest information that we have available at the time.
Yaron Kinar: Got it. And then my follow-up question is with regards to the reserve beyond COVID. You're still relatively new in the role, less than one year in, there's new CFO now as well. We haven't really seen much movement in reserves this year. As we head into the end of the year, how confident is the management team in the current reserves?
Juan Andrade: Yeah, sure thing. So, Yaron, what I would say is, we have an ongoing and dynamic process to review our reserves. And our philosophy hasn't changed. It's really what we have talked about in the past in the sense that we recognize bad news quickly. And we require good news to be proven over a longer period of time. And hence, that was a little bit also of my answer to Elyse earlier about accident year loss picks. We need to see some of that season over time. But we're always continuing to review and analyze the portfolio. We have completed some reserve studies in smaller segments earlier in the year, and there was no material change in either direction. We will be completing longer-tail segments in the fourth quarter. And if we see any need to take action, we will take action at that point in time. But again, that's basically the reserving stance in our philosophy.
Yaron Kinar: Thank you very much.
Juan Andrade: Sure.
Operator: Brian Meredith with UBS Securities. Your line is open.
Brian Meredith: Yes. Thank you. A couple of questions here. The first one, just on the Reinsurance space, I noticed a drop in casualty XOL and casualty pro rata premiums. I thought that was actually a pretty good market now. What's going on there? Just contracts lost, certain unusual items going on? Or is your conscious reason to decrease that?
Juan Andrade: Thanks, Brian. I'll ask John Doucette to please comment on that.
John Doucette: Yeah, good morning, Brian. Look, part of that is just timing of accounts and a couple of one-off accounts. But we agree that it's a good market, and we're seeing both on the treaty and the facultative side proportional casualty and excess of loss casualty opportunities both in the U.S. and international. And we had a very good July 1, and continue to see that. And frankly, expect that to be an area of growth for us in 2021.
Brian Meredith: Great. And then pivoting over to the Insurance, kind of similar type question. I mean only 5% growth in premium this quarter. I know some of that's probably the pressures from workers' comp. But maybe some color around why are we seeing better growth there?
Juan Andrade: Yeah. Mike Karmilowicz, if you can answer that question, please?
Mike Karmilowicz: Sure. Thanks, Brian, for the question. A couple of things. Juan stated before that our focus is really in the business with a better margin long-term, as you just mentioned with workers' comp and our diversification. You're seeing that business mix play through the underlying loss ratio. And with that, we are focused with the front foot of capitalizing those markets where we are prepared to drive. So when you think about like excess casualty, you think about D&O and even our core U.S. retail and wholesale property where we're up 28%, we're driving those groups really hard. Now there is a drag a little bit that you're seeing with regards to the pandemic, but we are very well positioned. And given the opportunity in the marketplace that's in front of us, we think we're going to have significant opportunity in the foreseeable future as the economy comes online.
Juan Andrade: Yeah. And what I would add to that, Brian, as well, is that we're executing pretty well and we have the platform, both on the E&S side and the retail side. You saw the plus 19% rate that we had in the quarter, which is continuing to build over prior quarters. And when you take away some of the drag from the exposure reductions that you're seeing in the economy, this business will grow double digits. And that's just a matter of the economic recovery playing itself through.
Brian Meredith: Great, very helpful. Thank you, Juan.
Juan Andrade: Sure.
Operator: Michael Zaremski with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Michael Zaremski: Okay. Good morning. Thinking about the capital raise, I guess from hearing the comments on previous earnings calls, it didn't seem like capital was really needed. I heard the comments, Juan, about being opportunistic. So just curious, did something kind of change quarter-over-quarter? Or is it just simply low debt costs and some growth? And do - will some of this capital be used for buybacks, if the buybacks, you think, will come online now that COVID losses seem to be kind of improving, and we're through most of cat season?
Juan Andrade: Yeah, thanks, Mike. So first of all, nothing has changed. We have been in an excess capital position as a company, as we've talked about in the past. And for us, it was exactly what I said, it was really opportunistic timing, given where credit markets were. I mean, look, the fact that we printed a 3.5% coupon on 30-year debt is pretty good. I think it's probably one of the lowest, if not some - the lowest P&C long-term debt coupon that's been printed out there. So the timing, it was really the key for the markets where yields were at the time. That was really the key that drove all of this. Now as far as what we'll do with that capital, again, we were starting in an excess capital position, we're now in an even stronger capital position, we have flexibility. As I indicated in my remarks, we see some very, very good opportunities right now organically in both the Insurance and Reinsurance space, given the market conditions. So that's part of it. But we're also thinking, as I said in my remarks, about playing this in support of our overall strategy to grow book value, right. So there's different things that we can do over time with this capital.
Michael Zaremski: Okay. Understood. And that would include share buybacks potentially reopening, Juan?
Juan Andrade: It could in the future, right. I mean if you look at our capital management philosophy, our first priority has always been to deploy capital for organic business growth in the market. We see attractive opportunities there. Beyond that excess capital can also be used for other things, share repurchases, pay dividends, et cetera, et cetera. So there's multiple things that we can do there. And that's really my comment about supporting growth in book value over time.
Michael Zaremski: Okay. Great. And last question was a follow-up to Yaron's question about kind of reserve studies. Do you - is there any - do you think that the new management team coming onboard, there might be a change to kind of the reserving philosophy as you guys take kind of a new sets of eyes kind of look at the book, I think - versus one that historically you've thrown up just a little bit of reserve releases. Some of your peers tend to kind of just book a little bit more conservatively. Just curious if you think if there could be any changes there. Thanks.
Juan Andrade: Yeah. Thanks Mike. Look, keep in mind, I think, as Yaron said, I've been the CEO for less than a year at this point in time, right, it's been about 10 months. Mark Kociancic is now joining us. But as I stated earlier, in the response to his question, the fundamental philosophy of recognizing bad news quickly and requiring good news to be proven over a longer period of time really has not changed from that perspective. So I go back to the fact that I'm a fact-based guy. We will look at the information that comes out of our reserve studies and then we will act accordingly.
Michael Zaremski: Thank you.
Juan Andrade: Sure.
Operator: Meyer Shields with KBW. Your line is open.
Meyer Shields: Thanks. First question to Mark, if I can. You mentioned I think that insurance ceding commissions were up and that was helping the expense ratio in that segment. I guess it was a little surprising. My impression is that ceding commissions are generally coming down as one of the aspects of the hard market. I was hoping you could add some color to what's going on there?
Mark Kociancic: Yeah, Brian.
Meyer Shields: Meyer.
Mark Kociancic: Meyer, sorry about that. Yes, the ceding commissions what we're seeing in the Insurance space is an elevated level of ceded premium really due to the business mix of what we have. And so we're ceding a bit more business out in certain lines, which is leading to higher ceding commissions coming in there, but that's more of a business mix situation.
Juan Andrade: Yeah, so it's not so much a change in the percentage for the actual ceding commission, but rather the business mix that's flowing through.
Meyer Shields: Okay. That's very helpful. The second question, I guess, earlier this week, we had one of the Bermuda reinsurers talk about being more conservative in their interpretation of potential catastrophes than vendor models. And I was hoping if you could talk about how Everest sees that.
Juan Andrade: Yeah, thanks, Meyer. This is Juan. Look, I think climate change is a real thing, right. It would be crazy to deny that climate change exists. You know I'm also acutely aware that our industry plays a critical role, frankly, in the economic and social recovery after extreme weather events. And you look at what's been happening, particularly in the Gulf Coast. And frankly, my heart goes out to these people having spent a lot of time in my career working and living down there. The frequency of activity that's hit them in the past quarter is just not good. From the perspective of how we think about it, I think modeling is a big part of it and we certainly have a really world-class modeling capability that looks at everything from sea temperatures to atmospheric saturation to changes in economic valuations, and we look at all of that. However, what I would say is, though, no single computer model is going to be able to predict consistently the long-term impact of climate change. So this is when you have to really come back to the skill set that your underwriters bring and the underwriting judgment that we have. And so from our perspective, that's part of how you have seen some of our PMLs reduce over time, right, the fact that we're looking to grow a diversified book of business to be able to manage that type of volatility even better. And the other thing that I would say is you look at our hedging, right. The fact that we do pretty significant risk transfer to our third-party capital tools like Kilimanjaro, Mt. Logan, et cetera, and that's part of the suite of how we think about all of this. So hopefully, that provides a little bit of context on how we think about it, Meyer.
Meyer Shields: It does. Thanks so much.
Juan Andrade: Thank you.
Operator: Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research. Your line is open. Ryan, your line is open.
Ryan Tunis: Sorry, I was on mute. Sorry about that. Can you hear me, Juan?
Juan Andrade: Yeah, Ryan, I can hear you. Good morning.
Ryan Tunis: Sorry about that. Yeah, good morning. So yeah, you said you've been here 10 months. So you're pretty familiar with Everest now, some management changes. I guess just taking a step back, a broad question. As you think about 2021, what are the main parts of Everest that you think need to get better? And what are you thinking, like, some of the main improvements might be?
Juan Andrade: Yeah, it's a good question. Look, I start with the fact that I think we have a great company and a great culture. And frankly, based on the numbers that you see us continue to report, we're attacking this environment, right. The pricing is there, the execution is there. So I feel pretty good about all of that. We certainly have strengthened the management team with two executives who have global capabilities, who have a lot of strategic strength, and I feel very, very good about that. Look, I think for us, the opportunity is how do you continue to execute in the middle of all of this, right. The context of a pandemic, the context of an economic recession, and the context of a very strong underwriting market. So for me, those are good problems to have, which is how do you continue to take a great franchise and move it forward in that environment and do it successfully.
Ryan Tunis: That's helpful. And then my follow-up, I guess, just for John Doucette. The $300 million of cats seems like a lot less than maybe what Everest might have had in past years. I don't know if that's how you're thinking about it or not. But I'm just curious if - what's your observation on cat experience this third quarter versus maybe what you would have had in a similar type of cat year in 2018 or 2019? How does that reflect some of the changes you made in the book?
John Doucette: Yeah, thanks, Ryan. Good morning. And - so a couple of things. So as we've talked about on prior earnings calls, you break it into a couple of parts, you break it into wildfire. So we had talked about how we didn't think the industry was charging enough what we thought was required for the elevated risk for the wildfires. And so we pushed rates, terms, conditions and irrespective of getting a lot of improvements. We also decided, made a conscious decision to cut our wild - our gross wildfire exposure. And then on the - on some of the property and the wind-exposed areas, yes, we've been seeing a lot of rate, but we also talked about a view of an elevated risk, a combination of the climate change that Juan talked about before, but also seeing social inflation, things like Assignment of Benefits, and how that impacts things. And so, that along with exposure growth, and just frankly, our increased cost of capital, because our ability to deploy capital profitably into many other lines of business, and we expect to be doing that going into 1-1. As we see improving rates terms and conditions, our cost to deploy property ag has continued to go up, cat capacity. So that certainly was helpful in terms of our market share and absolute dollars of loss. But, frankly, that wasn't an accident, this was all intentional.
Ryan Tunis: Thank you.
Operator: Josh Shanker with Bank of America, your line is open.
Joshua Shanker: Yeah, good morning, everybody.
Juan Andrade: Good morning, Josh.
Joshua Shanker: I wanted to talk a little bit in relation to Meyer's question about ceding commissions, but on the Reinsurance side. Obviously, it's a very good quarter in terms of the commission expense ratio, the best since 3Q 2017. I've been looking at the mix of business. It seems like quota share casualty went down, and it doesn't seem like there was a lot of ceding commissions from the events. Maybe you can walk through that number a little bit and give us some thoughts on how it might compare with where it might be in 2021.
Juan Andrade: Yeah, so John Doucette, maybe you can provide some color on that?
John Doucette: Yeah. Thank you. Good question. So I mean part of it is mix of business, but part of it also, I think, there was also a commutation we had mentioned a couple of quarters ago that had to do with prior year that kind of had an offset between what was on the commission side and the loss reserve. So it was kind of a push financially, but it did move some of the numbers around. And I think that's part of what you're seeing. So - and then in terms of what we would expect going forward? We would encourage you to look at the year-to-date numbers for what the commission ratio as a better indicator than any one quarter.
Joshua Shanker: Okay. And then, if we're thinking about business mix going forward, orientation for 2021 between XOL versus pro rata, between property versus casualty, do you have any preview on how you think you might orient the book coming next year?
John Doucette: Yeah, it's a great question. We spend a lot of time thinking about that, strategizing about it with our underwriters all over the world. So look, I mean the bottom line is we're pretty bullish on many opportunities across many lines of business going into 1-1. And there's a variety of reasons for that. We're seeing the flight to quality and a flight back to the traditional model, which we think will greatly benefit us across many lines. Our global clients are continuing to want to buy more and buy more from people like Everest. So that's a significant opportunity. And then, whether it's property or casualty or specialty, marine and aviation, political risk, trade, credit or surety, I mean we have underwriting expertise in all of these lines of business all over the world. And so, we are ready, we get the team. We have the capital as one. And Mark talked about. We have the franchise, the distribution. And we're really leaning forward. And then, in terms of where it will be, we see opportunities in all of those. We expect the casualty market, partially because the reinsurance panels, the security requirements on reinsurance panels for our long-tail business, casualty professional, that's hard for a lot of people to get access to that business. So we have the distribution and the relationships and, again, the underwriting expertise. So we expect to see a strong 2021 when it comes to the long-tail. But, of course, we're looking at the most dislocated property retro market we've seen in 15, 20 years. And so, again, we'll look to deploy capacity and capital. And then, we spend a lot of time, and we've talked about this before, kind of dynamic capital allocation, not just between short-tail, long-tail, but then within each of the respective areas; what's the best territory, what's the best product, structure that we want to deploy. And so, it's hard to know how that will all settle out. But rest assured, we are bullish about the opportunity presented to us and our ability to execute it going into 1-1.
Joshua Shanker: Thank you very much for the answers
John Doucette: You are welcome.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn it back over to the Everest team for final remarks.
Juan Andrade: Thank you. And thank you for your time today. I think as you've heard from us, Everest is well positioned for this market. We have the financial strength. We have a preferred market presence. We have a diversified global platform. We're very nimble. So we can go either way and take advantage of the opportunities. We have a deep distribution set of relationships. We have great people. And we have a great culture. So we do feel pretty good about the market environment and the situation that Everest is positioned on to capture. Thank you for your time today and we look forward to updating you at the next quarter.
Operator: This concludes today's earnings call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-08-09 10:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Everest Re Group Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. And now at this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jon Levenson. Please go ahead, sir.
Jon Levenson: Thank you, Cody, and welcome to the Everest Re Group Limited 2020 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. The Everest executives leading today's call are Juan Andrade, President and Chief Executive Officer; Craig Howie, EVP and Chief Financial Officer; John Doucette, EVP and President and CEO of the Reinsurance Division. We're also joined by other members of the Everest management team. Before we begin, I will preface the comments on today's call by noting that Everest SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. Management comments regarding estimates, projections and similar are subject to the risks, uncertainties and assumptions as noted in these filings. Management may also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These items are reconciled in our earnings release and financial supplements. With that, I turn the call over to Juan Andrade.
Juan Andrade: Thank you, Jon. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. The world is struggling with the greatest public health threat in the last century, which has resulted in economic and great personal suffering. At the same time, individuals are rightly calling for positive social change and seeking an end to racism and inequality. At Everest, we stand together with our colleagues around the world against racism and discrimination. We have an unwavering commitment to supporting diversity, equity and inclusion in our workplace. In the context of this public health, economic and social environment, Everest is serving our customers and providing the strength and stability that they have come to rely on for almost 5 decades. Our business is running smoothly. We are performing well, and our people continue to demonstrate the passion and resilience that differentiates Everest. The health and safety of our employees and our customers are paramount. I am very proud of our team and very thankful for their hard work and perseverance in delivering the solid results we're reporting today for the second quarter and for the first half of 2020. Our ability to leverage our capital position, our global platform and our success in executing against our objectives, even under adverse conditions, positions us very well for continued profitable growth. We have strong and broad-based forward momentum across both our Reinsurance and Insurance divisions. Our growth stems from a combination of new business opportunities, resulting from our strong financial ratings, deep distribution and diverse portfolio as well as increased rate levels and high retention rates. We sequentially improved our underwriting profitability in the second quarter, and we continue to demonstrate strong structural expense management discipline. Our industry-leading expense ratio continues to give us operating flexibility. We also reported significantly improved net income compared to the first quarter as we benefited from the upswing in the capital markets during the second quarter. And our shareholders' equity grew to a record $9.3 billion as of June 30. Our book value per share was $232.32, up 8% from the first quarter of 2020 and up 4% compared to year-end 2019. Our excess capital position remains a source of strength, as evidenced by A+ financial strength ratings recently affirmed with stable outlooks. Everest has the capital to play offense in this market. If we were to identify a need for additional capital, our low debt ratio gives us high degree of flexibility. Our capital position, our focus on execution, our people and our emphasis on solving problems for our customers keep us well positioned to pursue all business opportunities that meet our underwriting appetite. Before I specifically address our second quarter results, let me share how we're driving the company forward. Our focus is on sustainably growing a balanced and diversified insurance and reinsurance portfolio by line of business and geography through the relentless execution of our strategies to deliver consistent underwriting profitability. We are nimble. We are opportunistic. We are capturing current market conditions that meet our return requirements. On the revenue side, this is about creating greater optionality and diversification across our entire business. With a broad mix of products, customer segments, distribution and selective local presence, we're capitalizing on growth opportunities around the world and balancing the highs and lows of our industry and economic cycles. This is why having vibrant reinsurance and insurance businesses is a key element of our strategy. The growth of the Insurance division, with gross written premiums now exceeding $3 billion on a trailing 12-month basis with sustained attritional profitability, is vital to greater balance in the organization. But this growth is not at the expense of our Reinsurance division. Today, we are a top 10 global reinsurer, a growing specialty insurer, and we are building on these positions in this market. As a group, we are playing offense to improve and further solidify our position with the best mix of talent, product and services. We are enhancing and sharpening the strategy and tightening the execution and operating rhythms. We are deploying our sizable balance sheet and diverse capital base to expand our relevance in our chosen markets. On the margin side, the focus is on underwriting profit. We are maintaining and enhancing our underwriting results with active portfolio management, strong risk governance and excellent analytics. We are reducing exposure in areas not meeting the right risk-return profile, and we're dynamically deploying that capital to areas that do. Our strategic utilization of alternative capital will enable us to further diversify the portfolio. We are focused on claims management to deliver consistently accurate outcomes with superior service. We are maintaining our expense leadership through more efficient and scalable operating models enabled by the latest technology, including artificial intelligence and natural language processing tools. On investments, we continue to generate strong cash flows that are invested in conservative, high credit quality portfolios. We remain well diversified. All of this will deliver growth in earnings over time, resulting in book value per share growth. Turning to the second quarter of 2020. We demonstrated continued momentum across the group with 11% growth in gross written premiums, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. The growth was broad-based across both our reinsurance and insurance businesses with gross written premium growth of 11% and 10%, respectively, also excluding the impact of foreign exchange. We continue to benefit from improved insurance and reinsurance market conditions during the quarter, which I will discuss in a moment. Excluding catastrophes and the pandemic impacts, our IBNR loss provision and a small amount of associated credit impacts, our attritional combined ratios for the group at 88.5% and each of our segments, Reinsurance at 86.7% and Insurance at 93.7%, are reflective of the strong underwriting performance across the group and the earnings generating power of this franchise. Underwriting profitability remains at the core of everything we do. On a 6-month year-to-date basis, Everest has grown 15% and delivered an 89.1% attritional combined ratio, excluding pandemic impacts. Our Reinsurance segment had strong growth for the quarter. We continued to successfully execute our strategies to underwrite a high-performing book of business with higher economic returns at the important April 1, June 1 and July 1 renewals. We continue to see excellent reinsurance opportunities in several areas such as facultative risk, property and in certain territories including the U.S., Canada, Latin America and Asia. This environment gives us the opportunity to better shape our book toward deals with better terms and pricing and walk away from others that do not meet our pricing hurdles. Traditional capital from highly rated carriers like Everest has become more relevant, and supply is tight, particularly given the more limited availability of alternative capital. We see this favorable pricing environment continuing for the foreseeable future, even with pandemic-related economic headwinds. Reinsurance profitability was also strong for the division, with a 95.3% combined ratio, including COVID impacts, and an 86.7% excluding the COVID impact. John Doucette will provide additional details on market conditions. Our Insurance segment's growth remained strong for the quarter at 10% and with improvement in underlying performance. The attritional combined ratio, excluding the pandemic impacts, improved to 93.7% for the quarter compared to a 96% in the second quarter of 2019. We are strategically managing the insurance portfolio to build a more diversified business and steer our mix towards product lines that we expect to earn higher margins long term. The maturation of several new product lines launched over the last several years as well as our wide market footprint give us access to significant opportunities. For the quarter, the main insurance growth drivers were: strong and widespread rate momentum excluding workers' comp of plus 18%, and including workers' compensation of over plus 12%. This is the highest overall rate change we have seen in a long time. Insurance written rate also continues to exceed loss trend across our core P&C lines of business. We also saw continued strength in the excess and surplus line space. We had strong renewal retention in both our retail and E&S businesses. But this growth is offset by pandemic-related headwinds and lines heavily impacted by lower payrolls and lower business activity. Turning to investments. Net investment income decreased to $38 million for the second quarter. The drop was attributable to negative returns from our limited partnerships, which, as we mentioned in our first quarter call, report on a 1 quarter lag. Given the lag, this drop reflects the market turmoil, which occurred in March. The second quarter recovery in the public markets provides a basis for expecting an improvement in limited partnerships, which will be reported in the third quarter. The amount of the recovery is difficult to predict given the ongoing uncertainty caused by the pandemic. Regarding COVID-19 impacts, as per our July 23 announcement, we have taken $160 million loss provision in the second quarter made up substantially of IBNR. The majority of this loss provision, $130 million, was for the reinsurance business. These losses relate to event cancellation or postponement, business interruption and workers' compensation. We have also increased our IBNR for allocated loss adjustment expenses based on anticipated cost to investigate and defend some portion of claims. We are taking a measured approach to our loss estimation process that is based on credible and supportable information. This is an ongoing event and very different than a natural catastrophe. We're continuously monitoring this evolving situation and recognizing potential exposure based on the most up-to-date information available. Our second quarter estimate was based on a refreshed analysis updated with the latest information from our clients. While our analysis continues to include all aspects of our global portfolio, our estimate does not take into account legal, regulatory or legislative intervention that could retroactively mandate or expand coverage provisions. Of the $30 million loss provision for the second quarter in our specialty insurance business, the majority was from event cancellation and postponement policies as the nature and duration of the pandemic has increased the likelihood of cancellations into early 2021. A smaller portion of the insurance loss provision was predominantly loss adjustment expenses for business interruption policies. As stated last quarter, our property policies have unambiguous policy language that requires direct physical loss for business interruption coverage to be triggered. Additionally, the majority of the property policies in force contain a virus exclusion. Only a very small number of policies have endorsed sublimits that would offer BI coverage for a notifiable human disease. These exposures have already been recognized as part of the overall IBNR estimate. Workers' compensation represents the smallest portion of the insurance provision in the quarter. We have refreshed our analysis based on the industry profile for businesses which have now been deemed essential by many states. However, this is not a significant amount. Our portfolio has no known exposure to first responders and very minimal exposure to frontline health care workers. With regard to the reinsurance loss provision, we have updated our analysis based on information from cedents and brokers. It is important to reiterate that as a reinsurer, our analysis will be very fact specific to each situation and each contract. We have also updated our review of our mortgage reinsurance contracts. Based on our current view of the macroeconomic situation, updated client information and our internal modeling, we remain comfortable with our exposure and with our loss reserves. We will continue evaluating this business as the economic situation unfolds. In summary, Everest continues to gain traction and forward momentum despite the macroeconomic uncertainty and the rapidly changing external environment. We're operating smoothly with the health and safety of our employees and their families top of mind. I am optimistic about our future. We have a talented team, a global platform and a strong capital position, which allows us to capture the improving opportunities in front of us. Lastly, I want to welcome Mike Karmilowicz to the call today. As you saw in our recent announcement, I am pleased to introduce Mike as the new CEO of our Insurance division. Mike's promotion is an acknowledgment of the key role he played in the growth of the insurance business over the past several years and provides continuity so Everest can execute on our winning strategy. He will be available to answer your questions today. Now let me turn it over to Craig to provide additional details on the financials.
Craig Howie: Thank you, Juan, and good morning, everyone. Everest delivered another solid quarter of financial results. For the second quarter of 2020, Everest reported net income of $191 million. This compares to net income of $17 million in the first quarter of 2020 and $333 million for the second quarter of 2019. On a year-to-date basis, net income was $207 million compared to $687 million for the first half of 2019. Net income included $22 million of net after-tax realized capital losses compared to $100 million of capital gains in the first half of 2019. These results were driven by a strong underwriting performance across the group, stable investment income from fixed maturities and low catastrophe losses, partially offset by a COVID-19 pandemic loss estimate of $310 million and negative limited partnership investment returns. The overall underwriting gain for the group was $51 million for the second quarter and $80 million for the first half compared to an underwriting gain of $393 million in the first half of last year. The company continues to grow premium in 2020. Year-to-date gross written premium was $4.9 billion, up $646 million or 15% compared to the first 6 months of 2019. This reflects growth in both segments, with Insurance up 20% and Reinsurance up 13% compared to last year. In the second quarter of 2020, the company reported $15 million of catastrophe losses related to the civil unrest in the U.S. Although there were a number of loss events in the quarter, notably U.S. storm events, none of these events breached our $10 million catastrophe threshold, and as such, are included in our attritional loss estimates. On a year-to-date basis, the results reflected catastrophe losses of $45 million compared to $55 million during the first half of 2019. The group combined ratio was 98.1% through the first 6 months compared to 95.5% for the full year of 2019. Excluding the catastrophe losses and the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, the comparable combined ratios were 89.1% through the first 6 months of 2020 and 88.4% for the full year of 2019, mostly attributable to business mix changes that impact the attritional loss ratio. Excluding the pandemic loss estimate, the group attritional loss ratio was 16.7%, up from 16.2% for the full year 2019, primarily due to the continued change in reinsurance business mix. For the Reinsurance segment, the attritional loss ratio, excluding the pandemic loss estimate, was 59.0%, up from 58.2% for the full year 2019. This increase was related to the continued shift toward more pro rata business, which requires a higher loss pick, but allows us to benefit directly from the firming primary market. Pro rata premium is less volatile than excess premium, and we will see the benefit earn into our results as we let the loss pick season over time. For the Insurance segment, the attritional loss ratio, excluding the impacts from the pandemic, was 65.4%, down compared to 66.0% for the full year 2019. Our U.S. franchise, which makes up the majority of our global insurance business, continues to run an attritional combined ratio in the low 90s, excluding the pandemic loss estimate. The group commission ratio of 22.4% was down compared to the prior year due to the business mix and more ceding commission received in the Insurance segment. Group expense ratio remains low at 5.8% in the second quarter and 6.1% for the first half of 2020, in line with our expectations. During the second quarter, we saw reduced expenses for new hires, travel, entertainment and conferences. On loss reserves, we completed several reserve studies during the quarter related to some smaller classes of business. The overall indications were not material enough to warrant any action on these studies during the second quarter. For investments, pretax investment income was $186 million year-to-date on our $21.6 billion investment portfolio. As Juan mentioned in his remarks, investment income in the second quarter was impacted by $88 million of limited partnership losses. The fixed income portfolio remained stable and produced $272 million of investment income year-to-date compared to $253 million for the same period last year. The pretax yield to maturity on the investment portfolio was 3.4%, stable compared to 3.4% one year ago. We've been able to maintain a consistent yield to maturity without a dramatic shift in the overall investment portfolio. We expect to maintain our asset allocation and a conservative, well diversified, high credit quality bond portfolio with conservative duration. For our investment-grade portfolio, the new money rate was 2.7% for the quarter. Other income and expense included $24 million of foreign exchange losses during the first 6 months of 2020. On income taxes, the year-to-date tax benefit of $14 million included a $31 million tax benefit related to the CARES Act that we reported in the first quarter. Excluding this benefit, the effective tax rate on operating income was 11%, in line with our expected tax rate for the full year. Positive cash flow continues with record operating cash flow of $1.1 billion for the first half of 2020 compared to $854 million in 2019. This increase reflects our growth in premiums and a lower level of catastrophe losses in 2020 compared to 2019. Shareholders' equity for the group was $9.3 billion at the end of the second quarter, a new record for Everest, up from $9.1 billion at year-end 2019. The increase in shareholders' equity in the first half of 2020 is primarily attributable to the $207 million of net income and a significant recovery in the fair value of the investment portfolio. A mark-to-market impact on the fixed income assets improved from an unrealized loss of $248 million in the first quarter to an unrealized gain of $545 million in the second quarter of 2020. Everest continues to maintain a very strong capital position, with industry low debt leverage and high liquidity in our investment portfolio. Thank you. And now John Doucette will provide a review of the Reinsurance operations.
John Doucette: Thank you, Craig. Good morning. Having now finished our June and July renewals, we are increasingly optimistic about the reinsurance market and our position as a global provider of reinsurance solutions. The flight to quality by reinsurance buyers continues. And highly rated reinsurers like Everest, with solid financial strength and global underwriting capabilities, will do well in this market. The expanded opportunity set allowed us to improve our portfolio across virtually all geographies and classes of business. As Juan stated earlier, Everest's market positioning, combined with healthier market conditions, led to strong growth in gross written premiums for this quarter and for the first half of this year. For net written premium, the growth was even higher at 15% for the second quarter as we retain more business given our capital strength, the improved underwriting environment and the shifting economics of retrocession purchases. Overall, we have a larger and more profitable portfolio than we did last year. By many measures of risk and return, the expected performance of writings this year is improved versus the expected performance of the last underwriting year. Our portfolio's growth has been broad-based with significant contributions from our global facultative operations, which are seeing large increases in submission activity and strong pricing trends. Encouragingly, rates are increasing strongly even in markets with sufficient capacity. In terms of property cat, market conditions overall remained strong, particularly in peak zones and recently loss-affected areas. Cat renewals in Florida and the U.S. generally experienced double-digit rate increases with higher increases on loss-affected business, leading to higher expected margins and profits. In our Florida cat book, we wrote more premium versus last year, but with less exposed limit. As a result of our underwriting execution and rate increases, our expected dollar margin for Florida is meaningfully higher. We also refocused our capacity on fewer core clients. Regarding our global property portfolio, we executed our plan. Expected profits grew considerably as we retained more economics due to a smaller outwards retro spend. However, we maintained hedging capacity through Mt. Logan in our catastrophe bonds. Across our peak cat exposures, our net PMLs increased midyear relative to January's net PMLs, reflecting our plan to capture this market's improved profitability. The net PML increases are predominantly further in the tale of the distribution. Competition from ILS capacity was less pronounced during the midyear renewals due to investor frustration from multiple bad industry cat loss years, adverse development and trapped capital by several ILS managers. The retro market is favorable for sellers. And as a net seller of retro, we captured strong double-digit rate increases. And demand from recurring retro buyers remains robust. We also deployed more capacity in property pro rata business with original rate improvement and tighter occurrence caps. The well-priced cat exposure of this class contributed somewhat to the increased PML. The casualty reinsurance markets are also improving directly from increased excess rates or indirectly as original business rates benefit pro rata deals. Excess casualty rate increases generally range from single digits to well into double digits, varying by ceding and product. Casualty ceding commissions improved slightly. While the casualty market improved, we still walked away from some large renewals priced below our return requirements. Nevertheless, we have several compelling opportunities to partner with our global clients in several classes of business, either through new deals brought to the market or increased shares on improved renewals. In Australia and Asia, market firming continued throughout the year with earlier renewal rates increasing less than later renewal rates. For these midyear renewals, more business met our return hurdles, and we wrote more premium accordingly. Our long-term relationships in Asia cultivated over the last 30-plus years allowed us to capture better opportunities and in times like these, those situations become more pronounced. Likewise, quality underwriting opportunities presented themselves in Canada as rate increases were achieved across several different lines of business in both fac and treaty. Therefore, we have been increasing our shares on several Canadian programs. Finally, some comments on our mortgage book. We remain comfortable with our exposure, loss picks and loss reserves on our mortgage writings. The majority of our in-force mortgage business will not be impaired by the pandemic unless housing fundamentals and post-economic recovery, unemployment deteriorate significantly. This is in part because of our generally high attachment points and our conservative underwriting and pricing of mortgage. Also, unlike the primary mortgage insurers, we, as a reinsurer, can and do book significant IBNR reserves. In summary, disruptions facing our industry and our personal lives create uncertainty around the future of many businesses and economic sectors. As a leading provider of reinsurance solutions, we maintain a strong position to absorb volatility and diversify that uncertainty for our clients with our robust balance sheet, global presence, and capital resources, while generating solid returns for our shareholders. Thank you. And now I will turn it back over to Juan.
Juan Andrade: Thanks, John. I feel good about the direction of the insurance and the reinsurance market, and I am pleased with our execution and our momentum. We have grown our premium by 15% in the first 6 months of 2020. Our first priority is to profitably deploy our capital for organic business growth in this hardening market environment. We continue to find ways to put our capital to work, and we see strong opportunities ahead. Now let me turn it over to Jon Levenson to open it up for your questions.
Jon Levenson: Great. Thanks, Juan. Cody, I see we have a number of participants in queue. Can you please open the Q&A?
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And we'll first take our question from Mike Zaremski with Crédit Suisse.
Michael Zaremski: First question. I appreciate all the color regarding the COVID losses that were booked. Curious, we get a lot of questions from investors about how to think about the COVID impact going forward. And I know it's complex, given a lot of your losses are coming through the Reinsurance division. But in regards to your conversations with cedents, do you - are some of them thinking that there's likely to be more losses trickling in during the back half of the year as this very complex situation is further assessed? Or some insurers, I think, mostly primary issuers are trying to say that they think they kind of have most of their loss picks on booked, unless things get materially worse regarding COVID?
Juan Andrade: Yes, Mike, this is Juan Andrade. Look, I think we have a very solid estimate based on what we know today. We have a good process that has underlined the estimates really from the beginning of this crisis, and we certainly talked about it in the last call. All that being said, this event is still underway, right? The crisis is still ongoing. And much of this is going to be determined by the length of this crisis, as well as by any actions that are taken by governments along the way. So I think in that sense, there is some uncertainty as to where the losses, particularly on the reinsurance side, may go as cedents are still trying to grapple with their own numbers and essentially come up to a good estimate. But again, I would say, from my perspective, we do have a solid estimate based on what we know. And that certainly has been the approach and the perspective that we have taken from the very beginning. And as we have more updated information, we will be updating that as well.
Michael Zaremski: Okay. Great. My last follow-up question is regarding your outlier low leverage level. And I think we appreciate that you guys are playing offense. Clearly, you can see it. PMLs came up a little bit, but still kind of well below historical levels. You're seeing certain participants in the industry either raise debt, equity, new startups. So has your thought process changed in terms of the opportunity cost of holding a lot of excess capital? Is it changing or is it kind of plan A is still is just let's keep kind of trying to grow the top line in excess of our ROE, less the dividend and we'll just kind of use up our excess over the coming 3, 5 years that way?
Juan Andrade: Yes. So let me start, and then I would ask Craig Howie to jump in as well. Mike, what I would say is our capital management philosophy hasn't changed. I start out with the fact that we have more than ample capital to deal and face off with the opportunities that are in this market today. And I think you see it from our numbers, right, that we've been very forward-leaning and being able to continue to grow in this environment. We also have a very low debt leverage, right? So as I mentioned in my remarks, to the extent that we see any opportunities that are relevant for us, that are accretive for us, at that point in time, we have the flexibility to increase our capital. But as I sit here today, look, I feel very good about our capital position. We also have over $13 billion in deployable capacity, right? When you think about our policyholder surplus plus what we hold in our bonds, what we hold in Mt. Logan, et cetera, et cetera, we have plenty of capacity to work with in this market. So from that perspective, our philosophy continues to deploy capital into this market, particularly given the favorable conditions that we're seeing right now. But Craig, is there anything you would add?
Craig Howie: Juan, I think you covered it. I do think that, just to state the obvious, that if we did want to build our balance sheet, we have sufficient low leverage and certainly one of the lowest debt leverages in the industry to be able to do so.
Michael Zaremski: And so would you - if you had to put more capital to work, are you leaning more towards reinsurance in the near term or primary insurance to deploy that - the access?
Juan Andrade: Yes. It's a great question. Fortunately, we're in a pretty good position, right, in the sense that you don't have to choose which of your children you like most. We see opportunities on both sides, right? And so I think as I articulated and John Doucette had articulated, we're seeing some really good opportunities on the facultative risk side, some very good opportunities in property as well. All of that being said, you also heard from John that we're being very disciplined. So if things do not meet our economic return criteria, we will walk away from it just like what we did at some of the recent renewals. But we see plenty of opportunity to deploy capital there. The same thing in insurance. You saw the growth rate there. We see great opportunities in property, both wholesale and retail. We see very good opportunities in excess casualty. We see very good opportunities in D&O. So right now, because of our capital base, we are looking at where we can play offense in this market and deploying our capital that way, so we can grow and essentially take advantage of the favorable conditions.
Operator: We'll now take our next question from Josh Shanker with Bank of America.
Joshua Shanker: So I saw you took the PMLs up, of course, and following on what Mike was saying. Is there any change in the cat load guidance? And if we think about next year, if things go the way you want them to go, where would you ideally want to be setting your PML and your cat load guidance? What is a healthy market and a healthy PML in an attractive market for cat protection?
Juan Andrade: Yes. So Josh, this is Juan. So for this year, there is no change in our cat load from that perspective. But let me ask John Doucette to speak to the PMLs.
John Doucette: Yes. Thanks, Juan. Thanks, Josh, for the question. So as I mentioned in the script, we have seen opportunities. And as we put in the investor presentation, the PMLs are up now, Southeast wind is 7% of equity, up from 5.7%. And really, it's going to be a function of the - of what we see in the market. We expect - we like Florida, but we were disciplined. We did shed some clients and nonperforming accounts that didn't meet our return thresholds. And that was true at July 1 as well, and we expect it to be true at 1/1. So we do expect to see momentum continuing into 1/1 and beyond. We think it's a great market to be a seller of retro. We are a top 2 seller of retro among rated reinsurers. And as Juan alluded to, we have the capital across the Kilimanjaro bonds, Logan and, of course, our common equity and debt - have the capital and flexibility to write the book that we see that's in front of us and what the market gives to us. But we do expect to see robust demand in 1/1 and going forward.
Joshua Shanker: Okay. And then a little education in casualty pro rata risk. If I may cede and I have a pool of risk that I'm raising prices on and I think improving margins on. When I negotiate a treaty with a reinsurer to protect me from some of that business, because maybe I need balance sheet protection or let's just say balance sheet is just not big enough. I'm going to say, look, our business is going to be more profitable next year, so we're going to raise the ceding commissions on you. To what extent, I mean, is there a ceiling on how much profitability you can receive in a rising rate environment for risk if it's sort of tempered by the ceding commissions being charged for improving profitability on that same risk?
John Doucette: Yes. That's a great question. And I think first principles. That's why we're agnostic to the form that we take in reinsurance risk, whether that's casualty, property, specialty and mortgage. We look at it across - we look at it as to how we want to deploy capital, and that will vary by product. And likewise, our clients will look to see whether they want to do things on a proportional basis, an excess basis, excess or loss per risk basis. And that varies. Some of them will change that over time. But that's why in my statement, in my comments, I mentioned that the casualty market we're seeing improving, but we're seeing a little bit of improvement in ceding commissions given the market that we're in. But we are seeing a lot more of the benefit coming through the original, the primary rates on the insurance operation. So - and then also, I think it's - we need to remember that there are a whole lot of clients out there that write their business using different capital levels. And some have capital - a lot of capital support that, that gives them flexibility, whether they do something potentially on a pro rata basis or an excess basis. But then a lot of our clients around the world, again, they don't have a lot of capital. And so sometimes they need to de-lever their premium. And so they do need to buy proportional treaties. And that's in the U.S., that's international, that's in Lloyd's, where it will vary, again, by line of business. And that gives us the opportunity by having the ability to dynamically allocate capital by line, by territory and by product, excess loss or pro rata, it gives us the best chance to capture what we see as the opportunity in front of us profitably.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs.
Yaron Kinar: I guess first question. I do want to go back to the capital raise question. It sounds like the environment is a very constructive one, and you see it probably with legs going into '21. So does the decision to not raise capital today - I'm just trying to understand how that fits in to this construct. Do you not see sufficient opportunities to deploy capital that you would raise? Is the market not attractive enough? I guess at what point - what would make you want to raise capital that you're not seeing today?
Juan Andrade: Sure, Yaron. So thank you for the question. This is Juan. Look, so number one, I would start with the fact that for us, this is a dynamic process, right? We're always sort of assessing our capital, our needs, the environment, that sort of thing. So it's not a fixed point in time. It's a very dynamic discussion that we have within the company. We find the current opportunities to be quite attractive. And hopefully, you saw that from, frankly, the bullish nature of my comments and those of John Doucette on this call. I think you see that from the growth rates and how we're managing to execute on the opportunities that we see in this market. But our position right now is, look, I mean, where we sit with the capital that we have right now, we feel that we have more than enough to be on offense in this marketplace. Unlike others who have had to raise capital for defensive purposes, we're not in that situation, right? We're actually in a good place right now. Now I did say in my remarks that this environment is very fluid. And if we identify opportunities that we see that are accretive to our bottom line, then we certainly have the flexibility to be able to do that. Again, I would have like Craig to see if he's got any additional thoughts on that.
Craig Howie: Yes, Juan, I agree. If you're going to raise capital, it should be accretive. And certainly, timing comes into play as well. If you're raising equity capital, certainly, earlier in the year was a good time to do it instead of waiting toward election times. But we didn't need to raise equity capital. We didn't need to build scale. We already have the scale. We're not trying to fund M&A at this point in time, and we're not trying to replace retro coverage at this point in time. So certainly, as the market changes, we still have flexibility, especially with respect to our debt leverage.
Yaron Kinar: Okay. And my second question, with regards to Reinsurance COVID losses, can you maybe explain what the difference is between being fact-specific to each situation in each contract as opposed to following the fortune? Like what's the distinction that you're making?
Juan Andrade: Yes, Yaron, happy to talk about that. Look, every contract is going to be different, right? I think unlike a natural catastrophe, there's going to be hours clauses, there's going to be bench definitions, there's going to be different attachment points, et cetera. And so that's really when we say that, that's what we mean, is that this is not a panacea, and we're going to look at each contract by its nature, by its merits, by its own facts. And then we will make claims adjudication decisions based on that.
Yaron Kinar: And that's not the same as following the fortune?
Juan Andrade: Well, I think following the fortunes would imply that essentially, any loss that you're seeing to report as being a COVID loss would be automatically accepted. And essentially, what I'm saying - what we're saying as a company is it's very fact specific, and that will be put against the contractual requirements and wording in each of our contracts.
Operator: We'll then move on to our next question from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.
Elyse Greenspan: Sorry, I also have a question to follow-up on the capital side of things. Is there a way that you can tell us like, I know you pointed to, right, that you have your own common equity, Logan as well as Kilimanjaro, that help support increased writing, cedings into what seems like a really strong market in 2021? But can you give us a sense on your current capital base, right, assuming on more increased deleverage, which sounds like you're holding off on that for the time being? How much growth could Everest absorb on its own capital base today in 2021?
Juan Andrade: Sure. I would ask Craig Howie to answer that.
Craig Howie: Well, Elyse, it depends on which capital measure you're looking at. And right now, we feel as though we can grow both sides of our book, both reinsurance and insurance, with the capital base that we have today. And that even goes into looking forward to 1/1 renewals on a reinsurance basis. So that's why we feel as though given the market and given where we are today, that we have enough capital to not miss out on any opportunities in the current market conditions.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. That's helpful. And then my second question, on the leverage side, obviously, you guys have pointed out, you're underlevered relative to your peers. Is there a certain internal mark that you guys are viewing to go to? And then I guess, in that answer, how high would the rating agencies let you take your leverage? And can you also provide with an updated AUM for Logan? I'm not sure if you guys provided that earlier.
Juan Andrade: Craig?
Craig Howie: Yes. So Elyse, with respect to our leverage, certainly, from a rating agency perspective, what they're doing currently right now is allowing people to increase their current leverage. As you know, we're closer to 6%. We could have easily grown that capital to 20% leverage without any question or concern at all. Most of our peers are in the 20% and upwards of 30% range, as you well know. So from that standpoint, we have plenty of room to grow and expand that leverage. As far as the Logan AUM question, our Logan AUM was - we were able to grow the AUM slightly this quarter, but it is down from year-end. We're at about $800 million.
Operator: We'll now take our next question from Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research.
Ryan Tunis: So I'm actually interested in John Doucette's perspective, because I would think, look - John, looking at Slide 15, if that slide would be driving you nuts, because you've been here - you've been at Everest for years. And in '15, '16, '17, '18, the PML was double digits and pricing was a lot worse. And common sense says, if you want your PMLs to be better or higher when pricing is better and now, they're only at 7%. So I guess the question is like, what's the lesson here? Was it too high back again? Or are you more in the camp of I'm chomping at the bit to deploy more capital at this moment because this is when you really want to be quite a bit higher in terms of PMLs?
John Doucette: Yes. Ryan, thanks for the question. So a couple of things. So what we've been saying for a while is that we want to - we're not just a one-trick pony within property. And if you rewind the tape, property - our view, the property was more attractive on a relative basis than some other lines, and you talked about being more bearish on casualty than some of our competitors. So what we've seen, a couple of things. We have seen property - improvement in property prices. We've also seen improvement in casualty. As you know, we've been growing out our mortgage book substantially. We're seeing nice increases and opportunities in specialty lines business. And so we're deploying more capacity along the way there. And really, I think what we're trying to do is capture what we see as the opportunity in front of us. We've also talked about on prior calls kind of an elevated risk that we've seen in a social - when you think about social inflation and things in Florida tied to like assignment of benefits and climate change and other risks that also have caused us to make sure that we're deploying what we view as the right amount of capacity fill combination. And so that elevated the return requirements that we needed to deploy increased capacity. And again, our view as to where are we head into 1/1, we expect to see a robust January 1, particularly in peak zone cat and retro. And we'll deploy capacity accordingly. So we'll do it, but we'll also be - we'll do it based on what the market terms and conditions are, what the clients' demands are, but we'll also be looking across all lines of business and territories to really build the best book we can.
Ryan Tunis: And then just one follow-up for Juan on the insurance side. You said in the press release that pricing is exceeding loss trend. We're seeing modest improvement of the underlying combined ratio in that business. It's probably not arithmetically what you think it would be, given the level of rate we're getting. So I guess, how would you describe, I guess, the cadence and the pace of margin improvement we're seeing in insurance relative to the amount of rate.
Juan Andrade: Thanks, Ryan. Look, what I would say is we are definitely seeing loss trend being essentially below our written price change, right? So we're seeing a lot more rate right now ahead of trend. And that's a good thing. That being said though, we are also keeping our loss picks up and conservative given the environment in all of this, right? So while you're seeing rate ahead of loss trend, and frankly, you're seeing some frequency benefit on some lines of business, at this point in time, we think it's just prudent to maintain the loss picks where they are. And so over time, you will see that margin improvement. And so that's basically how we're looking at that.
Operator: We'll move on to our next question from Meyer Shields with KBW.
Meyer Shields: I want to start with Juan, I guess, basic question. I know it's way too early to have an estimate for losses from the Beirut explosion. But how should we think about that impacting various insurance and reinsurance markets?
Juan Andrade: I'm sorry, Meyer. I didn't hear the first part of your question.
Meyer Shields: I'm trying to get a sense in terms of directionally. When you got something like the Beirut explosion, obviously, far too early for any estimate of losses, but should we think of this as an insurance event, a reinsurance event?
Juan Andrade: Got it. So if we're looking at Beirut specifically, I think, as you pointed out, look, it's probably too early to tell. We are a global company, and I would expect that we will have some loss out of that. I would expect the loss, if it comes, it will be more on the reinsurance side than on the primary insurance side, at least for ours.
Meyer Shields: Okay. That's very helpful. I'm getting a couple of questions about the modest adverse reserve development in the Insurance segment. I was hoping that either Juan or Craig could comment on that maybe.
Juan Andrade: Yes, sure. This is Juan, Meyer. Would be happy to talk to you about that. Number one, it's very small, right? So it's less than $5 million. And it's really an increase on a specific large loss that came through in the quarter in our international insurance operations. So it's not meaningful from that perspective. And as you know, our reserving philosophy has been that we react quickly to that news. And frankly, we felt it prudent to recognize in this quarter and we recognized the development.
Meyer Shields: Okay. So if this was an actual loss emergence instead of this happening. Okay. And then final question, and I know quarterly numbers again bounce around a lot, but the - within insurance, the other specialty line was down year-over-year. Is that a more economically sensitive line than some of the other specialty lines?
Juan Andrade: Yes. And let me ask Mike Karm to jump in and give you a little bit of color on that as well. So Mike?
Michael Karmilowicz: Sure. Thanks for the question. That actually is definitely an economic impact. That business usually is transactional risk, which is M&A, which is obviously impacted by the COVID and the pandemic and then other lines on the credit side. So some of those actions, we actually were deliberate in actually slowing that business down, given what's going on with the pandemic and its impact to the credit markets.
Operator: We'll move on to our next question from Brian Meredith with UBS.
Brian Meredith: A couple here. Juan, I just want to clarify. I think you said in your response to Ryan's question that you didn't take any frequency benefit in the quarter either on comp or short-term property lines in the Insurance segment?
Juan Andrade: Yes. So that's correct, Brian. We are not taking any frequency benefit in the quarter for any of the lines of business where we have seen lower frequency so far this year. At this point in time, we think that's premature. And the reason for that is pretty straightforward. While you do see claims counts down in some lines of business like commercial auto and workers' comp and in GL, exposures are also down, which also result in premium refunds, right? So the impact on severity is less clear yet. And so I think you really need to look at longer-term averages because some of these frequency decreases may be temporary, and we don't know what the bounce back is going to be once the economy is fully reopen.
Brian Meredith: Got it. That makes sense. And I guess I'll just add on to that. I'm just curious, Juan. Could you give your perspective on kind of what social inflation kind of currently looks like? And what your outlook is here as the economy reopens? And with respect to that, is there anything that you can do right now with contract awards in your insurance space to potentially mitigate COVID-19 related claims here going forward?
Juan Andrade: Yes. No, absolutely. This is something that, frankly, we have been all over from the very beginning of this crisis. And I give a lot of credit to our corporate underwriting teams and our chief underwriting officers on that. Look, this is consistent with what I just said about frequency. I think as the economy begins to reopen again, a lot of the trend indicators that were there prior to the pandemic that frankly gave rise to some of the rate increases that we're seeing now across the board are still going to be there, right? So that hasn't gone away. But we have taken a number of actions, whether it's been pushing rate, tightening terms and conditions, reviewing contract wordings. We've also been putting pandemic exclusions in place across the board. We've also withdrawn capacity from certain territories, certain products, certain lines of business that, frankly, we weren't comfortable with as far as the risk assessment or the coverage that was being granted. And as you just asked on the earlier question regarding other specialty and insurance, we're also remaining cautious on certain economically sensitive lines. So we've taken a pretty deep and thoughtful approach to our underwriting from the very beginning of this pandemic in order to provide protection to the book going forward.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Phil Stefano with Deutsche Bank.
Philip Stefano: Yes. I was hoping you could talk about the reserving process for the COVID charges on the insurance business. And I think, Juan, you had mentioned in your opening remarks that there are some events into 2021 that are contemplated. So maybe you could just give us a flavor for kind of the time line and how you're thinking about reserving there.
Juan Andrade: Yes, absolutely. Look, I would tell you that the estimate that we have on the insurance side is a solid estimate, as I mentioned before. Particularly for event cancellation type policies, we are looking at early 2021 at this point in time. And this goes back to one of the questions I was asked earlier about the nature of this event. And what I mentioned, which, look, this is an ongoing event, and a lot of this will depend on the length and shape of it, frankly. But on contingency, we're definitely looking at early 2021 at this point in time.
Philip Stefano: And so the reason I'm asking the follow-up then leads to the reinsurance side of that. I'm getting the impression on these calls first quarter and probably even more so second quarter that auditors are having a different feel for how far they're allowing people to look in their reserving process. I guess, on the reinsurance book, when you have conversations with students, is the horizon they're allowed to contemplate in any way complicating your ability to reserve on the reinsurance side? How are those conversations going? And is the time line you're contemplating a reinsurance really different than the insurance side of your book?
Juan Andrade: Yes. So let me give you my thoughts on that, and then I would ask John Doucette to jump in as well. So look, I think the process has been very similar from the perspective of the detailed discussions that we've been having with our cedents, we've been having with brokers trying to understand the book of business. Obviously, the difference being that in the reinsurance side, it's a much more global book. We have some very large cedents and they're still trying to grapple in some ways, as you've seen in a lot of the calls, with their own exposure. And so from that perspective, on the reinsurance side, we do get a bit of a lag as far as the information is concerned with some of this information. But I think as far as the time horizon is concerned, our conversations with the cedents have been - they're looking at similar time frames through the end of this year, beginning of next year. But John, I don't know if you would like to add some color to that also.
John Doucette: Yes. Thanks, Juan. And as you said, there clearly is an information lag in terms of when the reinsurers hear things, plus everybody has to go look at the contracts in terms of how - again, going back to contract specific, fact specific, what are the retention clauses. What were the retentions? What are the hours clauses? What are other terms and conditions, exclusions that are in the contract? And I think that just takes a while to understand. And our clients - again, it varies by territory, what the original wording is. And so there's a lot of moving parts that really result in this as well as, as we've said, this being an ongoing event, that it makes it a lot more complicated. But we feel comfortable, based on all the information we have today, with both the process that we put in place to identify as well as what we have booked, again, given the information we have today.
Juan Andrade: Yes. And the last thing that I would add to that is, remember, the assessments we have out there are really management's best estimate. And what the auditors will review is really the approach on how management essentially achieve those estimates.
Operator: We'll take a follow-up from Mike Zaremski with Crédit Suisse.
Michael Zaremski: Great. Just two quick follow-ups. Any California wildfire subrogation benefits this quarter expected? And also, just wanted to confirm regarding the mortgage insurance book, I believe you said that losses weren't booked unless the situation deteriorates or did you say that there was some IBNR put up, but you don't expect kind of losses unless things deteriorate?
Juan Andrade: Yes. Thanks, Mike. Let me start off with mortgage first, and then I'll ask Craig to talk about the subrogation question. We have not put up any estimates for mortgage because we don't think we need to. We think our loss estimates, and we think our reserves are fine, more than adequate at this point in time. So we have not put up anything for the mortgage book. Craig?
Craig Howie: With respect to the California wildfire subrogation, first of all, on the reinsurance side, we'll see a lag in reporting from our cedents on that. The PG&E settlement just happened this quarter. So it will take some time before it gets reported to us. On the insurance side, we don't expect much subrogation at all since we had very few losses related to the California wildfires in our Insurance segment.
Michael Zaremski: Okay. So from the reinsurance, can you kind of look at what the - you can see what your losses were and just expect a certain percentage of that to potentially come back in the coming quarters?
Juan Andrade: Go ahead, Craig.
Craig Howie: It depends on each season, and it depends on each contract that we have with them and how much coverage we have with them. And then they will report back to us depending on what their settlement was out of the PG&E settlement.
John Doucette: Yes. This is John. I just wanted to add. So it very much is a function of what was their gross wildfire loss and then where do their reinsurance - what is the attachment point and the limits. So some of it, it could meaningfully impact their ceded losses. In some cases, it could have no impact on their ceded losses. So we're really in a wait and see, as Craig said, waiting to see what the settlement, if any, was and what they report as the benefit to the reinsurers. And when and if they do that, we'll book that into our numbers.
Operator: And we'll take our last question from Josh Shanker again with Bank of America.
Joshua Shanker: This is probably easy, and probably not. I want to say. Can you tell us anything about the insurance or reinsurance markets in Lebanon, given the news last week and how we might want to think about that?
Juan Andrade: Good question. I'll ask maybe John Doucette to start on the reinsurance side.
John Doucette: Yes. So I mean, again, very early days. It's a small market, and we're looking at what the - first, we're looking at what the coverages are that are offered in the region. So far, some of the brokers have come back with some modest coverages that are there. And really, we're still - it's too early to tell in terms of what the ripple effect is, both for the building, the specific building that was at risk, but then also the broader - the territory, the neighborhood that was impacted around that. So frankly, we're looking at it, but it's a relatively small market.
Joshua Shanker: And is your exposure in line with your global market share?
John Doucette: We're still assessing that. We don't have - we certainly would expect it to be, but it does vary by territory, but we don't have any reason to think it wouldn't be.
Juan Andrade: I think it would be helpful to add that indigenous exposure would be de minimis, right? I think any exposure for the company really would be out of global treaties from global cedents, that sort of thing.
John Doucette: Correct.
Operator: And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.
Juan Andrade: Great. Thank you, and thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to continuing the discussions next quarter. But before I let you go, just echo what I said earlier. We feel very good about where Everest stands right now. We feel very good about our traction, our momentum and our ability to execute in this market. So thank you for your support, for your questions, and I hope you stay safe.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-05-09 10:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Everest Re Group, Ltd First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jon Levenson. Please go ahead, sir.
Jon Levenson: Thank you, Nadia, and welcome to the Everest Re Group, Ltd. 2020 first quarter earnings conference call. The Everest executives leading today's call are Juan Andrade, President and Chief Executive Officer; Craig Howie, EVP and Chief Financial Officer; and John Doucette, EVP and President and CEO of the Reinsurance division. We are also joined today by other members of the Everest management team. Before we begin, I will preface the comments on today's call by noting that Everest's SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. Management comments regarding estimates, projections and similar are subject to the risks, uncertainties and assumptions as noted in its filings. Management may also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These items are reconciled in our earnings release and financial supplement. With that, I'll turn the call over to Juan Andrade.
Juan Andrade: Thank you, Jon, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. First and foremost, I hope you, your families, your friends and your neighbors are all staying healthy and safe. On behalf of our company, I want to offer our heartfelt condolences to all of those, including many in the Everest Re family who have lost loved ones during this difficult time. Our sincere thanks go to those medical professionals and first responders who are putting themselves at risk to keep everyone safe. Also, to all of those who are working hard to keep the supply chains going: the truck drivers, delivery drivers, grocery store employees and everyone else, thank you. I also want to thank all of Everest employees for their spirit and their unflagging commitment to serve our customers. We took early, proactive and decisive actions to protect the health and safety of our employees, their families and our stakeholders. As a result, Everest continues to successfully operate remotely. We are doing our part in support of the global economy by serving all of our customers and stakeholders without interruption. Our move to remote work was planful with a well-executed organizational resiliency plan and an underlying technology infrastructure that performs seamlessly and an information technology organization that has performed admirably. Our employees have been flexible, resilient and productive. We have received accolades regarding our responsiveness and our stability. We also continue to support our local communities around the world in their pandemic relief efforts. These are leadership moments for people and companies. Our culture of collaboration, thoughtful assumption of risk, humility and relentless execution are at the bedrock of our performance. I am incredibly proud of our people and our company. Our diversified global platform, with its broad mix of products, distribution and geography, remains an important source of stable capacity to our broker partners and customers. Our capital position remains a source of strength with high-quality invested assets, significant liquidity and low financial leverage. Despite the pandemic and the economic downturn, Everest remains profitable, as reflected in our reported 98.6% combined ratio or 89.9% excluding catastrophe losses and the pandemic IBNR loss provision. Additionally, Everest remains resilient, as reflected by both our 21% growth rate in gross written premium and by our capital position. We have built a strong capital foundation over the years, holding $8.6 billion of shareholders' equity at March 31, 2020. While this is a decrease from year-end 2019, this decrease primarily results from: one, the sharp decline in the fair value of the investment portfolio, which has now substantially recovered since the end of the quarter; two, share repurchases and dividends paid; and three, the pandemic loss IBNR provision. Most importantly, our capital position continues to exceed what we need to run the business with excess capital relative to rating agency and regulatory requirements. We have substantial liquidity from the cash we hold, and the cash flow from operations, which was over $0.5 billion for the quarter, were up 10% from 2019. We have significant access to capital markets, including plenty of debt capacity as we carry very little debt compared to all of our peers at less than 7% of our capital when most of our peers typically carry upwards of 20% to 30%. Lastly, our industry leading expense ratio also gives us operating flexibility, which is particularly critical in times of uncertainty. Turning to the first quarter of 2020. Everest remains strong and is well positioned with broad capabilities and top talent. And we remain focused on solving our clients' most critical risk transfer needs in a disciplined and profitable way. We demonstrated excellent momentum across both of our Reinsurance and Insurance businesses with gross written premium growth of 16% and 33%, respectively. We also continued to benefit from improved market conditions during the quarter, which I will discuss in a moment. Excluding catastrophes and the pandemic IBNR loss estimate, our underlying combined ratios for the group at 89.9% and each of our divisions, Reinsurance at 87.7% and Insurance at 95.6%, are reflective of the strong underwriting performance across the group and the earnings generating power of the franchise. Underwriting profitability remains at the core of everything we do. Our Reinsurance division had a strong January 1 renewal season. We continue to judiciously deploy capital, and we underwrote a high-performing book that is focused on strong economic returns while improving the diversification and balance of our overall portfolio. We also saw stronger opportunities in several areas such as retro and facultative risk. As the quarter progressed, we saw continued momentum across the portfolio. John Doucette will provide additional details on market conditions and the underlying growth. Our Insurance division's growth remained strong and consistent with recent quarters. The drivers for this growth were: number one, strong and widespread rate momentum. Excluding workers' compensation, the rate increase was plus 24% or plus 17% net of a handful of large deals booked in the quarter and over 12% including workers' compensation. This is an improvement from the fourth quarter of 2019 where the rate increase was almost plus 12% excluding workers' compensation and plus 4% all in. We also saw continued strength in the E&S space with strong submission flow and market conditions continuing to tighten in property and casualty in both primary and excess lines. We also had strong renewal retention in both our retail and wholesale businesses. And we had increased productivity resulting from additional underwriters hired in 2019 that are now fully onboarded and providing capacity to address the increased submission flow. The insurance growth was also balanced and diversified across our many lines of business. Strong rate and tightening terms drove the growth in the long-tail line. Despite the impacts of the pandemic in the quarter, our underlying insurance portfolio continues to perform well, and we are seeing the benefits of our various investments in portfolio optimization efforts, all of which position us well for this environment. Turning to investments. Net investment income of $148 million was up 5% from the first quarter of 2019. Our investment portfolio had been and is defensively positioned with over 75% in investment-grade fixed income bonds and less than 4% allocated to public equities. Most of our risk is bond risk, and we also have the ability to hold bonds until they mature. In addition, we’ve continued to further reposition our portfolio, moving up in fixed income credit quality and reducing equity exposure. As per our April 23 announcement, we’ve taken $150 million IBNR loss provision in the first quarter related to the COVID-19 pandemic. These losses relate to event cancellation, business interruption and other coverages such as accident and health and workers' compensation. Our estimate was based on an analysis completed during the first quarter. This analysis was a thorough cross-functional review of the in-force portfolio by line of business, industry and geography. The review was completed by a team of professionals representing every area of the company. Given the fluid and continuing nature of this pandemic, this is an ongoing event and so is our analysis. While our analysis looked at all aspects of our global portfolio, our estimate does not take into account legal, regulatory or legislative intervention that could retroactively mandate or expand coverage provisions. As stated in our release, our philosophy is to recognize and react to expected future losses on a timely basis. We will be tracking pandemic losses separately from our attritional losses and as an ongoing event. With regard to our specialty insurance business, we’ve limited exposure to event cancellation, accident and health, workers' compensation and business interruption. Our property policies have unambiguous policy language that requires direct physical loss for business interruption coverage to be triggered. Additionally, the majority of the property policies in force contain a virus exclusion. Only a very small number of policies have endorsed sub-limits typically less than $25,000 and with short-duration caps that would offer BI for a notable -- notifiable human disease. These exposures have already been recognized as part of the overall IBNR loss estimate for the quarter. The majority of the IBNR loss provision was for the Reinsurance business given the relative size of this portfolio compared to our Insurance businesses. It is important to note that as a reinsurer, we’ve contractual terms and conditions, such as retentions, limits, event definitions, hours clauses and other coverage provisions that will apply to this ongoing event. Thus, we do not simply follow the fortunes. It will be very fact-specific. We’ve also done a thorough review of our mortgage reinsurance contracts. Based on our view of the economic situation that is aided by both external information and our own proprietary internal modeling, we currently believe that our loss picks and reserves remain adequate. We will continue evaluating this business as the economic situation unfolds. In summary, Everest showed forward momentum, resiliency and profitability in the first quarter of 2020. We effectively transitioned to running our company remotely. And as always, we'll remain a consistent and trusted provider of capacity to our customers. Given the uncertainties in the current public health and economic environment, there could be an adverse impact on results for the property and casualty industry and Everest for the remaining part of the year. The impact is clearly dependent on the shape and length of the recovery. While the economic environment has changed, Everest remains a high quality franchise with broad capabilities, a global platform and top talent. We remain focused on solving our clients' most critical risk transfer needs in a disciplined and profitable way. We have the right culture, the right platform and relevance with our clients and trading partners and the capital base to see us through this time. Now let me turn it over to Craig to provide additional details on the financials. Craig?
Craig Howie: Thank you, Juan, and good morning, everyone. Everest reported net income of $17 million for the first quarter of 2020. This compares to net income of $355 million for the first quarter of 2019. Net income included $172 million of net after-tax realized capital losses compared to $74 million of capital gains in the first quarter last year. The 2020 capital losses were primarily attributable to fair value adjustments on the public equity portfolio. Operating income for the quarter was $164 million driven by strong underwriting results across the group, stable net investment income and lower catastrophe losses, offset by a COVID-19 pandemic IBNR loss estimate of $150 million. The overall underwriting gain for the group was $29 million for the quarter compared to an underwriting gain of $196 million in the same period last year. In the first quarter of 2020, Everest saw $30 million of catastrophe losses related to fires and hailstorms in Australia and a tornado in Nashville, Tennessee. This compares to $25 million of catastrophe losses reported during the first quarter of 2019. Overall, our prior year catastrophe loss estimates continue to hold. The combined ratio was 98.6% for the first quarter of 2020 compared to 88.7% for the first quarter of 2019. Excluding the catastrophe events and the impact of the COVID pandemic, comparable combined ratios were 89.9% for the first quarter of 2020 and 87.4% for the first quarter of 2019. Excluding the pandemic IBNR loss estimate, the attritional loss ratio was 61.5%, up from 60.2% for the full-year 2019 primarily due to the continued change in business mix. For the Reinsurance segment, the attritional loss ratio, excluding the pandemic loss estimate, was 59.8%, up from 58.2% for the full year of 2019. This increase was related to the continued business mix shift toward more pro rata premium, which carry a higher loss pick but allow us to benefit directly from the firming primary market. Pro rata premium is less volatile than excess premium, and we will see the benefit earn into our results as we lap the loss tax season over time. For the Insurance segment, the attritional loss ratio, excluding the pandemic loss estimate, remained very steady at 66.1%, essentially flat compared to 66.0% for the full-year 2019. As you can see in the financial supplement, we also experienced more growth in areas that typically carry a higher loss pick and -- but a lower overall combined ratio. Our U.S. insurance franchise, which makes up the majority of our global insurance business, continues to run an attritional combined ratio in the low 90s, excluding the pandemic loss estimate. The group commission ratio of 22% was down slightly compared to prior year. The group expense ratio remains low at 6.3% and was higher than last year due to an increase in nonrecurring incentive compensation, benefits and payroll taxes in the first quarter, which will normalize during the rest of the year. Before moving to investments, I'd like to point out that we are now reporting two segments: Reinsurance and Insurance. This is consistent with the way the business is managed and the way management views the company's results. For investments, pre-tax investment income was $148 million for the quarter from our $20 billion investment portfolio. Investment income was 5% above the first quarter of last year. This result was primarily driven by the increase in investment-grade fixed income portfolio, which had a higher asset base this year, and higher limited partnership income quarter-over-quarter. Since we report most partnership income on a quarter lag, the global equity market performance in the first quarter will be reflected in the limited partnership investment results in the second quarter. The pre-tax yield on the overall portfolio was 2.9%, about flat compared to one year-ago. For our investment-grade portfolio, the new money rate was 2.7% for the quarter. Other income included $21 million of foreign exchange gains in the quarter. On income taxes, the $60 million tax benefit for the quarter included a $31 million tax benefit related to the CARES Act, which extended the carryback period for cat losses to 5 years. Excluding this benefit, the effective tax rate on operating income was 12%, in line with our expected tax rate for the full-year. Positive cash flow continues with operating cash flow of $506 million compared to $460 million for the first quarter of 2019. This increase reflects a lower level of paid catastrophe losses in 2020 compared to 2019 and an increase in cash flow from our ongoing growth in insurance and reinsurance premiums. Shareholders' equity for the group was $8.6 billion at the end of the first quarter, down from $9.1 billion at year-end 2019. The movement in shareholders' equity since year-end 2019 is primarily attributable to the sharp decline in the fair value of the investment portfolio and by capital return for $200 million of share buybacks and $63 million of dividends paid in the quarter. The reduction in investment portfolio valuation came from the realized losses in the equity portfolio and the $248 million mark-to-market impact on the fixed income assets resulting from the widening of credit spreads. These mark-to-market adjustments have substantially recovered since the end of the quarter. During the first quarter, we made some tactical adjustments to reposition the portfolio by moving up in credit quality and further reducing our equity exposure. As Juan said, our capital position remains a source of strength with high-quality invested assets, significant liquidity and low financial leverage in addition to our robust cash flow. The strength of our balance sheet is critical to the success of our business. Thank you. And now John Doucette will provide a review of the reinsurance operations.
John Doucette: Thank you, Craig. Good morning. As Juan did at the start of the call, I would like to add my sympathies to our reinsurance trading partners and their families affected by the coronavirus pandemic. Like the rest of the group, the Reinsurance division, supported by our dedicated IT colleagues and our newly completed next-generation global underwriting platform was able to transition to 100% work from home without missing a beat. We are reviewing submissions, quoting and binding facultative and treaty business and settling claims. Now I will review the quarter. During Q1, the Reinsurance division increased our gross written premium to a record of $1.8 billion, up 16% from last year. Q1 growth was driven by January rate increases in loss-exposed areas and retro and writing more PURPLE products and casualty business due to improving conditions there. Growth was widespread, spanning territories and lines, including the U.S., international, casualty and property and short- and long-tail facultative reinsurance. Excluding COVID-19 losses, our underlying reinsurance loss ratio was up by two points largely due to more pro rata premium written over the last year. Pro rata business directly benefits from an improvement in original rates while ceding commissions have generally been stable and, in some cases, improved. Those improved original rates will take some time to be recognized in our loss picks. Note that the volatility associated with $1 of pro rata premium is generally lower than $1 of excess premium, and combined ratio alone can obscure risk-adjusted returns. We are pleased both with our progress at building a more diversified, profitable, sustainable gross portfolio and that we are seeing some tailwinds in the reinsurance market in casualty, property, retro, specialty and fac to help us achieve a stronger, more profitable portfolio. Everest's facultative operations continue to see an increase in demand. In the U.S. and international, we’re continuing to see significant double-digit rate increases in short-tail and long tail fac, with dramatic increase in submission count. Given that facultative renews on multiple inception dates, it is a good forward indicator of reinsurance demand and pricing. For our casualty business, original rates on certain lines have shown some increases, which will earn through on our pro rata premiums. As always, we’re deploying our shareholders' capital judiciously, seeking to build the strongest reinsurance portfolio possible while maximizing returns, while limiting our downside risk through increased diversification and balance. Now to comment on recent and upcoming renewals. April renewals showed continued rate momentum in loss-affected and capacity constrained segments. Japanese wind and retro rates showed strong increases, consistent with the need to maintain appropriate returns. Looking near term, particularly the upcoming June Florida renewals, we expect rates will be affected by limited capacity, recent losses and the market's heightened sensitivity to risk due to climate change and social inflation. Also, there is a strain on alternative capital, traditionally large players in Florida. Therefore, we continue to see upward pricing momentum in Florida along with improved terms and conditions. Now turning to mortgage. With the ongoing economic disruption, primary mortgage insurers could see increased losses along with regulatory capital pressure. However, housing fundamentals are stronger today than they were heading into the financial crisis with higher credit scores, tighter housing supply and lower-risk products. Our reinsurance mortgage book is seasoned and pegged conservatively. To give you some color on our mortgage book. By limit, our book is roughly 80% GSEs and 20% mortgage insurance. Virtually all business we write is on a QM basis. The underwriting box we participate in is very controlled and tightly underwritten, meaning our portfolio has no exotic products and has high FICO scores particularly on the GSE business. From the beginning of Everest entering the mortgage space, our pricing assumptions were and remain more conservative than the external vendor models that we use to validate our pricing assumptions. Regarding the MI treaties we reinsure, we effectively play in an excess position, thus avoiding the working layer losses and resulting in a meaningful buffer in gross loss ratio deterioration before we suffer any economic loss to our reinsurance treaties. Deterioration in this buffer range decreases the size of the profit commissions we would typically pay to the MIs, but at no economic cost to us. Regarding our GSE business, given our more conservative view of underwriting, pricing and capital modeling, we preferred higher layers over lower layers in these programs, and we’ve weighted our book to higher attachment points accordingly. Much of our exposure has been seasoned for several years, which benefits from home price appreciation. Going forward, credit standards at nearly all stages of mortgage origination are tightening and improving, therefore increasing the credit quality of borrowers in our book. Additionally, early government intervention in the economic crisis to support borrowers and lenders, including the broad offering of forbearance, will mitigate potential losses and help keep people in their homes and avoid default. We’re continually reevaluating the dynamics of this economically sensitive line to prudently manage our mortgage exposures now and on a go-forward basis. Now I will give some comments on the overall market ahead. Despite the uncertainty the industry faces, we cautiously anticipate that the reinsurance markets will remain healthy for the highly rated traditional reinsurers who can deploy capacity in multiple lines of business around the world, while also meeting clients' increasing counterparty credit requirements. This view is based on current reinsurance industry dynamics and the supply-demand curve. Starting with the market supply. More stable capital remains in place, while some of the opportunistic capital is exiting. Alternative capital investors are reevaluating the thesis that reinsurance is a non-correlated asset class. Potential uncertainty from COVID-19 and the possibility of more trapped capital compounds frustrations of these investors from the last 3 years of cats and subsequent loss creep from several events. This is in addition to higher relative return hurdle requirements given the increased price of risk across virtually all risk asset classes. On the demand side, clients have increased reinsurance purchases for risk management and capital support particularly as some of them come under capital or earnings pressure given the volatile markets. The flight to quality continues as reinsurance buyers and brokers are increasingly focused on the stability and quality of counterparties to protect program continuity and mitigate counterparty credit exposures in these volatile times. The length of the economic downturn will ultimately be a key factor impacting reinsurance demand. These market dynamics benefit Everest as we deliver stable capacity with strong security as a long-standing client-focused partner. Regardless of where the market turns, we will focus our capacity on those clients that align with our philosophy of prudent underwriting and sound claims handling practices. In summary, Everest is built to withstand volatility and uncertainty such as we’re seeing now. We continue to prove our resilience, our solution-driven partnerships with long-standing clients and our ability to execute through these unprecedented times. Thank you, and now I will turn it back over to Jon Levenson.
Jon Levenson: Great. Thanks, John. We would like to open-up the call for questions. We would ask today, if you could please limit to one question. And then if you do have a follow-up with another question, you could please rejoin the queue. We are hoping to get a lot of questions today. Nadia, could you please open up for Q&A?
Operator: Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Mike Zaremski from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Mike Zaremski: Hey, good morning and thanks for all the commentary in the prepared remarks. My first question, I will go with mortgage insurance. I think many investors feel that ultimately, the vast majority of mortgage borrowers who defer or miss payments will ultimately cure. But it would be helpful if maybe you can help us size up kind of where your excess layers kind of kick in from maybe a loss ratio standpoint, but some kind of framework to understand if you guys kind of play in the 100% combined ratio and up on, when we're looking at the mortgage insurers or kind of how to frame your exposure there.
Juan Andrade: Yes. Thanks, Mike. And this is Juan Andrade. Look, I think to echo some of the comments that John Doucette made in his opening remarks, from our perspective, I think there's really three things to consider. Number one is where we play as a reinsurer; and number two, the fact that we see this more as a frequency driven event essentially driven by unemployment. And so that certainly helps our view of all of this. The other part of that is that unlike the 2008 financial crisis, I think as we look at the mortgage products, the better original underwriting, I think, here will pay off. There's also much earlier intervention by the government, much tighter supply of housing, too. We also believe we have some very conservative loss picks on this. But let me ask John to answer your question more specifically on structure. John?
John Doucette: Yes. Thanks, Juan, and good morning, Mike. Thanks for the question. So again, I think you need to think of the world in two different buckets. One is on the mortgage insurance side, and one is on the GSE side. So on the GSE side, that's really more like a credit mortgage catastrophe. And so it's hard to map that to a loss ratio because as Juan said, there is frequency and severity tied to different percentages of default. So it's not really a loss ratio. On the mortgage insurance side, these are typically quota share deals. But then as I mentioned, given the profit commissions that go back, it roughly -- it's effectively like an excess deal that it catches at about an 80 combined ratio.
Mike Zaremski: Okay. And on the GSE side, is there a way to frame maybe what -- is it a cumulative loss of like 2.5%, or any numbers you could put around on the GSE side that could help us?
John Doucette: Yes. And it will vary by layer. I would just go back to the point I did say, which is -- so some of the GSEs have broad layers that they offer one layer, so -- and a much bigger stretch. Other ones have various layers. And where we had the opportunity, we'd typically play higher up on the -- further remote away from risk. But it's hard to map it to -- there's a lot of moving parts to the answer as to what the default rates are and things like that. And it's very much a function of -- because the GSEs also have the benefit of an earned cover from the MI. So if there is MI insurance on it, so there's -- it's not a -- there is no simple linear answer on that about what the default is. It depends on the type of the default, the frequency, severity, what drove it.
Mike Zaremski: Understood. My last question, switching gears to primary insurance. I think one of the most frequent questions we receive is trying to understand whether each insurer has a material amount of policies, property-related business interruption policies that may not have a virus exclusion specifically. And I know -- I think part of the IBNR charge you took included business interruption, but is there any way you could frame whether you -- a portion of your book doesn't have a virus exclusion and whether you are reserving or making some reserves for those policies?
Juan Andrade: Yes. Thanks, Mike. And I would go to -- this is Juan, and I would go back to my prepared remarks where I basically said that the majority of the property policies in the primary insurance book do contain a virus exclusion. And we only have a very small -- frankly, it's a very, very small segment where we do offer sub-limited coverage and I mentioned that it's less than $25,000 with very short gaps on duration. And all of that is included in the estimate that we put up for the quarter.
Mike Zaremski: That’s helpful. Thank you.
Juan Andrade: Thanks, Mike.
Operator: Thank you. We will next go with Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Yaron Kinar: Thank you very much. First question, probably for Juan. I think in your opening comments, you said that you had limited exposures in the Insurance segment to workers' comp among others. I was hoping that maybe you could help us -- or maybe explain how you come to that determination in the context of workers' comp premiums, I think, account for about 1/5 of the segment GPW?
Juan Andrade: Yes, I would be happy to talk to you about that. I would say, number one is we really don't have exposure to frontline first responders and very minimal exposure to the frontline health workers, the health care workers in the portfolio. So that essentially is how we come to that conclusion. So as we went through this very thorough process that I mentioned, we looked at industry profile for businesses that we deemed essential. And that's where the IBNR provision really was put up for those kinds of businesses. But again, when you look at those industries that would be most affected, health care workers, first responders, etcetera, we’ve very minimal exposure in the portfolio.
Yaron Kinar: Okay. And if you broaden that -- the more broad category of essential workers, how would you think about that?
Juan Andrade: Yes, and that’s essentially the provision that is included in the IBNR that we put up for the quarter. So if you look at our total workers' compensation book, again, the exposure to health care workers, first responders is not there. When it comes back to what we consider to be essential workers, that is really the provision that was taken for the quarter. So we believe that we've already accrued for that.
Yaron Kinar: Great. That’s very helpful. I appreciate. I will queue up for more questions. Thank you.
Juan Andrade: Thanks. Thank you, Yaron.
Operator: Thank you. We will next go with Brian Meredith from UBS. Please go ahead.
Brian Meredith: Yes. Let me just follow-up on that one. I noted today that California came out and, I guess, officially expanded presumption of coverage for employees there. So I'm assuming that your estimate actually included the expanded presumption of coverage for workers' compensation?
Juan Andrade: No, it does not. So that’s recent information, right? Look, our point of view on presumption of coverage is that it's something that needs to be taken very seriously obviously. Any broad sweeping presumption measures, frankly, can cause long-lasting harm to the industry and don't make a lot of sense for a number of reasons. Retroactively restructuring the underpinnings of the workers' compensation system to shift the burden of proof of cost to employers and their insurers really undermines the spirit of the workers' compensation system. And that's not something that companies have underwritten or priced for, and thus, it materially weakens the system. And so that is something that needs to be considered. It also violates well-established principles for workers' comp law that the claimant has the burden of proving his or her claim was a workplace injury and is a covered claim. And so that’s the way we tend to view this, but our estimate does not include an expansion of presumption at this point in time.
Brian Meredith: Thank you.
Juan Andrade: Thanks, Brian.
Operator: Thank you. We will next go with Ryan Tunis from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.
Ryan Tunis: Hey, thanks. Good morning. My first question, we were given this stat on another call this morning about the percent of the exposure to personal lines or homeowners-type businesses versus commercial lines within the property cat book. By client, do you have a -- could you provide us with that breakdown?
Juan Andrade: Thanks, Ryan. Let me ask John Doucette to jump in and help me answer that question.
John Doucette: Yes. Good morning, Ryan and hope you’re doing well. Look, that's a -- we write $6.5 billion of premium around the world, a good chunk of that’s property. It's going to vary all over the place. By territory, within property, we write quota share per risk and catastrophe. And there's a mix, and it will vary within region in the U.S. as well. So there's no simple answer to that.
Ryan Tunis: Got it. And then my other one, I guess, is trying to think about -- I guess what I'm trying to think about is if there is like a second wave later in the year, whether or not that would constitute a second event. So maybe trying to get some clarification. I'm not sure how to ask the question, but some clarification on, like, what would a conservative reading be of the end of this as an event from a reinsurance standpoint? Like what conservatively would, I guess, close the book on the losses associated with this first lockdown?
Juan Andrade: Yes. Ryan, this is Juan. Let me jump in there, and I will ask John to supplement my answer. I think this is where you come back to my comments that this is not a follow-the-fortunes event for Everest, right? When you start looking at event definition, including hours clauses, limiting duration of an event, outlining the radius or the contiguous environment that’s involved, this is where all of that is going to come in into play for us, right? And so John, maybe you can more specifically answer that also.
John Doucette: Yes. Thanks, Juan. And I think it's important to point out that not only is the event going on, but we have rolling inception dates that are happening all the time. And we just finished 4/1s. We had some 5/1s in the U.S., May 1. Florida is coming up June 1. And in July, we’ve a lot of renewals kind of all over the world, and facultative is ongoing throughout the year, many times a year. We have inceptions. And one of the things to point out that I think is important is that we are pursuing terms and conditions that help narrow or exclude pandemic risk. And that will ripple into some of the things you're saying about the go-forward. And that will help mitigate, limit or exclude the potential losses going forward. And we're certainly not alone doing that. Other -- while we're leading the charge, many other reinsurers are doing it as well. And I think that will help narrow whatever the scope of this turns out to be. But there's a lot of economic facts and things to come in terms of -- to answer your question better than that.
Ryan Tunis: Thank you.
Operator: We next go with Meyer Shields.
Meyer Shields: Can you hear me?
Juan Andrade: Yes, Meyer, we can hear you.
Meyer Shields: Okay, great. Good morning. I have a question on business interruption. I'm hoping you can explain the position and maybe the reserving stance on the question of whether commercial property policies that don't include a virus exclusion but require direct physical damage, is it Everest's position that, that is still an absolute event, or are there some reserves that -- or some reserves that you established for that?
Juan Andrade: Yes. No, Meyer. So this is Juan. Look, I think as I said in my opening remarks, we absolutely believe that physical damage absolutely is unambiguous in the coverage of this, right? If you think about it, there's double triggers, right? Number one, there has to be covered physical damage, which, again I believe is pretty unambiguous in the wording. And secondly, we also have virus exclusions on the portfolio. So I think that's the other trigger. So the answer would be yes to your question, do we believe it would hold?
Meyer Shields: Okay. Thank you. The second question, I was just hoping that given the comments that Craig had made about moving up the credit quality curve since the end of the quarter, can you give a sense as to new money rates?
Juan Andrade: Sure. Craig, can you take that, please? Craig?
Operator: Craig maybe on mute.
Craig Howie: Thank you. Sorry. Meyer, I saw on your -- or I mentioned in my prepared remarks that our new money rate for the investment-grade portfolio was about 2.7% on average for the quarter. What we did see was due to some of the widening of the credit spreads and some of the actions that we took in the quarter, we actually saw better rates in March than we did for the overall quarter. So they were higher and closer to the 2.9% range. On average, we saw -- across investment-grade and some below investment-grade, we saw a purchase yield of about 3.2% for the quarter.
Meyer Shields: Okay. That covers April in essence as well?
Craig Howie: I'm sorry, I didn't hear that?
Meyer Shields: Yes, I was wondering whether that covers the sort of April yield as well.
Craig Howie: Well, the April yield is probably -- as I said to you, it's closer to the 2.7% on the investment-grade portfolio. And then some of the high yield that we are seeing so far is still over 5%.
Meyer Shields: Okay, fantastic. Thank you very much.
Craig Howie: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. We will next go with Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi. Thanks. My first question, going back on the business interruption and COVID discussion and just on the reinsurance side, I recognize -- I think someone else asked about the commercial versus personal breakdowns as well. Maybe you can give us those percentages, but is there a way for you to give us a high level view of what policies could be at risk in terms of accounts that have virus exclusions so they don't -- just as we kind of think about this being an ongoing event and what additional losses would come to Everest on the catastrophe reinsurance side?
Juan Andrade: Sure, Elyse. And this is Juan and let me start off with that. Look, I mean this is still obviously a fluid and ongoing event. And we put a pretty thorough process in place in the first quarter that, as I mentioned in my remarks, is ongoing as far as how we're going to be able to continue to refine the estimates as we go-forward. On the reinsurance side, that basically involved spending time with clients, brokers, essentially looking at some of the underlying contracts, etcetera, to be able to get a handle on that. And what we know is that the underlying business that we're protecting, the vast majority of that requires physical damage before providing any cover on the business interruption side of things. And also in the U.S. specifically, most of the underlying policies in those portfolios that we're protecting also will include the virus exclusion. But let me turn it over for John Doucette to give you maybe a bit more additional color on that.
John Doucette: Yes. I would -- I don't really have that much to add. As we've said, we're also -- our top down bottom up review, we looked internally, externally, talked to a whole lot of brokers, clients looking at our -- not just our catastrophe book, but our contingency book just across all lines of business. We did a kind of first principles review of everything that helped us get to the number that we got to and, again, trying of factor in retentions, deductibles, hours clauses, radiuses, contracts, some on a named peril basis and other provisions that vary. And we -- again, we looked and -- across, did a very thorough review, had a lot of people looking at it and are comfortable, based on what we know today, that we’ve put up a reasonable provision for that.
Elyse Greenspan: Thanks. And then my second question is on the retro side. If you could just give us a more update view of the pricing within that business. And then this is more specific to your outbound purchases. Would you guys look to potentially buy less retro and keep more business net? And can you just have a current view of the pricing that's going on in the retro market?
Juan Andrade: Thank you. John, can you take that?
John Doucette: Yes. Thanks, Juan. Yes, thanks, Elyse. Good question. And so retro is predominantly not exclusively January 1. A lot of it covers -- a very solid majority happen at January 1. And so we’ve seen a few that have come up the summer off-cycle and do it at March, April, May, June. And I think -- so we’ve seen increased pricing there. And I think that the alternative capital that I talked about in my prepared remarks, we are seeing and hearing a lot of noise about redemptions and, again, frustrations with the losses and kind of a comparison to other places to deploy the capacity. So I think there is a lot of noise there that we think will continue for a while. And that will have a direct impact on the retro market. In terms of our hedges, we look at a whole suite of hedges and really try to build a holistic program that has different attachment points, different product types, different geographic coverages, different durations of how long they are in place. And as you will recall, we renewed our catastrophe bonds. We have almost $3 billion in catastrophe bonds in place. We renewed them in November, December. The ones that had expired, we bought lower down. And again, in hindsight, we are glad we took the capital that was available to us then, even though it had been a slight increase in rates. And those are multiyear deals, and they will be in place for the next several years. And because the pricing's already locked in, the cost of that capital, the cost of that or the rate change embedded in that on a go-forward basis is 0. We also have Logan, our strategic partner and continue -- Logan is about flat from January to now and continue to use that as a very important hedging mechanism. And the cost of that goes basically, Logan rides up and down with us as they take quota shares of different layers of and build -- we build portfolios for them where they help us hedge. We do buy traditional reinsurance in retro. We will remain pricing sensitive to using that as a form of hedge. And we also buy ILWs, and we've been in the ILW market since January, looking and buying up ILWs as another way for us to hedge.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. Thank you for the color.
Operator: Thank you. We will next go with Ron Bobman from Capital Returns. Please go ahead.
Ron Bobman: Hi. Thanks a lot. Glad to hear everyone sounds well. I had two questions. One, trying to get some handle around sort of the reinsurance buying demand from the market. I guess that would be sort of directed to John principally. John, with primary property companies presumably having some affirmative BI exposure and losses and presumably some amount unknown, the sort of tail risk, whether it be sort of judicial decision, litigation-oriented, etcetera, and the unknown and significant amount of that, what should a primary company be thinking and sort of doing now, if at all, as far as buying additional reinsurance? And what I’m really sort of thinking about is sort of third event cover if some amount from COVID is going to tap their first tower.
John Doucette: Thanks. Appreciate the question. So look, we are seeing a lot of interesting things about demand out there. But I would broaden it beyond people are buying specifically for COVID. People are looking because it's been a bumpy few years for the industry. And I think people's view, whether it's wildfires, Japanese wind, different exposures that happen and the development that we saw, so I think that overall, there's a view of derisking and a lower risk appetite. And that was around and building before COVID. And I think that today, people will be looking not just to how do I protect against COVID, but how do I use reinsurance to help manage volatility in my earnings from typical covers, typical perils as well as consider more capital protection. So -- and I think -- so we are seeing demand from larger buyers. We are seeing demand from smaller ones that are rating-sensitive or have ratings pressure. And a lot of our clients had asset issues due to the impact of the COVID environment, which also drives reinsurance demand.
Ron Bobman: Okay. Thanks. And then the $3 billion in cat bonds that you mentioned and then separately the ILWs, do those -- is pandemic a named peril that those -- the cat bonds and separately the ILWs would provide protection for?
John Doucette: They -- both the ILWs and the catastrophe bond are named peril and a pandemic is not a named peril, I mean.
Operator: Thank you. We have Yaron …
Juan Andrade: One last -- I’m sorry, one last comment I would add to Ron's question, too. If you're also thinking about Everest insurance, we also feel that we’ve a very good reinsurance program that's in place with regard to all of this. So I just wanted to finish that thought. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We will next go with Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs for a follow-up question. Please go ahead.
Yaron Kinar: Hey, thank you. I thought maybe I would move away from COVID questions. I noticed there was a little bit of an uptick in the accident year loss ratio in insurance. Can you maybe talk about what drove that?
Juan Andrade: Yes. Sure thing, Yaron. This is Juan. I think as Craig mentioned also in his opening comments, when you look at the loss ratio for the quarter, very close or very stable to where we were at the end of the year. There is really a main driver on sort of the uptick, and that really has to do with mix. We saw a bit more growth in A&H, in casualty and in risk management. And those lines of business basically could carry higher loss picks than some of the other lines of business. So I would attribute it basically to the mix and the growth in those specific lines.
Yaron Kinar: Got it. And is that mix also impacting part of the decline in the expense ratio year-over-year?
Juan Andrade: The expense ratio exactly, that was primarily on the commission side of things where because we did write some more risk management business, etcetera, you also had a mitigating effect on that. So that would be correct.
Yaron Kinar: Okay. Thanks so much.
Juan Andrade: Sure. Thanks, Yaron.
Operator: Thank you. It appears that we have no more questions in the private -- in the question queue. [Operator Instructions]
Jon Levenson: Nadia, pardon, I think we are done with questions. And we would like to hand the call back over to Juan for some closing comments.
Juan Andrade: Great. Thank you, Jon, and thank you for everyone today. And again, as I said, I’m glad that everyone seems to be doing okay. Look, as far as just some quick summary remarks, over the years, our company has built a reputation for strong operating performance with a strong capital position built to withstand catastrophes. And while no one could have predicted an event of this magnitude, we do stand ready to serve our customers and our brokers, and we will have the strength and stability that they will have come to rely on us over the last five decades. So we will keep refining our estimates, and we will keep working on this, but we will also be there for our customers as they need us. Thank you for your time.
Operator: This concludes today’s call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q4  (2020-02-11 10:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Everest Re Group, Ltd. Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Today’s conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to turn this conference over to Jon Levenson. You may begin.
Jon Levenson: Thank you, Chantelle, and welcome to the Everest Re Group, Ltd. 2019 fourth quarter and year-end earnings conference call. The Everest executives leading today's call are Juan Andrade, President and Chief Executive Officer; Craig Howie, EVP and Chief Financial Officer; John Doucette, EVP and President and CEO of the Reinsurance Division; and Jonathan Zaffino, EVP and President and CEO of the Everest Insurance Division. Before we begin, I need to preface the comments on today's call by noting that Everest's SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. Management comments regarding estimates, projections and similar are subject to the risks, uncertainties and assumptions as noted in these filings. Management may also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These items are reconciled in our earnings release and financial supplement. With that, I turn the call over to Juan Andrade.
Juan Andrade: Thank you, Jon, and good morning. It's my pleasure to join you for the first time as President and CEO of Everest. 2019 was a solid year for our company as we continue to benefit from improving market conditions across all areas of our business. We are well positioned for this market with broad capabilities in top talent, and we remain focused on solving our clients' most critical risk transfer needs in a disciplined and profitable way. For the full year 2019, Everest recorded net income of over $1 billion, a significant increase from the prior year and a 12% net income return on equity. Net operating income for 2019 was in excess of $872 million, also a significant improvement over the 2018 result. Our combined ratio for the year was 95.5% compared to 108.8% in 2018 despite $550 million of catastrophe losses during the year. Our book value per share growth was 16%, and we grew our revenues by 8%. We remain focused on our industry-leading expense advantage. We achieved a 6% expense ratio in 2019 while continuing to make significant investments in people, technology and the infrastructure necessary to grow our company. These overall results are a testament to the strength and diversification of our franchise. We had sizable contributions from both our underwriting and investment operations throughout 2019. Specific to the underwriting operations, 2019 demonstrated the success of our strategies in both reinsurance and insurance. For the full year 2019, Everest generated $336 million in underwriting income. In our Reinsurance division, we generated $255 million in underwriting income with a 95.4% combined ratio even with an active catastrophe year with industry insured losses in excess of $50 billion. This result reflects the steps we have taken to diversify our portfolio and reduce volatility. In our Insurance division, 2019 marked another strong year of profitable growth. We finished the year with gross written premium of nearly $2.8 billion, a 23% growth rate, over $81 million in underwriting income and a 95.8% combined ratio. Our U.S. franchise, which makes up the majority of our Global Insurance business, ran a combined ratio in the low 90s for the full year. The Insurance division had pretax operating income of $270 million for the year, including the allocated $189 million of investment income, an excellent result. Overall investment income for the group was $647 million, up 11% over the prior year. Given the prudent investment mix of assets we maintain, this was also an excellent outcome. Overall, our invested assets grew by $2.3 billion in 2019 to nearly $21 billion, driven by record underwriting cash flows and the solid return on invested assets. Turning to the fourth quarter of 2019, overall group results were impacted by $215 million in catastrophe losses and higher-than-expected losses in our crop reinsurance book as a result of inclement weather. This resulted in a group combined ratio of 101.5%. For the quarter, as a result of these losses, our Reinsurance division posted a combined ratio of 103.9% and an underwriting loss of $55 million. Our Insurance division generated over $26 million in underwriting income and a 95.1% combined ratio. Heading into 2020, we remain very well positioned. In our Reinsurance division, we were pleased with our January one renewals, which represents about 50% of our annual reinsurance premium. Underwriting discipline remains paramount, and we were able to underwrite a stronger portfolio with greater balance, diversification, more expected margin and reduced volatility. In our Insurance division, the rate momentum continues to build up meaningfully in virtually every class of business. Our Insurance division is hitting full stride at an ideal time given the market tailwinds. We have the right culture, platform and relevance with our clients and trading partners. We also have the underwriters and systems necessary to capitalize on the current market, with the infrastructure in place to ensure underwriting discipline and appropriate risk selection. Strategically, our focus is on increasing Everest's earnings power in terms of both our underwriting and investment income, with the goal of driving superior book value growth over time. Underwriting profitability will remain at the core of everything we do as we execute on our well-defined premium growth strategies in an improving underwriting environment. We will continue to search for profitable growth opportunities and increase relevance. To use a sports metaphor, we're on the front foot. We will also continue to create optionality and diversification in our business with a broad mix of products, distribution and geography. This allows us to focus our underwriting capital on the most profitable classes, regardless of the environment. With regard to investment income, strong operating cash flows and returns on invested assets will continue to grow our portfolio going forward. Our focus will be on optimizing the performance of our investment portfolio while maintaining a well-balanced and prudent investment posture. The efficient use of our capital facilitates returns on equity significantly in excess of our cost of capital. Our goal is a double-digit return on equity. Our first priority is to deploy capital into the business to position Everest for long-term success and profitable growth. Growth in our earnings power, combined with our strong balance sheet, low leverage, strong financial ratings and the effective management of capital, will position Everest to succeed in every stage of the market cycle. Now let me turn it over to Craig to provide additional details on the financials.
Craig Howie: Thank you, Juan, and good morning, everyone. For the fourth quarter of 2019, Everest reported net income of $218 million. This compares to a net loss of $385 million for the fourth quarter of 2018. Net income for the full year was over $1 billion compared to net income of $89 million in 2018. These results were driven by a strong underwriting performance across the group, higher net investment income and lower catastrophe losses compared to 2018. In the fourth quarter of 2019, Everest saw $215 million of net pretax catastrophe losses compared to $875 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. The 2019 pretax loss estimates came from Typhoon Hagibis in Japan for $190 million and the Dallas, Texas Tornado with $25 million. On a full year basis, the results reflected net pretax catastrophe losses of $550 million in 2019 compared to $1.7 billion recorded in calendar year 2018. These losses are pretax figures, net of reinsurance and reinstatement premium. As a reminder, the company uses net after-tax loss estimates when setting its catastrophe loss budget for the year. Excluding the catastrophe events, reinstatement premiums and favorable prior period reserve development, the underlying book continues to perform well with an overall current year attritional combined ratio of 88.4% for the year compared to 87% last year. This increase was primarily due to the business mix in the Reinsurance segment, which has been writing more proportional casualty business over the past several quarters, which carries a higher loss ratio but benefits from the current underwriting market condition, also due to the impact of the current year crop reinsurance losses in 2019 of about $50 million. On reserves, we completed the remainder of our annual loss reserve studies during the fourth quarter. We booked $19 million of favorable prior year reserve development. This is in addition to the $75 million of favorable prior year development reported in the first three quarters of 2019 for a full year total of $94 million. The Insurance segment reported $16 million of favorable prior year reserve development during the quarter, which was largely related to its workers' compensation business. The Reinsurance results - segment reported $3 million of favorable prior year development during the quarter and $77 million for the year. The Reinsurance segment saw favorable development in some short-tail and credit-related lines, such as property, surety, marine and mortgage. This favorable development was offset by actions we took to strengthen reserves in the Bermuda segment for losses on some specific accounts for both property and casualty. Before moving to taxes, I'd like to remind you that we've included a split of our net investment income between the Insurance segment and total reinsurance. This is shown on Page 15 in the financial supplement. It indicates the contribution provided by each segment to pretax operating income and reflects $458 million allocated to reinsurance and $189 million of net investment income allocated to the Insurance segment. We are including this information to better demonstrate the total contribution by business segment and highlights the stand-alone value of the growing insurance franchise. On income taxes, the tax benefit was the result of losses associated with the catastrophes this year. Since the majority of the catastrophe events came from business written in the U.S. book, the losses and tax benefit primarily reflect the U.S. tax rate. The effective tax rate is an annualized calculation that includes planned catastrophe losses for the year. For 2020, we expect our tax rate to be about 12%, which reflects an annual cat load of about six points of loss ratio. Shareholders' equity for the group ended the year at a record $9.1 billion, up $1.3 billion or 16% compared to year-end 2018. The increase in shareholders' equity is primarily attributable to the over $1 billion of net income and the recovery in the fair value of the investment portfolio. During the quarter, the company announced an 11% increase in its regular quarterly dividend and paid $1.55 per share in the fourth quarter of 2019. Our balance sheet and overall financial position remains strong. We maintain industry load debt leverage, manage a high credit quality investment portfolio and generate robust cash flow. Thank you. And now John Doucette will provide a review of the reinsurance operations.
John Doucette: Thank you, Craig. Good morning. Following three years of significant catastrophes and more recent loss development, the 2020 reinsurance market is dynamic, just as our property book in 2019 was a better portfolio compared to 2018. After this January 2020 renewal, we have a stronger, even healthier book across our overall global property portfolio, including property cat, proportional, facultative, per risk, retro and PURPLE treaties with better balance, diversification and limit deployment, and we have improved expected margins while managing the size of our catastrophe PML. We are optimistic about the opportunity set in front of us while remaining realistic that there are choppy waters to navigate in both property and casualty lines. It is an improving market marked by increasing demand for reinsurance with roughly flat reinsurance supply. And for specific deals, pricing was determined by class of business, territory and loss experience. Everest is well positioned in this market given our unique strengths and attributes. These include our long-standing client relationships and robust ability to source business globally with strong balance sheet and strategically located and seasoned underwriting teams empowered to make decisions and execute. At January 1, Everest deployed more capacity in retro; our PURPLE product; loss-affected territories with rate improvements or continued post loss, higher reinsurance rates; casualty; specialty; and facultative lines around the globe. Conversely, we continue to re-underwrite poor performing accounts or accounts which did not have strong pricing. On these programs, we cut back our share or came off. Approaching January 1, we utilized alternative capital to capture value in the improving market. We went back to the cat bond market to renew the expiring Kilimanjaro bonds and utilize the approximately $800 million of AUM in Mt. Logan. Along with in force, cat bonds and other hedges, we holistically built capacity to deploy on deals we like, particularly in retro and PURPLE. At 1/1, we were able to improve profitability of our global cat book, optimizing the risk/reward of the portfolio while managing the volatility. There's been a lot of discussion of the U-shape market pricing dynamics. I think the correct analogy is a W-shape. Why W-shape and not a U-shape? Both exhibit increasing primary and retro rates. But in the U-shape model, reinsurance rates would not move up much at all. However, in the W-shape model, the reinsurance rates, terms and conditions were mixed. Some disappointingly flat and some with nice improvements and continued attractively priced opportunities. That is why we believe a W-shape is a better visualization of the market. First, the left side of the W-shape model, primary insurance. Everest writes a large amount of proportional treaties. We are directly benefiting from improving primary markets in casualty, property and specialty lines, particularly in E&S and in certain capacity-restricted territories such as Canada. Our relevance to our clients and brokers for providing much needed risk transfer, capital support and volatility management helps them capture value in these improved primary markets. Now the middle part of the W-shape model, reinsurance. As I said, results were mixed, some good, some disappointing. Positives were global reinsurance programs, pockets of casualty, mortgage, structured business, many facultative lines and several loss-affected areas. Disappointments included several smaller capacity programs and several cat-free territories. Specifically, at January 1, several large global property programs that tapped out global capacity had improved pricing. Therefore, we wrote more with several large multinational global clients, particularly with our strategic partners. Loss-affected territories impacted by catastrophes over the last three years have substantially better rates, and in some cases, those rates continued to improve. But smaller limit programs, including regional U.S. and smaller clients around the globe, did not see much rate movement. Most of Europe and much of Latin America and Asia were closer to flat. China was down, and we deployed less capacity there. Casualty reinsurance saw a directional improvement in reinsurance rates as well as benefited from primary rate increases, improved terms and limit contraction, resulting in a better priced and better balanced book. There's been a lot of talk about social inflation and increased loss trends in casualty. We believe this is a reversion to the long-term mean as opposed to something new. And this reversion to the mean in trend and loss development is something that we have been underwriting for, pricing for and embedding in our trend factors for several years, prior to this being in the headlines now. Seasons continued to decrease their volatility through a combination of gross line reductions, buying down treaty retentions, buying more casualty reinsurance and buying more facultative reinsurance in both property and casualty. Fac helped seasons manage line size and protect certain rigs that get limited or excluded under treaties during this part of the cycle. Then at the right price, terms and conditions assuming that risk, our seasoned fac teams can specifically underwrite those risks. In the last many months of fac renewals, including this 1/1, we have seen a significant increase in the number of opportunities in fac, both in casualty and property, in the U.S. as well as internationally, much coming with significant rate lift. And mortgage, which has treaties incepting throughout the year, remains a positive driver in reinsurance. Finally, the right side of the W-shape model, retro. At January 1, retro rates were up meaningfully, and we wrote more premiums accordingly. We dusted off our pillared product, PURPLE, and marketed that beyond the few core clients who have been consistent buyers. The end result was roughly a 25% increase in our combined retro and PURPLE premium. Therefore, improving insurance, mixed reinsurance with some bright spots and improved retro results in the W-shaped market. As we look forward to 2020, we see January one momentum continuing throughout the year on reinsurance and retro, including upward pricing pressure both in Japan at April one and also in Florida at June 1. Trapped capital and investor fatigue continue as important drivers in the property space. We see a mixed casualty reinsurance market continuing in 2020 with some reinsurers writing more and some are treating or writing less. This is a function of perception of loss trends, market share and underwriting actions taken over the last several years. As discussed on many prior earnings calls, given casualty underwriting actions we took the last six to eight years, we are optimistic about the current market. Mortgage continues to be a core line for us. We have increased our book and expect to see increased reinsurance demand from the buyers in 2020 and beyond. With proactive optimization, continued re-underwriting and diversifying our global portfolio, we are pleased with the outcome at January one and are well positioned for the future. Thank you. And now I will turn it over to Jon to review our insurance operations.
Jonathan Zaffino: Thank you, John, and good morning. Everest insurance completed 2019, delivering another year of solid profitable growth with the strongest underwriting income in many years, and as you heard from Juan, achieving a milestone of $270 million of pretax operating income. Stated simply, the insurance organization is well positioned for continued success in this firming market. Our strategy, thoughtfully executed upon over the past several years, is producing solid results. We continue to increase our relevance within the specialty insurance segment, and most importantly, among our valued clients. We remain optimistic about the future and continue to see meaningful opportunities ahead. This is an underwriter’s market, and we have the platform, the products and outstanding talent to continue to thrive. For the full year 2019, we achieved gross written premium growth of 23% or $2.8 billion. Our net written premium, likewise, grew 22% to $2.1 billion. Over the last two quarters of 2019, we experienced a gross written premium growth rate of 30%, which speaks to the accelerated pace of firming in the market and the increased opportunity set across our global specialty wholesale and retail product offerings. Various underwriting divisions, representing our short, medium and long tail books, all experienced opportunistic growth in the quarter. Our mix remained generally similar to the prior year, with one notable decline in U.S. workers' compensation down 4%, now equaling about 20% of our total writings. While we continue to see opportunity in workers' compensation, we remain cautious in that line of business. Our short-tail and accident and health portfolios remain roughly 30% of our total mix, and our specialty casualty portfolio is also roughly 30%. The balance is made up of our various professional and financial lines offerings. Business originated within the U.S. excess and surplus lines market and London wholesale accounted for nearly 40% of our total premium in 2019. This may scale even further as we continue to see meaningful opportunity through this important channel. Our new business in the quarter was solid once again, and our retention ratio grew in each major distribution segment. Add to this, growth emanating from rate change and all of these factors further contributed to top line performance. As you heard, profitability was solid in both the quarter and year-to-date period. Our year-to-date 2019 result is the strongest underwriting profit in many years and is 6% greater than last year's results on the same basis. The reported loss ratio was essentially flat year-over-year, registering a 65.2 versus 65 in the prior year. However, the attrition loss ratio improved 20 basis points over the prior year coming in at 66 versus 66.2. The expense ratio for the year remained stable, around 30%, while we continue to invest in people, technology and infrastructure, including our growing international platforms. As an example, we continue to invest heavily in our claims organization to promote better outcomes for Everest and our clients. This includes the recruitment of outstanding talent across every level of our claims group as well as investments across our operational infrastructure enabled by technology. Further, we have migrated claims handling away from TPAs and several key product lines and geographies to our in-house claims teams and are very pleased with the results thus far. We will further enhance this important aspect of our organization in 2020. As we look to the rate environment, we see accelerating rate improvement across most of the market. In the quarter, we experienced pure rate increases, which excludes the impact of exposure of 12% excluding workers' compensation and 7.9% year-to-date on the same basis. This is the largest increasing in many years and continues to be led by double-digit rate increases within our property portfolio. Financial lines and umbrella excess are also showing significant improvement, registering double-digit rate increases as well. And in the case of excess casualty, rate increases are in the high teens. Encouragingly, we also see primary general liability rates moving up in the fourth quarter as well to the mid-single-digit range. Every major line of business we underwrite showed improvement in rate change momentum in the fourth quarter. As we have previously noted, we remained very well positioned to take advantage of this improved pricing environment in terms of our people, product set and our ability to offer solutions to clients in this evolving market. Most importantly, all of these actions continue to drive meaningful income in the insurance organization. In conclusion, we entered 2020 with excellent momentum. Our global platform, extensive global distribution and, most importantly, talented team continued to differentiate Everest insurance in the market. Having recently hosted our 2020 Underwriting Summit, a gathering of our top underwriting leadership across the world, I can assure you the team is focused and prepared to continue executing on our key underwriting directives. We look forward to reporting back to you on our progress next quarter. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Chantelle for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Elyse Greenspan, Wells Fargo.
Elyse Greenspan: My first question kind of I guess trying to tie together a few things you guys said in the prepared remarks. It sounds like your cat load should be lower in 2020. I think you guys said around six points relative to where it's been trending. But then it sounds like you guys saw some good opportunity, both on the reinsurance and the retro side at 1/1? So is that more a function of just some also good growth you're seeing on the casualty side of things? I'm just trying to lump that all together and why your cat load will be down if you're seeing good growth on the cat side?
Juan Andrade: Yes Elyse, this is Juan. So let me start then I'll ask John Doucette to add to this as well. So as you pointed out, we did see a very good opportunity in the retro market at 1/1. We continue to see a good economic bet from the perspective of rate momentum. We were also successful in moving further up in attachment points, et cetera. So for us that was really a very good opportunity. And as a result of that, you will also continue to see our volatility continue to improve, as both John Doucette and I mentioned in our prepared remarks. I think you will see that in our numbers throughout the year. Now with regards to casualty, we also continue to see pretty good opportunity on the reinsurance side, essentially for all the reasons that we mentioned, with the improvement in the primary side of things, particularly in general liability and some of the improvements that we've seen in excess casualty as well, and given the fact we are providing proportional treaties with some key clients, that was also a pretty good opportunity for us up in the 1/1 period.
John Doucette: Yes, good morning Elyse, this is John Doucette and just wanted to follow-up a couple of things. So, yes, we did see opportunities in certain pockets of the reinsurance, and we saw opportunities in retro and Purple. We also saw places within the property area in the reinsurance that we didn't like, and we scaled back accordingly, and that freed up some of the cat load for us to deploy elsewhere. We also talked about and deployed additional hedges, reloaded the cat bonds. And they came in lower, which also freed up some of the EL. And then as Juan said, really trying to continue to diversify the book, which is growth in casualty, growth in mortgage and growth in facultative and specialty non-cat-exposed lines of business as well.
Elyse Greenspan: That's helpful. And then, Craig, you mentioned you were kind of going down into some of the pushes and the pulls in terms of the reserve development. In terms of Bermuda segment, I guess the net number is a small number for the quarter. But could we just get a little bit more color on what you strengthened in terms of property and casualty accounts and the size within that segment?
Craig Howie: Sure, Elyse. First of all as you said, we did take some specific action for both property and casualty in the Bermuda segment. For property, we primarily strengthened reserves for one account, which we no longer write, and also a specific loss related to some very older years. In the casualty side, we strengthened reserves for some specific accounts, including a nonstandard auto account that we wrote in 2015 and 2016. We no longer write this account. The other thing, as you mentioned, there are some puts and takes and there always are. We have over 200 IBNR scenarios. And so you're always going to see some ups and downs. But the other thing that's going on in the Bermuda segment this quarter is we had a one-time commutation of a contract. So that actually served to reduce prior period reserves by about $20 million, and it was offset by about a $20 million commission paid. So essentially, no material impact to the underwriting results in the quarter.
Elyse Greenspan: That's helpful. And then one last question did you guys see any movement in any catastrophe losses, prior year cats in the quarter that offset each other? Or it was just kind of not much movement there in the quarter?
Craig Howie: There's always some movement up and down, Elyse, with respect to catastrophe losses. But overall, our current - our prior year catastrophe losses continue to hold, and there was no overall movement.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Mike Zaremski, Credit Suisse.
Mike Zaremski: Maybe a good commentary in the prepared remarks especially on pricing is there a way to try to frame, I know there's a lot of moving parts, maybe kind of loss cost inflation on the primary insurance casualty side? Are you - is it still kind of stable quarter-over-quarter or some companies are saying it's kind of inching a little higher, curious if any color there?
John Doucette: Good morning Mike, this is John. We definitely - let me go back to sort of what we mentioned in the prepared remarks that we definitely saw a meaningful uptick in the rate environment in the second half of the year. As you mentioned, every line of business has a bit of a different dynamic. We obviously have a process for tracking or viewing rate and trend assumptions across all of our lines of business. But I would tell you that we feel quite confident that the written rate is exceeding trend in virtually every area. It will take a little bit of time for that to earn through. And this is a comment a bit export comp, of course. But even in that case, we're still seeing negative frequency trends. So we're watching all of this. The uptick as I mentioned, of 12% in the quarter ex-comp, that's up from 7.5% in the third quarter, 6.5% in the second quarter, so you get the feel. So we feel really good about the rate environment. We like where we're heading, and we do believe on a rate basis, we are exceeding trend in almost every area.
Mike Zaremski: And lastly, if I look at the paid to incurred loss ratio, excluding catastrophes, it seems like it ticked up a little bit, and it's above 100%. Anything you'd call out there or is it just normal variability?
Craig Howie: I think that's just normal variability, Mike.
Operator: Our next question will come from Amit Kumar, Buckingham Research.
Amit Kumar: Two follow-up questions, the first question goes back, I think to the first question regarding the shift in business mix in the reinsurance segment, casualty market conditions as well as the cat market conditions. When we think about 2020, would that imply based on the shift that the AY ex cat loss ratio should tick-up or not?
Juan Andrade: So Amit, this is Juan. So look I think let me address it in a couple of different ways. So I think, number one, we are seeing a very programmatic shift in business mix in the company. It's something that we started really in 2019, and it will continue into 2020 as we look to manage volatility on the property cat side of things. And that's essentially the commentary that you've heard from both John and I. As far as basically being able to shape a book particularly at the 1/1 renewals, with lower volatility, better margin, et cetera, et cetera. At the same time, it's also the commentary regarding our mortgage book of business, which we continue to see as a terrific opportunity for the company, as well as pockets in casualty. And again, that's not across the board. We are very discerning underwriters in that sense, but we do see pockets of opportunity as we see the primary rates go up, as we see opportunities for tighter terms and conditions and for us to be able to play in that environment. So from that perspective, I think that makes us real. And let me turn it over to John.
John Doucette: Yes good morning Amit. So there are a couple of countervailing currents, and Juan touched on a couple I'll just add. So like what Jon Zaffino said on the primary side, we are seeing, when it comes to the proportional treaties we write in short and certainly in long-tail lines. We're seeing in specialty lines, we are seeing the rate lift. So we have changing mix of business, which is changing our attritional. We also see the rate changes. But similarly as Jon Zaffino said, we would expect that to take a while to earn into the numbers. So net-net-net, we probably look to the full year's attritional loss ratio as a good guide.
Amit Kumar: And the second and I guess final question. Going back to the discussion on the reserve parts movement, if we were to step back, the reserve release number is lower than the prior quarter's trend line. And again, I know that one should not look at any sort of repeat of past patterns. But that said, the number is lower than what it has been in the past was that - maybe this question might be for you, Juan. Is that because of your enrollment, maybe something you saw, maybe just talk about that a bit more?
Juan Andrade: Sure, Amit. Look, keep in mind also that we released a total of $94 million in 2019. So while we had $19 million in this quarter, there was also $75 million in releases in prior quarters throughout 2019. That being said, we do have an ongoing and dynamic process to review our reserves. We do recognize bad news quickly, and we require good news to be proven over a longer period of time. As we do these reserve studies, and if we identify an area where we do need to strengthen, we will take a range of actions. We will increase our loss reserves already on the books, we will increase our current senior loss fix, and we will adjust our pricing targets for new and renewal business. And I think that's some of what you heard Craig described, particularly for the Bermuda segment in the quarter. But also keep in mind that, I think as Jon Zaffino said, while in most classes in this current market, the rate that's being achieved is outpacing the loss trend. In our business, we do need to see results season over time. So that leads me to take a position that is cautious upfront, but frankly, willing to have an upside surprise in the future. So in the meantime, we review, we analyze, we act on our portfolio throughout the year, and that's basically the approach that we will follow and that you saw in this quarter.
Operator: Our next question will come from Yaron Kinar, Goldman Sachs.
Yaron Kinar: Good morning everybody. I guess my first question is around third-party capital. So I think both Mt. Logan and Kilimanjaro capital is down year-over-year. How much of that is a function of the markets or external pressure, timing? Or how much of that is just a function of Everest shrinking the gross property cat exposure growing its equity base?
John Doucette: Good morning Yarn, it's John. So as we talked about, we have this - we've talked about before, we tried to have a holistic hedging program across the cat bonds, across Logan, across traditional and other nontraditional hedges that we have in place to really allow us to have the portfolio match the best capital to risk, manage the P&Ls and reduce the volatility. And we'll dynamically allocate between those based on market conditions, capital availability, really to try to set it up where we're serving our clients and our shareholders the best. In terms of specifically Logan and Kilimanjaro, so cat bonds in general for the entire industry are more out of the money, lower return periods. And they haven't had as many losses over the last couple of years, although there have been some. So there was - capital was tighter there, but we didn't see the same withdrawal to the same extent that more of the alternative capital playing in the sidecars and other kind of just straight up taking reinsurance or retro risks. So I think there was more availability there. And we had specifically decided that we wanted to move this - the new cat bonds lower more into the money and less just to be in the tail. So from an EL relief, actually despite it being less dollars of limit purchased, it was more EL relief than the expiring bonds that we had in place. And in terms of Logan, it really - there's a lot of moving dynamics. There's investors that have come in. There's investors that have scaled up. There's investors that have come out. There are investors that have scaled back. There is clearly - this is an industry comment, not an Everest or Logan comment, but there is investor fatigue with the losses and some of the surprise losses. So I would say, overall, third-party capital is tight right now. You still have trapped capital, even going back to '17, certainly from '18, and then Jebi happening. I mean Jebi and the development there as well as the recent Japanese losses closer to the renewal season also resulted in more trapped capital. So I think net-net, the third-party capital is tighter, and we'll continue to see that throughout 2019.
Juan Andrade: Yaron, the only thing I would add is that the way we access alternative capital in the end of the year and to 1/1 really allowed us to build the capacity to deploy and to improve 1/1 market, as we discussed earlier, particularly to our retro and PURPLE products, while helping us to manage our volatility and our P&L. And so for us, that was very strategic.
Yaron Kinar: Understood, I appreciate the thoughtful answer. And then my next question, probably for Jon Zaffino on the insurance side. So margins - underlying margins seemed very stable year-over-year, had a pretty good ratio there. But nonetheless, I think we did see an uptick at the end of the year, both in the expense ratio and the loss ratio, underlying loss ratio? Can you maybe talk about that and is that just normal volatility or is that something that you really maybe - was a step change or a small step change, I guess, into the end of the year?
Jonathan Zaffino: Yes, thanks for the question. Let me try to provide some additional color on this. So let me - I'll start with taking on a couple of parts. First off, as you mentioned, we do think the year-to-date number is a better gauge and more reflective of our performance. As respect to the attritional loss ratio and that 140 basis point increase you saw in the quarter, there is noise in the quarter emanating predominantly from an unallocated loss adjustment expense, a UA expense catch-up that affected the attritional loss ratio. Excluding that catch-up, the pure attritional loss ratio actually declined by about 100 basis points. Then again on a year-to-date basis, the attritional is flat basically for the full year. I also want to add, and if you recall in prior calls, we did take a more conservative view of our work comp book earlier in the year. So, on a year-to-date basis, that's also creating about a 70 basis point headwind, if you will to the year-over-year comparative. As respects, the expense ratio, as Craig mentioned, we experienced favorable prior period development in our work comp book as we have for the past couple of years, and associated with that was a one-time profit commission, which caused the commission ratio to go up a bit in the quarter. Absent of that, we had about a 200 basis point improvement in the commission ratio. And secondly, there were some timing issues associated with expense accruals in 4Q. And we also had some prior year lower incentive comp accruals based on company performance, et cetera. So that just hopefully gives you a little bit of color as to sort of what was going on in the quarter. But again, we think the full year numbers are more indicative of our run rate and our trend.
Operator: Our next question will come from Meyer Shields, KBW.
Meyer Shields: I want to look at the reserves from maybe a different perspective. When we look on a full year basis, we're seeing a little bit of a decrease in dollars of reserve release. Is it fair to say that the gap between the conservative numbers that you're booking and the ASCO numbers out there that, that gap is shrinking?
Craig Howie: Meyer, overall, I would say, the conservative numbers that we're booking come from how we select our loss picks over a long period of time. In other words, that's part of our annual planning process, and we take into account factors like rate change and loss trend and historical loss ratios. And as we set those reserves, we go through this process with our reserving actuaries, our pricing actuaries, our underwriting and our claims area as well as management. We select from various metrics, whether that be prior year loss selections, the plan, the bridge, which takes into account our - both rate and trend. And then we also have the reserve studies that come from the reserving actuaries. And then we also look at how the business is priced and how the underwriters select those loss picks. We go through that. We also compare that to our actual reported loss experience. And then we modify it each quarter as we go through the reserve committee meetings and the underlying assumptions. As I said before, we have over 200 IBNR categories that we look at, and some are - some go up each quarter, and some come down each quarter as we look at this and as we go through the reserve studies. So what I would say to you is the process has not changed. We continue to go through that process. We continue to quickly recognize unfavorable development that we're seeing in that process, but we tend to hold or recognize favorable development over a much longer period of time. So as I would say to you and I've said to you before, we continue to hold the more recent years. And again, this quarter, we took action on some specific accounts. But overall, the process has not changed over time.
Meyer Shields: Second question, I guess international reinsurance had a phenomenal attritional loss ratio. Was there anything unusual or was that just a true-up for the full year?
Craig Howie: Essentially, for international it's not necessarily a true-up. What I would say to you is in that - in those areas of the world, and what I'm talking about here are Latin America, Brazil, Middle East and Africa. What we saw was fewer non-catastrophe-type storms in those regions, which allowed us to take down what we would call property-related loss picks that would fall below our cat threshold for that period. So that's what you're seeing come down in the fourth quarter for that region.
Operator: Our next question will come from Brian Meredith, UBS.
Brian Meredith: Yes thanks, just a couple of quick ones here. First, what was the impact of the crop loss in the quarter on the underlying combined ratio at reinsurance? And was it all U.S. reinsurance or was it elsewhere as well?
Craig Howie: So it happened in two separate regions, Brian. But essentially, it's $50 million.
Brian Meredith: Yes.
Craig Howie: And the two separate regions are U.S. reinsurance as well as it happened in Canada as well. So from a total reinsurance perspective overall, the $50 million is about 3.5 points for the quarter and about one point overall for the year.
Brian Meredith: And then I guess, one bigger picture question, curious, for Juan and Jon. Given the magnitude of growth that you're seeing right now in your insurance operation can you talk about - I mean and I see that obviously, your expenses are up, so you're kind of adding people and stuff. Talk about how you get comfortable with the magnitude of growth that's going on right now. I mean I know it's a good rate environment, but substantial, substantial growth has done and how you're controlling that?
Juan Andrade: Yes, sure so let me start that, and then I'll hand it over to Jon Zaffino. So I think it's important to recognize where the growth is coming from, right? And I think as Jon illustrated in his prepared remarks, it's really from a couple of buckets right so increased rate is certainly part of that. Keeping in mind that we did have a 12% increase in rate in the quarter, excluding workers' compensation, so that's certainly part of the lift. The other part of the lift that we're seeing is about 40% of our business and growing is exposed to the E&S space, which is really where we've seen the majority of the opportunity come up at this point in time. We also had very good renewal retention. If we look at our retail book of business, it's really in the mid to high 80s, and our E&S retention is in a good place. So you look at those three things: an increase in rate, opportunity particularly in the E&S space, solid renewal retention. And on top of that, you add the fact that we've added about 60 additional underwriters throughout 2019 and starting to get essentially the picture where that growth is coming from. Now specific to your question on how we manage this, et cetera. That is some of the investments that you're seeing us continue to make, both in technology as well as infrastructure for the company. One of the things too that I think is unique to us is that we have a very focused distribution footprint, and so we know who has the business that we want. We're trying to increase the shelf space with them, and we're not out there buying to basically grow with everybody. So that also allows us to have a much more focused presence from a distribution standpoint that's out there. But investments in technology, investments in our target operating model, et cetera all basically give us comfort that the growth that we're seeing is something that is sustainable for us, which at the end of the day, is really the most important thing, it’s really sustainable, profitable growth. Jon?
Jonathan Zaffino: Yes no I think thanks Juan that's really well said. I would just sort of maybe echo a couple of Juan's points here. Number one and you could see it in the supplement, our growth is balanced and diversified across our chosen product areas and maybe to amplify a couple of Juan's points. Our growth in the E&S market is growing faster than our top line overall. So we are taking advantage of that. So the comment on our rate and exposure lift, that accounted for about 20% of our growth in the fourth quarter, so just to give you an order of magnitude there. And then yes, we're well positioned with our trading partners. The value they see and what Everest can bring to the table is creating basically record submission flows. We're well into the 150,000-plus submission activity. So, all that together in conjunction to what Juan said, is what's sort of creating this environment.
Operator: Thank you very much. At this time, we have no further questions in the queue. So I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing comments.
Juan Andrade: Well, thank you for your questions and allowing us to talk about the year and the quarter. As I mentioned before, we are very well positioned for 2020. We were very pleased with our 1/1 renewals, and we're excited with the momentum that we continue to see in our insurance business going forward. So with that, we look forward to updating you at the end of the first quarter. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time this now concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your phone lines, and have a great rest of the week. Thank you.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-10-29 10:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Everest Re Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jon Levenson. Please go ahead, sir.
Jon Levenson: Thank you, Holly, and welcome to the Everest Re Group Limited 2019 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. The Everest executives leading today's call are Dom Addesso, President and Chief Executive Officer; Juan Andrare, Chief Operating Officer; Craig Howie, EVP and Chief Financial Officer; John Doucette, EVP and President and CEO of the Reinsurance Division; and Jonathan Zaffino, EVP and President and CEO of the Everest Insurance Division. Before we begin, I need to preface the comments on today's call by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. Management comments regarding estimates, projections and similar are subject to the risks, uncertainties and assumptions as noted in these SEC filings.  Management may also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These items are reconciled in our earnings release and financial supplements.  With that, I turn the call over to Dom Addesso.
Dominic Addesso: Thanks, Jon, and good morning, and welcome to our call. In the third quarter, Everest produced operating earnings of $3.39 per share despite experiencing $280 million of cat losses. Our underlying performance continued to be excellent as our attritional underwriting gain of $250 million nearly offset the catalysts. On a year-to-date basis, our underwriting profit was $365 million and $700 million, excluding cats. This is a solid outcome and demonstrates our ability to absorb cat volatility due to a large and well-diversified book of business. When combined with another solid quarter of investment income, the year-to-date operating income is at $742 million. These outcomes are being driven by an organization that has evolved dramatically over the last several years due to an intentional strategic focus and supported by market conditions. What you see, for example, is a continued effort to reduce cat volatility as a result of growth, diversification and exposure reductions. In reinsurance, the growth has been focused largely on mortgage risk and casualty lines where rates, terms and conditions have been improving. Keep in mind that our cushion for these lines, especially casualty, was of a more recent vintage. For many years, we deemphasized casualty. Only recently, as the market has been improving, have we been growing premium. The greatest diversifier, however, has been our successful push into the specialty insurance space. By year-end, we will be closing in on $3 billion of annual gross premium. And as you have seen, the profit picture there remains solid.  Our timing on these initiatives has been good. Rates are improving in many sectors. And, yes, while there have been pockets of frequency and severity trends to take note of, these are managed through conservative loss picks through the cycle. We're in a long-term business, and at times, cost of goods sold may seem uncertain, but we are less worried about that and what we see on trend versus rate given our book of business and where we have it pegged. The market is poised to continue higher as it grapples with trend, increasing weather events and anemic investment returns on new money, but now is not the time to retreat.  With that, let me pass it over to my colleagues to give you some of the details around the story. First, to Juan Andrade, who, as you know, is my successor effective January 1. Juan?
Juan Andrade: Thank you, Dom. It's a privilege to be here as a member of the Everest team. After 8 weeks on the job, I've had the opportunity to start getting deep into our businesses and to meet our employees, major customers and our key distribution partners in the U.S. and around the world. I'm very appreciative for Dom's support and that of the entire leadership team as we transition responsibilities at the end of the year. Dom has built a great business that we will continue to advance.  Everest is well positioned for the current market environment. We have a highly diversified franchise with a strong team of smart and experienced leaders, a rock-solid balance sheet and enduring customer relationships. I have been very pleased with the talent, division, the energy, the focus and the pride in Everest that everyone I have met has shown. The feedback that I have received from our customers has been universally positive. They value the longevity of our trading relationships, our financial strength and sizable capacity, our knowledgeable underwriters and the access to products in the right locations, along with our responsiveness and innovation. We have 2 very strong and complementary businesses. We are a top 10 global reinsurer with a 47-year history. We have a seasoned and strong underwriting team around the globe, broad product capabilities, a dynamic strategy that is responsive to market conditions, best-in-class data-driven management systems and a competitive expense advantage. We also have an entrepreneurial and growing primary specialty insurance business with a client-first culture of providing solutions with more than 150 products and services. This team is led by highly skilled industry professionals who are focused on sustainable profitability and growth and who have the underwriting discipline and built the tools and processes required to ensure continued success. While being very cognizant to the challenges facing our industry, we also see opportunity. These industry challenges are resulting in improving pricing and terms and conditions in both insurance and reinsurance. In some classes of business, we are seeing the strongest rate movement in many years. This change in the market is long overdue, and we remain committed to being selective to where we dedicate resources and capacity. At Everest, we will continue to focus on underwriting profitability and sustainable growth with a relentless focus on execution, diversifying our business, always strengthening our enduring relationships, managing our cat exposure and maintaining our strong balance sheet that provides the foundation for the security that we provide to our customers. I am optimistic about the future of Everest. We have a strong franchise that is positioned to succeed regardless of market conditions.  With that, I turn the call over to Craig.
Craig Howie: Thank you, Juan, and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter of 2019, Everest reported net income of $104 million. This compares to net income of $198 million for the third quarter of 2018. On a year-to-date basis, Everest had net income of $792 million compared to net income of $474 million for the first 9 months of 2018. The 2019 result represents an annualized net income return on equity of 13%. These results were driven by a strong underwriting performance across the group, our highest quarterly investment income in the last 9 years and lower catastrophe losses compared to the first 9 months of 2018. In the third quarter of 2019, the group incurred $280 million of net pretax catastrophe losses compared to $230 million in the third quarter of 2018. The catastrophe losses related to Hurricane Dorian at $160 million and Typhoon Faxai at $120 million. On a year-to-date basis, the results reflected net pretax estimated catastrophe losses of $335 million in 2019 compared to $795 million in 2018.  Everest reported $52 million of favorable prior year reserve development in the quarter. This primarily related to a onetime commutation of a multiyear contract that reduced prior year carried loss reserves by $44 million, which was offset by $44 million of commission paid, effectively no material impact to the underwriting result in the quarter. Another $4 million of the favorable development was identified through reserve studies completed in the third quarter of 2019. Excluding the catastrophe events and favorable prior year development, the underlying book continues to perform well with an overall current year attritional combined ratio of 87.7% through the first 9 months compared to 87.0% for the full year of 2018. This increase was primarily due to the business mix in the reinsurance segment, which, as we have noted, has been writing more casualty business over the past several quarters. Turning to investments. Pretax investment income was $181 million for the quarter and $501 million year-to-date on our $20 billion investment portfolio. Investment income was up $60 million or 14% from 1 year ago. This result is primarily driven by the growth in investment assets coming from our record cash flow, which was $1.5 billion during the first 9 months. Some of the strong cash flow comes from the increase in overall premium volume, including an increase in the casualty writings, which has a longer tail and allows us to invest the money longer.  Before moving to taxes, I'd like to point out that we included, for the first time, on Page 15, in the financial supplement a split of our net investment income between the Insurance segment and total reinsurance. This shows an indication of the contribution provided by each segment to pretax operating income and reflects $361 million allocated to reinsurance and $140 million of net investment income allocated to the Insurance segment. The split is based on gross carried loss reserves, excluding catastrophe reserves. We are including this information to better demonstrate the total contribution by business segment and illustrate the unrecognized embedded value of the growing insurance franchise. This is consistent with previous comments, encouraging investors to look at Everest on a sum-of-the-parts basis. On income taxes, the tax benefit we recorded in the quarter was the result of the amount and geography of the losses associated with the catastrophes and the favorable prior year reserve development associated with the onetime commutation of a multiyear contract that I previously mentioned. The year-to-date effective tax rate of 9% is an annualized calculation that includes planned catastrophe losses for the remainder of the year. Higher-than-expected catastrophe losses would cause the tax rate to trend lower than the current 9%.  Shareholders' equity for the group ended the quarter at $9 billion, up over $1 billion or 14% compared to year-end 2018. The increasing shareholders' equity is primarily attributable to the $792 million of net income and the recovery in the fair value of the investment portfolio.  Our balance sheet and overall financial position remain strong. We maintain industry-low debt leverage, a high-quality investment portfolio and continue to generate positive cash flow. You will notice some minor revisions related to foreign exchange in our financial supplement. None of these revisions impact operating income. Thank you. And now John Doucette will provide an review of the reinsurance operations.
John Doucette: Thank you, Craig. Good morning. The magnitude of industry losses over the past 3 years has been extraordinary for the reinsurance market. Although the insurance industry would have hoped for a quieter 2019 to regroup, this has not been the case. The losses have shaken up the primary reinsurance and retro markets, creating dislocation and, in turn, opportunity. Though not an across-the-board traditional hard market, we see a foundationally more sustainable environment for the near and medium term in many lines. Multiple factors are pushing the market, including 2017, '18 and '19 cat losses, with corresponding trapped capital and negative sentiment for ILS; emerging industry loss trends in casualty; improving primary market and underwriting actions taken by major participants; and continued low investment income yields. Given the above, we are increasingly optimistic on the treaty and facultative global reinsurance market heading into renewal and our improving opportunity to deploy capital profitably in 2020 and beyond.  We continue to see increased demand for reinsurance globally driven by our clients' desire to reduce volatility, manage regulatory capital constraints and decrease net capacity deployed. That increase in demand, in conjunction with improved insurance and reinsurance pricing, terms and conditions, will result in more opportunities hitting our underwriting requirements and pricing targets. At the same time, the supply of reinsurance capital is relatively flat or down, considering trapped capital, given that over 50% of the retro capacity is supported by unrated, alternative capital. And there will be more collateral trapped by the recent events, in addition to the remaining collateral still trapped from the 2017 and '18 events. Not all rated reinsurers are positioned to write multiple classes of business across all territories to clients large and small, but we are. With our solid financial strength and ratings, multi-decades long trading relationships, we are one of the few global reinsurers writing in all P&C lines in most developed territories, making us well positioned to take advantage of these positive trends to drive differentiated results. Year-to-date reinsurance premium is $4.7 billion, up 3% from last year. Growth in our business is being driven by increased casualty writings, more proportional business, mortgage, more treaties with our global clients and increased back opportunities. This growth was muted by the reunderwriting of some portions of our property book as we pushed pricing and reduced lines or came off programs that did not meet our required pricing targets. Year-to-date, reinsurance underwriting profits are $310 million, impacted this quarter by the Dorian and Faxai losses mentioned by Craig.  Year-to-date reinsurance attritional losses are 57.5% compared to 57.0% for the full year 2018 due predominantly to shift in mix, increased casualty business as well as overall more proportional business to capture the primary rate movements. This is offset by increased mortgage writings which have a lower combined ratio. Heading into the renewal season, we are optimistic about the market conditions in casualty, fac, mortgage and certain property markets, including retro and loss-affected areas.  In U.S. casualty, reinsurance terms are improving. Primary rates are increasing on loss-affected programs, along with some tightening of terms and conditions. Some market participants have signaled reducing capacity. Combined, this results in some interesting opportunities. Since 2018, we have been increasing our casualty reinsurance writings based on these improving conditions, and this trend will likely continue heading into January 1 renewals.  Facultative is seeing meaningful, increased submission activity globally, improved rates and terms in both property and casualty, resulting in an increased business at much improved economics. As mentioned last quarter, our global fac book is well over $400 million gross written premium in force, and we see continued growth opportunities there given favorable market conditions. Fac is typically a leading indicator of client risk appetite, and therefore, shows increased future demand for our treaty capacity.  The global impact of Lloyd's and other major insurers reunderwriting is meaningful. Significant premium is coming to market, which is then subject to increased rate and improved terms and conditions. This is in addition to some large primary insurers tightening capacity and pushing rate in both property and casualty lines. The mortgage market remains favorable as the large GSEs, Fannie and Freddie, continue to privatize risk. Our well-seasoned mortgage portfolio continues to produce strong earnings with growth potential. Currently, our annualized mortgage book is about $200 million of gross written premium, including many multiyear deals with future premium that has not yet been recognized. We continue to proactively scrutinize relevant economic trends and underwriting standards which remain attractive, and we'll continue to look for more opportunities there.  Given these multiple areas to deploy profitably our capital, our pricing targets for cat-exposed property reinsurance and retro continue to rise. We remain committed to manage volatility to our long-standing disciplined underwriting, robust portfolio construction and through increased property hedging in both traditional and alternative hedges. The current property momentum is generally favorable and likely will last well into 2020, but additional improvement in rates, terms and conditions are required in global property reinsurance and retro markets given the elevated risk factors and increased exposures in certain territories as well as the recent substantial industry losses. More rate is required to get back to adequate levels to achieve a long-term, appropriate and sustainable return on capital. Concentrating property underwriting on our core clients has created a better risk-adjusted portfolio with significantly more dollars of profit per unit of risk, and we do have the capacity to increase our participation in improving markets when returns increase enough to warrant.  We expect January 1 property rates to generally be up in most regions, and more recently loss-affected territories will see greater impacts. In retro, we anticipate double-digit rate increases. With Hagibis causing further losses and trapped capital late in the year and uncertainty of ultimate loss, rates may improve more. Improvement in retro is necessary given those rates have been under the most pressure by nontraditional capital but also because retro bore a disproportionate share of losses since 2017. Everest has the capital and capability to effectively write in this market. We believe there will be select opportunities to deploy additional capital depending on market conditions. Overall, we are in a reinsurance market where favorable trends exist for those able to capture and maximize the best opportunities. With our financial strength, nimble culture, global capabilities and diversified capital sources, we are prepared to meet our clients' needs while delivering superior results to our shareholders. Thank you, and now I will turn it over to Jon Zaffino to review our insurance operations.
Jonathan Zaffino: Thanks, Jon. Good morning. Everest Insurance has just completed another quarter of solid execution, resulting in excellent top line growth, and more importantly, continued profitability. We continue to advance our strategy to build a world-class, diversified Specialty Insurance Group fueled by talent, partnerships and a deep set of specialty products that are well positioned within this changing market. Our solid results this quarter billed on the first 2 quarters of this year and marked the 19th consecutive quarter of growth for the insurance operations. Our gross written premium growth of 29% quarter-over-quarter is once again balanced across all major business segments. Our growth accelerated this quarter beyond our year-to-date trend line of plus 21%, in part, reflecting the changing nature of the market which is impacting nearly all major product lines. This is particularly the case for business originated within the excess and surplus line market, which accounted for over 1/3 of our premium written in the quarter.  Our new business this quarter provides some additional context on our balanced growth. It was driven by a multitude of areas, reflecting the specialty nature of our portfolio, including specialty casualty, which, once again, experienced meaningful rate increases in the quarter; our property and short-tail businesses, led by both our retail and excess and surplus property divisions, both of which also achieved meaningful rate increases; and our various other specialty product lines, including transactional risk, credit and political risk and surety. Each of these businesses continues to see meaningful increases in opportunity. The segments I just referenced make up approximately 75% of our business growth in the quarter and represent the balanced portfolio we seek to build. The combined ratio for the quarter is 96.4%, 3.2 points better than the third quarter of 2018 and year-to-date is 96% or 2.1 points better year-over-year. This is due to both lower catastrophe losses impacting our repositioned property portfolios and to an improved attritional loss ratio. The expense ratio remained stable despite our continued commitment toward investments in people, technology, new business units and new facilities. New underwriting capabilities established in Bermuda and the regulatory approval of the London branch of our Irish insurance company are good examples of these new facilities and represent our continued commitment to international expansion. Further, new and expanded office locations in the U.S. are bringing us closer to the customers and trading partners we serve. Turning to the rate environment. We are encouraged by the results we see here. In the quarter, we experienced pure rate increases, which exclude the impact of exposure of 7.6%, excluding workers' compensation, and a positive 6.7% year-to-date. The quarterly ex work comp rate increase is the largest increase seen since the second quarter of 2012 and continues to be led by double-digit rate increases within our property and commercial auto portfolios.  Financial line in umbrella, excess are also showing improvement in the mid- to high-single digits, while general liability rate lift continues to build momentum with rate increases in the mid-single-digit range. The London wholesale market is also improving, showing double-digit improvement this quarter driven by professional indemnity, management liability and property. Year-to-date, International is showing a 7% improvement.  We are very well positioned to take advantage of this improved pricing environment. In terms of our people, product set and our ability to offer compelling solutions to the market. This, coupled with strong retention rates within both our wholesale and retail books, is an encouraging sign. In other words, the strategic plan we have been executing over the last several years has positioned us well in this current rate environment.  Most importantly, this growth in top line, coupled with improved business metrics, has resulted in Everest Insurance continuing to post an underwriting profit over 2x greater for the year-to-date period and now standing at 10 of the past 11 quarters. As Craig mentioned in the new investment disclosure, the pretax net investment income for insurance is $140 million year-to-date, thus our pretax operating income year-to-date now stands at $195 million, an excellent result.  In conclusion, we remain pleased with the continued progress we are making and the establishment of a world-class specialty insurer. The over 90,000 new business submissions we have received year-to-date in our direct broker operations speak to our relevance and positioning in this market. Further, the underlying performance of our diverse books of business remain solid, and hence, we are well positioned to create value for all of our constituents in the evolving market ahead.  We look forward to reporting back to you on our progress next quarter. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Holly for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. We will now take our first question from Amit Kumar from Buckingham Research Group.
Amit Kumar: And welcome to Juan on the conference call. One question and one follow-up. Maybe I'll start with Juan. With you coming onboard, and I know you mentioned that you've been meeting people, et cetera, over the past 2 months. Do you have a view on Everest Re's reserves? And will you be doing some sort of a ground-up reserve review as we head into year-end?
Juan Andrade: Thanks, Amit, and thank you for the welcome on that. And, look, as you pointed out, I've had the opportunity to actually travel quite extensively over the past 2 months, meeting people, reviewing our businesses, et cetera. With the point specifically on reserves, I have had a number of discussions with our actuarial team, and what I can tell you is that Everest has a very solid process. Expected loss ratios are reflective of our best current information, industry data and other data sources. We also have very experienced underwriters who know their business, and they proactively work to mitigate known potential and unknown exposures, and the company also reacts to bad news quicker than good news. So we're constantly analyzing, taking actions on these findings and constantly repeating this process to ensure the strength of our balance sheet. Frankly, this process has resulted in Everest initial loss ratio picks developing, on average, over the last -- over 2 points favorable, including cats, over the past 10 years. And again, I think that's an important point that we have seen favorable development, on average, of 2 points over the last 10 years from our initial loss ratio picks. So I believe that we have a solid process, and we're constantly reviewing this performance of our business, and we will take action if it's warranted.
Amit Kumar: Got it. That's helpful. And the only follow-up, and I will re-queue. This might be for Dom or Mr. Zaffino. Going back to the growth in the Insurance segment, I think 21%. I know we discussed this on the last call. However, in some of the recent conference calls, there have been further alarm bells on the loss cost trends, the discussion on social inflation, the total environment, even the underlying loss cost trends. Does this give you a reason to maybe slow down the growth from here? Or how are you thinking about the rate versus your loss cost trend metric?
Dominic Addesso: Let me start, and I'll ask Jon to jump in as well. As we previously mentioned in the opening comments, any new business opportunities that we take on appropriately contemplate trend, frequency and severity, et cetera. And obviously, we've been getting rate increase for the last couple of years in many of the lines. I'd also point out that, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, our loss picks that we put on these books of business are very conservative from the very beginning and reflect those trends that we're all concerned about. In fact, relative to the market, I'll point out that, take commercial auto for example, we've been increasing our loss pick there for the last couple of years in recognition of those trends. Similarly on excess liability, the same thing, although we're not necessarily seeing any spike in claims activity. But in anticipation of some of the noise within the marketplace, again, we're picking a conservative number. Likewise on workers' compensation where we've seen rate decreases, we've also been increasing our loss selection there. Although that line of business continues to trend very favorably from a loss reserve perspective. So we certainly share the market's concerns over these issues. But as I've mentioned earlier, we think we have them properly ring-fenced. And we'll see what the future will tell for that. And, Jon, do you have anything to potentially add to that?
Jonathan Zaffino: Yes. Let me touch on the growth for a second in the quarter here, and there's really 5 or 6 things we're seeing as contributory to the growth. First and foremost, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, it's all increased rate opportunity that we're seeing across the board almost, excluding workers' compensation, combined with pretty solid renewal retention. So if you recall from prior quarters, there was a lot of portfolio reshaping, repositioning going on. We've seen that stabilize, so our retention ratios are much stronger than they have been. Secondly, as I mentioned, we're seeing a lot of opportunity in the E&S space. Submission flows are through the roof. We're seeing a lot more opportunity there, a lot of dislocation, and it's predicated off of a number of different factors, but we're certainly taking advantage of that. And then somewhat linked to that is the growth in our underwriting population. Over the last year, we sort of stopped the clock at third quarter of '18 to say we've increased the underwriting population by almost 20%. So we have more people, wonderful talent across the board who's able to respond to this market change and condition, and we're taking advantage of that. The other piece I'll point out is even as you look at the supplement, even in our -- some of our specialty casualty areas -- remember, very little of what we do is standard business. This is a specialty company. So while it might be in a certain line like GL, we will write GL out of 12, 13 different areas, each with various tones of specialization. And as Dom mentioned, we're going to react to trends as we see them. We're constantly monitoring for those and react accordingly. So you almost have to deconstruct those buckets to really get the -- to feel what's happening underneath there, but we're comfortable where we're at.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo.
Elyse Greenspan: My first question. Was hoping, Juan, to get some color from you just in terms of thinking about Everest's outbound retro strategy for next year, if you have a view in terms of using cat bonds, ILWs or traditional retro within the outbound purchases. And I guess, just on an overall basis, you guys alluded to retro rates increasing substantially at 1/1, and so retro rates really do skyrocket next year. Would you have to shrink your kind of curve capacity if you aren't able to buy that coverage?
Juan Andrade: Sure, Elyse. So let me start, and I'll ask John Doucette to add some color to that. Look, I think as John Doucette mentioned in his remarks, we are seeing a change in the retro market. There's a lot of trapped capital currently out there, particularly from the events in '17, '18 and '19. And as a Jon mentioned, the majority of that retro really has been without alternative capital. As far as rated carriers are concerned, this does create an opportunity for us to get additional rate that is much needed in that space and for us to have essentially opportunities for growth there, albeit on a disciplined way of doing that. So we are looking at opportunities for growth in that space right now, and I think John can give you a little bit more color on our strategy.
John Doucette: Yes. Thanks, Juan. So part of the rationale as to how we built the strategy of how we think of hedging the book is we want to get it to the right net risk appetite and then also shape the book to where we want, more here or less there, in terms of net position. But very importantly is we have -- and we've talked about this a lot. We have a variety of hedges, different products, different durations, different attachment points, different territories, frankly, different investor pools of capital that we're -- that we've been tapping into. And that's the cap on capital pool is different than the Logan investor pool is different than our traditional reinsurance and retro hedges that we put in place, different than ILWs. And what we have built is a suite of those that are a lot more robust than any one of them individually. And I would note that, particularly with the cat bonds, and this was intentional, the cat bonds that we do are on a multiyear basis. And we are one of the largest, if not the largest, sponsor of the catastrophe bonds in the world on the property side. And those basically, year-over-year, will have no increase in the cost of hedging. And so that provides a nice, stable anchor to our hedging strategy, and then -- and again, we'll look at all -- across the whole suite of the different hedges that we have. We'll look at that in terms of how -- what we want to do where and based on availability and price and execution and things like that.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. And then my second question. If we could -- do you guys have an initial view on the Q4 cat losses for Everest? We obviously had another typhoon in Japan. You also have the California fires and some events within Texas. And, Craig, in terms of taking to the Q4 tax, can you just kind of guide us in terms of tax rate for the fourth quarter as well?
Dominic Addesso: Let me start, and I'll then ask Craig to mention the tax rate. It's really early days on assessing Hagibis. You've seen, I'm sure, what the modeling firms have put out in one particular case. The range is pretty wide, and it's really too soon for us to direct the market on where that loss is ending up. We obviously have other events, Faxai, that can be used somewhat as a guidepost. But even in that particular case, it is still very early in assessing where that might end up. Although, obviously, we feel we've reserved it conservatively at the high end of the range. So we can't give any guidance at this point until we know more. And the minute we know more, I'll come up with an estimate. We certainly will be potentially disclosing that. And, Craig, why don't you...
Craig Howie: Elyse, this is Craig. With respect to taxes, I mentioned in my comments one of the things that we look at from an effective tax rate standpoint is the number that we gave for this quarter is an annualized number. It's essentially a 9% rate. If the catastrophe estimates for the fourth quarter are higher than our planned catastrophe estimates for the fourth quarter, we would expect that rate to be lower than the 9% rate. As far as what's in the plan for the fourth quarter, we've given you guidance before that our average annual cat load is just under 7 points of cat and about 1/4 of that would be in our planned cat load for the fourth quarter.
Dominic Addesso: Keep in mind that -- I know you're trying to get to a specific number on the P&L. But in fact, to the whole notion of how we manage cat exposure, we do manage cat exposure on an after-tax basis. Clearly, some markets don't have the ability to do that because they're in a tax-free jurisdiction, but we look at our net cat exposure on an after-tax basis. So we think we have a unique ability to take on business in a tax-efficient manner.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Brian Meredith from UBS.
Brian Meredith: Yes. John, I'm just curious your commentary about more renewals and solid pricing and what's happening here. If you break that down, what are you looking at as far as Europe goes? Because Europe, I don't think it's had quite the cat activity. And could that potentially offset some of the -- kind of good pricing we're seeing in retro when we look at the total picture?
John Doucette: Yes. Brian, it's John. Yes. I mean, look, we write $6 billion to $7 billion premium all over the world, all products, all lines and across large clients, small clients. There's going to be pockets that we think are doing better. We'll try to allocate more pockets that aren't necessarily doing as well. There'll be less. And to your point, so we went to -- this is the conference season. So several of us went to Monte Carlo, and there was a lot of bullish talk on pricing there. Then we -- some of us went to CIAB out in Colorado, and it was more bullish there. Part of that is the timing. Part of that is the territory. And then a lot of our underwriters just recently came from APCIA, and we're more bullish still. So we're seeing -- generally, I think we're feeling like there's some momentum building on the pricing, but there are definitely pockets of that, that, that wouldn't apply too as much. And in bottom, the conversation was more muted, partially because of the loss activity over the last few years. And right now, going on now is the Asian conference, SIRC. So we're looking to get feedback there. But part of -- as we really think about this global portfolio and how we dynamically allocate it, we'll do that in real time based on where we see the opportunity set for us best to deploy our capital.
Brian Meredith: Great. And then just quickly on the Insurance side, I'm just curious. Big growth in your property short-tail this quarter after it being kind of down for the last several quarters. What kind of happened all of a sudden caused a big shift there?
Jonathan Zaffino: I don't know if it was a big shift as it might look. There are obviously improved market conditions that we're seeing. Some of it has to do with lower year-over-year comps on some deliberate actions we took in the prior year in the portfolio. But overall, we're feeling quite optimistic about the opportunities that are coming in. Obviously, we measure those on a real-time attribution basis, and we can see sort of what's happening. And we're very confident that the book that we're assembling right now is quite strong. So some of it's year-over-year comps, but it was just simply a function of market opportunity and rate.
Brian Meredith: Great, great. And just one other quick one on the Insurance side. Special liability, are you guys seeing the same type of loss trend pressure that others have kind of talked about and reported?
Jonathan Zaffino: We're seeing it as an industry observation, but not as much in our book. If you recall 3 years ago, we took very aggressive corrective action and basically took most of our exposure off, particularly in the public D&O space. So we are watching the same types of events, and we are seeing those. But our book is a bit different, a bit insulated. What we're encouraged by, Brian, is the rate we're seeing. So if we look at it quarter-over-quarter on our professional liability book or our D&O book, it's -- the rates have almost doubled. So we're more constructive on that market going forward, so starting to build some exposure, but we've been a little bit insulated by some of those broader trends.
Dominic Addesso: And that is another series of lines of businesses where we took -- made some loss pick selections higher a couple of years ago. So we have been aggressive in pushing up our loss picks in those lines as well. I mentioned earlier the casualty, in particular, and commercial auto but also on the professional areas, we've been pushing up our loss cost -- pushing up our loss picks.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs.
Yaron Kinar: First question is around losses from Dorian and Faxai. I guess there are many ways to slice and dice this, but one thing I did note was that the market share -- Everest market share of these losses seem to be pretty much in line with the market share of prior losses in these regions for the company. And I would have just thought that maybe that market share should compress, just given the actions that you've taken to shrink your catastrophe exposures. So any thoughts on that?
John Doucette: Yaron, it's John. Overall, we did -- as we reprice the book, we did take -- decreased some net exposure, as you saw in our PML that we stated. And part of it is a function of what we were trying to get to in some of the more of the peak zones, and part of it is a function of where we see the opportunity set. So we have been a very strong supporter, for example, in the Caribbean for a long time. We have developed a very nice attractive book there. And correspondingly, we have a decent market share there. And our intention always is try to have a lower market share of the loss, the market share of the premium as we try to build out the portfolio. But part of it is where the specifics of the losses that happen.
Dominic Addesso: So you would have seen -- I think another way to answer that question is that, as we were trying to reduce some volatility, as John mentioned, looking at our PML disclosures, certainly a big part of the reduction would have occurred in Florida specifically.
Yaron Kinar: Okay. That's helpful. And then my second question just goes back to the Bermuda reinsurance segment where we saw a significant decrease in the commissions and brokerage ratio. Can you maybe talk about that?
Dominic Addesso: Craig, can you...
Craig Howie: Yaron, this is Craig. One of the things that I would encourage you to take a look at with respect to that Bermuda book and the commission lines, specifically, is look at it more on a year-to-date basis. What is included in that line is also contingent commissions, but what you're really seeing is a change in business mix. What we've seen is lower costs on the commissions paid for some of the property pro rata business and some larger global account deals that have been written as well as mortgage. Offsetting this slightly is what you're seeing is a higher loss pick, which is up about one point year-over-year. So again, the idea was to grow the book but to get it -- to grow the book at a better overall margin.
Yaron Kinar: Okay. So I guess we should look at the year-to-date results as maybe a better indicator of the actual run rate?
Craig Howie: Yes. So that's down about 3 points, but that's more in line with where we would expect it to be than the quarter number, yes.
Dominic Addesso: And keep in mind, that highlights the fact that -- we've been saying about improving rates, terms and conditions on the reinsurance portfolio. That evidence fell through in the proportion of business through lower, lower cedes. So that's where we're seeing the benefit of that.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Ryan Tunis from Autonomous Research.
Crystal Lu: This is Crystal Lu in for Ryan Tunis. My first question is about the reserve development this quarter. Can you provide some detail on where the reserve releases came from?
Craig Howie: Sure, Crystal. This is Craig. What I would say to you with respect to the reserve studies that were completed this quarter, essentially what we saw were releases from Canada as well as accident and health on the reinsurance side.
Dominic Addesso: In addition to the mortgage.
Craig Howie: In addition to the -- yes. In addition to what we had said with respect to the commutation of the multiyear deal. But the actual reserve studies that were completed for the quarter were favorable by about $4 million.
Crystal Lu: Okay. That's helpful. And the second question is on capital management. Can you just talk a little bit about your desire to build capital versus return it going forward?
Dominic Addesso: Well, first of all, our strategy around capital has always been to certainly maintain some level of excess capital in order to support the growth that we've had, and you've seen how we've been able to grow the business organically over the last couple of years. So we clearly feel that we do have sufficient capital, and we also feel we have some excess capital. But we have not been, in essence, returning -- buying in any shares over the last several months. As you know, our stated intentions have always been to not be aggressive in terms of buying in shares during catastrophe season. So it doesn't diminish our appetite for share repurchases going forward or in any other forms of returning capital to shareholders once we emerge out of the cat season.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Meyer Shields from KBW.
Meyer Shields: Great. This is, I think, mostly for John Doucette. I'm trying to balance the benefit of accelerating and increasingly earned rate increases against the book of business diversification into higher loss ratio lines. So basically, can you give us a sense as to when the benefits of rate will match or outpace the higher attritional combined associated with more casualty?
John Doucette: That's a multi-faceted question. There's not a simple answer for that. We do look at -- maybe I'll bring it back to kind of our pricing and ROE framework. So we do have a holistic ROE framework that goes across all lines of business, all territories, and that factors in volatility of the lines, historical performance of the lines. It also factors in duration. So we can kind of crystallize things into one view of risk and return based on an ROE framework that we have, and we would see -- and so that would factor in long duration versus short duration, volatile versus nonvolatile and things like that, that allows us to help turn the dials. And again, that will vary all over the place by territory, by line, by client, by size, by product, et cetera.
Dominic Addesso: Keep in mind, too, Meyer, the other thing that I think was worth considering or looking at and things -- something we've referenced in the past is that you've got to be careful about just looking at the combined ratio. And sometimes, you got to pay attention to the dollars, to the bucks. And the reality is, is that when you look at our underwriting result in dollar terms, it's actually gone up year-over-year. So I understand we look at the combined ratios themselves, but we also look at dollars of profit.
Meyer Shields: No. That's very fair. Just a quick follow-up. The Faxai estimate that you guys put out was clearly very conservative. But I'm wondering, now that we've had another typhoon in sort of the same region and the risk of some demand surge associated with that, is there still a risk of, I guess, either industry-wide or Everest's Faxai losses going up?
Dominic Addesso: Oh, I don't know how you answer that, Meyer. You could always say there's a risk to anything, and perhaps there's a risk that it could go down, too. I mean maybe that's the right way to answer it. But we've reserved it what we think is a very conservative level. I think it's been suggested that the industry ranges reflect the risks that you are referencing. So therefore, perhaps it's already embedded in the industry estimates. Look, more than that, we're not certain, but we don't have strong conviction that we're going to be short. Put it that way, best way I could say it.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Mike Zaremski from Crédit Suisse.
Michael Zaremski: Dom, first off, congrats on a successful career at Everest, and all the best to you. My first question -- as I've taken everything's been said on the call so far, it feels like if we think about on the casualty side that you're saying the trend is well within rate increases. And then also, I think, Dom, you mentioned you guys have been underweight in some of the lines that might be causing some higher trend for -- more so for your peers. I'm just kind of curious. Is there a fear factor in the broader marketplace right now in the casualty side causing rates to move so much? Or is it truly a change in loss trend coming into the marketplace or both?
Dominic Addesso: I think it's -- it could be a number of factors, and I'll ask certainly any of my colleagues here to chime in as well. I do think that the marketplace is seeing trend, clearly, which, again, we feel that we've either accommodated through rate increase and/or a higher loss pick. And just to stay on that point for just a second, I think you'll find that if you examine our lines of businesses that we are near the high end, if not at the high end, or even above many industry loss estimates for the industry loss picks. So we have reserved it conservatively. And clearly, with our mid-90s combined ratio and you back off a very competitive expense ratio of lower than average expense ratio, you back into a loss ratio that I think you'll find is, again, above the industry. And that's not because of our book of businesses. It's because we conservatively selected a loss space. So just to focus on that for just a second.  But I do think, back to your question, factoring will be trend. The factor will be perhaps some of the industry maintaining their loss picks through a softening cycle and perhaps they're seeing some of the redundancy, if have had redundancies, start to erode. That's a factor as well. Certainly, anemic investment returns, meaning an increasing desire or need to have an increasing underwriting return. Those are all factors that impact any underwriter's view or any management's or executives' view of where the market needs to go.
John Doucette: Yes. And, Mike, this is John Doucette, and I just want to add a little more color from the reinsurance side. So, yes, we have been underweight over the last several years, and I encourage you all to go back and look at what we've been saying about casualty going back 6 or 7 -- starting 6 or 7 years ago, where we talked about concern of worsening casualty markets, broadening terms and conditions and some emerging risks. And clearly, increased ceding commissions on the reinsurance side. A lot of that is now coming to fruition. So it's exactly what we have been talking about in reunderwriting and managing our portfolio for a long time, which we think puts us in a good stead going forward to take advantage. We are seeing some of the larger buyers come back into the market, and that can have a meaningful impact on the reinsurance market. So a lot of those losses also had stayed with some of the large globals who have been buying less. And I think the pendulum swinging back now as they're looking to help decrease their net lines as well as the underwriting results that they're doing on a gross basis. So we think that will certainly impact the market. So a combination of what we had done starting 6 or 7 years ago as well as the opportunity set that we have with our ratings and balance sheet and positioning with the large global clients who have very, very tight reinsurance security list and a whole lot of reinsurers either don't qualify or aren't allocated large lines to them, we think puts us in a good stead for what we see as an improving casualty market going forward.
Michael Zaremski: That's helpful points. And finally -- yes, please.
Jonathan Zaffino: No. I was just going to add one quick point from insurance side. And just to be clear, I don't think we dispute the fact that there is trend. There is trend. I think what Dom is referencing is we've made conservative loss selection, but I'll give you a for instance here on our commercial auto book. On the insurance side, I just want to remind you, it's less than 10% of our total premium. So it's not a big part of what we do. Our accident years '13 through '16, we took corrective measures all throughout the reserving processes, and so we did see the average development. The reality is we have already taken the measures to address that. So just a quick point. We're not disputing the fact that there is trend. It's real, but I think some of the measures we've taken are giving impact.
Dominic Addesso: Thanks, Mike.
Michael Zaremski: Okay. That's helpful. And lastly just maybe for John Doucette. You spoke about property reinsurance and about there being elevated risks and more rate needed to reach "adequate levels." So I guess do you feel that in the segment of the crop cat market that maybe isn't earning its cost of capital today, and so we need to see double-digit plus rate increases to kind of get more bullish on you guys growing that portfolio meaningfully?
John Doucette: Yes. There's a lot of moving parts there. And so a lot of it is a function of what, where the losses have happened and frankly what the response for the market and what the response of some of our clients is to losses. And $250 billion, $350 billion of losses we sometimes have a disagreement with some of our clients in terms of what the right price equilibrium should be after the losses have happened. And you look at different brokers put out different rating indices. And while we have seen some rate, that's kind of coming back. That's building back up to some of the rate decreases that have been happening since in 2011, 2012, and we watch that carefully. So we are looking. It will vary -- certainly, there's been underwriting issues that we've been focused on in terms of reunderwriting and managing our wildfire exposure and things like that, that we had focused on.  So there's a variety of conditions that -- where we're going to get to. But we're going to deploy capacity where we think we're getting paid the best. We're going to deploy capacity behind long-term strategic clients, and that will vary by product, and then we'll allocate. And this is important that I don't think people realize as much. We also move between excess loss -- cat ex loss versus proportional versus per risk, and we'll move that within the same client to get -- and we'll also move within cat layers. We'll move up and down layers based on where we think we have the best rates, and that's very helpful. And because of our trading relationships and our balance sheet, we have more ability to do that than some of our competitors. And then we'll also look at allocating between our reinsurance and retro based on where we see the best pricing conditions. So there's a lot of moving parts going into that for where and how we're going to deploy our capacity.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank.
Joshua Shanker: And, Dom, congratulations on a decade. Hopefully, you won't be a stranger. And congratulations to Juan on your start at Everest. Wish you the best.
Juan Andrade: Thank you, Josh.
Joshua Shanker: Yes. First question, I guess for John Doucette. And if we look over a multiyear attritional combined ratio like underlying in the reinsurance space, it's been going up. As you've been deemphasizing catastrophe -- or not deemphasizing, but writing non-cat and casualty as a higher proportion of the book, as we think about 2020 and the mix of the book, should we continue to see the attritional combined ratio rising in the reinsurance segment based on mix?
John Doucette: Josh, I think I would say the year-to-date numbers today for the attritional loss are probably a decent indicator for what 2020 is going to look like.
Dominic Addesso: And again, back to -- let me -- Josh, let me just jump in. By the way, thank you for your thoughts. Let me just jump in here. Again, back to my comment I made earlier about let's not get too focused on the "combined ratio". The only way you'd see the combined ratio go up on an attritional basis is if the dollars of profit margin would be going up. So that's the way we would look at it.
Joshua Shanker: Okay. But of course, I mean, the cat business has a very low attritional combined ratio to it and so lower proportion of the overall pie, I guess.
Dominic Addesso: I take your point on that, and I don't think you'd necessarily see that book of business shrink so dramatically that it would have a meaningful impact on that element of the combined ratio that you're referencing.
Joshua Shanker: All right. And then for Jon Zaffino, on the insurance and winning business, we are seeing with some of the companies that have already reported a decline in retention on their insurance businesses. Could you just talk a little bit about the relationship with distributors and what they're seeing in terms of how competitive you need to be with the brokers in order to win new business?
Jonathan Zaffino: Josh, I guess I would maybe reframe the question a little bit and just start by offer a comment on what defines a relevance to our brokers. Number one, and we talked about this in the past, while we've been active at transforming and building the insurance operations over the last 5 years, recall that all of our main divisional "client-facing leaders" are far from new to this business, averaging over 30 years' experience. They have deep and long relationships with many of our distribution sources. So number one, we have a number of connection points within both the retail, wholesale, even delegated authority pockets of the market. Secondly, I think one of the keys themes for relevance is can you bring forth a very strong, differentiated balance sheet across a wide range of products. That's why we constantly sort of quote the 150 specialty products. And we're finding that happen in lots of different pockets.  We're seeing the relevance of that in a lot of different pockets. For instance, some of our rating-sensitive lines of business, D&O, credit, political risk, surety, our balance sheet differentiates So we're seeing a good flow of opportunity there. In a market like this, the key is to be able to respond to the flow that you're receiving. So a lot of the work we're doing -- and we constantly talk again about investments in technology. How do we handle all this throughput? Again, I mentioned, I think, the 90,000 submissions new business year-to-date. How do you handle that? A lot of work we're doing operationally to make sure we're prepared. So when you think of those things together, the relationships we have, the wonderful balance sheet, the deep set of products and the improvement operational environment to handle all this, it creates a pretty powerful formula. Did that get to it, Josh?
Joshua Shanker: I suppose. And do you think that some of your competitors are getting less relevant as your abilities become more relevant in the market?
Jonathan Zaffino: Well, I think one thing we are seeing is a change underwriting posture from a lot of our competitors. And you heard about limit compressions in a bunch of different markets which is opening up opportunity for us. We've been pretty much front foot from the beginning. We know what we want to do to. It's an organic build. We're not distracted by rapid changes in underwriting appetite. So we are picking up some of the advantage of a market that is viewed, I think, generally as quite skilled in what we do, very stable and very clear on what our asset types are. So that's been benefiting us.
Operator: As there are no further questions, I'd like to hand the call back to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.
Dominic Addesso: Yes. Thank you, Holly, and let me just close this out. I'd like to thank you all for joining this morning. And of course, thanks for the many years of relationships we've developed. As you know, this is my last earnings call, and you can well imagine the smile on my face. Not that I don't love you all, just saying. Actually, through that time, I've appreciated the exchange. It's not easy to summarize these last 10 years, but let me leave you with a few quick thoughts. As I've said many times, this is a long-term business. It needs to be managed in that fashion. And while, at times, conflicts with your mandate, which I understand, one shouldn't lose sight of the game plan. To that end, Everest has been on a path to grow shareholder value. And over a 10-year period, we had a compound annual growth rate of close to 10% in that shareholder value growth. And gross written premium has grown from $4 billion in 2009 to what would be hopefully an annualized $9 billion in 2019.  At the same time, we reengineered our legacy Insurance business and bolstered those reserves and went on to build what is becoming one of the best premier specialty insurance franchises in the business, approaching $3 billion in gross premium written. Our reinsurance business has evolved into a more diversified portfolio, growing profitably into what is now one of the top markets for brokers globally, a true international brand. Investment portfolio has been greatly diversified and by several metrics has proven to be one of the best performing relative to duration, quality and data. None of this happens without the great team sitting with me here today, and I thank them enormously for their support and efforts. And now we ask Juan to lead us on that journey. I'm extremely confident that he and Messrs. Doucette and Zaffino, along with the rest of the Everest team, will continue to do great things.  Thanks for this morning, and hopefully, we'll see you in the days ahead. Have a good day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-07-30 10:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Everest Re Group Limited Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jon Levenson, please go ahead, sir.
Jon Levenson: Thank you, Sinead, and welcome to the Everest Re Group Limited Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. The Everest Executives leading today's call are Dom Addesso, President and Chief Executive Officer; Craig Howie, EVP and Chief Financial Officer; John Doucette, EVP and President and CEO of the Reinsurance Division; and Jonathan Zaffino, EVP and President and CEO of the Everest Insurance Division. Before we begin, I need to preface the comments on today's call by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. Management comments regarding estimates, projections and similar are subject to the risks, uncertainties and assumptions as noted in Everest's SEC filings. Management may also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures these items are reconciled in our earnings release and financial supplement. With that I turn the call over to Dom Addesso.
Dom Addesso: Thanks Jon. Good morning and welcome to our call this morning where we are pleased to outline the excellent results we had for the quarter. As you've no doubt seen by now, our net income per share for the quarter was $8.39 resulting in an ROE of 16.1%. This combined with the first quarter equaled almost $17 per share and a 16.5% ROE. The quarter saw a continued underwriting profitability in both our Reinsurance and Insurance divisions along with a very strong level of investment income. My colleagues will give many of the details underlying our success, but let me say that we continue to execute successfully on our strategy. For Reinsurance, it has been a diversification effort and over time, has seen growth in casualty, mortgage and non-cat property and of course our strategic repositioning in the insurance space which began just over four years ago is now hitting its stride. Given our scale, ratings, global franchise and diversification in all our businesses, we can capitalize on the rate momentum we are now seeing in the market. Rate activity, we are seeing; however, is still spotty and in several instances not yet at levels they need to be. Nevertheless, this certainly appears to be a market that will continue to see Re. Our observation of capacity pullbacks and an increasing flow into the facultative market and the E&S markets are encouraging signs, perhaps not a classical hard market but given industry reserve positions, capital levels and frankly better analytics. The amplitude of prior pricing cycles is likely being replaced with more timely actions. I believe that is in part what we are seeing now. An element of this is also in reaction to loss trend. There has been much discussion about loss trend over the last couple of weeks. No doubt it is evident in many classes but to varying degrees and while everyone is looking for a Point estimate, there will undoubtedly be varying numbers based on book profile, class, attachment point et cetera. As a general comment our rate increases are for the most part, above trend. In addition, we would expect that loss trend to continue and accordingly rate increases will likely persist. My colleagues will get into the many details on our results. But it is worth emphasizing that over the past several years, we have continued to diversify and reduce volatility. One measure of that is our expected annual cat loss which just a few short years ago was 12 points as a percentage of premium and now stands at approximately 6.5 points. The end result is less volatility and improved profit targets. Our reinsurance division has successfully diversify this portfolio. As I mentioned earlier and our insurance segment now at over 30% of our business. Is growing profitably. At its current pace, as I mentioned in last quarter the sum of the parts should prove to be quite positive. Thank you. And now to Craig for the financial highlights.
Craig Howie: Thank you, Dom, and good morning everyone. Everest had another solid quarter of earnings with net income of $343 million in the second quarter of 2019. This compares to net income of $70 million for the second quarter of 2018. On a year-to-date basis, net income was $692 million compared to $280 million for the first half of 2018. Net income included $100 million of net after-tax realized capital gains compared to $9 million of capital losses in the first half of 2018. The 2019 capital gains were primarily attributable to fair value adjustments on the public equity portfolio. After-tax operating income for the second quarter was $321 million compared to $40 million in 2018. Operating income year-to-date was $603 million compared to $260 million for the first six months of 2018. The 2019 result represents an annualized operating income, return on equity of 14.4%. These results were driven by a strong underwriting performance across the Group, stable core investment income, a higher contribution from private equity investments and lower catastrophe losses compared to the first half of 2018. The overall underwriting gain for the Group was $393 million for the first half compared to an underwriting gain of $20 million in the same period last year. In second quarter of 2019, the company reported $30 million of net adverse catastrophe development. The catastrophe losses were primarily reported in the international reinsurance segment and related to Typhoon Jebi, which occurred in Japan during the third quarter of 2018. The industry loss estimates for this event rose significantly again this quarter. The initial estimates for Jebi were $3 billion to $7 billion and at that time, we estimated a conservative estimate based on an $8 billion industry loss. We have now reestimated our share of the Typhoon Jebi losses in line with the high end of the new industry range of $14 billion to $16 billion. Although we have number of loss events in the quarter, including U.S. storm events, none of these events breached our $10 million catastrophe threshold and as such are included in our attritional loss estimates. On a year-to-date basis, the results reflected catastrophe losses of $55 million compared to $597 million during the first half of 2018. Partially offsetting the catastrophe losses was $22 million of favorable prior year reserve development related to non-catastrophe reserves. This prior year favorable development was primarily identified for reserve studies completed in the second quarter of 2019. These reserves related to casualty and property reinsurance business both in the United States and internationally. The redundancy determined from the reserve studies was recognized in the second quarter given the magnitude of the overall indications. These redundancies have developed over time, but we don't revise estimates until the reserve position becomes more mature. We continue to maintain our loss reserve estimates for the more recent years excluding the catastrophe losses and favorable prior year reserve development the underlying book continues to perform well. The overall attritional combined ratio through the first six months was 88% compared to 87% for the full year of 2018. The attritional loss ratio of 59.5% and the commission rate ratio of 22.8% were up slightly compared to the same period last year. Primarily due to business mix in the reinsurance segment which has been writing more casualty business over the past several quarters. The Group expense ratio remains low at 5.7% for the first two quarters of 2019. This is flat compared to the same period last year. Our year-to-date reported combined ratio of 88.9% was driven by the strong underwriting performance of both our reinsurance segment and our ... insurance segment. Before moving onto investment income, I'd like to point out that we included two new pages in our financial supplement Pages 6 and 11. These pages detail gross written premium by major lines of business, for the total Reinsurance and Insurance segments. This provides background detail to the business mix shift and the resulting combined ratio changes we've been referencing. For investments, pre-tax investment income was $179 million for the quarter and $320 million year-to-date on our $19.8 billion investment portfolio, a new record portfolio size for Everest. For the year-to-date, investment income was up $40 million or 14% from one year ago. This result was primarily driven by the increase from the investment grade fixed income portfolio which had a higher asset base this year. Additionally, we've seen a recovery and limited partnership income which was up $11 million for the first half - from the first half of 2018, as we expected and mentioned in the first quarter. The pre-tax yield on the overall portfolio was 3.4% compared to 3.1% one year ago, as both investment grade and alternative fixed income yields are up year-over-year. The duration of the portfolio remains at just over three years. On income taxes, the 12% effective tax rate on operating income is associated with the amount and geographic region of the underwriting gains and the investment income, expected to be earned for the full year. The effective tax rate is an annualized calculation and includes planned catastrophe losses for the remainder of the year. Lower-than-expected catastrophe losses would cause the tax rate to trend higher than the current 12% rate. Positive cash flow continues with record operating cash flows of $854 million for the first half of 2019 compared to $133 million in 2018. The increase reflects our growth in premiums and a lower level of paid catastrophe losses in 2019 compared to 2018. Shareholders' equity for the group was $8.9 billion at the end of the second quarter, another record for Everest, up almost $1 billion or 12% compared to year-end 2018. The increase in shareholders' equity. In the first half of 2019 is primarily attributable to $692 million of net income and the recovery in the fair value of the investment portfolio, partially offset by capital return for $114 million of dividends paid as well as $25 million in share buybacks. Everest continues to maintain a very strong capital position with industry low debt leverage and high liquidity in our investment portfolio in addition to our robust cash flow. The strength of our balance sheet is critical to the success of our business. Thank you. And now John Doucette will provide a review of the reinsurance operations.
John Doucette: Thank you, Craig. Good morning. We are pleased to report another strong quarter for the Reinsurance Division with $178 million of underwriting profit in Q2. And further diversification of our portfolio providing stability and balance to our operation. Our global franchise is well positioned and new initiatives, underwriting actions and rate increases. We are finally seeing both the property and casualty reinsurance markets move positively. Reflecting a combination of recent catastrophe losses, capacity shortages, trapped capital, pockets of poor loss experience and new found discipline from some of the largest players in both insurance and reinsurance. The upshot is improving original insurance rates which Jon Zaffino will touch on later and better reinsurance rate terms and conditions in several parts of our portfolio. In Florida, we were pleased with our June renewal. Overall, the market was rational with pricing up. We saw a more risk adjusted rate increases on loss affected treaties and increases on many others, but there was a wide range of outcomes with some programs remaining underpriced. I think of this not as a hard market but as a reasonable market. Finding its way back to a sustainable balance between serving clients needs and generating appropriate returns on reinsurance capital therefore, we continued our practice of allocating capital to long-term strategic clients and the deals with the best returns. Our underwriting and modeling teams did a great job positioning Everest to capture more of the best business while shedding less attractive deals, the end result was a reduction of Everest exposure to property gap and an effort to encourage rate discipline through scarcity of our capacity. On some deals we achieved tighter terms and conditions such as LAE cap and lower current limits on proportional treaties. Consequently, we are encouraged with the direction of the Florida market, but more improvement is needed given several years of Deterioration, rate pressure and loss cost inflation. Nevertheless, the bottom line for our Florida book is a higher ROE and a reduced model cat loss. We achieved portfolio rate increases that outpace the overall market by strongly differentiating programs through disciplined underwriting. We are pleased that model profitability remains relatively flat despite meaningful reductions to our catastrophe exposures. Switching to July 1st, outside of Florida, U.S. property, renewals were orderly and directionally positive. Rates were up mid-to- high single-digits on a risk adjusted basis. Property business at July 1, outside of the U.S. was generally stable. With rate increases driven by loss activity or the reunderwriting mandated from some of the Lloyd's Syndicate. As mentioned previously, during the April 1st renewals for Japan, Everest did employ more capacity there given the improved rates. And the Japanese market is preparing for potentially further rate increases for upcoming renewal. Due to recent loss experience particularly the industries loss creep on JEBI. In the U.S. casualty lines trends remain positive. Despite plentiful potential capacity, the market has grown more discipline in both reinsurance and insurance, as primary rates improve across most line. Casualty reinsurance terms are stable for non-loss affected business; however, poor performance and increasing loss trends over the last several years are prompting reinsurers increase rates and decreased commission because of Everest, 40 plus year history, strong balance sheet and ratings, large market presence, robust, long-term client relationships and responsive underwriting we continue to garner preferential access on casualty reinsurance business. As we have previously discussed, until about 18 months ago. We have been reducing our casualty writings over the last several years prior to that due to the deterioration in both the insurance and reinsurance casualty markets. This has helped us avoid much of the poor loss experience that has emerged and we are now very well positioned to deploy our underwriting expertise and capacity as the casualty markets improve. In addition to casualty we have significant opportunity in mortgage business shown by the 16% growth in mortgage writings during the first half of this year. Also of note is the evolution and strong growth of our facultative book globally over the past several years. We have several very experienced fact teams worldwide who are product experts and local market specialist. We now have over $430 million of facultative reinsurance premium in-force, covering property casualty, professional, specialty and order lines across Miami, New York, New Jersey and several other offices in the U.S. as well as in Toronto, Singapore and London. This is an all-time high gross written premium for our facultative book after meaningful growth during the last few years. And it is well diversified as our global back book is broadly split by line approximately 60% casualty and 40% property. And it is also split geographically 60% international and 40% U.S. meaningful improving back opportunities emerged following dislocation in Lloyd's the 2017 and 2018 cat losses and general decrease in D&F capacity. Tax submission flow is up significantly in all territories in line highlighted by the 26% year-to-date increase in U.S. that fac casualty submissions. On the demand side, our fac clients are seeking both short and long tail limit reduction and exposure management, particularly in auto due to poor experience increased demand is broad based across back including property, casualty, individual risk auto fac, U.S. placements and placements from abroad. Our growth in facultative business exemplifies our ability to capitalize on opportunity around the globe. Writing all P&C lines of fac in key centers all over the world requires a robust global infrastructure and it's hard for competitors to replicate which gives us a sustainable competitive advantage. Our strong growth in fac is more evidence of an improving overall reinsurance market as Dom mentioned earlier, because fac renewals happen much more often than treaty renewal they are good leading indicators of market trend. We are bullish that this improving trend in fac will continue well past 2020, particularly as tough exposures meet limited capacity in the firming treaty market. During the second quarter Everest purchased an aggregate property retro program that will help protect us from a large catastrophe loss or series of mid-sized losses. This retro program was designed to refine the shape of our portfolio by further diversifying our capital structure, reducing that volatility, adding flexibility to deploy our capital for interesting and unique opportunities. This retro purchase aids to be better positioned to capture improvement opportunities in the property space, including at January 1, 2020, given the retro market dislocation and trapped capital while managing the volatility of our property book with the combined financial strength of our shareholders. Common equity, Mt. Logan capital Kilimanjaro cat bonds ILWs, facultative retro protection and now this additional aggregate retro capacity, we are well capitalized and not reliant on any one capital source to finance our underwriting risks. Moving on to our year-to-date results, our global reinsurance operations at growth of 3% on written and earned premium during the first half of 2019. Growth came from U.S. operations with increased casualty and mortgage writings offset by slightly less premium in treaty property as we push rate and in Bermuda due to some non-renewal of some - of a few large deals . we booked in 86.6% combined ratio for reinsurance operations with cat losses of $55 million which included losses from the Townsville monsoon, Australian flooding and some loss - some additional loss development from Typhoon Jebi as the market loss worsen significantly just as Craig mentioned earlier these cat losses mostly impacted our international segment. Excluding catastrophe losses, the underlying loss ratio of 57.4% for reinsurance operations increased by 0.4 points compared to the full year of 2018. Given the greater mix of casualty and pro rata business in our portfolio. We continue to be viewed by clients and brokers all over the world as a core go-to trading partner and garner increased opportunities particularly with dislocations of capacity around the world in multiple lines of business. These dislocations and pressure on supply of risk capital include one dislocation due to lower large scale rationalization impact and direct and facultative capacity And many international portfolios helping to drive improvements in the E&S Primary and facultative books, two ongoing trapped capital from 2017 and 2018 losses and the subsequent market loss deterioration are pushing ILS investors to retrench, withdraw capacity for demand better pricing and terms the resulting dislocation in several property reinsurance market and global retro capacity will likely continue for the upcoming January renewal. Three, some European reinsurers have been pulling back casualty and professional reinsurance capacity decreasing authorizations on specific programs were pushing casualty rates and terms, which is leaving potential in some clients treaties and creating some upward pressure on casualty rates both of which provide attractive opportunities. Four, some reinsurers our now bumping up against internal risk capacity limits or rating agency constraints for mortgage causing reduced involvement on new mortgage deal. We believe this mortgage reinsurance capacity constraints for some rated carriers will continue or even grow. Each of these or taken separately and certainly together present robust prospects for profitable growth opportunities for a large global reinsurers with strong capital high ratings and dry powder. In summary, we are pleased with not only our year-to-date results but also with our strategic positioning for the future. Despite this evolving market we remain focused on building long-term value for our shareholders while being the first call for our clients and broker partners. Thank you and now I will turn it over to Jon Zaffino to review our insurance operations.
Jonathan Zaffino: Thanks Jon and good morning. Our global specialty insurance operations delivered another solid quarter of performance. We continue to experience high quality, profitable growth within our many retail and wholesale underwriting divisions across North America and several international markets. Our growth remained balanced and diversified by geography, product segment and distribution channel. Our insurance operations are well positioned to continue on this path of growth and profitability as clients increasingly rely on Everest Insurance to offer solutions to help them address a growing range of complex risk issues. Our leading balance sheet formidable global infrastructure and outstanding talent, nearly 1,000 strong are increasingly in demand in this transitioning market. The second quarter brought some notable performance achievements highlighted by record reported gross and net written premiums as well as net earned premium. We also experienced the highest level of quarterly submissions across our retail and wholesale operations coupled with the strongest renewal retention. We have experienced, and more than five years and our U.S. direct operations. This speaks to the growing role Everest Insurance plays in the global specialty market. The second quarter also continued a nearly five year trend or 18 consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth in our business. This focused growth is the result of increased scale and relevance within the many underwriting divisions across our global property and casualty and accident and health operations. We believe significant additional scale can be achieved within our chosen product areas. Allowing us to maintain excellent growth rates into the future. Of course, market conditions dependent. Most importantly and this quarter builds upon the underwriting profitability achieved in the first quarter of this year and brings our year-to-date underwriting profit to $38 million, a 72% increase over prior year first half. Our second quarter underwriting profit was $19 million, a more than two fold increase over 2018 second quarter and $16 million more that our 2017 second quarter performance. Further, nine of the last 10 quarters have now produced an underwriting profit, the lone exception being the 3rd quarter of 2017. An area of continued focus for the insurance operation is the attraction of industry-leading talent. Everest Insurance and the greater Everest organization remains a highly desirable home for talented professionals. Across a range of disciplines in fact, hundreds of talented colleagues have chosen to join Everest Insurance over the past several years and we are proud to welcome them into the Everest family. These talent acquisition efforts continue to fuel our growth, enable our capabilities and differentiate us by ensuring we have the right people in place to support our strategic initiatives, our ever expanding books of business and most importantly our growing client base. The evolution of Everest Insurance is a long-term effort and there is always room for further improvement yet we are certainly encouraged by our trajectory to date and are optimistic about our opportunities in the market ahead. Turning to the financial results for the quarter and year-to-date period. For the second quarter of 2019, the global insurance operations produced $757 million in gross written premium, an increase of $111 million or 70% Over second quarter of 2018. Year-to-date, gross written premium rose to one $1.4 billion, a $201 million or 17% increase over the same period of 2018. Our net written premium growth matched our top line growth at 17% year-over-year increasing by $80 million to $549 million. Net earned premium in the quarter was $474 million, an increase of $65 million or 16% for the year-to-date period net earned premium increased to 899 million an increase of $97 million or 12% over the prior year period. The growth in earned premium has been anticipated as various business ventures incepted over the past several years, begin to earn through the P&L at a greater rate. Turning to the combined ratio, for the quarter, the GAAP combined ratio was 96%, a 170 basis point improvement from the second quarter of 2018 and a 310 basis point improvement over the same period in 2017. Year-to-date, the GAAP combined ratio was 95.8%, a 150 basis point improvement over the comparable prior year period and a 300 basis point improvement over the first half of 2017. The attritional combined ratios for the quarter and year-to-date period are 96% and 95.8% respectively. On the year-to-date basis we see an 80 basis point improvement over 2018 year-to-date results of 96.6%. The quarter's loss and loss adjustment expense ratio improved 290 basis points from the prior year period to 65.8% from 68.7%. This includes the benefit of no cat losses in the current quarter, a result of thoughtful positioning of our various property portfolios. On a year-to-date basis, the 2019 attritional loss ratio of 65.4%, an 80 basis points improved over last year's 66.2%. Our expense ratio was stable in the quarter, and consistent with the full year of 2018 performance. We continue to take advantage of our improved scale to invest in people, technology and new locations in key markets across the globe. For the year-to-date period the expense ratio was 30.4%, down slightly from the 30.5% in the comparable period of 2018. As we expect that we are seeing the stabilization of our expense ratio year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter as earned premium continues to come through as our businesses mature. Turning to the operating environment I would echo the sentiment you have heard from other companies, namely that the trading environment and trading conditions globally continue to improve, as respect to pricing I would break this down into three areas. First, we are seeing improved underlying pricing across all lines except workers' compensation. Second, we see accelerating price improvement in several areas across property, liability and professional lines. And third, for the first time in many quarters, our aggregate renewal price change, which includes exposure change has moved into positive territory registering 2.9% for the quarter, inclusive of workers' compensation. Excluding workers' compensation Everest Insurance produced an aggregate renewal price change of 8.1% in the quarter, which is the strong as we have seen in seven years. Year-to-date, the renewal price change as they likewise excellent 6.3%. Further, this continues the upward trend and non-workers' compensation rate change that began in the beginning of 2017. And in fact the underlying rate change increased to 7% in the second quarter. In general, I would say the same themes we have discussed in prior calls are continuing to play out. However, the notable change is the increased momentum. Property lines, cat and non-cat exposed alike continue to gain meaningful rate as does commercial auto, both were up in the low-to-mid teens this quarter. The liability lines Primary and Excess are also beginning to achieve more significant rate, generally in the low-to-mid single digit range, as are the professional and financial lines. The financial lines initially lag other areas in terms of rate achievement, but are quickly beginning to adjust to the new reality of much needed rate to absorb increased loss cost. So overall, we see a much more constructive environment and as our renewal premium changes indicate, we are optimistic that this trend will continue in the quarters ahead. In conclusions stated simply, this is another quarter of strong growth, increased profitability and meaningful advancements toward our strategic objectives. We look forward to reporting back to you next quarter. And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Sinead for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Yaron Kinar: My first question goes to the underlying or - your loss ratio and reinsurance. I guess we are seeing about 5.5 points of deterioration year-over-year. You called out business mix loss trend and non-cat weather. Can you maybe help us think about the magnitude of each of those drivers and then maybe as a follow-up to that, how should we think about the 87% underlying combined ratio that you had talked about in the past given that I think it was a little bit in excess of that this quarter?
Dom Addesso: This is Dom. I'll start and ask Mr. Doucette to - and Craig to complement wherever I say. But first of all, I think the comparison against the year ago quarter is a little bit difficult because of the number of adjustments that we made in the second quarter of last year. So we think the more appropriate comparison is to look at the full year, December of '18 against the six months of '18. So the gap that you described is much narrower. Again it's business mix shift, it's certainly conservative loss picks, less of a factor is any loss cost trend, but those are the main drivers of the movement and the other thing to keep in mind is that through six months we still carry fairly good size non-cat, cat loads so that's also reflected in the six months numbers. We're in the full year that tends to get equalized out. So those are some of the factors, I don't know if Craig or John want to add anything to that.
John Doucette: Yes, it's John, good morning. Just one thing, I think we had about $32 million of reinstatement premiums in last year's Q2 which also skews, the comparison of just isolating the quarter-over-quarter comparison.
Yaron Kinar: And then my other question is just with regards to premium growth in reinsurance. So I appreciate the color and the opening statements, and I realize that there are a bunch of offsets there. But, and this may be Monday morning quarterbacking here, but I guess I'm looking at the prior year had 137% growth and gross premiums, about 47% growth in net premiums, definitely saw a slowdown here even as rates have improved I guess how should we think about the rate, the premium momentum here and I guess, in hindsight, was the capital deployment in 2018 maybe too aggressive leading to some needed to slow down growth and '19?
Craig Howie: Yaron, and this is Craig. Just, just to kick this off and then I'll let John jump in as well. But this is something that I think you have to look at. So, you mentioned the growth in the prior year. What I would say to you is the growth this year on a year-to-date basis is actually 5% if you exclude foreign exchange, so you're actually growing on top of that growth from prior year so that's, certainly something I'd ask you to look at.
Yaron Kinar: Yes and too, I don't think this has anything to do with capital in terms of our deployment, it really is opportunity set and where we see it. And there's a - there is a - these are core renewal portfolio, there are some large one-off deals and this year, there were a couple of those deals that we didn't come to you know the renewal terms with the clients and so that again skews the numbers, which is one of the reasons we think it's better to look at the year-to-date numbers as opposed to the quarterly numbers. And we're actively talking to some clients about some large, complicated deals now, and so it could move the other way as well. So I - but it's absolutely not capital related. Okay.
Dom Addesso: And one of the things I'd add to that, Yaron, is that you know reinsurance by its very nature can be a little lumpy, so I wouldn't necessarily look at any year-over-year increases in premium as some kind of a forecasting tool, if you look at our property pro rata. For example, that moves around a fair bit and to John's point if you can't come to term with a client on a particular deal then you've got to slug a premium that - pro rata can be lumpy. So you can have a slug of premium that can be here one year and gone the next. It's not particularly troubling. For us, again our franchises is one in which we continue - each and every year, we gained momentum in the marketplace across many different product sets. So the momentum is still quite fair.
Operator: And now take our next question from Mike Phillips from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Mike Phillips: I wanted to touch on the insurance side. I appreciate all the color there at the end with the conditions are improving. You mentioned - you mentioned three reasons why, I mean you said liability and professional lines, low-to-mid single-digit rates but much in it - much needed and loss costs are still rising. So, I guess all that in, if you look at the past. I don't know, 7, 8, 9 quarters. Your core loss ratio or your core combined ratio was around 96 or so and really hasn't moved much from there, I guess how do you think about, given the rate and loss trend environment in the insurance, when do you expect any kind of movement and improvement in that core loss and core combined ratio?
Dom Addesso: I'll start and ask Mr. Zaffino to answer that. Our combined ratio and loss ratio is here again, also driven by mix. So in the insurance operation - by the way is a great, a great result and we're quite proud of it. But we've got this additional rate activity, rate increases coming into the market, we have not pull down our loss ratios to account for any of that we tend to be more conservative in our loss picks. So we continue to pick the same loss ratio on a higher premium base on the other hand, again to reflect some level of conservatism where comp with rate decreases we've actually increased our loss pick and will come, given the fact that they were rate decreases that we're facing. So we've kind of short sighted ourselves in a way there and then I guess the last point you mentioned or I mentioned already, but mix, so we have a bit more risk management business in our portfolio than we anticipated, which just by - and accident and health business, which by its very nature, books at a higher combined ratio still very profitable, consistently profitable business. So that's some of the reasons why perhaps we're not seeing as much movement as you would otherwise have expected in the combined. But nevertheless we are still anticipating continued improvement over the quarters and years ahead. So Jonathan, you have anything to add.
Jonathan Zaffino: I think that's well said. I would add to that remember, if you look at our strong growth rates from quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year to Dom's point, this can create mix changes that are hard to read from any specific quarter and Dom mentioned our risk management business, which is an excellent business, which tends to run in that sort of mid-90s levels that was a bit of a - a bigger contribution this quarter. As I also mentioned in my prepared remarks, you know, the earned premium from various new products, new underwriting divisions over the past few years are beginning to earn in and some of the dissipation if you will, of some areas that we had identified as a run off or those that we were deemphasizing our earning out, you're starting to see that intersection happen and we expect that to continue to happen in a beneficial way as we move forward here. So we're focused on delivering underwriting profit. We're going to be conservative in our views of how we recognize Dom's point, some of the rate changes that are earning through but I think those variety of factors are, what you're seeing is the reason for the mid-90s
Mike Phillips: I guess more generally then there has been some concerns affecting the overall industry. And kind of rising toward activity and litigation activity and I guess anything you've seen there and if I - kind of your business and if so, anything that we would see from maybe the paid activity that we can look at it from your Loss Triangles?
Jonathan Zaffino: No, - this is John again, we're obviously looking at the same dynamics that are being discussed across the industry. It's very difficult to broad-brush any one line of one area, each portfolio is a bit different, how companies address sort of where they hold certain acts - here it's a bit different. I would say as a general tone we are keeping a close eye on this it's often discussed in the general liability area. We write general liability for instance, across many different areas many different industry segments, each with different dynamics. And we talk about loss trend remember, there is two parts of that, there's frequency and severity, so they're going to differ from area to area. We're keeping an eye on it. We're encouraged by the rate levels that we're starting to see. Net trend is a little bit more muted with some of the exposure growth going on, but whether it's financial lines that's going to be a bit of a different mix, whether you're in Primary or Excess areas, same with the GL, autos has been talked about for quite some time. So overall, we take a look at the portfolio every quarter, really every day, trying to learn from what we're seeing out there, but I would say we feel pretty comfortable about where we are and even more comfortable as rate starts to build over the ensuing months here.
Craig Howie: And fair to say we do not see an explosion in trend. And as I mentioned in my opening comments, what we see in our portfolio and differs by company but what we see in our portfolio is trend is well within our rate increases.
Operator: We'll now take our next question from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Elyse Greenspan: My first question is going back to the margin conversation and really this is on the reinsurance side of things. So I know it's reflective of your business mix and Dom, I think you said we should look at the full year '18 and kind of compare the second quarter there, but I guess I'm thinking more about going forward, do you expect the mix to continue to tilt more toward casualty and away from property and should we think about the reinsurance At 86, attritional combined ratio is how we should think about modeling going forward or the half year. Just kind of margin expectations on a forward basis.
Dom Addesso: Right, so the - for the first half it's 85.4 not 86, not to get too precise, but for on the attritional side. And look at in the reinsurance business it's difficult to predict where the mix will go because as we've talked about many times over many, many quarters, we'll put our capital to where we think the best opportunities are and what emerges next year is a better opportunity. Who knows, but I would say that where we are mix wise today is probably balanced, where we would expect to be over the remaining quarters. Certainly we would expect more writings in mortgage, which as you know carries a lower combined ratio I don't know that we necessarily see any explosion in casualty from here relative to our other lines of business. So I think the mix is kind of fairly stabilized in terms of where it is today and I will. I would like to emphasize. And I know this is in the point you were quite making here but certainly what we've seen in any of the write-ups the headline of margin deterioration and again, what I'd like to point out is with the growth in premium. It might be a deterioration in the ratio but the overall absolute dollars of underwriting margins have increased over time. And in combination with a lower in cat load frankly, that gives us, and also I think about the investment income flow without - over $800 million of positive cash flow in the first half of the year. All of those things are we think improving our profit target, overall profit target, so - and with the decreased level of volatility. I know that isn't quite more than perhaps you asked but I think where we are now.
John Doucette: And Elyse, this is John, just to add a little more color. I mean, we're close to done within the treaty world of what we're going to put on the books for this year. They will still be facultative throughout the year. And there'll be the odd treaty deal. But obviously not that far along is January 1st and so we'll be watching closely obviously what happens in wind season as well as what we think the capital situation is the supply demand balance and that will dictate how much capital we deployed going forward and you know there continues to seem to be some dislocation and capacity shortages and trapped capital and related - related events As I talked about earlier. So we'll watch that and that will influence mix as well as we head into the New Year.
Elyse Greenspan: And then my second question on - if we look at your premiums writings on across the property lines. That was helpful disclosure that you guys added to the supplement, they've gone down and if we think about what happened. Obviously, now we had two successive years of high cat losses in your - John in your remarks, you mentioned some pretty good rate that you guys did see in Florida, but then we don't see that running through the premium written line. With that there were some accounts that were still under priced that you had to come off . Like how do we reconcile. I guess the fact that there were some pretty good rate in Florida and even in other areas of the world and your property rating - property writings, sorry, have come down?
John Doucette: You're absolutely right, I mean we pushed rate and one of the ways that the market is going to get hard is - or okay - and less people willing to walk away from things and we pushed and we pushed and in some cases, we came off. We also did move up particularly in Florida, we moved up the tower, which again we thought that was a better place, better risk adjusted place to play and that that could be less, less premium, but it doesn't mean that it's less profitable risk adjusted profit. So we were pleased with how we reposition that book and then there certainly been up a couple of pro rata deals where we, we pushed for certain ceding commissions and the current summits and things like that and we didn't get there, but again we're bullish. We're not retreating from property at all. We thought after $200 billion, $250 billion losses maybe we had a view on what the right rate was to deploy capacity and something we talked about before is, we're also looking at is not in isolation of just property. We're also looking at it has the opportunity set for us to deploy capital whether that's into the casualty space where we see in an emerging situation, obviously the insurance, the facultative both casualty, and international property as well as the mortgage which we remain very bullish on. So we're also, we're looking at it beyond just a property comment. We're looking at it across the whole global portfolio.
Dom Addesso: And as far as the shift that John was talking about. Generally, and this is mainly a Florida comment, the layers down low, lower traction limits we're frankly under-priced in our view and the increases there was nowhere near appropriate and also emphasize that we have increased some of our cat book outside the U.S., so John mentioned specifically Japan as one example.
John Doucette: So particularly on the Florida part, Elyse, it's John, again And particularly on the Florida part where the view of the increased risk from some of the social inflation aspects we thought were more prevalent on the lower layers.
Elyse Greenspan: And then lastly on the tax side, Craig. I think you said you know cats are lower, the tax rate should trend higher, I thought the expectation was for 13% for the year, it was a little bit light - lighter than that in the Q2 with low cats. Was there something impacting that in the current quarter?
Craig Howie: Yes. In the current quarter, we actually had more income and more foreign source income that came through. So we were able to use more foreign tax credits against that income, Elyse. So that's the reason it dropped to 12% for the first half of the year.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Josh Shanker: I guess, and this is for Jon Zaffino. You mentioned that your rate overall, your renewal rate pricing was up 2.9% and I think you said it was up 8.1% excluding workers' comp, workers' comp is about 20% of your portfolio. I'm trying to reconcile those numbers, did I understand you correctly?
Jonathan Zaffino: Yes, it's a little more than that. Josh, it's work comps is probably closer to 30%.
Josh Shanker: And then I guess, the number of assortment. So the, everything, example, workers' compensation of eight point - I mean, I know I did I just can't make the math work with numbers like that.
Jonathan Zaffino: Well, here's what you have happening. Number one there is a lot of rate being had now in the property and auto lines. Some of our auto ratings are up year-over-year. We're seeing again increased rate in a number of other areas from financial lines to other liability. Comp, you're getting some exposure look at an increased rate then to what you are in other areas as well. So some of that shows up in renewal price change versus pure rate, so there's a number of - and then you get mix differences in the quarter as well, so the waitings could be a little different based on timing. So for instance, in the second quarter, we write a few large risk management deals you might see more of the impact on the work comp thing you might - it might mitigate some of the other areas and the opposite happens as well. So all those things kind of moving together.
Josh Shanker: And you're still growing comp, I think comp probably is pretty healthy. But what is your flexibility if comp margins begin to change? How quickly can you move in and out of the comp markets?
Jonathan Zaffino: Yes, it's a good question. I - look, I mean we see still a very favorable underlying dynamics and workers' compensation, we are watching more closely the of course the rate pressure in the impact that it has to overall profitability. Some of our growth and work comp has come from again some of the areas that we underwrite loss sensitive programs. So you're getting the benefit of the installation of deductibles in different areas. If we see work comp starting to get to the point where it's not meeting our profitability objectives we will turn the dial well, - we will move out of some of those, particularly some of those model line areas where we're constantly adjusting rates regularly across the various different statutory companies we have and so on and so forth. Comp is a smaller part of our book than it's been in a while. Some of that is the relative growth rates of other areas. So we will watch it closely. We feel comfortable with where it is today, but if the economic scenario dips. Further, we will selectively start to move out of different pockets but feel comfortable - these are the pockets will - where we will be able to maintain some insulation from underlying loss cost trend.
Josh Shanker: And can you give any color on where margins are year-over-year in comp and accident year and calendar year basis, you going to give numbers like us - can we talk about - has there been a difference and where the initial marks are on comp business?
Jonathan Zaffino: Fair to say that at this point comp is still very profitable, we don't, - we don't give specific my ratios disclose that anyway Craig that --
Craig Howie: We have not. We've said that it's run in the low '90s. In the past.
Jonathan Zaffino: I think frankly that's where it's being booked but we think it's better than that.
John Doucette: And just to echo Dom's comment earlier, we did take a little bit more of a conservative view of this year in the comp line in relation to some of the increased rate reductions that we were seeing, so feel pretty confident we're sort of in that range today.
Operator: And now take our next question from Mike Zaremski from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Mike Zaremski: First question, in terms of the cat load coming down over time. Is there a dynamic of increasing reinsurance, retro purchase which is flowing through the financials and causing the underlying combined ratio did increase a little bit or is simply diversification and kind of shifting up the tower and whatnot?
Craig Howie: Yes, Mr. Doucette to comment as well, but it's mostly about diversifying into other lines of business is growing those more quickly. In this particular six month period. Certainly, as Jon has pointed out we've come off a number of programs that didn't hit our pricing targets that had an impact. Jon made reference to the retro. We did purchase in his opening comments. In part that's part of our typical risk management of our book. We have in the past purchased ILWs and we have cat bonds and Mt. Logan so that's all has been part of the equation. And as you point out moving up the tower certainly decreases premium but gives us similar a better risk adjusted return and you want to add to Jon.
Jonathan Zaffino: Just on the margin, the hedging, we have a very holistic broad brush hedging strategy and structure. And on the margin that can change the attritional combined ratio. But really, what's driving it is mix shift and growth in certain areas and growth in non-cat areas is driving it more than the hedging.
Mike Zaremski: Next on the expense ratio just clarification, I think it was up 140 basis points year-over-year. I know, I think, Craig cited and multiples people cited, it's kind of moving into more casualty is so were there any one-time items there are kind of this is, was a clean quarter. When we think about it.
Craig Howie: It's purely a mix shift and ceding commissions on pro rata casualty and product.
Mike Zaremski: And lastly, any update, do you expect the Board to make a succession decision in near-term?
Craig Howie: Yes. I and by the way, I appreciate everyone's restraints 4-5 callers to get to that question. But the simple answer to that is yes. And of course, I can't expand on that any further.
Operator: We'll now take our next question from Amit Kumar from The Buckingham Research Group. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Amit Kumar: Just a few quick follow-ups. The first question goes back to the growth in casualty reinsurance segment. I was just trying to better understand, if I look at casualty reinsurance pro rata. And I guess look at the definition in the K. Can you maybe you can just talk about some of the sub-segments. The growth is coming from, I guess I'm just trying to get some comfort that it's not skewed toward lines such as other liability et cetera. where there could be potential slippage in the tort climate?
Dom Addesso: Jon, you have anything on that - The casualty in the reinsurance side, I will let John to comment I don't know if he has the specifics at hand this morning but clearly casualty includes work comp, includes professional lines, the liability businesses well, it's all included. I don't know if you have a mix handy. We don't have the specific number but up a 1,000 foot view, I would say that the heavier casualty is really about 20% of the portfolio. Recognizing at more we write this in kind of the U.S. in the London market et cetera. But then we also do write it all over the world. And then a lot of those other world of other areas. It's a, it's a lot more of the softer casualty as well and we are seeing opportunities there and we're seeing opportunities, as I have mentioned before in the back of which our book is 60% casualty and at 60% international. So also kind of diversifying away from that really heavier casualty book. But we do write a fair bit of comp in there. Embedded in some of the program, environmental and there is a pretty diversified portfolio that we have both in territory and sub lines.
Amit Kumar: And maybe just related to that this might be for Dom or are you, do you have a view on the discussion on social inflation right now.
Dom Addesso: Look as we recognize that and that we primarily see this, what we're seeing in the inflation area with the loss cost trends. Is mainly in coming from our insurance book reinsurance book given the varieties of treaties that we write. It's hard to call a trend because it can vary by the type of business that you are in the class of business the territory, et cetera. So we frankly rely on what we're seeing and the insurance side, at least in the early days. And clearly we see a loss cost trend. Hard to determine whether that's what you're calling social inflation or just traditional severity and frequency.
Amit Kumar: Got it.
Dom Addesso: I don't know, don't see any - necessarily any huge jury awards, if that's what you're getting at coming through our insurance book and or coming through our reinsurance side.
Amit Kumar: Yes, that's what I...
John Doucette: And this is John Doucette. I would just add that and also - within reinsurance. I mean, we have a lot more flexibility in terms of our ability to respond. So first of all, we have been writing long tail business since the '70s in all over the world and we have a lot of experience, a lot of experienced underwriters. A lot of people that understand the markets and we have a lot of data and we've seen, and we've seen things move. And we have seen - looking at inflation and social inflation and different loss cost trends and things like that. All over the world and we also have the ability to then move by product, by attachment point move in and out of classes that gives us a lot of comfort that we're able to, with our data our expertise, our underwriting capabilities to be able to recognize that and respond to it and we do that all over the world. And so we feel is something that we need to focus on and we do focus on, but we feel we have to keep the right capabilities to be able to respond appropriately and timely to it.
Dom Addesso: So to sum that up. I would say that we don't necessarily see any "shock to the system." coming from what everyone is identifying as loss cost trends. But it is something that we and the rest of the industry frankly are addressing and are dealing with and recognizing that it's a factor in reshaping portfolios, taking a look at rates et cetera. And I think everyone is being very deliberate about that.
Amit Kumar: The only other question I had was on Mt. Logan. The AUN fell and there is obviously talk about in the past on regarding Stone Ridge's redemptions. How are you thinking about the future of this entity?
John Doucette: Yes, this is John. So, it's what at - Mt. Logan is a core strategic vehicle for us as we - as we manage our catastrophe risks, but it's one of them and we look at, we have the cat bonds we buy traditional reinsurance, we buy traditional retro for Facultative for treaty. We now have the new aggregate retro. So it's - will turn dialed up and down. Based on that we have continue to add and look to add investors into the mix and normal course of business we will continue to do that, but we're not trying to grow for the sake of growing. It's one of the strategic dials it has very specific values to Everest, but, so do some of the other ones. And so we look across all of these as part of the holistic hedging strategy and structure that we have and you know we have the ability to turn up and down other deals as well.
Amit Kumar: And what's the Investor percentage. If you could just remind me, that's the last question I have? The percentage. I think previously you've given that number. Thanks.
John Doucette: I don't recall ever given that number.
Amit Kumar: I think it was 85. I'll follow up offline. Thanks for the answers. And good luck for the future.
Operator: We’ll now take our next question from Ryan Tunis from Autonomous Research. Go ahead.
Ryan Tunis: I guess my first question is just on how - you said the PML exposures are down June 1st. Just curious if you could give us an order of magnitude around that?
John Doucette: So I mean, it varies - we track 75 zones. It varies a lot by territory and by return period and based on what products that we offer and where the attachments are, you get very different answers to that along the way.
Ryan Tunis: Is it - the property cat premium it showed down on a gross basis, is it fair to assume that on a net basis, it was down a similar amount or as a steeper decline?
John Doucette: Can look at premium if you're trying to look across the premium, to determine of PML decrease?
Ryan Tunis: No, I'm just curious in terms of - I can see the gross reduction in property cat premiums. I'm just trying to think about what profitability looks like in later cat type season. So I'm trying to get a figure, a sense of how much of that premium came down?
John Doucette: I think we don't have that split out, but I think across the entire reinsurance. I mean, I think they are directionally moving about the same.
Ryan Tunis: And then my last question is just on, I couldn't help but notice that there were no Kilimanjaro cat bond deals in the first half of the year and I. I think we've seen those in the past few. And I think that there is about $0.5 billion of limit maturing at year-end, I guess kind of same thing that Amit asked on Mt. Logan, how are you thinking about the affordability of those programs and in this environment. How are you thinking about those upcoming maturities?
John Doucette: I think the answer is it's too soon to tell what we would want to do as we had to the exploration which happens in November in December and it will depend on pricing. It will depend on the wind season and things like that. And we do track the cat bond market and the pricing spreads widened for a while and then they came in a little bit. So it will be one and there'll be a lot of factors that we look at what is our gross book looks like, what are the alternative hedges look like. But right now we're not in a position to know whether what we would do for that or any of the other hedges.
Operator: We'll now take our next question from Meyer Shields from KBW. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Meyer Shields: And I appreciate your patience on this call. I don't know - I'm guessing just a quick question for Craig. I was hoping you could walk us through the earnings impact of the decline in Mt. Logan, assets under management?
Craig Howie: So the earnings impact from the fee income that we receive that shows up in our books and records is relatively immaterial. And what I mean by that is for the quarter. It was down about $1 million overall for the year, we are up about $2 million. So relatively immaterial and that comes through other income, other expense.
Meyer Shields: And then second, I guess, I'm trying to balance the year-to-date decline in interest rates with the growing presence of longer-tail lines of business in gross written premiums. Should we anticipate net written premium - I'm sorry. Net investment income going up or going down as we consider those factors?
Craig Howie: Or into next year are you talking for the remainder of this year?
Meyer Shields: I was thinking next year, but happy to hear how you're thinking about it.
Craig Howie: Well, with strong cash flow, as I pointed out, when my previous answers - the first half of the year. Certainly increased asset base will be a bigger driver we think and kind of maybe what the Fed does, but we think then what interest rates do. So to that - to that degree than we would anticipate a growing investment income number.
Operator: We'll now take our final question from Brian Meredith from UBS. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Brian Meredith: It's a couple of quick ones hopefully here. First one, Craig. What is new money yields look like right now versus kind of your book yield?
Craig Howie: On an overall basis it's about 3.5%. Brian, but it really depends on what you're investing in, investment grade is probably slightly below that. But any bank loans or high-yield investments that we have alternative investments would be higher than that.
Brian Meredith: Right. Obviously, yes. So, okay. So still pretty positive good.
Craig Howie: Thanks.
Brian Meredith: Second question - I'm just curious, it's thoughts on kind of the crop environment outlook here given kind of what's been going on with crops in the Midwest late planting and seeding et cetera?
John Doucette: Yes, good morning Brian, it's John. So...
Brian Meredith: Yes.
John Doucette: So it was obviously a late start to the season, given the weather conditions and there was some prevented planting, and I know there's been some talk of that the prevented planting claims that you know they are - they are likely to some there, which will have - potentially have a - an upward pressure on the, loss ratio. But you know it's still early days that can recover. We don't know what's going to happen. It's both yield and revenue. And so the yield and recover, it's maybe a little bit more focused on or depending on what happens late in the year in terms of the temperatures on what's going to impact the harvest and in terms of what the crop prices are? We don't know, I mean that you know, if we knew that we are going to do a reinsurance as well.
Brian Meredith: And then last one for you, John. Just curious, you made a comment that you thought that the I guess alternative capacity alternative capital, the reinsurance would continue to be somewhat constrained going into one more renewals, just curious why you think that is?
John Doucette: So I think it's a combination of things. I think both some trapped capital that's still exists. And we think, well, but it's also I think the development that the markets on Irma, the development now that the markets on Jebi and I think - and then you have weather is a surprise or not maybe would depend on who is looking at it, but the situation with a couple of the alternative cat managers and how - what's happened to them, but so I think the sentiment among investors has been strained over the last couple of years. Having had five years of no-cat, basically, a very low cat, below average cats and then to have the two years with the losses. And then also have the development, I think has really focused a lot of the old alternative investors particularly ones that we call tourists that are really just they're just in it because it sounds different and interesting I think are really focusing on whether this is something they want to do. And I think all of that will map to a healthier reinsurance market and healthier retro market as the alternative investment manager is going to be held the higher standards on transparency, rate change, collateral lease and things like that. All that points to us to a healthier property market in 2020 at January one and beyond.
Dom Addesso: Thanks everyone, for your dialogue this morning and patients and a little over, but that's fine. And I can't help but wanted to emphasize that the strategic journey that we've been on is proving successful. I just caution us all to sometimes not to focus one individual metric and for us I think the focus on the fact that our increased diversification has increased our absolute dollar margin - even though our combined ratios may increase due to a lower proportion of cap business but the advantage there's less volatility along, but along with an overall improved profit target and by the way I include investment income on that. We are a unique franchise, global franchise that is delivering returns at the highest levels of the industry right now. An exceedingly well positioned for the future. So again, thank you for your interest and look forward to your dialog and questions in the weeks ahead. Take care, have a good day.
Craig Howie: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-05-08 10:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day and welcome to the Everest Re Group Limited First Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. Today’s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Jon Levenson. You may begin.
Jon Levenson: Thank you and welcome to the Everest Re Group Limited 2019 first quarter conference call. The Everest executives leading today’s call are Dom Addesso, President and Chief Executive Officer; Craig Howie, EVP and Chief Financial Officer; John Doucette, EVP and President and CEO of the Reinsurance Division; and Jonathan Zaffino, EVP and President and CEO of the Everest Insurance Division. Before we begin, I need to preface the comments on today’s call by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. Management comments regarding estimates, projections and similar are subject to the risks, uncertainties and assumptions as noted in Everest’s SEC filings. Management may also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These items are reconciled on our earnings release and financial supplements. With that, I turn the call over to Dom Addesso.
Dom Addesso: Thank you, Jon. Good morning and welcome to the call. It was a very strong financial quarter for Everest with contributions to profit from reinsurance, insurance and investments. We also continue to increase our market profile, with top line growth in both our reinsurance and insurance businesses. My colleagues will provide the details on our results, but before they do, I want to point out a few important insights. The first relates to top line growth. Within the overall increases in gross written premium, there are classes of business being reduced, where the rates are inadequate, terms and conditions are challenged or, in some cases, the customers no longer desire to cover in whole or part. Nevertheless, given current market conditions, along with our meaningful capacity and experienced underwriting teams, Everest is seeing an increasing number of profitable opportunities with the result and increase in business overall. We are proud of the market position that we have built and appreciate the preferred status we have in the market with customers and intermediaries. Second is the underlying performance of our business. We have detailed the change in business mix over the past few years and the impact on the loss and acquisition cost ratios. I note that this quarter, the attritional accident year loss ratio of 59.2% is very consistent with the result for the full year 2018. This is noteworthy for two reasons. First is that our loss selections do not yet reflect any underwriting actions taken, which is typically recognized as improvements are realized. And second, the earned premium in this quarter still reflects a good portion of business at 2018 rates. Rate increases achieved at January 1 and April 1 reinsurance renewals and any further rate increases will be earned throughout the year providing additional improvement to the attritional results. Turning to rates, although it is by no means a traditional hard market, I am encouraged by how the industry is responding to loss activity and trends. While capacity is available, there is a discipline emerging from both balance sheet and third-party capital for cat-related business, in addition to pricing, improving terms and conditions which are essentially equivalent to rate improvement, are also gaining traction. Property pricing has been the most responsive. Although it has taken 2 years of losses to bring change to the underwriting and pricing of the most challenging areas, notably wildfire and the AOB and LAE issues in Florida. Beyond property, the pricing momentum is mixed. Classes of business where profitability is challenged are getting some much needed rate. There is also a renewed discipline around other classes, including commercial auto and professional liability, also reflective of poor results. Other sectors, including energy and excess casualty, are firming, in line with the recognition of advancing loss costs trends and a market that is tightening. And finally, the discipline in London precipitated by tightening capacity at Lloyds and the increase in migration of business from the admitted markets to the E&S space is adding momentum to an improving market. I’m not declaring victory by any stretch, but it is encouraging to see both the primary and reinsurance markets demonstrating a rational response to the issues at hand. Everest is in a fantastic position to capitalize on this improving market due to our fundamental strengths. Our focus on balance sheet strength and financial security is the starting point. The bedrock of our business is a promise to pay, and to that end, we have kept ample levels of capital, low financial leverage and strong ratings. Over the long term, I am confident that shareholders have benefited from this conservatism as it has allowed Everest to access the best business even during times of market stress that otherwise could have gone elsewhere. Everest also has tremendous experience and long-standing relationships with the most important trading partners around the world. We have worked with some customers for over 40 years, and as a result, it’s difficult to replicate highly diversified book of profitable business. And finally, Everest has and will continue to have a strategic focus on long-term performance with a willingness to absorb volatility over the short term. In an improving market, our capacity, relationships and long-term focus are a very powerful combination. One final thought worth highlighting is that Everest is increasingly known as a market leader within the Specialty Insurance segment. The RIMS conference this year certainly spoke to that dynamic. Last year, Everest Insurance achieved excellent growth and underwriting results. And here, in the first quarter, accident year results are likely better than market expectations and many of our specialty insurance peers. While our insurance operations may get overlooked by investors sitting alongside one of the largest and premier reinsurance franchises in the world, the reality is that our insurance group is trending to end the year at record profits and will likely end the year ahead of many of its peers. That is both a size and profit common. I urge you to run the comps and include it’s fair share of investment income. Although Everest is clearly one entity, we have two distinct yet complementary businesses, and I encourage you to look at the value of each individually and the resultant sum of the parts. While both reinsurance and insurance benefit from being part of a larger group and the many synergies they create, they each have a great potential and value on their own and into the future. With that, I turn the call over to Craig.
Craig Howie: Thank you, Dom and good morning everyone. Everest had a solid quarter of earnings, with net income of $349 million for the first quarter of 2019. This compares to net income of $210 million for the first quarter of 2018. The 2019 result represents an annualized net income return on equity of 17%. Net income included $74 million of net after-tax realized capital gains compared to $19 million of capital losses in the first quarter last year. The 2019 capital gains were primarily attributable to fair value adjustments on the public equity portfolio. After-tax operating income for the first quarter was $282 million compared to $220 million in 2018. This represents an annualized operating return on equity of 14%. These results were driven by strong underwriting results across the group, stable investment income and lower catastrophe losses compared to the first quarter last year. The overall underwriting gain for the group was $196 million for the quarter compared to an underwriting gain of $108 million in the same period last year. In the first quarter of 2019, Everest saw $25 million of catastrophe losses related to flooding in Australia compared to $100 million of catastrophe losses reported during the first quarter of 2018. Overall, our prior year catastrophe loss estimates continue to hold. We revised the ultimate loss estimates by event and by segment with no change in the overall loss estimates. Estimated net favorable prior year catastrophe development was offset by $24 million of adverse catastrophe development on the third quarter 2018 Japan loss events. No other events breached our $10 million catastrophe threshold in the first quarter of 2019. Therefore, any losses arising from these events were covered in our attritional loss estimates, which include a load for estimates less than $10 million. The overall current year attritional combined ratio was 87.4%, up slightly from 87.1% in the first quarter of 2018. The attritional loss ratio remained relatively flat at 59.2%, in line with Dom’s earlier comments, while the commission ratio of 22.5% was up slightly compared to the same period last year, primarily due to changes in business mix and contention commission adjustments in the reinsurance segment. The group expense ratio remains low at 5.7% and was lower than prior year due to the increase in earned premium. Our reported combined ratio of 88.7% was lower than first quarter last year, primarily due to the lower reported catastrophe losses in 2019. For investments, pre-tax investment income was $141 million for the quarter. This was based on our $19 billion investment portfolio, a new record for Everest. Investment income was 2% above the first quarter of last year. This result was primarily driven by the increase from the investment grade fixed income portfolio, which had a higher asset base this year. This was partially offset by lower limited partnership income. Since some partnerships report income on a quarter lag, this quarter’s results reflected the poor equity market performance of the 2018 fourth quarter. We would expect there to be improvement in the limited partnership income going forward if the public equity market trading conditions continue to improve in 2019. The pre-tax yield on the overall portfolio was 3%, flat compared to 1 year ago. However, both investment grade and alternative fixed income yields were up year-over-year. On income taxes, the 12.5% effective tax rate on operating income was close to the 13% tax rate we expect for the full year. Positive cash flow continues with operating cash flows of $460 million for the first quarter of 2019 compared to $196 million in 2018. The increase reflects a lower level of paid catastrophe losses in 2019 compared to 2018. Shareholders’ equity for the group was $8.4 billion at the end of the first quarter, up $523 million or 7% compared to year-end 2018. The increase in shareholders’ equity since year-end 2018 is primarily attributable to $349 million of net income and the sharp recovery in a fair value of the investment portfolio, partially offset by capital returned through $57 million of dividends paid and $60 million of share buybacks in the first quarter of 2019. Additionally, we purchased another $9 million of shares after the close of the quarter, for a total of $25 million year-to-date. Everest continues to maintain a very strong capital position with low debt leverage and high liquidity in our investment portfolio, in addition to our robust cash flow. As Dom mentioned, the strength of our balance sheet is critical to the success of our business. An attestation to this is the affirmation of our A.M. Best A+ superior rating announced last week. Thank you. And now John Doucette will provide a review of the reinsurance operations.
John Doucette: Thank you, Craig. Good morning. We are pleased to report a robust underwriting profit and solid premium growth for the Everest Reinsurance Division during the first quarter of 2019. Our business remains well-positioned for the current market and for what we see as the evolving trends over the near-term. While the improving market that is emerging today is not an across-the-board rate lift as we may have seen in years gone by, it nevertheless has the potential to be meaningful and sustainable. And this environment favors companies such as Everest, who have the breadth, depth, flexibility, size and innovation to capture evolving opportunities across all classes of business and territories. Everest’s success in the current market is based on these fundamental strengths: a global brand and platform; long-standing, broad relationships with clients and brokers built up over the last four decades by deeply experienced underwriting teams around the world; meaningful capacity; diversified capital sources; and a strong balance sheet. This quarter, we continued to see the value of partnership with clients, where the reinsurance relationship is strategic for all involved. As our clients have seen pockets of capacity in certain areas reduced, they increasingly turn to Everest to solve their risk and capital needs. Our ability to withstand market stress and continue to provide meaningful, stable capacity over 45 years is of great value to our customers and their intermediaries. Reflecting on the latest two major renewals, January 1 and April 1, we are encouraged with the rate change trend in the market. While not a hard market by historical standards, increasing evidence of stabilization on both underlying business and reinsurance business continues. The market has been reconsidering rates on key parallels and is now painfully aware of the risks embedded in historically less conspicuous parallels such as wildfire. The result is a market requiring rate increases and improved terms and conditions on loss-affected business while maintaining generally stable to increasing prices in non-loss affected programs. Overall reinsurance market capacity remains tight as both traditional and alternative capital are recalibrating their assumptions on loss costs, exposures, risk assessment and various risk perils, particularly given the amount of catastrophe losses over the last 2 years. And they are becoming more selective as to who they will back and the terms and conditions with which they deploy capacity, which is a positive step in the evolution of the overall reinsurance market. The knock-on effect to non-cat lines is also noteworthy. The market’s broad recognition that cat-exposed profit can no longer subsidize underperforming treaties and other lines of business is resulting in actions on terms, conditions and underlying rates if they have been inadequate on a standalone basis. At the same time, there is increased demand as our customers re-underwrite their primary books, apply rate increases and seek to manage their net exposure. Outside of traditional P&C classes, we also find the outlook on our mortgage business robust and continue to see a long runway in the mortgage space for us to deploy capacity profitably in the current forms as well as in new products, structures and distribution sources. Now for a review of our quarterly results. For the reinsurance division overall, we wrote $1.5 billion of gross premium and reported an 86.5% combined ratio. Premiums were up 9% on a constant dollar basis year-on-year, with casualty as strong contributor to the growth. Original casualty rates have seen pockets of improvement, with reinsurance terms and pricing stable and, in some cases, increasing. Lower catastrophe losses helped drive an improved reinsurance division underwriting profit of $177 million, and our overall attritional loss ratio was about flat at 84.7% despite a larger percentage of the earned premium coming from pro rata business, which typically runs to a higher attritional loss ratio. Growth was strongest in our U.S. operations, up 19%, largely due to proportional casualty treaties predominantly written in 2018. The overall combined ratio was stable, with our attritional loss ratio down slightly and the attritional combined ratio up 3 points mainly due to commissions, increasing from the greater mix of pro rata business. The international operations also exhibited strong growth, with premiums up 13% on a constant dollar basis. Increased demand for Facultative reinsurance was a large contributor to the quarter’s growth. And dislocation of capacity in London and other markets improved the opportunities for Everest in many international territories. Results in the international reinsurance segment were impacted by $25 million of loss from the Townsville monsoon and flooding in Australia as well as from increased loss estimates related to the third quarter 2018 Japanese loss events. However, our attritional loss ratio was flat at 53%, and our attritional combined ratio was down 1 point to 78.6%. The Bermuda operations had a decrease in gross premium, dropping 9% on a constant dollar basis. However, the year-over-year comparison was affected by premium recognition timing as the first quarter 2018 premiums were bolstered by the timing of premium reported on certain large accounts. Our London and Dublin operations included in this segment showed growth, benefiting from the dislocation in new markets. Profitability metrics are skewed due to some large shifts in prior period cat reserve to other reinsurance segments. Our attritional loss ratio of 61.6% was up 2.5 points due to an increase in casualty and specialty writings. However, our attritional combined ratio of 87.4% improved slightly. In summary, the first quarter was a solid start to the year for our reinsurance operations, and we remain well-positioned to capture rate improvements due to recent loss activity and overall favorable underlying market trend. Thank you. And now I will turn it over to Jon Zaffino to review our insurance operations.
Jonathan Zaffino: Thanks, John and good morning. Our insurance operations are likewise pleased to report a strong start of the year. Our first quarter performance was excellent as measured across several metrics, most importantly the significant increase in underwriting profitability. This solid first quarter profit continued the trend we have demonstrated over the past 2 years, notably by delivering an underwriting profit in eight of the last nine quarters. Underlying growth was excellent in the quarter, and some of the heavier impacts of non-renewal activity lessened, although have not completely diminished. The Everest global insurance operations produced gross written premium of $595 million for the quarter, an 18% increase over the first quarter of 2018 and a 37% increase over the same period in 2017. As we have over the past 4 years, we continue to pursue thoughtful and disciplined growth within our chosen product segment across the entirety of our global operations. This is the strongest first quarter production we have experienced in our history, and it marks the 17th consecutive quarter of top line growth across a diversified palate of high-value product areas. Most importantly in the quarter, the solid growth, combined with outstanding execution, resulted in underwriting profit of $19 million, a 50% increase over the $13 million of underwriting profit in the first quarter of 2018 and a nearly fourfold increase over the first quarter of 2017. Further, our attritional loss in LAE ratio improved 1.1 points to 65%, reflecting the continued migration toward the higher value and diversified specialty books of business and the earned premium impact of these businesses into our results. The evidence shows that our confidence in pursuing the organic build of a world-class specialty diversified insurance organization has been justified. As we have reported on prior calls, our leadership and underwriting teams across the globe continue to execute well on their individual and collective mandates, particularly during times such as these where we are experiencing transitioning markets. Our teams remain focused on our opportunity set, measured by our robust submission flows across lines of business, continues to grow, something I’ll touch on later. We look forward to build on this momentum throughout the year. Turning to the financial highlights, the global insurance operations produced $595 million in gross written premium in the first quarter, an increase of $90 million or 18% over first quarter 2018 again evidence of our growing relevance in the specialty insurance market. As in prior quarters, contributions remained quite balanced across the diverse group of property and casualty and accident and health underwriting divisions within our global insurance operations. In fact, aside from our program operation, Everest Underwriting Partners, where we’ve taken underwriting actions in pursuit of improved profitability, every other major business segment in the Everest Insurance portfolio delivered growth above 15% over first quarter of 2018. Turning to net premiums, for the first quarter of 2019, net premiums written also grew by 18% to $457 million while net earned premium grew by $32 million or 8% to $425 million. Our reported GAAP combined ratio for the quarter was 95.6%, a solid improvement of 1.2 points over first quarter 2018 and nearly 3 points improved over first quarter 2017. The attritional combined ratio was also 95.6% in the quarter, a 2.4-point improvement over the first quarter 2018, attritional combined of 98% and an 80-basis point improvement over the full year 2018 attritional combined of 96.5%. The overall GAAP loss ratio for the first quarter of 2019 was 65%, effectively flat as compared to last year’s 64.9%. The first quarter of 2019 attritional loss ratio ex cat improved further by 1.1 points over the first quarter of 2018 and a further 3.2-point improvement over first quarter 2017 results. As anticipated and discussed on prior calls, the downward drift on the attritional loss ratio continues. This is a result of an improved mix of business, the growing benefit from the many new businesses launched, the improving underlying rate dynamics and the strategic underwriting actions of the past 4 years. Our expense ratio for the quarter was 30.6%, an improvement of 1.3 points over the prior year period. This is in line with our full year 2018 expense ratio of 30.3%. The first quarter 2019 expense ratio remains very competitive in the specialty insurance market and reflects stabilization around the 30% mark regardless of continued significant investment and talent, new products, new geographies and new technologies. We continue to recruit and retain the best talent in the industry and have invested in modern office locations to assist our colleagues in serving our customers in their local geographies. To support our talented employees and to enhance our client value proposition, we have committed to a robust program of IT investments in both traditional infrastructure and a variety of cutting-edge and innovative technologies. It is through the hard work of colleagues and their tireless commitment to execution that we have been able to pair this investment and growth with an industry-leading expense ratio. I’ll turn now to the market conditions, which are clearly painting a picture of an evolving market. One of the barometers used to draw this conclusion is our submission flows in the quarter, which amounted to our third highest on record. This was particularly acute in our various wholesale dedicated businesses, where submission activity is significantly increasing month-to-month. As for underlying rates, we largely experienced an improving Property and casualty and accident and health pricing picture across the organization, a trend that has continued from last year. The exception has been workers’ compensation, where rates remained under pressure. However, our view of profitability within the line remains positive. Excluding workers’ compensation, overall property and casualty renewal premium change, which includes exposure change, was 6.9% in the quarter. Pure rate change on the same basis increased by 5.5% in the quarter. Virtually, all lines showed quarterly improvement led by commercial auto, property and umbrella excess. Encouragingly, financial lines globally also showed strengthening, building on a trend that began in the last 2 quarters of 2018. This is the highest aggregate rate change we have seen in roughly 5 years. Finally, and this is something that we pay close attention to, terms and conditions also point to improvement, particularly in the property and excess casualty markets. The bottom line for us is that we are focused on achieving adequate technical pricing across our portfolio and are working diligently toward that objective every day. In conclusion, the first quarter 2019 showed continued progress on our journey, along with solid results. Our vision of building a leading specialty diversified insurance company has become a reality. We have demonstrated that our strategy is sound and, more importantly, that we can execute on that strategy as evidenced by our consistent underwriting profitability across 8 of the last 9 quarters. More importantly, we believe we are positioned with the right capabilities, products and, of course, talent to service our customers in this evolving market. We look forward to continuing our positive momentum and reporting back to you next quarter. With that, I’ll turn the call back to Jonathan for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We’ll take our first question from Amit Kumar with The Buckingham Research Group.
Amit Kumar: Thanks and good morning. Just maybe a few questions. The first question is probably for Dom. In the opening remarks, you talked about how the 59.2% was obviously did not reflect some of the things we talked about. I was curious, and maybe this, ties to ties into insurance and reinsurance, how should we think about what would be sort of a normalized fully adjusted number if all the pluses and minuses were to have flown through the numbers?
Dom Addesso: Amit, we don’t forecast earnings or try to give you any specific guidance on the numbers. In large part, that’s the job of you and many others. I think what we’re trying to suggest is that our first quarter numbers, not surprisingly, would be consistent with our 2018 loss picks on an attritional basis. And I think what we’re also trying to suggest is that we’ve got ahead of us rate increases that were already some of which was came through in ‘18. We’ve got rate increases coming January 1 and April renewals, and then of course, highly anticipated June account. So, I think what we’re trying to suggest is that there should be improvement in that number. And that’s somewhat, of course, dependent upon what the level of rate increases are, which we don’t try to publicly prognosticate on a specific level of rate increase. So you’re on your own.
Amit Kumar: No, that’s a fair point. I was probably trying to come up with the Q4 comments and back into maybe 2 or 3 points of improvement. The other question I had was the discussion on reinsurance pricing and the upcoming 6/1 renewal. The 6/1 reinsurance premiums have [obviously seen a growth] substantially for the Q2 2018 versus Q2 2017. I was curious, based on how you’re thinking about capital deployment, is it going to be more about risk selection at 6 at the upcoming renewal and, net-net, your size of the book remains mostly unchanged? Or how should we think about that?
Dom Addesso: Well, that of course, Amit, is somewhat dependent upon what’s presented to us at 6/1. As we’ve said, we certainly would anticipate some meaningful rate activity and terms and conditions, which are improving, which essentially is rate. But naturally, that will vary by client. So, in some cases, the level of rate activity will vary by client, I guess is where I’ll try to leave that. Our activity at 1/1 reflected some reduction in our exposure, as you could see from our PML’s disclosures. And that was, of course, due to the fact that we did not achieve the level of rate increase that we felt was necessary. And on a risk-adjusted basis, some of the accounts were non-renewed. Whether or not that present itself in the same way at 6/1, not very likely. We certainly anticipate 6/1 will be much stronger than what we saw at 1/1. And what we saw at 4/1, by the way, were meaningful rate increases. And in fact, Japan was an area, for example, where we had pulled back in more recent times due to risk-adjusted pricing going down, but we actually increased slightly our participation in Japan at 4/1. So, it’s a mixed bag. It’ll be dependent upon what the market opportunities present to us. But I don’t know that you’ll necessary, see us meaningfully increase our exposure.
Amit Kumar: That’s a fair point. The final question might be for Craig or John. The $37 million positive movement in the catastrophes in the U.S. reinsurance, where is that from?
Craig Howie: So, Amit, we go through a comprehensive approach this is Craig to review our cat reserves on a current year basis but also in prior years as well. And we go through them. We look at each of them. However, we reserve on a group-level basis, not a segment-level basis. These events do not always fit neatly into a segment because the exposure can be written from multiple segments. We tend to react quickly to any adverse development, as you saw from the Japan loss events from 2018 that we took a charge for, but we take our time to react to any favorable development until that position becomes more mature. So, you may see movements between segments, but it’s really done at an overall level.
Amit Kumar: Okay. So that $37 million is from several pluses and minuses, I think is what you’re saying versus one single event?
Craig Howie: Correct.
Amit Kumar: Got it okay I will stop here thanks for the answers and good luck for the future.
Craig Howie: Thank you, Amit.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll take our next question from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi good morning. My first question, I was hoping to spend a little bit more time on the forward pricing environment. I recognize we’re still on discussions for the midyear renewals. But given what we’ve seen in the industry with Irma and the development with Irma, I mean can you give us a sense what kind of price increases would you need to see for this to be a successful renewal versus prices? If we get closer to 6/1 and prices fall short of expectations, is there a certain bar where Everest is going to walk away if they’re not able to recoup price increases after 2 successive years of losses?
Dom Addesso: So, Elyse, I’m going to ask John to comment John Doucette to comment, but let me just say that consistent with what I’ve said before is that we try not to prognosticate where the rate increases will be going and frankly where they even need to be. It varies by client, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, depending upon client experience, other relationships, risk-adjusted returns, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. And frankly, it doesn’t really do us any service to be trying to put a specific number or bar on it. I think it probably telegraphs an inconsistent message or an incorrect message to The Street. And frankly, it perhaps depending on the client relationship, it could be the inappropriate target for a specific client. So, it doesn’t really serve our purpose to be putting a benchmark or drawing a line in the sand, so to speak, as you described. But John, do you have any further...
John Doucette: Yes, and thanks, Dom. Elyse, thanks for the question. First, I do want to highlight that there’s actually been 3 years of hurricanes hitting Florida, not 2, with Matthew, Irma and Michael. And I think there’s been a lot of movement there, and I think there’s been – as Dom said, as we look at this, we need to achieve the rates that we expect at, and that will vary by client. That will vary by product. That will vary by attachment. But we fully intend to differentiate the clients in terms of how they have performed with their losses, with their LAE, with AOB, with their loss creep, et cetera. So that will all factor in. We clearly see capacity tight as we head into the market both as I touched on in my earlier comments, both on the traditional and in the alternative space for a variety of reasons due to some of the aforementioned reasons, but also just the reload the alternative capital and the lack of reload. So, a couple of other points, that we continue to look to where we want to allocate capacity and not just property that’s not just by a client in Florida. And we are allocating more capacity to global clients, where obviously as Jon Zaffino articulated, deploying more capital and capacity on the insurance space. We’re seeing increasing opportunities on the casualty reinsurance space and, as I said, on the mortgage space. So, all of that factors into a higher required return threshold for where we are headed into our Florida business. We don’t predict rates, but we think it’s going to be a very, very late renewal, potentially messy. And ultimately, we think it’ll be profitable for us.
Dom Addesso: The only thing I’d add to add, Elyse, is that while it’s maybe precisely on point to your question, hopefully this helps. I did describe earlier that we’ve increased our participation in the Japan market. And there, we’re seeing rate increases of 20% to 30%. So maybe that gives you some notion of our appetite and maybe perhaps what’s needed generally.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. That’s very helpful. And then in terms of your Jebi development in the quarter, so if we look at where your initial loss sat, and we’ve seen a lot of development across the industry, and so the development that we’ve seen from you guys, smaller percentage of your initial loss, is there a difference in how you attach on treaties there? Or maybe the level of insured losses you’ve used when you set up the reserve for the losses in the third quarter of last year? Just any guidance there that we should think about in terms of the development on Jebi?
Dom Addesso: So, we believe that last year, when we established that reserve, we were at the high above frankly, we’re way above where the industry estimates were at the time. So that obviously kept us in good stead as well as the fact that we’ve essentially when you look at the losses in Asia, we’re looking at them as a group of losses as with respect to that marketplace. So, I think all of those factors combined enabled us to have that managed appropriately.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. That’s helpful. My last....
Dom Addesso: Give me one second. I think maybe John Doucette...
John Doucette: Yes, and I just want to give a little bit of a frame of our market share in Japan. So, if you think back since over many years, we had post, the Tohoku earthquake substantial rate increases, and we significantly increased our book of business then. And then over the last several years, there had been a downward pressure on the rates. And we, accordingly, kind of turned our books each year a little bit for the worst performing accounts, and we also were moving up capacity, which I think is reflective of where we find ourselves for the Japanese book overall.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. That’s helpful. And then my last question was on the expense ratio. It was up a little bit year-over-year. And then if I look within the U.S. reinsurance segment, you saw an uptick a decent amount uptick in the commission and brokerage ratio from where you’ve been trading. Is there something going on there that we should think about in terms of modeling going forward?
Craig Howie: So, Elyse, this is Craig. Expenses year-over-year, one of the things that you saw at year-end, was variable pay expenses, where we’re taking down at the end of last year, predominantly due to the profitability of the book. Those are back in normal, ranges for this year overall, but what you’re seeing is just a slight uptick in expense dollars. But overall, the expense ratio is staying at a low level of 5.7% overall.
John Doucette: Yes, and Elyse, this is John. I just want to add a little more color on the mix change. So, we also have been talking about increasing our casualty book of business overall, increasing our pro rata business. And at 1/1, we took action based on rates tied to our property retro and aggregate retro portfolio, and that decreased. The combination of those, all those, do have or did have an impact on the attritional combined ratio.
Dom Addesso: And the expense ratio, of course, is...
Craig Howie: Is down year-over-year.
Dom Addesso: Is down over year. But the commission ratio had a and I think you referenced the U.S. reinsurance, that had a contingent commission adjustment in the first quarter, a true-up, if you will, due to the mortgage book.
Elyse Greenspan: And how much was that true-up?
Craig Howie: Overall, it relates to a bunch of things. It relates to contingent commission and the mortgage true-up, but it’s also relates to the business mix that we had with more pro rata business coming on the books that John just mentioned.
John Doucette: And different classes of business that specifically have contingent commissions in them.
Dom Addesso: So, we don’t have one specific number for the mortgage adjustment.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay, that’s helpful. Thank you for all the color.
Dom Addesso: Thank you, Elyse.
Craig Howie: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll take our next question from Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs.
Yaron Kinar: Thank you. Good morning, everybody. I guess this question is a multi-part question. So, first, just looking at the total reinsurance underlying attritional combined ratio of 87.4%, it just seems a little bit lower than the roughly 87% number that I think we had run rated last quarter. So, other than maybe contingent commissions or a couple of other minor – are there any major drivers there that, that would have resulted in this significant improvement quarter-to-quarter?
John Doucette: No, I mean, we continue to deploy more capacity into the mortgage space, which we think has a robust risk reward characteristic. And as you may recall, the mortgage book are basically multi-year deal. They’re over several years. So, deals from 3 years ago were still getting earned premium, 2 years ago, et cetera, 1 year ago, as well as writing new premium. That certainly has the directional impact of improving the attritional combined ratio given the potential profitability in the mortgage portfolio.
Yaron Kinar: Okay. That’s helpful. And then, Dom, from your earlier comments, it sounds like between the underwriting actions that you’ve taken and has been implemented starting in January and the rate increases that you’ve been seeing, you are expecting an overall improvement. So basically, you are expecting that rates will be an excess of loss trends. Is that kind of broadly true? Are there lines of business or geographies where you actually don’t see that to be the case?
Dom Addesso: Not in any meaningful way. I think generally – and that’s primarily because in any particular class of business in a particular geography, and of course, this can get pretty minute. But if that were the case then you’d be seeing us take capacity move it away from those from that sector. I’m not sure that I could really highlight anything that’s moving in the wrong direction.
Yaron Kinar: Okay. And then I guess one last quick one. I think the increase in losses from Japan is for all 3 industry events, so Jebi, Trami and then the flood losses. Would you be able to break that out?
Dom Addesso: We do not break that out.
Yaron Kinar: Okay. But if I take the 3 industry events together, it would seem like you are in the 80 basis point to 90 basis point market share of those 3 losses based on current estimates. Is that roughly how you’re seeing it?
Craig Howie: Roughly 1%.
Yaron Kinar: Roughly 1%, okay. Thank you very much.
Dom Addesso: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll take our next question from Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research.
Ryan Tunis: Hey thanks. Just looking for a little bit more color on the texture behind the Japan book now at renewals maybe in terms of premium size, how much of that is quota share? What’s the weighting between the wind and the quake and how much of that – if it’s excess of loss is aggregate or occurrence?
John Doucette: Good morning, Ryan, this is John. So, our Japan book is about $60 million – $50 million to $60 million, up slightly this year over prior years. The mix would be – I don’t have that in front of us. The mix would be mostly excess of loss business and that’s mostly property. There’s some other surety, fidelity and some other smaller programs that we write for a lot of the major clients.
Ryan Tunis: Thank you. And then a follow-up for Dom, going back to the prepared remarks about – thinking about these 2 businesses from a similar parts context. I’m just curious, like what is your ROE outlook on – where the primary insurance business is today and where the reinsurance business is?
Dom Addesso: Well, first of all, our – we would certainly target an ROE in the double-digits. Clearly, we would expect a higher ROE out of our reinsurance business and the insurance business given the volatility there. A couple of 100 basis point difference, but that’s about as specific as I think I’d want to get without giving you a specific number, which would then, of course, translate into an earnings projection.
Ryan Tunis: Fair enough. Thanks.
Dom Addesso: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll take our next question from Joshua Shanker with Deutsche Bank.
Joshua Shanker: Yes, good morning, everybody.
Dom Addesso: Good morning.
Joshua Shanker: I want to talk a little bit about pricing, obviously, both sides of the markets. First of all, in terms of the rate increases on the primary inside and it’s not just for you, but others, to what extent are broadly discussed industry price increases going to get mitigated by higher outwards reinsurance costs, which you guys will benefit from? And two, in absence of property pricing being up, I’m sure in your non-property lines, you had all seen price increases, but would it be business as usual or is there really something palpable going on outside of the property-driven pricing markets?
Jonathan Zaffino: Good morning, Josh, this is Jon. Let me take that from the primary side. First and foremost, I don’t see this as a reinsurance-driven pricing change. I think some of the underlying fundamental dynamics are such that there are a number of areas that just simply needed to correct the rate action. So, we’re seeing that across several lines, some of which I mentioned in my script, we’re actually seeing some of the momentum actually built, which is – which fundamentally I think is creating a pretty interesting dynamic and outlook. So, we anticipate that to continue as the year moves on and we’re seeing it outside of property. We mentioned the commercial auto, not a new story obviously. But as I mentioned earlier, in the financial lines, you’re starting to see particularly in some of the management liability areas, public company D&O, certainly primary layers, you’re starting to see increased rate of change happening there in terms of rate action. So, we just see it’s sort of a broad-based move, but a lot of it being driven by underlying fundamentals versus kind of a top-down view.
Joshua Shanker: And even though it’s not being driven by the reinsurance side, are your clients going to see some of their rate-driven margin expansion curtailed by higher outwards reinsurance costs?
Dom Addesso: Well, there would be – we would expect the industry – the primary industry to obviously realize some of the reinsurance rate increases. I’m not so sure that, that would translate into margin compression on their end. I think their rate levels, clearly, the reinsurance spend is only a portion of their gross written premium. But I think the economics are such that I wouldn’t necessarily expect any compression for their margin because of increased reinsurance pricing.
Joshua Shanker: Fair enough.
Jonathan Zaffino: And I think – and John Doucette can speak more to this, but I – everyone buys differently. So, I think it’s a very difficult translation of one-to-one. So, I don’t know, John, if you want to comment on the demand side.
John Doucette: Yes. What we’re clearly seeing a lot of our clients, reinsurance clients, looking to grow – to buy more frankly, grow their reinsurance treaties and some of them are property-driven for volatility. Interestingly, we’re still seeing a lot of demand on the casualty side of the house. And that is resulting in – so to your – to the original question, we’re still seeing non-property rate improvement with improved terms and conditions and lower ceding commissions on the casualty, the broader casualty part. And then we’re also seeing some pick-up in some of the specialty reinsurance areas, aviation, marine, et cetera. We’re seeing some lift, some of that’s really loss-driven. So, we’re seeing some opportunities there that we wouldn’t have found attractive in prior years, but at a better pricing, we could put more capacity to work there.
Dom Addesso: The one area, Josh, where you may see some of which you’re suggesting could be in Florida with some of the smaller companies, where they may feel a little bit of pressure from rising reinsurance costs, but that would be the only spot where I think that would potentially go through.
Joshua Shanker: Alright, well, thank you for the answers.
Dom Addesso: Thank you, Josh.
John Doucette: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll take our next question from Meyer Shields with KBW.
Meyer Shields: Thanks. I was hoping you could give us an – your views on the sophistication of the Japanese catastrophe models compared to the ones we’ve got for the Southeastern United States?
John Doucette: So, let’s start with first, all models are wrong. And every time a loss happens, some of the weaknesses get demonstrated and then there’s kind of a look back and a retooling back to cover the losses that happened. And I think that’s one of the reasons why we take a pretty holistic view on – across the whole board and really try to think about it on a first principle basis and so not just be model-driven. So, our – I think the data is getting better over time overall, but it’s still not nearly as good in a lot of international areas as it is in the U.S., that would include Japan. But it has gotten a lot better over the last several years and the models therefore are also better.
Meyer Shields: No, great. Thank you. That’s very helpful. Second question, I think it’s – my impression at least is that, you tend to see reinsurance buyers or really all insurers get somewhat more optimistic in their loss picks during soft markets and then that reverses when rates rise. Can you talk about how you sort of manage against that in the reinsurance book?
Dom Addesso: Well, I mean, it’s an interesting observation, and, of course, selecting an ELR and knowing the true cause of business, cost of goods sold in this business is something that you never really know for years into the future. So, you never really know accurately your cost of goods sold and it’s always a challenge. So, the best way to deal with that is to use all the tools that are available to you, stay true to your process, be conservative and disciplined around how you establish loss reserves and just collect all the data you can. And I think what we’ve shown and demonstrated is that in our attritional book, we have a fairly good track record over the last half a dozen years or so of reasonably reserving through various market cycles. But look it’s never an exact science and it’s all about being presenting the fair financial picture, which we think we’ve done. John?
John Doucette: Just to add a little more color, we also benefit – and this is where I think data and experience with clients, clients’ business in different territories, I mean, we write this business for over 45 years. We write in basically all P&C lines in all territories and have traded with 70% of our clients for decades now. And that’s incredibly helpful because we can pull up prior year submissions. We can pull up similar clients and we can look and build. So, I think being – having a global footprint for a long period of time gives us a very strong insight into what we think the market really is, the loss pick really is and the rating environment really is, which I think has helped us time and time again being in that favorable position to be able to execute on that and not just rely specifically on what a specific client information tells us, but to be able to pull in across kind of our institutional knowledge on actuarial pricing and trends – loss trends and whatnot.
Dom Addesso: And to be specific about our process and I know we’ve mentioned this from time to time, what we do in our process is that after the last reserve study and this will apply to every class of business, we then apply to that last reserve study selection, we apply what’s happening with rates. So, if there are rate decreases going on in the marketplace, we will take the last reserve study pick and adjust it downward or upward, I’m sorry, for any rate decreases and the opposite if there are rate increases going on. So, that’s how we deal with it specific to our company.
Meyer Shields: Okay. That was very thorough and helpful. Thank you.
Dom Addesso: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll take our next question from Brian Meredith with UBS.
Brian Meredith: Yes, thanks. Most of my questions have been asked, but just one quick question here. John, what do you think the impact of the AOB legislation in Florida is going to have on just the pricing environment to the kind of loss cost stuff going forward?
John Doucette: Yes, it’s a great question. Again, we try to absorb all the information out there. We don’t really try to make specific predictions on what this is going to do or what that is going to do in a while. I’ll go back to 3 years of hurricanes hitting Florida, a lot of capacity, the loss creep that we did see, I think capacity is tight, as Dom alluded to, a lot of the reinsurance clients there, their reinsurance programs are capital for them, and I think they need to be reflective of the not-so-great experience over the last couple of years. We certainly hope and we think it’s a positive move that the Florida legislature is addressing this issue. So, hopefully, that’ll make an overall better healthier market in the long-term.
Brian Meredith: I guess most specifically, do the quota shares actually done in Florida, do you think it’ll have any impact on pricing then or are you going to kind of just wait and see what happens call it a year from now?
John Doucette: I think there could be – I think – I don’t know if your question was insurance pricing, the original pricing or reinsurance pricing.
Brian Meredith: Yes.
John Doucette: I think it’s going to be – I’m – there’s going to be directional movements up and down on all that stuff. But again, I think the capacity is tighter at this renewal.
Brian Meredith: Great. Thank you.
Dom Addesso: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, there are no further questions in the queue.
Dom Addesso: Good. I’ll just sum up here. Thank you for joining this morning and for your questions and discussion. Certainly, we’re off to a good start for the year, but more important is what is likely to unfold as the year progresses. And I think as you have heard from us and other market participants the rate outlook is quite positive. This along with our many business initiatives and expansion opportunities causes us to be very optimistic about our future. So, I look forward to interacting with many of you in the weeks ahead and have a good day. Thanks again.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s teleconference. You may now disconnect.

===== 2018 Q4  (2019-02-12 10:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Everest Re Group Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. Today's call is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Jon Levenson. Please go ahead, sir.
Jon Levenson: Thank you, and welcome to the Everest Re Group Ltd. 2018 fourth quarter and year-end conference call. The Everest executives leading today's call are Dom Addesso, President and Chief Executive Officer; Craig Howie, EVP and Chief Financial Officer; John Doucette, EVP and President and CEO of the Reinsurance Division; and Jonathan Zaffino, EVP and President and CEO of the Everest Insurance Division. Before we begin, I need to preface the comments on today's call by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. Management comments regarding estimates, projections and similar are subject to the risks, uncertainties and assumptions as noted in Everest's SEC filings. Management may also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These items are reconciled in our earnings release and financial supplements. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dom Addesso.
Dominic Addesso: Thanks, Jon. Good morning and thank you all for joining on the call this morning. As you know, Everest's fourth quarter was impacted by catastrophes in the amount of $695 million. This follows a third quarter with a series of events as well. It has been an unusual two-year period, estimated to be the highest on record at almost $240 billion of losses over those two years. With our global presence, balance sheet and business model, we undoubtedly expect our share of the losses. While the current estimates are consistent with prior market events, the difference from prior years is that despite the significant size of the catastrophes, Everest was still able to generate operating earnings over the two-year period of $603 million. This is the result of a focused effort to continue to diversify our portfolio by expanding our product set in both our reinsurance and insurance businesses. We would expect that trend to continue as momentum is building rapidly in these initiatives. More on that later from my colleagues. Turning to our property cat business. Our portfolio over time has produced excess returns, extremely positive on average, but variable over any individual period. Many years are great and others require fortitude. However, as I have noted in the past, in the short term there may be some adjustments on our portfolio, particularly as we continue to allocate more capital to casualty and mortgage businesses. To be clear, the cat business remains a core part of our portfolio. However, pricing for risk in many circumstances has not firmed as much as required. On that business we take a pause and allocate our capital elsewhere. January did present some very good opportunities to get better risk-adjusted returns and some renewals were already adequately priced with expiring. Retro pricing, large programs and loss affected accounts, on balance, were strong. Nevertheless, our January 1 business for property cat reinsurance was down due to pricing on some business. Going forward, we would expect a stronger market as April and June renewals are dominated by loss affected areas, notably Japan and Florida. The market has some repair to do in these areas as industry issues, particularly in Florida around LAE and AOB are factors that have not been well considered in pricing. Couple that with what we see as desire for improved economics by third-party capital, and you have the recipe for positive renewal. We view the influence of alternative capital as somewhat neutral due to what appears to be at least some slowdown in the rate of growth there due to lockups from last year and perhaps a view on adequacy of pricing. Our conversation this morning should also focus on our strategic objective of building a diversified global reinsurer and insurer. To that point, you will note the strong performance of our insurance operation this year as highlighted by the fact that for the first time in many years, we produced an underwriting profit. This has truly been a journey as the legacy portfolio required some work. While at the same time, we were expanding into new classes and territories. We have set the table with an array of product offerings and many new distribution relationships and an international presence in London, Dublin and Toronto. This $2 billion-plus specialty insurer is completely overhauled and now truly represents our go-forward base. We are poised to accelerate from here and insurance will undoubtedly be a larger part of our future. Similarly, on the reinsurance front, we continue our diversification work. In terms of classes of business, mortgage and other credit-related premium continue to grow and are becoming a more relevant part of our underwriting profits. Also, as we have mentioned on previous calls, the casualty classes have seen improvement in rates, terms and conditions. As a result, our treaty casualty book is profitable and growing. This growth is mostly in proportional business, which does drive the overall combined ratio up, but nominal margins are increased with a higher premium base. Looking at geography, our new Zurich branch is enabling us to gain increased penetration in the Continental European market. On the investment front, while we still manage an overall conservative portfolio, we generated very positive returns, mainly due to our strategies around private equity. Rates are inching up. And while that bodes well going forward, it does have the medium term impact of negatively affecting marks on our existing portfolio. As a result, we have an unrealized loss this year which affects book value. But since the duration of our portfolio is relatively short, this will reverse as bonds mature. From a capital perspective, we did less than we planned in buybacks this past year due to cats. This was mostly due to being in blackout periods during the year as a result of uncertainty around cats and not because of any threat to our capital base, which is solid. As we go forward on our diversification efforts, there will likely be opportunity to consider additional buybacks as diversification could result in the ability to expand the premium to surplus ratio. This of course is all subject to the opportunities we see ahead as the market is developing. Before I turn it over to my colleagues where they will go into some detail on the operations, let me say that we have never been more confident about our ability to continue to perform at a high level. As I mentioned, volatility, although likely reduced in the near term given our portfolio expansion, remains a factor in our business. Nevertheless, Everest's ability to compound book value well above the industry over the long term remains our hallmark. Balance sheet strength remains intact, coupled with significant hedging structures in place and low financial leverage. Our diversification efforts at the Group level are taking hold. The insurance brand is growing profitably as a unique specialty insurer with global reach, achieving record gross written premium and positive underwriting income. After two challenging years, we find ourselves well-positioned in a changing macro environment. Cat pricing is likely to firm in certain areas given loss activity over the past two years, which could create enhanced opportunities. And insurance growth is in an improved rating environment presents some unique opportunities. The platforms we have in place are sound and my colleagues across the entire organization are outstanding. Our culture of underwriting and expense discipline, coupled with an entrepreneurial spirit, will enable us to continue to be a market leader. And I look forward to your questions later. And now over to Craig for the financial highlights.
Craig Howie: Thank you, Dom, and good morning, everyone. Everest had a net loss of $382 million for the fourth quarter of 2018, a quarter heavily impacted by catastrophe losses and realized capital losses. This compares to net income of $571 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. Net income for the year was $104 million compared to $469 million in 2017. The full year of 2018 was also impacted by catastrophe losses and realized capital losses. For the year, net income included $109 million of net after-tax realized capital losses compared to $102 million of capital gains in 2017. The capital losses were primarily attributable to fair value adjustments on our public equity portfolio. Since the end of the year, we've seen pre-tax realized capital gains of over $50 million. The after-tax operating loss for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $237 million compared to $535 million of operating income in 2017. Operating income excludes realized capital gains and losses, foreign exchange and the tax impact related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. For the year, operating income was $191 million compared to $413 million in 2017. The primary difference was higher catastrophe losses booked in 2018. In the fourth quarter, Everest saw $875 million of net pre-tax catastrophe losses compared to $36 million in fourth quarter of 2017. The breakdown of the pre-tax loss estimates by event is as follows: Hurricane Michael was $400 million; the Camp Fire in California was $300 million; the Woolsey Fire in California was $150 million; and the Australia hailstorm was $25 million, for a total of $875 million in the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, the results reflected net pre-tax catastrophe losses of $1.7 billion in 2018 compared to $1.3 billion in 2017. These losses were pre-tax figures net of reinsurance and reinstatement premium. As a reminder, the Company uses net after-tax loss estimates when setting its catastrophe loss exposure budget for the year. Excluding the catastrophe events, reinstatement premiums and favorable prior year reserve development, the underlying book continues to perform well with an overall current year attritional combined ratio of 87% for the year compared to 85% last year. This increase is due to a change in business mix, with the growth in our pro rata premium during 2018 which carries a higher combined ratio. Our year-to-date Group expense ratio remains well at 5.4%, while our commission ratio of 21.9% remains stable. On reserves. We completed the remainder of our annual loss reserve studies during the fourth quarter. The results of the studies indicated that overall reserves were redundant and in the fourth quarter we booked $74 million of favorable prior-year reserve development. This included favorable prior-year prior-period development for both the insurance segment and the reinsurance segments and is in addition to the $100 million of favorable prior year development reported in the second and third quarters of 2018. The insurance segment reported $51 million of favorable prior year reserve development during the quarter and $52 million for the year, which was largely related to its workers compensation business. The reinsurance segments reported $23 million of favorable prior year development during the quarter and $122 million for the year, which related to the casualty and property business, both in the United States and Bermuda. These redundancies have developed over time but we don't react until the position becomes more mature. We continue to hold our loss reserve estimates for the more recent years. For investments, pre-tax investment income was $140 million for the quarter and $581 million for the year on our $18 billion investment portfolio. Year-to-date investment income was up $38 million or 7% from one year ago. The result was primarily driven by higher yields on the fixed income portfolio and the increase in limited partnership income, which was up $10 million over 2017. During the fourth quarter, we made a tactical shift to de-risk the investment portfolio. We reduced our public equity and alternative investment portfolios by over $500 million and reinvested in investment-grade fixed income. The pre-tax yield on the overall portfolio was 3.2% compared to 3.1% one year ago as both investment-grade and alternative fixed income yields were up year-over-year. The rising new money yields will boost future net investment income. On income taxes. The tax benefit was the result of losses associated with the catastrophes this year. Since the majority of the catastrophe events were written in the United States, the tax benefit primarily reflects the U.S. tax rate. The effective tax rate is an annualized calculation that includes planned catastrophe losses for the year. For 2019, we expect our tax rate to be about 13%, which reflects an annual cat load of less than 7 points. Shareholders' equity for the Group was $7.9 billion at the end of 2018 compared to $8.4 billion at the end of 2017. The decline in shareholders' equity during 2018 is primarily attributable to the $256 million mark-to-market impact on the fixed income investment portfolio, $77 million of foreign currency translation adjustments and capital returned through $260 million of dividends paid as well as $75 million of share buybacks, partially offset by $104 million of net income. Since year-end, the mark-to-market gain on the fixed income portfolio is approximately $100 million pre-tax. Our capital position remains strong. The catastrophe losses of 2017 and 2018 were contained within earnings and therefore had no impact on our capital position. During the year - during the quarter, the Company announced an 8% increase in its regular quarterly dividend and paid $1.40 per share in the fourth quarter of 2018. Thank you. And now John Doucette will provide a review of the reinsurance operations.
John Doucette: Thank you, Craig. Good morning. Following the unprecedented back-to-back years of significant catastrophe losses, Everest remains as a solid and stable partner for our clients with the financial strength, experienced underwriters and a full suite of products required in this rapidly changing market. Although our 2018 earnings were impacted by these catastrophe losses, our capital position remains strong and our willingness to deploy meaningful capacity at favorable risk-adjusted pricing remains intact. Our resilience is the result of our ongoing strategy to build an extremely diversified reinsurance portfolio by class of business, product type and geography. Although 01/01 pricing did not reflect a traditional across-the-board hard market, Everest still had a successful renewal. We were able to allocate our capacity to the best opportunities by proactively utilizing our core skill and our market differentiators. These include: a strong balance sheet and ratings, with meaningful capacity and $13 billion of underwriting capital, including our third-party capital; a full suite of products across all P&C lines of business in most geographies; trust from reinsurance buyers and brokers in the strength, stability and longevity of Everest; we have been trading with many of our customers and brokers around the globe for over 40 years; experienced underwriters in local markets with deep product expertise; and a dynamic culture with a flat, nimble organization that can pivot swiftly to the best opportunities. Through these strengths, we empower our local teams to execute, unencumbered by internal and external distractions such as M&A, weakening relevance and restructurings that several of our competitors face. Accordingly, during this renewal season we focused on the best underwriting opportunities in support of our core clients. Everest maintained and increased shares on our clients' most strategic programs and layers that also demonstrated the best prices for the exposures. This focused underwriting meant moving away from some property layers or programs while increasing some casualty or other long tail lines which has further diversified our portfolio. Now some detail on the reinsurance division's financial results for the full year of 2018. The reinsurance business experienced strong growth in gross written premiums of 22%, with all three segments contributing strongly to $6.2 billion in gross written premium in 2018. Much of the growth across the reinsurance division came from non-property lines, including casualty, motor, mortgage, surety and aviation. While underwriting profit per dollar of pro rata premium is lower than excessive loss, volatility is also considerably lower, consuming less capital per premium dollar. As a result, Everest had $360 million of underwriting profit in 2018 from nonproperty lines of reinsurance, which is up over $50 million versus 2017. For the full year of 2018, the reinsurance operations reported a 113% combined ratio, with 33 points of net cat losses incurred. The attritional combined ratio is up about 3 points to 84% from 2017, given the larger amount of pro rata premium and more casualty premiums earned during 2018. The U.S. reinsurance segment 2018 gross written premiums grew by 16% to $3 billion. The largest contributions were from pro rata casualty, mortgage and pro rata property. With 135% combined ratio, this segment bore the brunt of the catastrophe losses, most notably California wildfires, Hurricanes Michael and Florence and the development on Hurricane Irma. Total catastrophe losses reported to this segment were 58 loss ratio points for the year. The 2018 attritional combined ratio was 83%, up about 5 points from 2017 due to more pro rata earned premium. In the Bermuda segment, 2018 gross written premium grew to $1.7 billion, an increase of 38%. This segment had its strongest growth from casualty pro rata, Lloyd's fee-bearing deal and mortgage. In addition, motor, aviation, political risk and trade credit written out of our London and Zurich operations also contributed to the growth in the Bermuda segment. This segment had an 88.5% combined ratio, aided by 2 points of reduction in prior year attritional losses. The 2018 attritional combined ratio was 88 points, representing a 1.5-point decrease from 2017, despite the larger mix of proportional business. In the international segment, we grew gross written premium 17% to $1.5 billion in 2018. Growth was broad-based, including pro rata property and casualty in many territories including Canada, Latin America, Asia and Middle East and Africa as well as robust growth in international fac. The combined ratio was 96.9%, which included 18 points of catastrophe losses. The 2018 attritional combined ratio was 81.1%, with about a 2.6-point increase in the attritional loss ratio from 2017. The amount of pro rata premium affected this metric also. In 2018, most of our roughly 15 major reinsurance profit centers made an underwriting profit, with the exception of those few which were heavily impacted by large risk losses and the catastrophes in the USA and in Japan. Now I will give some color on the January 1 renewal. We headed into the 01/01 renewals with the strategy to push rate, terms and conditions on property where needed, to deploy more risk capital into other classes with improving economics, notably casualty, mortgage and credit. We also planned to increase support of our global clients and strategic reinsurance partners, areas which continue to develop strongly with meaningful profit opportunities. Broadly, we were successful with this plan. Now more details about 01/01. Regarding property reinsurance, the overall market at 01/01 was mixed. Loss affected business and retrocessional accounts showed rate increases, while much of the remaining market was relevantly flat. In areas unaffected by losses and on small capacity layers that are easier to fill out the required capacity, these were much more closer to flat or even down which was disappointing given recent industry losses. Everest held the line on changes to terms and conditions and reduced our share where economics fell below our expectation of acceptable pricing levels. We reserved our cat capacity for our best clients and the best price opportunities, while leaving some dry powder to deploy for property business throughout 2019. Altogether, both our 01/01 property premium and exposures have reduced as we pushed rate, terms and conditions and withheld capacity where we found it prudent. In terms of pricing at 01/01, as we have demonstrated in multiple prior renewal cycles, we were able to achieve significantly improved risk-adjusted rates, beyond what was reflected by the average market rate changes mentioned in the headline. This is driven by our leading global franchise and ability to deploy meaningful capacity in all P&C lines for clients around the world. The end result was an overall improvement in expected ROE across our global property cat book, but with a wide dispersion of results. Our growth in - reinsurance more than made up our decrease in property writings. Our expanded long tail writings have included new deals as well as increased shares on accounts with improving pricing on the original insurance rates, increased reinsurance rates or improved ceding commissions. Furthermore, we continue to expand our product set and capabilities. We have recently added to our in-force business in lines such as multipara crop in North America and in Asia; mortgage, structured products, aviation, political risk and trade credit and several new product offerings in Canada; and we continue to see improving pricing in broader opportunities in facultative business in the U.S. and internationally, given dislocation in several major markets. In summary, the market at this 01/01 renewal is mixed, particularly given the loss activity over the last two years. But overall, we were pleased with our ability to execute our game plan. We pushed rate, terms and conditions on property reinsurance; deployed more risk capital in both a relative and absolute basis in casualty and mortgage; and we expanded relationships with global clients who continue to want to buy more reinsurance across all property and casualty lines from large, well-rated global reinsurers such as Everest. Our success with the global clients was particularly noteworthy in our London and Zurich operations at January 1st. Given a relative shift to more casualty and more pro rata, we have seen upward pressure on the attritional loss ratio. But the dollars of underwriting margin remain robust and we like the trade. We expect our Q1 2019 business, which is broader than just 01/01, to be up on gross written premium compared to Q1 2018, given our strong success and continued opportunities in the segments I just mentioned. We also expect gross written premium booked throughout 2019 and beyond. This is from large proportional deals where we recognize premium throughout the year slower than some of our competitors as well as from multiyear deals such as mortgage. So we effectively have written but not reported premium coming from these classes. On the alternative capital side, investors continue to support Mt. Logan as we onboarded some new investors at 01/01/19, resulting in assets under management being slightly up compared to a year ago. Investors in Mt. Logan benefit from Everest's world-class property underwriting expertise and access to broadly diversified business from around the globe. And Everest investors continue to get the benefit of protections from Logan in above-average cat years such as 2017 and 2018. Given the improvement in our reinsurance portfolio, supported by our organizational resilience, underwriting acumen, relevance and diversified capital structure, we remain bullish on our future and we look forward to our success in 2019 and beyond. Thank you, and now I will turn it over to Jon Zaffino to review our insurance operations.
Jonathan Zaffino: Thanks, John, and good morning. 2018 was a pivotal year in the history of Everest Insurance highlighted by several noteworthy achievements. First and foremost, we're pleased to report a full year of GAAP underwriting profit with a combined ratio of 95.3%. This is the first underwriting profit Everest Insurance has delivered since 2006 and continues our recent trend which has produced an underwriting profit in seven of the last eight quarters. Our $77 million of underwriting income reflects a $146 million swing from the prior year and it's the third-largest underwriting income we have achieved in 20 years. This result speaks to the successful implementation of our strategy, the growing resiliency of our platform and the immense efforts of the talented team we have steadfastly and carefully assembled over the past four years. Highlighting the year. Our gross written premium achieved a record $2.3 billion, reflecting growth of 9% over 2017. Our growth, while more moderate than the prior three years, reflects both the balanced contributions from our many underwriting divisions and targeted product lines and the impact of continued reunderwriting of some legacy portfolios. Over the past several years, largely beginning in 2016, we have written $1.4 billion of new gross written premium in high-value, carefully selected lines of business that simply were not part of the product portfolio prior to this time. Further, over 15% of that three-year premium number or approximately $230 million has originated from outside the U.S. market via our growing international operations and select global product lines. At the same time, we have nonrenewed, divested or reunderwritten portfolios approximating $500 million in gross written premium that simply do not fit with our future strategy. As a result, we conclude 2018 with the following: solid underwriting profit and risk-adjusted returns; record levels of gross written premium despite offsets from nonrenewed business; the deepest roster of actively underwritten specialty products in our history; the broadest geographic reach, 17 offices across the U.S., Canada, London and Europe for us to execute our business from; and the highest number of engaged insurance colleagues across disciplines around the world for making all this happen. We remain encouraged about our progress to date and look forward to enhancing the value of our platform on behalf of all of our constituents into 2019. Before moving on to the financials, I want to briefly comment on the transformation process we have been executing on over the past several years. As we have discussed on past calls, we have been planning, communicating and executing on a multifaceted strategic plan. This has been an extremely ambitious and challenging effort, but thanks to the incredible work and contributions from our colleagues, we're now poised for continued profitable growth in the future. The results I just referenced reflect the remarkable turnaround in a relatively short amount of time. We have grown organically and with discipline, one product at a time, one employee at a time, one office location at a time. And we have grown despite the actions accompanying our significant portfolio repositioning. With each new product, new employee, new capability and new location, we have become stronger and more resilient and I believe better as a specialty diversified insurance company. As a result, Everest Insurance is at an exacting inflection point. With the majority of the transformation work behind us, we recognize there is much more work ahead to achieve our ultimate vision. We are encouraged by the fact that we've built a strong, diversified well-established company within the specialty insurance market. We now have the full arsenal of tools we sought to attain, people, platforms, products and services, and we will continue building on the foundation we have established to further enhance our competitive position, profitability and growth. Turning to the financial results. I'll speak mainly to the full year results. I want to start with a comment on the quarter. The fourth quarter registered an outstanding 87.3% combined ratio despite nearly 4 points of pre-tax cat losses attributable predominantly to Hurricane Michael. We benefited from 12 points of favorable prior year reserve development in the quarter, the second year in a row we have experienced favorable prior year development as a result of our annual reserve review. In summary, it was an excellent quarter. Year-to-date, we achieved $2.3 billion in gross written premium, representing growth of $191 million or 9% over 2017. On a constant dollar basis, this growth improves to 10%, recognizing the growing contribution of our international operations. Normalizing for the impact of lines the business where deliberate underwriting actions were taken, the growth rate for the full year more than doubles to 21%. A solid percentage of this growth is emanating from the new businesses and products accepted over the past four years, inclusive of our increasingly relevant Lloyd's operation which equips $150 million in gross written premium in 2018, a 30% increase over 2017. Each of these products and markets chosen for particular risk return characteristics, is playing an increasingly important role in our diversified portfolio. Our net premiums were $1.7 billion for 2018, an increase of 5% over the prior year period. Net earned premium of $1.6 billion increased by solid $177 million or 12% over 2017. For the full year, the GAAP combined ratio was 95.3%. Excluding the impact of catastrophes, our reported combined ratio improved to 93.3%. The global insurance operations experienced roughly $33 million of net pre-tax cat losses, a significant improvement over the prior year period. Net favorable prior-year development had a beneficial impact of 3.2 points, reflecting the continued strength of our reserve portfolio. Again, this is the first full year GAAP profit in the last 12 years. The year-to-date reported loss ratio was 65%, which is a 10-point improvement to 2017's reported loss ratio of 75%. The majority of this difference is attributable to lower cat losses due to various underwriting actions and effective portfolio hedging. The loss ratio, excluding cats, also slightly improved by 14 basis points to 63% despite 70 basis points less of favorable prior year development. Our combined ratio and underlying results continue to improve as a result of the many underwriting initiatives instituted in recent years, and we expect this trend to continue. The 2018 attritional loss and loss expense ratio also improved by 80 basis points to 66.2% from 67% in 2017. While this is less improvement than we had anticipated, there were several mix changes and prolonged runoff activity that moderated additional improvement. Nonetheless, the trajectory is undeniable and, again, we anticipate continued improvement in 2019. Turning to expenses. For the full year 2018, the expense ratio was 30.3%, essentially in line with the 29.8% for 2017. We have maintained this steady, and I'll add, competitive, expense ratio even as we have continued to invest in people, infrastructure and technology. With the overall Everest operating discipline in mind, I certainly have my eye in the expense ratio and we will continue to balance future investments with our expectations of profitable premium growth. At the same time, we see continued investment in the organization as necessary to maintain an expense advantage and we'll continue to thoughtfully invest in the years ahead. We are particularly excited about several investments we have made in new and emerging technologies that are enhancing underwriting insights, creating meaningful operating efficiencies and improving our speed to market, thus enhancing our client value proposition. Turning to the operating environment. Overall, rate trends over the first three quarters - and these are pure rate, I'm referring to, gained some momentum in the fourth quarter, particularly in the commercial auto, GL and property lines, both in the North America and the London and European markets. Excluding our workers' compensation and accident and health portfolios, overall pure rate change for the North American P&C insurance operations where the majority of our renewable book resides, was plus 4.6% for 2018. This was up 3.6 points over 2017 and continues a two-year trend where we have experienced positive aggregate rate in the non-worker's compensation lines of business. Our workers' compensation portfolio continues to experience high single digit rate pressure yet also continues to deliver solid return. Despite the work comp pricing environment, the improvement in overall price trend is evidence of our growing diversification and resiliency across the portfolio. These outcomes were largely anticipated and factored into our pricing and reserving decisions for the year. To offer some additional color on the overall rate movements across our portfolio, our commercial auto segment continued to receive corrective rate action, a trend that has now persisted for several years. Overall, we achieved positive rate across this book in 2018, delivering low double digit increases. As for the primary general liability markets, we also achieved slightly positive rate in the fourth quarter of plus 1.3%, while excess casualty picked up some momentum with roughly 2.2% increases, reflecting our predominantly excess oriented book of business. Internationally, our rate levels also showed signs of improvement, with our Lloyd's operation delivering a positive 3% change across the portfolio. We expect this to continue and to increase in the months ahead. While financial and professional lines rates appeared to be turning the corner and actually improved in the second half of the year, it was not enough to deliver a full year increase. As for our property book, we achieved healthy and needed rate increases of just over 10%, and we believe this will continue as well. We do anticipate moderately improving operating conditions across our global portfolio throughout 2019, with some pockets lagging this broader trend as they are in need of further corrective rate action. Further, as our retention ratios steadily improve, we anticipate the stronger rate environment to have an increasingly beneficial impact to our results. In conclusion, we are very pleased with our results in 2018. We are gratified by the progress we have made and feel energized by the results of our strategic plan. We are well-positioned with our chosen markets and we are improving our organization each and every day. We expect our relevance among our valued clients to continue to grow as we become an increasingly important trading partner to them. We look forward to updating you on our progress in the future calls. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Andrea for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Kai Pan: First to Dom. You have made a lot of changes over the last five years to make Everest Re a more diversified franchise. I wish you the best on your upcoming retirement. So as the Board is searching for your successor, can you give us updates on what kind of characteristics that you're looking in a candidate and - either internally or externally? At the same time, will the Board consider - also consider strategic alternatives?
Dominic Addesso: Thanks, Kai, for your well wishes. And the Board, as you know, is in the process of looking for a successor in my role. And I think the things that the Board and I will be looking for will be obviously strong leadership characteristics, knowledge of our business. So it's not - can't preclude anything. But it's more than likely it would be somebody that has experience in the space and some tenure in the space. And more than that, I really cannot talk at this time. I think the process as I mentioned is under way, and it would be the classic qualities that you look for in any CEO.
Kai Pan: Will the Board consider - open to strategic alternatives?
Dominic Addesso: We are not - that is not an option that's part of this process. Obviously, that's something that any Board - you have to consider if presented with strategic alternatives. But that is not part of this process.
Kai Pan: And then back to the reinsurance business, the core margin or the attritional combined ratio deteriorated more than 900 basis points year-over-year. I just wonder outside the business mix, any other factor driven that to the 88.7% attritional combined ratio in the fourth quarter? Is it a good run rate going forward? Or we should be looking probably at 84% for the full year?
Dominic Addesso: I will ask Craig to comment on the - on part of this. But let me just begin it by saying that the mix shift is approximately a 2 point impact. And I'll ask Craig to speak to the third point of it.
Craig Howie: Yes. The other point for the year, Kai, is in the fourth quarter we did see about $50 million of reinsurance attritional losses coming through in the fourth quarter. And what that means is what we would call our non-cat cat losses, in other words, weather or events that were less our $10 million catastrophe threshold. So we did see weather losses, we saw shipyard fires, refinery explosions and other fires, and they occurred around the world, so Canada, the U.K., Australia, Latin America and the U.S. So that, in itself, is about 3 points in the quarter - in the fourth quarter and about 1 point for the year.
Dominic Addesso: And these would be besides events because these would - as you - I think you heard from other market participants, that there has been some frequency of severity if you will in some of these large risk losses. So we think this is - this has been an unusual year and we're not anticipating that going forward. Clearly, we do have an attritional pick for these lines of business but 2018 was particularly a heavy year for some risk losses.
Kai Pan: Just follow-up on that. As you grow your like nonproperty business faster than your property business, which carry higher attritional combined ratio, which means that your - into 2019, will that attritional combined ratio continue to drift higher?
Dominic Addesso: No. I think what we're saying is that what you saw in terms of the drift, about 2 points, is kind of where we think it will settle out there. It could drift a little bit from there. But I think the important point is not so much to focus on the combined ratio but focus on the underwriting margin. As John Doucette pointed out, we actually increased our underwriting margin by $50 million from $300 million - just over $300 million to $360 million in this last year and so therefore the combined ratio tick-up is offset by still that underwriting - that margin in the combined ratio applying to a higher premium base. So I think that for us - that's what should be - what you should focus on.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank.
Josh Shanker: You might just read my numbers but I think I'm close. I look at your share of the 4Q '18 events at about 3.7% of the industry's loss. And I look at your experience in 3Q of this year and then the second half of last year at being about 1.5% of the industry's loss. Am I reading that correctly, that your exposure on average was twice what it typically has been? And if there's some difference as you switch to a pro rata book? Or is this an exceptional set of circumstances particularly in 4Q where you had outsized exposure?
Dominic Addesso: All right. Let me, without having done any due diligence on your numbers, let me just give you what our view of market share is. Generally, given our scale in the marketplace, on any one event what we've experienced over the last 10 or 15 years has been - and again, on any one event - somewhere between - and it depends on where - somewhere between 2% and 4% of any particular event. And then generally for a particular year plus a series of events, our market share has been 1.3%, 1.2%, somewhere in that range. And if you look at the results for the '17 events and the '18 events, we are settling in at about 1.3% market share, which is pretty consistent with - if you go a little way back to 2010 and '11 which is - were the two successive years of pretty heavy cat losses, it's very consistent with that. But again, what you're looking at in the fourth quarter I think is in part reflective of where we placed our cat bets. So for example, Hurricane Michael, we generally are, as you know, a larger writer of Florida cat. And in particular, we have made underwriting decisions that we, in particular, like the exposure in the Panhandle as opposed to - contrast it with Miami and Dade County, for example. And so we have long-standing relationships with many clients who themselves have made bigger bets in that region of Florida. So as a consequence where that loss happened to hit tended be an area where we have a little bit more concentration. So I don't know if that - hopefully, that answers your question, but couldn't place what you're asking.
Josh Shanker: I think it does to some extent. So if I take that a little further ,one of your competitors last week said they took a rather large lumpy loss in the wildfires. And they said that if we could do it all over again we would still make the same bet again because we think we got paid adequately to take that loss. If I go back in time a year ago, I think you told me and the investment community that the ROE, all things being equal, in the 2018 book was better than the 2017 book. Do you still feel that way? And do you feel that although it didn't work out in '18 you liked the construction of '18 book? Or are there postmortems that you would do differently?
Dominic Addesso: Well, first of all ,there's always postmortems. There's always things you learn from every cat event, OK? But it still holds up that across the entire portfolio, the returns that we had priced in for '18 relative to '17 and frankly for '19 relative to '18 have improved. Now, I guess the real question is - or maybe underlying your question is, whether or not the way we modeled that exposure, the risk, is that's the way it kind of played out. And I would say, generally for Florida, yes. It just so happened as I mentioned with Hurricane Michael that where that particular storm hit affected us in that way. I do think though that there's probably for the industry things to learn from wildfire exposure. Notwithstanding the fact that back-to-back wildfire events of those magnitudes have essentially never been seen in the marketplace. So it's not as if history was telling us that it could happen. But I do think in reflection, it's probably fair to say that the models have not adequately addressed the wildfire exposure. And so therefore I do think that going forward and certainly we have into our '19 portfolio have addressed that in either pricing or scaling back or terms and conditions to more tightly control the wildfires because I think that's the risk that wasn't quite as well understood as certainly wind. Does that answer your question?
Operator: We will now take our next question from Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs.
Yaron Kinar: First, as we look at the large non-cat losses, does some of that have to do with the business mix shift into more attritional? Or was that really what you would consider one-offs that would not really be expected to recur?
John Doucette: Good morning. It's John. So I don't think it really has to do with shift. It really has in some ways to do with our definition of catastrophes. So a lot of, in places around the globe, we may have a lot of these - a lot of these deals. We may only get through a certain - a few clients or a certain territory. And so a lot of times, as Craig said that $50 million may result in where we have $3 million, $5 million, $8 million of losses tied to these things that the industry would think of as catastrophes. How we classify them? We don't call them catastrophes and that's from kind of a process point of view that we want - in terms of we want to have a materiality threshold for what we track as catastrophe. So I don't think it has to do with the shift in the mix. A lot of the shift in the mix we're talking about is moving to non-property which frankly wouldn't be exposed to these types of losses. And we also saw in addition to what we call the non-cat caps for us below $10 million, there were also some large risk losses in the industry that also people in the industry - other people in the industry may consider them catastrophes. We don't - a single risk loss, we don't consider a catastrophe in how we articulate the cat losses and the attritional losses.
Yaron Kinar: But I thought that the shift to quota share was on just on the casualty side also, on property itself. And if you do shift to pro rata, wouldn't that necessarily mean that you would be exposed to lower layers?
John Doucette: Yes. Absolutely, that should be the case. A lot of the shift that we're talking about is not necessarily taking place in the international space a lot. And one of the things - for the points that you raised, one of the things when we talk about property pro rata premium and increasing that particularly in the U.S. and the places over the last 2017 and '18 where the losses were hit, a lot of our clients - a couple of things. A lot of our clients are looking for capital relief and quota shares, provide them more meaningful capital relief than cap does in terms of de-levering their premium base. And so that's helpful for them. But we also spend a lot of time as we decide we want to deploy capacity as on a cat basis, property catastrophe excess a loss or in a quota share basis, we'll look at the occurrence limits that are within the proportional treaties that we have. And we watch the occurrence limits very, very carefully and really try to support our current property quota share deals that have very tight occurrence limits so that it becomes less of - less exposed to the issue that you're raising.
Yaron Kinar: And then two quick clarifications, if I can. Dom, you said that the business mix shift account for about 2 points of the combined ratio deterioration in '18. Was that for the full year or for the quarter?
Dominic Addesso: It's a full year comment.
Yaron Kinar: Full year? Okay. And the other clarification was on the 7% cat load target for '19. Is that on a net of reinstatement reinsurance basis with pre-tax?
Craig Howie: Yes. That is net and it's pre-tax and that - correct, not net of reinstatement - net of reinsurance.
Yaron Kinar: Net of reinsurance, not of reinstatements, and pre-tax. Okay. Thank you very much.
Dominic Addesso: And less than 7 points.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Amit Kumar from Buckingham Research.
Amit Kumar: Maybe just a quick follow-up to Yaron's question. Going back to the 7 points number, I was looking at the older transcripts and I was trying to recall, what was the cat load you were using for 2018 and 2017?
Craig Howie: So for 2018, that number was just below 9 points. And for 2017, that number would have been about 10 points, Amit.
Amit Kumar: So that was what was built in your expectations, not the actual, correct?
Dominic Addesso: Correct. That's correct.
Amit Kumar: The other question I have is in the opening remarks you talked about the reserve study. And I was looking at, I think it's page -- sorry, Page 6 of the supplement, and under the U.S. Reinsurance, the reserve release number is down materially versus the past. Are there any pluses and minuses in that $1.5 million release number? This is Page 6 of 13 in the supplement.
Dominic Addesso: Amit, there's - and I'll ask Craig to see if he has any additional comments, but...
Amit Kumar: Yes.
Dominic Addesso: As I think probably you realize we've mentioned before, there are some 200 different reserve categories or buckets as we call them and there are ups and downs in reserves all the time. I think no meaningful downs that I can cite, and Craig is hoping to add to that. But I will say that I don't know if we're looking at the quarter or the year-to-date, but keep in mind that we did have some reserve adjustments earlier in the year. So if you look at the complete year, if you look at the positive reserve margins that have come through, and I will also add that there's always going to be variation in the amount of redundancies that perhaps come through - hopefully come through. But I will point out that this would be the seventh year now of positive reserve development across the entire Group. And I think in any one particular year, it could be up, it could be down. But to me what's most relevant and important is that seven years of positive development. I think that's something we're all very mindful of and frankly proud of. So anyway, Craig, is there anything to add to that?
Craig Howie: Well, what I would add is - just to reiterate what Dom said is that we would look at the total year as opposed to just the fourth quarter. And as Dom said, we strive to carry an adequate reserve position in each one of these reserve segments. And the Company does react quickly to adverse development and takes its time to react to that favorable development and we do continue to hold in more recent years in each one of these segments.
Amit Kumar: So net-net, there wasn't any adverse development which offset the reserve releases, the $1.5 million.
Dominic Addesso: Nothing major that - that would make you say that now.
Amit Kumar: Perfect. That's what was I was looking for. The last question and I will requeue is, I wanted to go back to Josh Shanker's question and I think that is a philosophical question a lot of us have been asking based on the last two years. Did I understand it correctly in your response where I think what you were saying is we've had two years of back-to-back materially higher losses and hence it's less of an Everest Re risk selection issue, it's probably more attributable to how the models responded? And now that you're putting corrective actions into place that takes care of it, is that how - is that what the takeaway should be that had the models responded differently, it would have been...
Dominic Addesso: No, I wasn't. If I - if you thought I said that, I apologize. I think what I was saying is let's think about these two separate buckets. Let's think about the windstorm, in particular Michael. The models in that particular case are reasonable and fairly reliable. In our particular case, because of where we've chosen to put our capacity tends to be more in places like the Panhandle as contrasted with higher exposure in Miami and Dade. So I don't necessarily believe that that quote unquote required any corrective action. To the extent that I was thinking or you might have heard me think about corrective action, I think it had more to do with the wildfire exposure and the fact that the models are less reliable as it relates to wildfire notwithstanding the fact that this most recent two years of wildfire losses is something we haven't really experienced ever. But I would still contend that the models aren't as reliable. Therefore, corrective actions that we have taken relative to wildfire is cutting back some rates, terms conditions, sub limit, et cetera. That's the area I thought I was really trying to suggest that quote unquote any corrective actions required.
John Doucette: And, Amit, this is John. I just want to add a little more color to what Dom said. So Dom and I have been here about 10 years. And during that time, we've seen all - different catastrophe losses, and go down the list, the Japanese earthquake, the Thai floods, et cetera, et cetera - Sandy. In every loss, we learn, we evolve, the industry learns, the industry evolves, we make our models better, we make our underwriting better. I think part of what Dom was alluding to is, also when you think about like the wildfires. The wildfires have been kind of a secondary risk characteristic for the industry. And we think given the unprecedented losses that have happened over the last two years, that it's going to move not just in the model but also in the buyers, the rating agencies, the board of directors of the clients. They're going to think about this in a different way. We're already hearing some of our clients are looking to increase their limits that they buy. We think that in the future we may see wildfire exposure split out as a different reinsurance program for some people. But it's all that is how these - or how these evolve in how the industry thinks of the risk. Clearly, there's an elevated view on buyers, sellers, again board of directors, rating agencies, et cetera, about the wildfire risk. And it's not just in California. We also had the Fort McMurray situation in Canada a few years back. And I think all of this is going to help move this to be more like hurricane and earthquake as a primary loss that people have - a primary loss component that has to be factored in more explicitly, and frankly that the industry has to do a better job in terms of how it thinks about it, how it underwrites it, and terms and conditions in the contracts for that. And that's part of the natural evolution and we think that's frankly healthy for everybody.
Dominic Addesso: So let me add to that too since John brought up a 10-year window just by way of example. I think it's worth a reminder that we manage - particularly because part of our portfolio was cat business, subject to volatility, we manage for the long-term which you have to do when you're thinking about cat exposure which can be nil in any one year, and as we've seen in the past two years, it can be record-setting. But if you think about the past 10 years where we have clearly cat as a portion of our portfolio and we think about total value creation over the past 10 years, it's been around 11%. We happened to think that's - and by the way that's before pretty hefty years in terms of cat losses. So you had '10 and '11 and of course the last two which were record-setting. So that 10-year track record I think speaks to how we price our portfolio, how we think about risk, but again managing for the long term. Another little factoid if you will is over the last 10 years, our profits from our cat business on a net basis have been almost $3 billion.
Amit Kumar: That's fascinating. Might I - I know I've exceeded my time. Just only one quick clarification what you just said. What industry loss are you assuming for that 7 points guidance? Thanks.
Dominic Addesso: I'm not sure that you can equate it to an industry loss. I mean, that's an average estimated annual loss.
John Doucette: That's right. So it would be - we don't think of the world like that. We would look at what our gross in that exposures are and look at what we think what the cat loads that are tied to that and then compare it to our overall premium. So it's really a function of, again, what we're trying to get at as the diversification of the book and how we continue and frankly doing a tremendous job on the insurance side of growing and building the franchise and we see a lot of runway there to continue to do that. And all that will help and has helped us move the overall - the cat load as a percentage and bringing it down.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Brian Meredith from UBS.
Brian Meredith: Just a couple of quick ones here. First one, I'm just curious what was the impact of Mt. Logan's minority interest stuff in the quarter just to the other income line?
Craig Howie: Roughly a $5 million loss, Brian.
Brian Meredith: $5 million? Right. And then what does Mt. Logan's capacity look like for this year? Is it down? Up? What's going to happen with Mt. Logan as we look at 2019?
John Doucette: So, as I - this is John, Brian. So I said in my script, it's up - slightly up year-over-year. So we - it's down slightly from Q3, but then some of the - because of losses, but then some existing investors have added capacity and we have some new investors and continue to diversify the investor base. And so we would expect that to continue go up over time. But again, that's something that we look at in terms of as kind of our core strategic securitization vehicle. It's something we look at to make sure how it fits in executing our plan, our overall plan. So we'll factor, do we want to take more money or not. All things being equal, we would expect it's up now slightly compared to a year ago. And we would think that it would continue to go up to potentially increase somewhat but it will be market condition dependent.
Craig Howie: Overall, still assets under management, about $1 billion.
John Doucette: It's about $1 billion - about $1.1 billion.
Operator: We'll now take our next question from Meyer Shields from Keefe Bruyette & Woods.
Meyer Shields: I'm just trying to clarify. So I apologize for the repetition. But the cat load for 2019, the expected cat load is down 2 points. Should we assume that there is on a year-over-year basis still some upward drift in the combined ratio? Or was that all contained in the full year for 2018?
Dominic Addesso: Well, again, relative '19 versus '18?
Meyer Shields: Yes, '19 versus '18. The cat load is down and you've explained why I think very thoroughly. But I'm just trying to figure out how to model sort of core ex-cat ex-reserve development margins on a year-over-year basis.
Dominic Addesso: So I think what we said before was that we were expecting our attritional given the current mix, the attritional - again, it depends in part to how much premium you put into your model. But, given the same mix, then the 2-point shift as we've seen in '18 over '17 is approximately correct.
Meyer Shields: Okay. So...
Dominic Addesso: Is that what you were asking?
Meyer Shields: I meant to ask you whether there should be another 2 points in 2019 on an expected basis?
Dominic Addesso: No. We're not saying that at all.
Meyer Shields: Second question, and maybe a little bit related, but - I'm trying to understand the timing of a de-risk investment portfolio when you're moving to longer tail lines of business that could probably absorb more short-term volatility.
Craig Howie: Meyer, this is Craig. I think what ended up happening too is partially the de-risking of the portfolio was to take some - overall, just to take some of the public equity portfolio down at the end of the year, just taking some of the risk off the table. Some of the alternatives that we did was because we shifted capital around in the organization for where the capital was needed and where we're writing the business, to match those two components, and because of that we had the opportunity to de-risk some of the portfolio. As we go forward, we certainly will determine and look at both the duration and the types of business that we have as far as what our portfolio mix will be going forward.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Elyse Greenspan: I have a few questions. My first question, if we go back to some of your comments on the market, you guys like others seem to be a bit more bullish on the midyear renewals. But I think back, cat rates have really disappointed relative to expectations going back to 2006 really, and you guys already said that Logan is seeing more capital this year than last year. So what gives you confidence that the midyear renewals won't disappoint?
John Doucette: Good morning, Elyse. This is John. So we don't have a crystal ball. All we would say is that when it comes midyear, a lot of midyear is really Florida at June 1, and then different places, U.S., China, Australia, Latin America, at July 1. So a lot of it's going to be loss dependent. A lot of it - I mean, Florida market has seen some pretty active years the last several years and there was a lot of increase in development that the clients, the Florida clients had when it came to particularly Irma. So I think really we don't know what's going to happen, but I do think that what we saw at 01/01 and we just touched on it briefly is a lot of the alternative capital we think took a pause. There's a lot of things going on, a lot of concern about some of the losses. There's also some investor fatigue when it comes to some of the losses that we're hearing about in the alternative capital. We would note that - we would note that - sorry, we would note that Logan has had some of the best returns in the industry. So we think that helps our ability and I think the Logan investors buy into access to the - to Everest's global portfolio and underwriting expertise and that helps. But we also had redemptions in Mt. Logan as well. And we think that overall, there have been redemptions in the alternative capital. So I think a lot of alternative capital has looked and said that they need to understand the risks that they're taking better. And frankly, we're hearing people that are requiring a higher return. That's just healthier. We think that the entire market, the reinsurance, traditional, and alternative market is evolving with some of the hiccups that have happened recently. And we think that just puts the entire market in a better place for getting an appropriate return. What that means and how the rates, we're not sure.
Elyse Greenspan: And then in terms of going back to your cat load of the less than 7 points, is that due to, I guess, lower writing, lower earned premium? I just kind of want to get a sense of if I could look back over the past 10 years, your cat load sits about 12 points. Obviously, that includes some larger loss years, but what's really driving the expected annual loss down in 2019?
Dominic Addesso: The biggest driver of that going down would be our diversification. So growing in the non-cat areas, growing our insurance operation, growing our cash re book, growing our mortgage book, and some slight downward drift in our property exposure. So - but a big piece of that is diversification and we're getting larger. We're getting larger and not increasing cat - in fact, slightly decreasing it. So those two factors together.
Elyse Greenspan: And then your tax rate, you said, I believe, 13%, which seems about higher. I thought in the past we were talking about kind of high single digits if you were in line with your cat load. Is part of that due to a lower level of cat losses expected over this coming year? Or is there something else I'm missing that's driving up your expected tax rate?
Craig Howie: Part of that is lower cats expected, but it's also more capital allocated to the United States and more business expected to be retained in the United States. So you have to apply the higher U.S. tax rate than elsewhere in the world and some of the changes to our internal reinsurance programs as well.
Elyse Greenspan: And then last question. You guys spoke of kind of expanding in the reinsurance side. It seems like property for the most case mixed at 01/01, but it sounds like you guys saw some opportunities to grow within the casualty and non-property related lines. But premiums written basis, what type of growth - I know you pointed to growth in the first quarter. As you think about the book that you put together, what type of premium growth do you envision for 2019?
Dominic Addesso: We're not really giving out any guidance at this time on premium growth.
Elyse Greenspan: Do you - can you ballpark it? Would it be lower than what you saw over the past year or you just don't want to give any kind of magnitude?
Dominic Addesso: Let me say that on the reinsurance side, percentage growth is sometimes a difficult metric to really rely on. So a large quota share for example, like some of the newer transactions we did in 2018, gives a percentage growth that we may or may not be able to apply into the following year. So quota shares are kind of lumpy. More reliably would be - would be the insurance growth and since poor Mr. Zaffino over here, I think he is getting a little bit of a complex not being asked a question, maybe he could at least comment on the insurance side as to its growth prospects.
Jonathan Zaffino: Sure. Thanks, Dom. Yes, Elyse, good morning. The view from our perspective is our growth is probably going to return to sort of a stronger than what you saw in the fourth quarter, probably mid-teens level. And remember, if you look at 2018 full calendar year, property is only roughly across the various underwriting divisions about 15%-ish of our premium writing. So by default, our growth at a mid-teens, high-teens level or the property book that is less than 15% of the total, you'll see even more impact of the diversifying effect Dom is referring to. So we see a lot of opportunities for growth across many different product areas, many different geographies. And as I commented on based on the underlying market conditions, we think it's an opportune time in many areas to pursue that growth.
Dominic Addesso: The only other thing that I could say is that on the reinsurance side, we would anticipate that the growth would be slightly less than what we'd experience in the insurance side, with the caveat that if we come across a large quota share deal and/or if we reduce participation on an existing quota share deal, those numbers could change from that. I hope that's of help, Elyse, but that's the best we can do.
Elyse Greenspan: 50 million of attritional losses, what you define as the non-cat cat losses. That was a Q4 number. Do you have the full year number? Or the other three quarters kind of offset each other?
Dominic Addesso: Could you begin that question again? Because the beginning part of that question cut out on us.
Elyse Greenspan: So you guys - Craig had pointed to I think in response to a question that there was $50 million of non-cat cat losses within the reinsurance segment in the fourth quarter. I was wondering if what the full year number is, like if there were non-cat cat losses for the first three quarters.
Craig Howie: Elyse, this is Craig. You may recall in the first half of the year, so in other words, in the second quarter, we had taken down our accrual for those non-cat losses because we didn't really see anything in the first half of the year that related to our reinsurance book. We didn't touch the insurance book because they are more exposed to some of those smaller events because of the types of business that they write. But for the reinsurance book, we didn't see any of those major events in the first half of the year. Primarily what we saw were - was this activity that came through later in the year and got booked in the fourth quarter.
Operator: We will now take our last question from Mike Zaremski from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: This is Rob, dialing for Mike. Just one question. Our reinsurance market participants have talked about substantial retro insurance pricing increases in 2019. Are you seeing that as well? And if yes, how is that going to impact Everest from a financial standpoint?
John Doucette: This is John. So we did see retro prices at 01/01 increase particularly on loss affected accounts. And how much they increased varied on the client where it's exposed, things like that. To the extent that your question involves our hedging, I'd remind you that we have kind of a multi-product structure duration, tenure in terms of our hedging. Mt. Logan basically stands [indiscernible] pursue with Everest, taking the same rates, terms, condition, pricing that Everest gets but for fees and profit commissions and things like that. So it will move accordingly. And then when it comes to things like our catastrophe bonds that are put in place on a multiyear basis, that rate was predetermined before the losses. A lot of these catastrophe bonds were put in place before 2017 and '18's events and those - basically the cost of that hedging is basically zero year-over-year since it's fixed pricing over a multiyear basis.
Dominic Addesso: Thank you. I guess that finish with the calls. Let me just close out with some thoughts. I want to thank you for your participation. And as you heard this morning, underlying our results are fundamentally some very positive patterns emerging. I don't mean to be dismissive of cat losses and their impact, but as I mentioned before, a longer-term view including record cat events still reveals total value creation over the long term in the top quartile. Furthermore, as we've discussed this morning, our diversification efforts will serve to reduce volatility going forward. Our financial strength and resiliency allows us to respond to market conditions and take advantage of what I think are very - some very unique opportunities in both our reinsurance and insurance platforms. Our success in lines of business away from property cat and our now profitable insurance franchise are just the beginning of what I see as a major transformation endeavor. So thank you again for your participation, and look forward to our conversations over the weeks ahead. Thank you all.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this now concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2018 Q3  (2018-10-30 10:30:00) =====

Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Everest Re Group’s Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Today’s call is being recorded. On the call today are Dom Addesso, the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer; Craig Howie, Chief Financial Officer; John Doucette, President and CEO of Reinsurance Operations; and Jon Zaffino, President and CEO of Insurance Operations. Before we begin, please note, the Company’s SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, statements made during today’s call which are forward-looking in nature, such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations and the like are subject to various risks. Actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations. The SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements. Now, let me turn the call over to Dom Addesso.
Dominic Addesso: Thank you. Good morning. Last night, we released earnings per share of $5.02 for the third quarter. Despite the number of catastrophes for the industry in the quarter, this turned out to be a quarter for us with a solid ROE. This result reflects a strong quarter for investment income, continued strong underwriting income from attritional results and tax benefits achieved from our portfolio of composition. These factors, coupled with a positive equity market resulting in realized gains for the quarter, produced 9.7% annualized net income ROE for the quarter. No doubt that it has been an active last 15 months for cat losses, and of course, one more quarter to go with already some known cats. Well it's been challenging for those individuals and businesses directly impacted by these events. These are challenges to which we have responded well and in fact better than most. Over that time, we continued to produce positive results and we anticipate the same in the fourth quarter. Our portfolio composition is able to absorb volatility and over the longer-term, including these recent years, has produced total shareholder return of over 12%. On an ROE basis, over the last five years, Everest has outperformed by approximately 300 basis points, a top 20 peers listing as compiled by A. M. Best. Nevertheless, we must always look forward. And as all of us recognized, there are significant questions which persist around our industry, most notably, the influx of third-party capital and price adequacy. That is why you may have observed that over time, our net annual expected cat load has drifted down from over 12 combined ratio points to currently less than 9, and will likely drift down into next year. This has been and will continue to be the result of deliberate execution of our strategy, a combination of reducing and diversifying our cat portfolio and diversifying into other segments of the business. You will hear more about this from my colleagues. We continue to believe the future is bright for Everest given the scale we have on the business and our breadth of underwriting and capital management capabilities. And therefore the ability to leverage that into the better opportunities, the market offers and to participate meaningfully in new classes and constructs. We see the recent catastrophe events as being a strong proof point of our value proposition and this along with our clients focus on earnings volatility, has continuing to increase demand for our products and services. Thank you for your participation this morning, and I look forward to our dialogue during the Q&A. I'll now turn it over to Craig for detailed financial results.
Craig Howie: Thank you, Dom, and good morning, everyone. Everest had net income of $206 million for the third quarter of 2018. This compares to a net loss of $639 million for the third quarter last year, a quarter heavily impacted by catastrophe losses. On a year-to-date basis, net income was $486 million compared to a net loss of $102 million for the first nine months of 2017. Net income year-to-date included $35 million of net after tax realized capital gains compared to $79 million of capital gains in the first nine months of 2017. The capital gains were primarily attributable to fair value adjustments on our public equity portfolio. After tax operating income for the third quarter was $167 million compared to a loss of $624 million in 2017. Operating income year-to-date was $428 million compared to a loss of $123 million for the first nine months of 2017. The group recorded a modest underwriting gain of $278,000 for the third quarter essentially a breakeven result with a 100% combined ratio. This compared to an underwriting loss of $1 billion in the third quarter of 2017 with the combined ratio of 164%. The year-to-date underwriting gain for the group was $21 million compared to an underwriting loss $705 million for the same period last year. The year-to-date combined ratio was 99.6% compared to 116.5% reported for the first nine months of 2017 reflecting the higher catastrophe losses in 2017. These results reflect the series of major catastrophe events that are driving both the quarter and the year-to-date figures for both 2017 and 2018. In the third quarter of 2018, the group saw $240 million of net pretax catastrophe losses compared to $1.4 billion in the third quarter of 2017. The breakdown of the pretax loss estimates by event is as follows: Hurricane Florence was $90 million. Typhoon Jebi was $80 million. Typhoon Trami was $25 million. The 2018 California wildfires were $25 million, and the Japan floods were $20 million. On a year-to-date basis, the results reflected net pretax estimated catastrophe losses of $837 million in 2018 compared to $1.4 billion in 2017. Excluding the catastrophe events and favorable prior year development, the underlying book continues to perform well with an overall current year attritional combined ratio of 85.8% through the first nine months compared to 85.6% for the same period in 2017. Our year-to-date group expense ratio remains low at 5.7%, while our commission ratio of 22.1% remains relatively stable. When looking at year-over-year comparisons, it should be noted that the 2017 commission and expense ratios benefited from higher reinstatement premiums arising from the 2017 catastrophe events. For investments, pretax investment income was $161 million for the quarter and $441 million year-to-date on our $18.7 billion investment portfolio. Year-to-date investment income was up $47 million or 12% from one-year ago. This result continues to be driven by the increase in limited partnership income, which was up $29 million from the first nine months of 2017. However, $13 million of the limited partnership income this quarter came from a distribution of one investment and will not reoccur in the future. The pretax yield on the overall portfolio was 3.2% compared to 3.0% one-year ago, as both investment grade and alternative fixed income yields are up year-over-year. The new money rates are now in excess of our total portfolio yield. This will boost future net investment income. On income taxes, the tax benefit we recorded was the result of the amount and geographic region of the losses associated with the catastrophes. The effective tax rate is an annualized calculation that includes planned catastrophe losses for the remainder of the year. We expect to report a tax benefit for the full-year since additional catastrophe losses are anticipated in the fourth quarter. Positive cash flow continues with operating cash flows of $544 million for the first nine months of 2018 compared to $1 billion in 2017. The year-over-year decline reflects a higher level of paid catastrophe losses in 2018 from the 2017 catastrophe events. Shareholders' equity for the Group was $8.3 billion at the end of the third quarter and was essentially flat compared to year-end 2017. The $40 million slight decline in year-to-date shareholder's equity is primarily attributable to the $255 million mark-to market impact on the investment portfolio and capital return for $159 million of dividends paid as well as $75 million of share buybacks offset by $486 million of net income. As a result of the share buybacks and dividends, the Company has returned 48% of net income to shareholders to date in 2018. The Catastrophe losses in 2017 and 2018 have had no impact on our strong capital position. Thank you. And now John Doucette will provide a review of the Reinsurance Operations.
John Doucette: Thank you, Craig. Good morning. Everest Re continues to focus on relevance to our customers, global spread and line of business diversity in our expanding portfolio and proactive and efficient use of our capital. Our strategy is focused on long-term profitable growth, sustainability and responsiveness to our clients and brokers. We are built to withstand the volatility that we manage for our clients, whether that is from increased frequency of property catastrophes, short losses and casualty, and professional liability classes, credit risk, mortgage risk, or any other risks needing mitigation. Although we manage volatile risks, we are disciplined and thoughtful underwriters, expanding our business by offering tailored products and solutions across our global underwriting platform and in all property and casualty lines. In Q3 of 2018, we had $240 million of losses, net of reinsurance from the events in the U.S. and Japan. This continued frequency of catastrophe losses has put upward pressure on rates and as a core reinsurer, we are positioned to capture the benefits of any market uplift. That being said, the cumulative compression of property margins over the last several years has had the corresponding impact of stabilizing the casualty reinsurance market and some other non-property lines of business, which can no longer rely on rate subsidization from the property cat lines of business. Overall, we have correspondingly deployed more capital across many long-tailed and short-tailed line, which exclude cat exposure, highlighted by our underwriting profit from non-cat exposed classes, reaching $190 million through nine months in 2018, up $70 million over the same period last year from similar lines of business. Recognizing this improving market dynamic for non-cat exposed lines, we targeted inbound several large casualty treaties this year at attractive ROEs. And we know that several more new casualty treaties are coming to the market soon, both from large global clients and smaller regional companies, which could continue to improve overall reinsurance terms going forward and expand the opportunity set to profitably deploy capital. Similarly, we are viewed as a premier and disciplined reinsurance partner in the expanding mortgage space as well as in specialty lines and structured reinsurance products and continue to see new opportunities in these lines. As I have said before, this new paradigm of capital restructuring in SureTec and technology innovation, and other disruptive forces impacting our industry. Collectively, we'll continue to test all insurers and reinsurers, and only those such as Everest with our longstanding global franchise, an access to profitable diversified business through an efficient operating platform will continue to thrive in this new world. Now, I will turn to our quarterly and year-to-date results. In Q3 2018, overall the reinsurance division grew gross written premiums year-over-year by 7% to $1.7 billion. When removing effects of foreign exchange and reinstatement premiums last Q3 due to the catastrophes, it is up 18%, primarily due to increases in both property and casualty quota share business. Our overall Q3 combined ratio was 100.1%. This breakeven underwriting result was driven by an elevated cat loss ratio of 17.4%, primarily due to Hurricane Florence, California, Wildfires, Typhoons Jebi and Trami, and the Japanese floods. Year-to-date, our gross written premium were up 20% to $4.5 billion. And the overall combined ratio was 100.1%, which includes all cat losses incurred during the year. As pro rata business has become more attractive due to a combination of better original insurance rates in certain lines and improving ceding commissions and other reinsurance terms. Our business mix includes more pro rata than in prior years. Pro rata typically carries less volatility than excess of loss business, but offset by higher ratios. This is highlighted by our property pro rata premium contributing roughly half of the premium growth this year, but with tightly controlled limits including low occurrence limits as a percentage of premiums. Additionally, casualty quota share and other non-property quota share lines also accounted for roughly half of the premium growth seeing this year. Notably, our attritional loss and combine ratios were only up slightly to 55.1% and 82.3% respectively. We also closed more deals in credit structured reinsurance and the mortgage reinsurance space, allowing profitable capital deployment, facilitating premium growth. And we believe that we have a solid runway in front of us. In these respective areas to continue to grow and profitably diversify our writings in non-cat exposed lines of business over the coming years and therefore we would expect to see continued material growth in the underwriting profit margin contribution over the coming years from non-cat exposed business. As we saw the high double-digit annualized growth in underwriting profit margins so far year-to-date compared to last year in these classes. So while we saw a slight increase in attritional combined ratio percentage. Our notional dollars of underwriting profit from these lines are up and we expect this trend to continue in 2019 and beyond in these non-cat exposed lines of business. Year-to-date, the U.S. reinsurance operations had a 14% increase in gross written premium to $2.2 billion adjusting for reinstatement premiums and foreign exchange, written premium grew by 20%.. The increase in premium was driven by some large casualty quota share treaties, including capital relief deals and mortgage reinsurance writings. In addition, some large global clients purchased additional reinsurance including casualty and property pro rata, after reassessing internal risk targets following the cat events of 2017. These buyers seek reinsurers that can holistically address their reinsurance needs in multiple classes around the world. In Everest with our global footprint, was in a solid position to win attractive business. The U.S. combined ratio was elevated at 107.5% due to catastrophe losses incurred in 2018. While our attritional loss ratio improved slightly to 55%, our attritional combined ratio is up 1.6 points to 81.6% due to higher ceding commissions. But this is an exchange for tight occurrence limits and other risk mitigating features in the treaties. The Bermuda Operations grew 34% to $1.2 of gross written premium year-to-date. Zurich and London were primary contributors to this growth with increased casualty and multi-line sessions from large global clients. Expanded European Casualty and Motor Treaty business and growth and maturation of our political risk, surety, trade credit book. The loss ratio declined 16.7 points to 60.9% due to the lower amount of cat losses year-on-year. The attritional combined ratio decreased by almost one point to 87%. The international reinsurance operations also grew significantly to $1.1 billion. Gross written premium year-to-date increased by 21%. The growth included additional Latin American, Middle Eastern, African and Asian writings, providing Everest with broad-based international diversification. In Latin America and in the Caribbean, post the 2017 cat losses, we saw rate increases and some new additional opportunities both at 1/1/2018, but also throughout 2018 during other renewal dates for loss affected treaties. In Asia, we saw opportunities in crop and facultative business offset by a reduction in Chinese property pro rata business which we non-renewed due to deteriorating margins. The International segments combined ratio dropped to 97.7% from 133.4% in the prior year period. Year-to-date, 2018 has been affected by catastrophe losses from Jebi, Trami and the Japanese floods. However, the attritional combined ratio is essentially flat at 79.2%. Looking forward, it is too soon to tell, how exactly the market will respond to this year's losses, following the record losses of 2017 and active 2018 third quarter and most recently Hurricane Michael. However, with approximately $115 billion and claiming of market losses over the last 18 months. Retraction and dislocation across various lines in Lloyd's and other markets, outsized losses in the energy market, prior year cat development from several reinsurance clients, and shrinking casualty reserve redundancies. It is hard to see how it cannot be some upward pressure on rates heading into this major renewal season. We do not predict rates, but we plan to be able to identify, respond, and successfully execute in a variety of market conditions which may vary by line, by territory, and by product around the world. Thank you, and now I will turn it over to Jon Zaffino to review our insurance operations.
Jonathan Zaffino: Thank you, John and good morning. Everest Insurance has just completed another quarter of continued progress and solid execution. With each passing quarter, we gained traction and see growth across our various portfolios fueled by our deep specialty product set, the continued addition of talented colleagues, strength of relationships, and a strong balance sheet. We are seeing a stable and resilient combined ratio aided by the maturation of the many businesses launched over the course of the past three years. As premiums continue to earn in and as we realized the impact of decisive underwriting actions taken to dampen the impact of more challenging lines of business, the overall business mix changes for the better and we see the benefits in the form of a less volatile combined ratio. Once again, we are emerging from a third quarter marked by significant cat activity, and once again, we can report that the Everest Insurance franchise has proven to be resilient, standing ready to respond to our customers' needs in the face of these natural disasters. Overall, we remain pleased with the continued growth and development of our global insurance platform. As we've shared in the past, our vision to organically build a world-class specialty diversified insurance organization that is relevant within the global specialty P&C industry is being realized. Underwriting profit for both the quarter and year-to-date period, growth and gross written premium, improvement and the attritional loss ratio and continued expense discipline is evidenced that the strategy we have defined is sound and we have the right talent on board to execute on our plan. I'll turn now to the financial highlights in the quarter. Following this, I’ll provide brief comments on the cat activity experience within the insurance operations along with our views of the operating environment forward. For the third quarter of 2018, the global insurance operations produced $517 million in gross written premium, an increase of $37 million or 8% over third quarter 2017. Year-to-date, we achieved $1.7 billion in gross written premium, representing growth of $184 million or 12% over the comparable period in 2017. These strong growth rates have been achieved despite several underwriting actions that have resulted in our controlled exit of various lines of business. As in prior quarters, contributions remain balanced across the diverse group of underwriting operations, particularly the direct broker units within the Everest Insurance global platform. This also represents the 15th consecutive quarter of growth for global insurance. Turning to net premiums, net written premium for the quarter was $385 million, and increase of $15 million or 4%. Year-to-date, net written premium was $1.2 billion, growing by $61 million or 5% over the prior year period. Net earned premium in the quarter was $419 million, an increase of $43 million or 11% and $1.2 billion year-to-date, an increase of $157 million or 15% over the prior year period. Our GAAP combined ratio for the quarter was 99.6%, significantly lower than last year's quarter, which included the historic 2017 cat events. Excluding the current quarters 2.8 point of cat activity, the attritional combined ratio was 96.9%, which compares favorably to the third quarter 2017 attritional of 98% and continues a two year trend of improvement over the third quarter, 2016 attritional of 99.5%. Encouraging – and as anticipated, Everest Insurance has now produced an underwriting profit in six out of the last seven quarters. The underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio for the third quarter of this year was 66.4%, a two point improvement over last year, 68.4% and a 3.4 point improvement over 3Q 2016 of 69.8%. On a year-to-date basis, the GAAP combined ratio was 98.1% inclusive of 1.4 points of net cat loss, both delivering $23 million of underwriting profit, a $171 million improvement year-over-year. Year-to-date attritional combined ratio for the global insurance operations produced a 96.7%, essentially flat over the year-to-date 17 period yet 60 basis points below the 97.1% for the comparable period in 2016. The main variance here is the expense ratio, which came in at 30.5% in both the third quarter and year-to-date periods, which was up 90 basis points and 1% respectively over the same period last year. As we've stated in prior calls, an expense ratio at roughly 30% remains very competitive in a specialty insurance segment and is in line with our plan. Importantly, the underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio showed the 70 basis point improvement year-to-date, coming in at 66.3% versus the prior year period of 67%. The key point year-over-year, we are seeing a downward drift and the attritional loss ratio. This is a result of improved and mix of business, the benefits from our contingent commitment to add profitable lines of business to our portfolio and the strategic underwriting actions of the past three years. Let me offer a brief word on the third quarter cat activity. Despite an active quarter for industry cat losses are 2018 results are favorable as compared against several metrics. Everest Insurance booked at $12 million or 2.8 points net cat losses in the quarter, mainly from the impact of Florence and a smaller amount for California wildfire. The volatility from these events were well managed across our various underwriting operations. Our many underwriting actions and hedging strategies implemented over the past two years have proven effective, similar to any participants within the specialty PNC industry, we are not immune from the impacts of severe weather. However, with the growth and maturation of our platform, our ability to manage the volatility has indeed improved. Turning to the trading environment forward, the condition is exhibited in the prior quarters, remained largely unchanged. Certain lines of business continued to achieve needed positive rate, namely commercial, auto and property, and as respect property that's a common on both the attritional and cat side. Other lines of business are showing signs of improving, namely umbrella and excess. And yet other lines are showing positive rate, but not at the magnitude needed. This includes the general liability markets in many of the professional lines. Workers compensation continues to experience rate reduction as a reflection of the positive underlying fundamentals in the line. Outside of workers compensation, our composite rate increases in the quarter were at positive 4.3%, bringing our year-to-date total to a plus 4.8%. The slight decline in the quarter is as much a function of changing mix of business as it is reflective of a slowdown in rate. So in conclusion, we remain pleased with the continued progress we are making in the establishment of a world-class specialty insurer. The nearly 90,000 submissions we have received year-to-date, speak to our relevance. Further, the underlying performance of our diverse books of business remains encouraging and hence we feel we are well positioned to create value for all of our constituents in the evolving market ahead. We look forward to reporting back to you on our progress next quarter. And I'll turn it back to Craig for Q&A.
Craig Howie: Thanks Jon. Jonathan, we are ready and you can open the line for any questions that we may have.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi, good morning. My first question, you guys have shown pretty strong growth in your Reinsurance business, which continued in the third quarter, about 17% if you back out reinstatements, these statements from both periods. So I guess my question is do you think that this growth can be sustainable? Obviously, just assuming more or less stable kind of January 1, 2019 renewal season, because I guess more of the growth has really come from pro rata business and shifting away from cat into other casualty lines. So can we continue to see high double-digit growth from here?
Dominic Addesso: Certainly into the fourth quarter as that premiums continues to earn in, you'll see those kinds of percentage. But into next year, I certainly wouldn't put that high of a growth rate on our Reinsurance business. But we still think we're entering a part of the cycle where there are opportunities emerging outside of cat. We do see increased demand from global ceding companies, we're seeing increased demand in mortgage space and opportunities there. So there are opportunities, whether or not it would reach double-digit teens into next year, that's hard to predict. But certainly we would expect to continue to see growth opportunities in the marketplace. The secondary question, of course, is whether or not those opportunities will meet our underwriting guidelines in terms of pricing, terms and condition et cetera, so it's still unknown, but perhaps a growth year into next year, but certainly we don't believe at this pace.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. And then in terms of margins, so you guys – the underlying loss ratio deteriorated in the third quarter. You guys kind of made the point it's due to the shifting of the mix to pro rata and casualty business. And that typically does run at higher loss ratios. The second quarter saw a little bit of a different trend, the loss ratio did improve on an underlying basis. So is it the right the way to look at year-to-date? And I guess as the mix – the business continues to earn in, in the fourth quarter into next year, would you expect I guess at year-to-date about a 50 basis points or so deterioration in your underlying commodity ratio?
Dominic Addesso: So first thing is let me comment on the second quarter, just to go backwards and I want to refresh everyone's memory that the second quarter, we had a very low frequency of what we call non-cat cats. So that had a positive impact on the second quarter loss ratio. And we do think that it is more appropriate to look at the combined ratio on a year-to-date basis. And we do think that our combined ratios, frankly, on a year-to-date basis, has not changed all that much. In fact, on an attritional combined ratio, year-to-date September 2008, 85.8%, that compares against the year-to-date a year-ago of 85.6%. So two-tenths of a point movement in that, that's pretty stable, and that's kind of where we would expect it be through time, very stable. John Doucette – and it's worth reemphasizing mentioned in his remarks, the underwriting profit, I think this is why we emphasize it, sometimes can be misleading to just work from a combined ratio metrics, although we use them as well, but of course you have to use them against the right premium base. And I think that's frankly what – were some of the misses have been, there's been using the higher combined ratio, but not applying it to a higher premium base. And that's why, again, it's worth highlighting the actual notional dollars of profit that we've improved year-over-year. So this year we've had $190 million of underwriting profit from our non-cat portfolios on the reinsurance side and insurance, and last year that was $120 million. So an improvement of $70 million and sometimes when you just use the combined ratio statistics that – and you misapply the combined ratio to the wrong premium base, you miss the underwriting profit pickup. So rather a long answer to your question Elyse, but I hope that that addresses your question.
Elyse Greenspan: Yes, that was very helpful. And then just one last question. Particularly for Jebi, can you just let us know what level insured losses you're using? AIR and RMS come out, you've kind of in that $2 billion to $5.5 billion range. And then further, is your exposure there mainly XOL or aggregate or both? And of industry loss estimates rose for that event as we're hearing some chatter in the market, could your net loss that you guys set up this quarter be impacted negatively?
Dominic Addesso: So first our exposure to that loss is predominantly an XOL, it's not solely an XOL event. And in each of the events that Craig highlighted in his remarks, we use either the high end of the estimate, the highest end of the estimate, in some cases above the high end range from the industry estimates. Now clearly, it's still early with many of these events and we're not saying that losses can't change. Of course, they could go in either direction. But we think in the aggregate, we've done a pretty conservative job of reserving these events. There is no read across the last year because it's a much different path pattern. So we're very comfortable with the estimates. But with the absolute caveat that events can change, but even with what you've described depending on the severity of it, you think we've got that covered in large parts.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate the color.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our next question from Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley.
Kai Pan: Thank you and good morning. Just first question follow-up to Elyse question on the attritional combined ratio. You mentioned the decline, mostly because of mix change to pro rata and casualty lines. I just wondered, could you comment on the pricing trends versus loss cost trend, is there any impact from that as well? 
Dominic Addesso: Well, as John Doucette indicated that across many of the lines of business that we entertained, particularly in the casualty space, there has been a primary space. There's been generally rate increase, and of course, Jon Zaffino highlighted that as well, of course absent a worker's comp. And when we look at, I know your comment or question, I think was focused on the reinsurance side, when we underwrite those accounts, we build in our trend. So we do have trend built into our assumptions about where the market is going. And remember that on the pro rata business, the biggest benefit that we've seen or the improvement that we've seen from a reinsurers perspective is on ceding commissions. That's just over the previous five years, ceding commissions were on the rise and it was making that portfolio not suitable to put on the books. And again it's worth reminding everyone that Everest has been – I think terrific at cycle management. We took our – half a dozen years ago, we took our casualty portfolio down to just a few $100 million, I’m taking again on the reinsurance side. And of course now as market conditions have been improving, not only in primary rates, but also on ceding commission terms we've now founded suitable to reenter that space. So again, good underwriting cycle management, these are all things that we adhere to. I don't know if that answered your question.
Kai Pan: That’s very helpful. And could you quantify how much benefits you're getting from the reduced ceding commission?
Dominic Addesso: Not specifically. Again, I'll just come to the underwriting profit numbers that I cited earlier that across all of our portfolios, that underwriting profit increased $70 million to $190 million.
Kai Pan: Okay.
Dominic Addesso: That’s a nine-month comment, but year-to-date number.
Kai Pan: Okay. My second question, on Hurricane Michael, do you have any preliminary estimates by the losses and then you can talk about relative to Florence, and also how do you approach a reserving of that? Do you see the LAE issues or AOB issues continued to be an issue as we seen in Irma?
Dominic Addesso: So answer to the first question is, we don't have a reliable estimate that that we can disclose at this point. It's still early days. At this point, we've only received frankly some level of detail from only one client. Other information that we're seeing is based on model results and the process that we will go through to reserve that event will be using industry estimates, using our models, using underwriter estimates, market share and generally reserving towards the higher end of those picking the highest of those individual aspects. We do believe that from what we're hearing and observing that the event is towards the higher end of the estimates we've seen out in the street, but yet we've not been able to translate that into a loss estimate that we can put forth at this point. As far as the issues that arose in Irma, we do not think that they will be the same. Certainly the AOB threat and the carry on effect of losses will always be there. Of course in this particular case, there are more total losses than what we saw in Irma. So that theoretically should have a less – should be less of an AOB issue. The loss adjustment expense issue will be less of an issue as well, even though we will reserve that at with a market surge – demand surge a factor.
Kai Pan: Okay. That's very helpful. And last one if I may, given the Michael losses and upcoming January renewals, how do you approach the buybacks that towards the year-end?
Dominic Addesso: Again, we don’t really telegraph buybacks. We do think we have excess capital to deploy in that space. If we think the price is appropriate, and certainly at these levels, we think it's a certainly a good value. We are obviously approaching the end of the season. So as you know, in the third quarter, we get even though we did buyback some stock. We do get a little cautious given wind season. That's coming is in our rear view mirror. So that will be potentially an opportunity. We also will look at the opportunity relative to what does occur, 1/1 as again it's been mentioned, we would anticipate that our capital going into next year we'll even be lower again. So that does decrease some of the volatility, perhaps even freeing up more capital in that regard.
Kai Pan: Great. Thank you so much for all the answers.
Dominic Addesso: Thank you, Kai.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Amit Kumar with The Buckingham Research Group.
Amit Kumar: Thank and good morning. Just maybe a few follow-ups. The first question is going back little bit discussion on capital management? Are you sort of blacked out till we have a better sense of the micro loss?
Dominic Addesso: That's entirely possible.
Amit Kumar: Got it. That's helpful. The second question relates going back to the discussion on pricing renewals and expectations going forward. Do you get the sense of that Irma loss development, the material development for the industry? Is playing a role and will pressure pricing upwards materially for 1/1 or am I over thinking that component?
Dominic Addesso: We don't think you're over thinking it. We do think that it will that does create some pressure. We've a commentary about material TBT, but I'll ask John Doucette to maybe comment that as well.
John Doucette: Yes, good morning, Amit. Yes, I mean it's a combination of things of which the development there was seen by many companies for Irma, but not just Irma there was a development for a lot of reinsurance client in Maria, particularly in Puerto Rico. So I mean those are some of the things that happened, but in addition to that, we had 150 billion and growing of losses that happened. And I think that's something that needs to be factored in as well as just the reserve redundancies where do they stand? We've seen a lot of large losses like in the energy market. So there's all those, there clearly seems to be a while there's a lot of capital around there's talks on how much it's going to be stable when it comes to the alternative capital who probably a several of those players probably had two years of not great results. And so the question is not just can and will it reload. It also, I think will also be the question on what the returns and profitability targets that capital requires to come back in. So there is a lot of different things, there's the two major, major profitability reviews that are happening in Lloyd’s that could affect $5 billion of renewal premium, both individual syndicates with non-performance as well as lines of business across the market that aren't performing well. I mean, that all sounds like a different macro forces that will look to potentially increased demand and have an impact on supply. And we also frankly see clients that seem to be tired of volatility. Going back to the earlier question from Elyse, that there are – we are seeing clients coming back into the market they want to a re-insurer and lock and potentially decrease their own volatility, which means there may be whether it's on the casualty or the property or the specialty side that may be an increase in the buys that happened. And that as Dom said, it's tough for us to predict what that will do when it comes to our topline. We do think that will stabilize and potentially improve pricing in certain areas. Certainly pockets that we would expect to see some improvement in pricing.
Amit Kumar: That's helpful. The final question on the net investment income. The LP delta from private equity. Can you just remind us – going back to the K, just remind us, maybe just a bit more color? What exactly are these both investments in? Thanks.
Dominic Addesso: The LP investments that we have are primarily in private equity and or credit. These are investments that we've made over a longer period of time. That have helped us with getting better yield on the overall portfolio. But the amount of investments that we put in place over time has been relatively consistent over the past few years. And what you've seen is, a higher level of returns from these investments over that period of time on that. Again, no major changes in our overall portfolio. Predominantly the portfolio is made up of investment grade fixed income portfolio, but we do have alternative investments not only in the limited partnerships, but also bank loans which are floating rate as well as high yield – some high yield investments as well. Our total private equity is about $1.5 billion out of our – almost $19 billion investment portfolio. So as Craig said, some of that private equity is credit related, mezzanine debt, et cetera.
Amit Kumar: And is there like an additional commitment to LT investments which you have to make or is the steady state from here onwards?
Dominic Addesso: We have committed funds to the private equity space that would carry out into the succeeding years, but that would not be an outsized percentage relative to how we anticipate the total investment portfolio to grow.
Amit Kumar: Got it. Thank you.
Dominic Addesso: So $1.5 billion would probably likely go up, but not at a disproportionate percentage to the portfolio. Right now the private equity portfolio stands at about 8%. I don't expect that to change remarkably.
Amit Kumar: Got it. Thanks for the answers and good luck for the future.
Dominic Addesso: Thank you, Amit.
Craig Howie: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse.
Michael Zaremski: Hey, thanks. Follow-up to Amit’s question. First, the investment expenses are running $8 million or so higher year-to-date. Is that correlated with the higher alternative investment income or is that a run rate we should be thinking about?
Craig Howie: Mike, this is Craig. It is in line with the investment managers that we use for some of these types of investments. And you could expect that to be at a normal run rate.
Michael Zaremski: Okay, great. In the prepared remarks about U.S. reinsurance and I might be getting this little wrong. You talked about tighter limits and I know you mentioned, Dom, risk mitigation features. I think that was you Dom in a treaty. I was just curious, are you referring to a deal that the media reported earlier this fall, and maybe you can also explain what a – at a high level, what risk mitigation features means? 
Dominic Addesso: That was not me. That was John Doucette, and therefore I’ll ask him to respond.
Michael Zaremski: Sorry about that. Thanks.
Dominic Addesso: Although, keep in mind that we’re particularly sensitive to talking about individual clients. So with that, I'll ask John to dance through that.
John Doucette: Good morning, Mike. The comment was more, I think a broader comment. It wasn't deal specific. It was really talking about on proportional business, particularly in the property space. I think that we wanted to highlight that we have – there's a lot of property quota shares that are out there and we write a few of them, we write them with clients we know and like and respect. But we also – a lot of the time, those have very tight occurrence limits, cat occurrence limits as a function of the overall premium. So while the premium growth in property went up, it doesn't correspondingly mean that there is a meaningful change in the P&L for that. That was the main point that we’re trying to get to. And then beyond that, whether it's by line of business, and certainly in some of the structured areas, there will be different contract specific features, and there'll be gives and takes and different parts. And whether that's what the contract says, some swing rating, different supplements, things like that. That could happen. And that could be across basically any classes of business that we see. Back to what Dominic said at the beginning, we were more bearish than a lot of our competitors for a long time in the casualty space. And we think our view of the world for out as we cut our book tremendously. And we are seeing opportunities that we hadn't seen in awhile in the casualty space in general. Also the global clients are coming back in and they can – and that's lumpy, but they are looking for people that can trade with them in multiple classes all around the world. And we have the ability and expertise to deploy underwriting capacity in all property and casualty lines all over the world, and so we are seeing continued to see traction with the global. And again, what the contract features are will vary tremendously contract-by-contract.
Dominic Addesso: By the way, and that's answer. The one other narrowing of risk mitigate features could be narrowing reinsurance, which is another thing that this is booked as an underwriting feature of many of these accounts that we put on the books.
John Doucette: Meaning ensuring the insurance that our clients buy.
Dominic Addesso: And we stand with them, with the protections that they get either built in actually into the contract or deemed into the contract that we will have our recovery rate that matches the – that will match the terms attachment point limit of the coverage that they buy. And we factored that into our risk assessment as we try to decide if it's an attractive deal on a risk-adjusted basis to deploy capital in that.
Michael Zaremski: Okay, that's helpful. And just have follow-up on that, in terms of being less bearish on casualty – is that partly due to the new money rates being higher than the portfolio yield or is this simply due to just the non-investment income opportunities you guys are seeing?
Dominic Addesso: Underwriting first, yourselves as an underwriting shop and that's the number one priority.
Michael Zaremski: Okay, great. 
Dominic Addesso: Underwriting margin.
Michael Zaremski: Okay. And lastly, I'm just curious there's been a – I'm not an expert on the mortgage insurance space, but there's been a flurry of kind of a reinsurance capital market, bonds and deals announced in recent months, or just curious, does that compete with the traditional mortgage reinsurance that you guys have been a leader in?
Dominic Addesso: I'll take that one. So we write mortgage reinsurance related to the GSEs, write for the MI and we also write a little bit of mortgage reinsurance outside of North America in a couple countries that have high capital loadings such as Australia, France, potentially Germany et cetera. They were looking at that. But the predominant – our predominant mortgage book is with the GSEs and then also the MIs. So a lot of them are deploying capa – risk, are using hedging and risk mitigation strategies in at least two different capacities through traditional reinsurance, as well as through the capital market. And the GSEs in particular, have a dual mandate to use both the channels and they have a mandate to try to develop the hedging markets whether it's on the capital markets side or traditional reinsurers. And they continue to do that. So I would say net-net, it's a positive, because while they are different products, they are looking to build this out into a more sustainable class of business that. And we think the combination will do that.
Michael Zaremski: Thank you for the color.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs.
Yaron Kinar: Hi, good morning, everybody. I guess my first question is just thinking about cat loads. If we look at 2017s events and look at the shift in your business mix since then more into prorate, more into casualty. Do you have a sense of what the loss ratio or book value impact would have been from 2017 events? Have they occurred today?
Dominic Addesso: As the 2017 events occurred today?
Yaron Kinar: Yes.
Dominic Addesso: Not sure I understand that meaning. Meaning, the re-underwriting of the portfolio would be impacting less. So let me answer with this way because I don't know that I have that precise answer. Our cat load not only in combined ratio points, but also in nominal dollars has been coming down over the last couple of years. Reminder that a few years ago, it was up to 12 points, now it's less than eight or less than nine, likely to be less than eight going into next year. But even in absolute – and that's partly a result of diversification of our book of business across other lines of business, but growth of the insurance, many growth of the – the different classes that John Doucette emphasize. So the diversification certainly helps that. But even in notional dollars, the number has come down. It was approaching $600 million last year. It's in the mid $500 million into this year and it will be lower than that into next year in absolute dollars. In addition, our 100 PML in all of our peaks zones is down year-over-year modestly. But that's the best I can do in terms of answering that question. I don't have a pro forma in terms of overlaying last year's events into this year's portfolio.
Yaron Kinar: Okay. And then you had mentioned some adverse industry development for Irma and Maria that's still ongoing. Do you – if this continues do you think there’s still a risk that your loss ratios are loss picks for those events could further deteriorate? Or you now at a point that even if there is further industry deterioration, you’ve kind of – you’re comfortable with these reserves.
John Doucette: We think that our reserve position, can withstand further industry loss deterioration. But as you say on all of these events, you never know. But we think that the way it's a reserved currently we're talking about last year's events now and even this year's events. We think that it can withstand further into “industry deterioration”.
Yaron Kinar: Got it.
John Doucette: Okay. We heard from some clients and then we factor that into our loss fixed. So the fact that some emergency has happened more recently, that doesn't change her view per se right now.
Yaron Kinar: Great. Okay. So that was already factored in the last quarter update?
John Doucette: Yes.
Yaron Kinar: Okay. And last question just on the casualty market and reinsurance, so if I understood your comments correctly you are a little more constructive on opportunities there today than you had been in the past? Is that more from a pricing perspective? Or is it loss cost? I guess I was just a little surprised to hear more constructive commentary there given that it seems like loss cost trends are deteriorating at least on the underlying side?
John Doucette: Yes. So I mean – and there's the two worlds, the insurance world that Jon talked about and that it will vary if you want color you get on the primary side. But on the reinsurance side, there's a lot of additional moving parts right. There's the reinsurance terms conditions, what's the ceding commission, a lot of the book that we write out of the – London and Zurich is done on an excess of loss basis. So it's a little bit bifurcated from what the original rates are. So then is a rate on exposure of what we are getting and we're seeing improving opportunities on our ability to execute that. But I think in general, it's also just more a supply and demand that we see the large global clients want to do more with a company like Everest. They maybe full on some of the European reinsurers, they may – a lot of clients are tightening up their credit, their reinsurance security panel. So they are tightening the credit. So that means there's less supply for some of the long tail lines of business, the reinsurance that they want to buy. And we think that is a positive that happens. We also – one of the things that we're seeing is again, I think some of the clients who had centralized a lot of their buying, I think they are saying well, there was actually in the older – we want to take five or six, seven years and before that where there was more engagement between the reinsurance underwriters and the insurance underwriters, not just the ceded redesk of reinsurance buyers, and I think there's more feedback loop. And I think some of these insurance companies are realizing that there's real value that experienced reinsurance underwriters can add by providing insight because we see across the whole market, we see what lines of business or sub-classes are making money, are losing money, what products are making money or losing money, and it allows us to give that insight when we do underwriting audits which we do a lot of them. We underwrite our clients a lot. And I think that we are seeing the value of that as a lot of our clients are focused on their volatility, how do they improve their results. And they are looking to use reinsurance as a value proposition, not just get the lower ceding commission, but use it truer to get the better gross underwriting results
Dominic Addesso: And keep one thing in mind and I recognized where your question comes from, which is really more of a beta play. Make no mistake. This is not a beta play on the market. We underwrite each individual account and client and therefore they are likely making improvements in their portfolio that could be different than what you're describing as the overall market.
Yaron Kinar: Got it. That's very helpful. I appreciate the color.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will be taking our last question from Joshua Shanker with Deutsche Bank.
Joshua Shanker: Thank you very much. So I've talked to Jon Zaffino in the past and you Dom about the insurance improvement situation. I think a year ago when you're talking about material improvement in the combined ratio for that business, and look, I mean being in the mid-90s, there's nothing wrong with that. But I don't know over the past nine months, have the margins – underlying margin of that business improved? I can't tell that from the numbers. And is that what your expectations were a year ago or is the turnaround slower than you thought?
Dominic Addesso: I think it's just through the nine months. It’s probably where I would have anticipated it to be. Remember, we've got one more quarter to go here. You've got year-end reserve that used to evaluate. In the main, it is trending and it’s on the trajectory that – on a trajectory that I'm very pleased with. As you say something in the mid-90s is quite attractive. And I also know that what our loss reserve posture has been in terms of how we go about picking loss ratio. So we think it's conservative. So as we look forward, we're quite enthused about where this portfolio is trending.
Craig Howie: I would just add to that, Josh. I think we’re very encouraged by the growth and the many new initiatives that we've launched over the last several years, which, if you recall, those were carefully chosen selected lines of business. As those continued to make up a larger and larger part of our portfolio as we continue to wind down, as I think I mentioned in my remarks, certain portfolios that we are exiting in a controlled way, which they're still obviously an earned premium lag in the P&L. As you see that transition continue to happen and gain momentum, in addition to what Don mentioned, taking a prudently cautious view of current accident years, we're pretty encouraged by where we are.
Joshua Shanker: And you mentioned, Dom that you still have year-end reserve reviews to go. In the past couple of years the fourth quarter prior year reserve releases have been quite significant. At that time, have you also been rebasing the current accident year ever been in the past, 4Qs material changes to your in-year accident pick in that fourth quarter?
Dominic Addesso: No, generally not. The only thing we look at that has to do with current year accident fix would be on the property side to the extent that we've had. We've either had, will be called non-cat cats. And if we've had some then we keep those reserves there in place. If we haven't had any non-cat cats like we did in the second quarter, and then we would adjust that current accident year for the very, very short tail lines for the non-cat cat piece. Is that what your – it’s your question?
Joshua Shanker: Yes, I think so. So well I guess just coming back to the first question, and coming into the fourth quarter, you still have year-end reserve reviews. But we shouldn't expect that's going to significantly impact your combined ratio in the insurance business through nine months or maybe a – maybe I m missing something there?
Dominic Addesso: Well, any reserve redundancies or additions, obviously are going to affect the combined ratio on a year-to-date basis for the 12 months here. Craig, I think maybe understand…
Craig Howie: Yes, I think I understand what you're asking. But prior year reserves reviews that would be completed would show up on the prior year line and would not be included in the attritional line for the year.
Dominic Addesso: Okay, I’m sorry.
Joshua Shanker: Yes, so I guess the one thing in my view, I was expecting despite good results in insurance. I was expecting 2018 to be better than 2017. So far it's been, equivalent, which is fine. But I'm just trying to understand like maybe the fourth quarter might change that. I'm just trying to understand how the fourth quarter might, anything could change of course, but is there something that I'm not understanding about the fourth quarter, I guess?
Dominic Addesso: And I think the way we're answering your question is more about how we're viewing the profitability of the book and of course we don't – as we've outlined in the past, we hold reserves for periods of years as it relates to the current accident year. So you don't see those improvements coming through that we believe are there. They take a couple years go merge.
Joshua Shanker: Okay, the ultimate might be lower than the current pick.
Dominic Addesso: You got it.
Joshua Shanker: Yes. Okay, thank you.
Dominic Addesso: Thanks, Josh. End of Q&A
Dominic Addesso: Okay, sorry for going over. But we're glad to do it. Thanks again for your interest and your questions. We spoke this morning about the lots of things. I believe it's worth emphasizing that Everest is a franchise is not only as thrive over the Michael's – over the market cycle with above average total shareholder returns. But it's one, it's a franchise which is evolving and diversifying, based on where the future market opportunities are. And we've talked a lot about that this morning. Our goal remains the same, deliver above average returns on capital as we have done through time. Again, thank you for your interest this morning. I look forward to speaking with many of you over the weeks ahead.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning and welcome to Everest Re Group Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. On the call today are Dom Addesso, the company’s President and Chief Executive Officer; Craig Howie, Chief Financial Officer; John Doucette, President and CEO of Reinsurance Operations; and Jon Zaffino, President and CEO of Insurance Operations. Before we begin, please note that the company’s SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, statements made during today’s call which are forward-looking in nature, such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations and the like are subject to various risks. Actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations. The SEC filings have full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements. Now, let me turn the call over to Dom Addesso.
Dom Addesso: Thank you. Good morning and thanks for joining our call this morning. The second quarter of 2018 was a decidedly mixed quarter for Everest. Surely, the bottom line results were not where we wanted them to be driven by the reserve charge we pre-announced. Nonetheless, it was another quarter of the successful execution of our strategy. We had a lot of success executing on the opportunities that have been presented to us in the market. We have seen strong premium growth both in our insurance and reinsurance business. Plus in both segments, our underwriting and re-underwriting actions have driven improvements in the attritional loss ratio and the profit margin embedded in our portfolio. Of course, the progress towards our strategic objectives is masked by the reserve charge. No doubt, this adjustment was disappointing. And while it reflects some broader underlying trends going on in the market, in reality we know it will require us to improve and make changes to recognize these trends. The underlying cause of the reserve shortfall can be attributed to two factors, which were not apparent to us at year end. First, our clients are seeing a large number of reopened claims largely stemming from the AOB threat in Florida. Ceding companies were trying to settle claims quickly conceivably to mitigate the AOB issue. The loss reports we received from clients showed a high percentage of closed claims very clearly and we were encouraged by these reports. Settling claims quickly was initially a sound strategy, but what we now know is that this approach left our clients vulnerable when the actual repair bills came in higher than what they originally closed their claim. To a lesser extent, but for the same reasons, the claims reopening, has impacted Puerto Rico after Maria as well driving up losses, which crystallized in the second quarter. The reality was that these closed claim statistics we were seeing were a false positive. The second factor was the extraordinary rise relative to past events in loss adjustment expenses. The expense numbers we are seeing are significantly above our historical data. In fact we saw some treaties experience high 30s and even 40% expense loads. Again, these numbers only began to emerge in the second quarter claim reports. Both of these factors reopened claims and a much higher than expected LAE were the overwhelming reasons for the increases we saw. Our reserves at year end for our core reinsurance cat portfolio contemplated demand surge, but these developments were beyond anything seen before. In addition, when coupled with the California wildfires, it had a leveraged impact on our aggregate retro book. I would refer to this as the cliff factor. In other words, our previous analysis had many of our clients’ retro accounts not attaching, now some are very much in the money. So while these are the observations, it demands that we respond to what maybe the new normal. Going forward, cat pricing will need to reflect a higher level of loss adjustment expenses, particularly for those accounts that rely heavily on third-party adjustment services. While some of the LAE level was driven by scarcity of resources due to multiple, almost simultaneous events, for example, citizens doubled their standard adjusted fees due to the shortage created by Hurricane Harvey. Our pricing needs to better consider this new reality, plus our reserving process going forward needs to be refined to consider these factors when there are multiple events as seen in 2017. This commentary I have just gone through hopefully clarifies the circumstances and our recognition that we need to respond appropriately to changing market conditions. However, while we did temporarily get the scorekeeping wrong make no mistake that we are playing the game at a high level and we will continue to do so. Our profits from our cat portfolio were $3.5 billion over the last 5 years. This business comes with volatility, but the appropriate reward for the risk is evident. Finally, given the extraordinary circumstances of the 2017 cats and the separate process we use in setting cat reserves versus non-cat reserves, our review of our current reserves finds no read across on the adequacy of our non-cat reserves. We are very comfortable that our track record of conservatively setting our non-cat reserves continues. While these catastrophes obviously dominate the conversation, I would reiterate that other key parts of the organization are doing excellent and the attritional results are reflective of that. It is critical. The continued improvement is adding profitable diversification to our portfolio. The reinsurance portfolio has seen continued growth in mortgage and other credit related business as well as a revival of our casualty book, where pricing has improved considerably allowing us to entertain more deals. Overall, reinsurance premiums earned have risen almost 30% in the first half of the year to $2.5 billion, with an attritional combined ratio of 81.7%. This is an encouraging result as we move into the second half. The improvements in the attritional results reflect the trend we noted in the first quarter. The insurance business continues its growth trajectory, where premiums earned in the first half have increased by 17%. This growth number is understated due to the cancellation and re-underwriting of certain legacy parts of that portfolio. In fact, the new business initiatives, along with the existing go-forward portfolios, have grown almost 30% or $300 million. As a result of re-underwriting and new growth areas, the book is now demonstrating more consistent profitability. The improving trend in the attritional is illustrated in the investor deck. Our new products are now earning in as you will note by comparing earned premium to written, which should continue to improve our margins. We are well-positioned to produce a good second half. Thank you. And my colleagues will elaborate further and they of course welcome your questions at the end. Craig?
Craig Howie: Thank you, Dom and good morning everyone. Everest had net income of $70 million in the second quarter of 2018. This compares to net income of $246 million for the second quarter of 2017. On a year-to-date basis, net income was $280 million compared to $537 million for the first half of 2017. The quarter and year-to-date results were impacted by current and prior year catastrophe losses. Net income included $9 million of net after-tax realized capital losses compared to $50 million of capital gains in the first half of 2017. The 2018 capital losses were primarily attributable to fair value adjustments on the public equity portfolio. After-tax operating income for the second quarter was $40 million compared to $234 million in 2017. Operating income year-to-date was $260 million compared to $501 million for the first 6 months of 2017. The overall underwriting gain for the group was $20 million for the first half compared to an underwriting gain of $313 million in the same period last year. The year-to-date combined ratio for the group was 99.4% compared to 88.3% reported in the first half of 2017 impacted by the higher catastrophe losses in 2018. In the second quarter of 2018, the company reported a $400 million pre-tax increase in its estimates for prior year catastrophe events, net of reinsurance and reinstatement premium. The increase was primarily related to the 2017 storm events, was about one-third of the change related to reopened claims reported in the second quarter, about one-third coming from higher loss adjustment expenses and the other third coming from the impact on retro aggregate covers. The group also saw $65 million of current year catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance. Of the total, $50 million related to Cyclone Mekunu in Oman and Yemen and $15 million related to the late winter storms in the United States. This compares to $54 million of catastrophes during the second quarter of 2017. On a year-to-date basis, the results reflected catastrophe losses of $565 million compared to $74 million during the first half of 2017. Partially offsetting the catastrophe development was $97 million of favorable prior year reserve development related to non-catastrophe reserves. The prior year favorable development was primarily identified for reserve studies completed in the second quarter of 2018. These reserves related to casualty and property reinsurance business both from the United States and internationally. The redundancy determined from the reserve studies was recognized in the second quarter given the magnitude of the overall indications. These redundancies have developed over time, but we don’t react until the position becomes more mature. We continue to maintain our loss reserve estimates for the more recent years unchanged. Excluding the catastrophe losses and favorable prior year reserve development, the underlying book continues to perform well. The overall attritional combined ratio for the first 6 months was 85.3% compared to 85.6% in the first half of 2017. With the improvement in the attritional combined ratio and the 25% growth in earned premium, the underwriting profit has improved by more than $100 million on an attritional basis for the first 6 months of 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. Our expense ratio remains low at 5.7% for the first two quarters of 2018 down slightly from 5.8% for the same period last year. For investments, pre-tax investment income was $141 million for the quarter and $280 million year-to-date on our $18 billion investment portfolio. Investment income was up $23 million or 9% from 1 year ago. This result continues to be driven by the increase in limited partnership income, which was up $14 million from the first half of 2017 and the fixed income portfolio. The pre-tax yield on the overall portfolio was 3.1% compared to 2.9% 1 year ago as both the investment grade and alternative fixed income portfolios are up year-over-year. The duration of the portfolio remains at just over 3 years. On income taxes, the tax benefit was the result of the amount and geographic region of the losses associated with the catastrophes and the income associated with the loss reserve releases in the quarter. The effective tax rate is an annualized calculation that includes planned catastrophe losses for the remainder of the year. The expected range for the full year is now 0% to 6%. Lower than expected catastrophe losses would cause the tax rate to trend toward the higher end of this range. Positive cash flow continues with operating cash flows of $133 million for the first half of 2018 compared to $634 million in 2017. The decline reflects a higher level of paid catastrophe losses in 2018 compared to 2017. Shareholders’ equity for the group was $8.2 billion at the end of the second quarter compared to $8.4 billion at year end 2017. The decline in shareholders’ equity in the first half of 2018 is primarily attributable to the $232 million mark-to-market impact on the investment portfolio and capital returned through $106 million of dividends paid as well as $25 million of share buybacks offset by $280 million of net income. The company returned 47% of net income to shareholders. Our capital position remains very strong. Thank you. And now, John Doucette will provide a review of the reinsurance operations.
John Doucette: Thank you, Craig. Good morning. Q2 was the first renewal season following the catastrophes in 2017 for some loss affected areas, notably Puerto Rico and some of the Caribbean at April 1 as well as Florida at June 1. Overall, the markets were mixed. And from a rate perspective, they varied based on loss activity as well as macro and local supply demand factors. However, these and other renewals in Q2 provided our underwriters with an opportunity to reshape our portfolio by capturing higher risk adjusted rewards. We improved our portfolio by achieving rate increases, particularly on loss affected Puerto Rican and Caribbean accounts, growing share with some key Florida clients, reallocating capacity to different attachment points and better priced layers. We also saw more turnover in the book as we decreased shares or declined poorly priced deals and scaled up capacity on more attractively priced opportunities. Shifting capacity from excess of loss layers and proportional treaties on programs to where we are paid the best risk-adjusted price using our leading re-insurer position in the market to get preferred signings and utilizing both alternative capital and our equity capital to most efficiently match risk to capital all position us for better than market results. These advantages benefit us even for flat renewals and help drive some of this year’s premium growth. Our reinsurance gross written premium for Q2 was $1.4 billion and $2.8 billion year-to-date, which is a 29% growth in premium over year-to-date 2017 driven by growth in all of our reinsurance segments. Some of our growth in reinsurance was due to increased excess of loss and quota share participation on existing treaties and also new quota share treaties with improved profitability following the 2017 cat losses. In addition, we achieved some impactful reinsurance successes with several key global clients who want to trade more broadly with leading global re-insurers such as Everest Re across multiple lines of business around the world. Over the last several years, we have deployed significant resources to understand and be responsive to the risk transfer and risk financing needs of our global clients. Consequently, we continually expand our strategic relationships with several of these global clients and thus meaningfully have increased our in-force profitability and future opportunities with them. We also benefited from rate improvement in certain lines, especially loss affected property lines and select casualty and professional lines. We believe our current portfolio overall is stronger and more resilient than it has been for a long time. As Dom stated, our results did suffer from development on the 2017 events predominantly from Irma and Maria. The confluence of three significant catastrophe losses within 5 weeks caused a surge in demand for loss adjusters, inflating loss adjustment expenses to exceptional level. In addition, claim reopening frequency in both Florida and Puerto Rico were higher than expected. As noted earlier, the combination of increasing loss estimates due to reopen and loss adjustment expenses, coupled with the losses on the California wildfires, had a more severe impact to aggregate covers which we wrote. Including the 2017 loss emergence, reinsurance produced 107% combined ratio for the quarter. However, our attritional combined ratio was 79.8% for the quarter and 81.7% year-to-date compared to 84.2% and 82.1% respectively in the prior year periods. This quarter’s loss ratio benefited almost 2 points from lower non-cat weather losses and a better expected loss ratio. The improved attritional combined ratios are noteworthy given the increased share of proportional business and additional casualty writings, which both typically run to a higher attritional combined ratio than a more property dominated excess of loss portfolio. In our U.S. reinsurance segment, gross written premium of $1.3 billion year-to-date grew 23% versus the same period last year. Growth was broad-based across property and casualty lines. We saw new opportunities for excess of loss and pro rata deals, which included some new commercial and personal pro rata business, additional mortgage writings, reinstatement premiums and increased facultative writings. The Q2 year-to-date combined ratio was 116.8%. The corresponding loss ratio was elevated by 43 points of cat losses, mainly from the development on hurricanes Irma and Maria and the combined impact that these losses had with other 2017 events on aggregate covers. However, the year-to-date attritional loss ratio decreased 2 points to 54%. The international segment, with gross written premium of $766 million, grew by 31% in this year-to-date period. This included growth in Latin America on new opportunities and larger post-loss treaty participations, increased pro rata writings and additional capacity deployed on international fac deals in an improved post loss rate environment as well as growth in new lines of business around the world such as Indian crop reinsurance out of our Singapore office and new products out of our Canadian operations. The combined ratio for the first 6 months was 88.2%. The 6 month loss ratio was impacted by 14 points of catastrophe losses, which included about $50 million from Cyclone Mekunu in Oman, with the rest predominantly from Hurricane Maria. The attritional loss ratio is running about flat year-to-date at 51%. The Bermuda segment had gross written premium of $785 million or 41% growth during the first half, with contributions from writings covering various territories and lines of business. This included growth in London, Zurich and Bermuda operations in various lines in both excess and pro rata business and included some large opportunities with multinational insurers and continued expansion of our trade credit, surety and political risk capabilities and writings. The segment achieved an 83.6% combined ratio in the first half with the attritional loss ratio up less than 1 point to 58.6%. The loss ratio was affected by business mix, including additional premium. Now, turning to the 6/1 and 7/1 renewal. Overall, the market offered modest rate increases for both property and casualty. Accordingly, we did not just follow the market, but proactively structured our global property portfolio in a competitive post-loss rate environment to maximize our returns by allocating larger lines on more attractive deals and reducing or declining under-priced deals. Through this process, we improved our portfolio for this renewal season, representing a better risk adjusted return as we head into this wind season with less exposed limit, less PML, more premium and more expected profit than last year. While some competition on the property side sought to increase market share, we stock with accretive deals from our core clients that recognize the Everest long-term value proposition. In the end, particularly with the increased deployment of capacity to capped pro rata treaties, we materially increased our premium while our cat exposure is flat or down depending on the territory and return period. With respect to our casualty portfolio, we achieved some rate increases and lower ceding commissions. Modest improvement in reinsurance terms continued as the casualty reinsurance market has stabilized considerably from recent years. In addition, we added new profitable casualty business, which was not offered to much of the reinsurance market. Whether due to our long-term client and broker relationships, superior ratings, balance sheet strength or the ability to lead reinsurance programs for clients in all P&C lines around the world, we are often included in a select group of re-insurers invited to play on unique market opportunities. In the mortgage reinsurance markets, we remain a leader with a robust in-force mortgage book and significant future opportunities. With improved loan underwriting practices by lenders since the financial crisis, loss expectations remain muted in the near-term. However, we remained watchful of potentially destabilizing macroeconomic forces and/or heightened competition and will manage our portfolio accordingly. We are pleased with our progress at building a better positioned, meaningfully larger and more diversified global reinsurance portfolio. We remain confident that we can execute in a market that is transforming at an accelerated rate, whether it be from third-party capital, M&A consolidation, evolving distribution channels or rapid technology change and disruption. With that backdrop of fast-paced change, Everest Re will continue to differentiate itself with global breadth of capabilities across all P&C lines, meaningful and relevant capacity supported by alternative capital through Mt. Logan, cat bonds, traditional and non-traditional hedges, evolving and innovative capital structures, all allowing us to maximize the value proposition to our customers while enhancing returns to Everest shareholders, creative product structuring to deliver customized risk transfer and risk financing solutions for our clients, and expense efficiency and nimble execution via our flat and lean organization, allowing us to capture more dollars of margin for each dollar of premium than most of our competitors. Thank you. And now I will turn it over to Jon Zaffino to review our insurance operations.
Jon Zaffino: Thanks, John and good morning. Our global specialty insurance operations delivered a solid quarter of performance. We are encouraged by our steady improvement and the progress we are making toward our key goals. Prominent among these goals are diversified and profitable growth and increased resilience across our in-force portfolios and operating platforms. Our team has done an outstanding job executing on the plan and building upon the many foundational pieces we have put in place over the past 3 years. The second quarter brought some notable performance highlights beginning with the highest level of quarterly gross written premium, net written premium and net earned premium realized in our insurance operation history. It further marks the 14th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in our business. This achievement is the result of highly diversified growth across our property and casualty and accident and health operations, our growing geographic reach and our consistently evolving product capabilities. It also speaks to our increasing relevance within the specialty insurance market. This quarter’s results are also encouraging considering our two largest underwriting divisions by gross written premium in the quarter. Everest Underwriting Partners and our U.S. property group experienced notable declines in their premium production due to various deliberate underwriting actions. Importantly, this quarter builds upon the underwriting profitability achieved in the first quarter of this year and brings our year-to-date underwriting profit to $22 million, a more than twofold increase over prior year first half. Our second quarter underwriting profit is $9.5 million, a 3x increase over 2017 second quarter and $37 million more than our 2016 2Q performance. Further, five of the last six quarters have produced an underwriting profit, the lone exception being the third quarter of 2017, where we along with the rest of the industry felt the impact of unprecedented cat activity. We are encouraged, but not surprised to see our profitability increasing as we expand our specialty product premium writings along with our top line results. An area of continued focus for the insurance operation is the attraction of industry leading talent across our expanding global platform. Everest Insurance remains a highly desirable home for talented professionals across a range of disciplines. In fact, more than 500 colleagues have chosen to join Everest over the past 3 years. These talent acquisition efforts continue to fuel our growth while ensuring we have the right people in place to support our expanding books of business. Notable hires this year include a new CEO of our Canadian Insurance operation, the Everest Insurance Company of Canada, a new leader of the Specialty Insurance Group, our dedicated platform in the sports, entertainment and leisure space, and a new head of our E&S Casualty operations. Each of these leaders strengthens our already deep bench of talent and are representative of the top-flight professionals joining our organization. The evolution of Everest Insurance is a long-term effort, and there is room for further improvement. But there is no denying that many strategic actions we have taken since 2015 are beginning to take hold and evidence themselves in our underlying results. Turning to the financial results for the second quarter of 2018, the global insurance operations produced $646 million in gross written premium, an increase of $77 million or 13% over second quarter 2017. Adjusting for a second quarter 2017 renewal rights deal that enhanced our wholesale property platform, gross written premium growth improves to 17%. Year-to-date, gross written premium rose to $1.2 billion, a $147 million or 15% increase over the same period of 2017. Adjusting for the renewal rights deal, first half gross written premium growth also comes in at 17%. Again, gross written premium for the second quarter represents the single largest quarter of production in our history and showed a 96% increase over 2Q 2015, nearly doubling our production from when we started this transformation just 3 short years ago. The significant addition of new products, which continue to gain scale, coupled with strong performance from our many existing product areas, contributed to this excellent result. 9 of our 11 major business segments showed year-over-year growth in the first half, while our line of business mix remained generally stable, with roughly 40% of our premium written in short-tail classes and the remainder in our specialty and casualty line. Our net written premium growth, while still a healthy 6% year-to-date over the comparable period of 2017 was impacted by two notable items. First was the previously discussed 2Q ‘17 renewal rights deal, which included a one-time transfer of unearned premium in that quarter. If we exclude this one-time item, net written premium growth improves to 8% for the first half. Further impacting net written premium growth are additional hedges we have implemented for our wholesale and retail property portfolios, which included a one-time cession related to a new quota share placement incepted on April of this year. Net earned premium in the quarter was $408 million, an increase of $45 million or 12%. Year-to-date, net earned premium increased by $114 million or 17% over the prior period to $802 million. The growth in earned premium has been anticipated as various new business ventures incepted over the past 3 years begin to earn through the P&L at a greater rate. Turning to the combined ratio for the quarter, the GAAP combined ratio was 97.7%, a 140 basis point improvement from the second quarter of 2017. Year-to-date, the GAAP combined ratio was 97.3%, a 150 basis point improvement over the comparable prior year period. Our attritional combined ratio for the quarter and year-to-date period, are 95.4% and 96.6%, respectively. This represents a 1.8% increase over 2017’s second quarter of 93.6% and a 90 basis point increase over 2017’s year-to-date result of 95.7%. Last year’s second quarter attritional combined ratio had a one-time benefit from an adjustment to our A&H portfolio, which accounts for the majority of the 90 basis point increase in the year-to-date attritional combined ratio. This quarter’s loss and loss adjustment expense ratio improved 1.6% from the prior year period to 68.7% from 70.3%. This includes 2.6 points of cat activity in the current quarter related to late winter storms in the U.S. This compares favorably to the 3.6 points of cat activity in 2Q ‘17. The second quarter ‘18 attritional loss ratio increased 1.5% to 66.3% from 64.8% in 2Q ‘17. However, on a year-to-date basis, the 2018 attritional loss ratio of 66.2% remains very stable and, in fact, it is flat compared to the first half of ‘17. Our expense ratio was stable in the quarter as we take advantage of our improved scale to continue our investment in people and technology. Our expense ratio in the second quarter was 29%, down from the first quarter result of 31.9% and essentially flat from 2Q 2017. For the year-to-date period, the expense ratio was 30.5%, up a 100 basis points from the 29.5% in the comparable period of 2017. Again, we anticipate the expense ratio to stabilize as we continue on our growth path and as earned premium continues to come through in the second half of the year. As we’ve stated in prior calls, an expense ratio of roughly 30% remains very competitive in the specialty insurance segment. I want to spend a few minutes on the rate environment and share some observations with regards to pricing. Overall, I will break this down into 3 areas. First, we see some encouraging trends in parts of our U.S. property and commercial auto books, for example. Second, we are encouraged by some gradually improving lines of business such as primary general liability and various professional lines. And third there remains some areas under a higher degree of rate pressure, namely U.S. workers’ compensation, which we will continue to closely monitor. Overall, excluding workers’ compensation, Everest Insurance produced an aggregate rate change of plus 5.8% in the second quarter, which is the strongest rate change we have seen since the second quarter of 2012, a 6-year high. Further, this continues an upward trend in non-workers’ compensation rate change that began in the beginning of 2017. As for the encouraging areas, commercial auto was up 14% for the quarter and 13.1% year-to-date. Property rates increased 13.1% for the quarter and 12.6% year-to-date. Commercial auto has been on an upward trend over many quarters, and for property, the second quarter was the fourth in a row of growing rate increases. As for lines showing steady rate improvement, primary general liability is gaining momentum and the quarter’s plus 3.2% change is more than double the rate increase we experienced in the first quarter of this year. Further, the second quarter marks the sixth quarter of the last 7 in positive rate change territory for this line. As with respect to various professional lines, we continue to experience moderate rate pressure, although overall rates appear to be bottoming out, coming in near flat for the quarter. Workers’ compensation, despite coming under persistent rate pressure, continues to perform well and in line with our view of loss experience across our portfolio. As stated previously, we remain encouraged by the profitability of this line of business, and we’ll carefully monitor rate and loss cost trends in the coming quarters. Some concluding comments. Stated simply, the momentum across our global specialty insurance operation continues. Strong premium growth and increasing profitability are being achieved alongside continued investments in talent, technology and operating platforms. We have built an adaptive, resilient and relevant specialty insurance organization that we continue to grow, guided by our number one priority of profitable, sustainable growth. We look forward to continuing our momentum and reporting back to you next quarter. Now I’ll turn the call back over to Todd for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.
Josh Shanker: Thank you. In your prepared remarks, you spoke about what you got wrong on the cat losses last year and suggesting you have you have under-priced loss adjustment expenses. So, is the book of business you have in cat today under-priced relative to what you should have priced that at January 1?
John Doucette: Good morning, Josh. It’s John. Thanks for the question. I would not characterize it that way and we always are continuing to evaluate loss trends and factors that go into our pricing. And really, it was a function of the loss adjustment expenses that happened in totality when the multiple events happened, but we do look at and have modified our loss adjustment expenses going forward and we did going into this renewal season at 6/1.
Josh Shanker: Did that change the competitiveness about how you could participate? Did you find that your business was better except for that 1/1 than at 6/1?
John Doucette: I think there is a lot of countervailing occurrence that are happening. And at 1/1, that’s more of a different market. 6/1 is Florida and there is a lot more territories at 1/1. So I think there are a lot of moving parts, including some of the capital. I think there was more macro overarching supply demand as we headed into 6/1. There is a lot of moving parts that are there. With did, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we did write more on deals that we liked and wrote – declined several deals or reduced the share of deals that we didn’t like and some of that was pricing, some of that was what we thought the right kind of either an agreement or disagreement on what the price equilibrium should be for losses that happened or losses to particular layers, so either by region or to a client or to a layer and what we thought the price equilibrium should be for that. So, it was more than usual churn in the portfolio this Florida season than we had seen, but we were in the end pleased with our ability to deploy the capital, supporting the clients that we wanted to support. We also wrote more proportional business as we indicated both in casualty and in property.
Dom Addesso: Josh, these multiple events also had – because they were multiple events, had a disproportionate impact on our retro add book. And as a result of pricing demand that we had back in January 1 we actually have less exposure there than we did in the previous year. Go ahead.
Josh Shanker: Yes. If you think about your outwards reinsurance book, I think that in retrospect, you wish you had certain kinds of protection, particularly around LAE that you didn’t have coming into this year. Do you feel well protected on your outwards reinsurance book this year or does it carry with the same risks that befell you in 2017?
Dom Addesso: First of all, big portion of our outwards book is through Mt. Logan, which is proportional as well as some facultative specific deals, which again are for the most part proportional. So, those are not affected. Our cat bonds, which frankly make up the bulk of our protections beyond Mt. Logan, are really intended to be protected against capital events, not earnings events. So, we still feel very comfortable with our cat load that we profess to be under 9% and that our protections are the same or better.
Josh Shanker: Alright. Well, I will see the floor to other questions.
Dom Addesso: Thank you.
John Doucette: Thanks, Josh.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi, good morning. So my first question just trying to get a bit more color on the increase to losses for 2017. So, you guys mentioned part of it was related to the AOB issue in Florida. We have seen that going on in the state with a bunch of the homeowner insurers for sometime. So in retrospect, I mean, maybe are you a little bit less surprised that this happened, just a little bit more color there? And then my second question would be, I don’t know, if it’s IBNR that you can disclose in relation to how you are carrying for these events or some other metric I guess. So we would expect we can kind of look to a number and say this has been fully addressed and we don’t expect any additional movement from here?
Dom Addesso: I will ask Craig to address the IBNR question, but relative to the AOB, the AOB issue was not the AOB per se, it was the threat of AOB that we think was driving the number of reopens. So again to be clear what we were seeing as increases were due to reopens not as it relates specifically to AOB. Craig, on the IBNR question?
Craig Howie: Elyse, on the IBNR, we believe that we have put up adequate IBNR and when we went through these calculations for these catastrophe events, our goal was to put this issue behind us. And so we believe the IBNR that we hold for all our cat events and that’s separate from our non-catastrophe reserves is adequate to cover in any and all prior year cat.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. And then my second question maybe this ties back to a little bit of what Josh was asking, but if we look at your losses following on this quarter’s increase as a percent of equity, you do stand above your peers following this increase. So in retrospect, as you think back were you carrying too much risk, two to three storms? And I guess as you have you did mention writing less aggregate retro this year. So do you think given that the increase happened kind of right around the midyear renewals were taking place, do you think that you were able to kind of see it in time to make enough adjustments to the book you are carrying into this year’s wind season?
Dom Addesso: Right. So in response to your first question, I will take a little bit of – I slightly disagree with characterizing it as above our peers. It’s frankly more in line. We manage our cat exposure as you know on an after-tax basis as do many others, but most others aren’t being in Bermuda, don’t have some of the same advantages from our tax structure that we do. So frankly, we consider it on that basis. And again given our capital position, given what I mentioned in my script, was that again over the last 5 years, our overall cat portfolio has been extremely profitable at generating over $3.5 billion of profits in that 5-year time period as well as I think if you look at our operating ROE compared to our peers, I think you will find that we lead the group there as well. So, the answer to your question relative to tax is we manage our cat exposure at less than 9 points of combined ratio points on an annual expected basis. And frankly over the last 5 years or 10 years, it’s actually proven to come in right in around that number. So we think we have kind of optimized our portfolio. The fact that we write a lot more retro and retro ag than most other participants again because of our size and our scale can lead to a little bit more volatility, but again we think that that’s come with the appropriate returns. I don’t know if that answers your question, but...
Elyse Greenspan: Yes, that does. And then one last question moving away from the cat increase, the current accident year results were pretty strong in reinsurance in the quarter. In the prepared remarks I believe you said 2 points was from non-cat weather. You showed about a 5 point improvement in your accident year loss ratio in reinsurance in the quarter, which did stand out as you commented just given the shift to pro rata and casualty business. So is that as you think going forward is that a level of improvement that can be sustained or were there some other one-timers in the quarter or should we just look to the half year number as representative of the underlying margin improvement we could see?
Dom Addesso: I always prefer to look at a half year number, because any one quarter can have a fair bit of volatility in it, but I think the half year number is fairly reflective of kind of what we expect going forward recognizing of course that it was positively impacted by the non-cat – the scarcity of non-cat cat events, which is frankly has not occurred for a number of years. You might recall last year, it was for both primary companies and re-insurers, there was a lot of storm activity in the first half of the year that didn’t reach the level of, in our case, $10 million per event, so we call them non-cat cats. But recognizing that difference, depending on how you would like to account for that in your models again in the 6 month numbers would be more reflective of how we see the portfolio.
John Doucette: And Elyse, good morning, it’s John. I’d just add a little more color on the portfolio so we did see rate increases at different points in time this renewal season post the events again, we talked about it at 1/1 was it as much as we were hoping for now but we did see rate increases at 1/1, 4/1, 6/1 and 7/1, and that is going to have some impact in the numbers you’re looking at we also as we continue to build out our mortgage and credit portfolio, that has run to an attractive combined ratio and there is a lot of other things I talked about the global clients and the strategic relationship we are building with some of those, also has run favorably so there is a lot of moving parts but again, just to reiterate from the prepared comments, we really believe that our overall portfolio, our U.S. international casualty, professional, property, mortgage, structured is better positioned today that we’ve been able to get rate in some places but also position the portfolio and build some stronger portfolio overall that will impact that has impacted the attritional combined ratio.
Dom Addesso: To further add to that, John mentioned in his prepared comments about, as well, a low combined ratio line expansion in or growth in trade credit political risk and surety again, we have, over a number of quarters now, worked hard to diversify our portfolio not only by product and class of business but also geographically and I think that if you look at the underlying metrics, you’ll find that we’ve achieved a lot of that success and that’s, in part, what’s driving down what historically had been a much higher annual expected cat load, driving that down below 9%, notwithstanding the fact that, yes, we have these events in ‘17, but again, given the fact that we have a retro book that, in retrospect, was not – it was not a surprising effort.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay, thank you very much for all the color.
Dom Addesso: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs.
Yaron Kinar: Good morning, everybody. My first question on the reinsurance front, so Everest, I’d say is probably a little bit of an outlier in terms of the strong growth in net premiums written that we have seen and that growth has accelerated this quarter. John, I know you said that this growth was broad, but I am just curious are there any particular notable deals that drove this particularly strong growth this quarter and are you seeing the ceding commissions or the ceding rates relatively stable?
John Doucette: Good morning, Yaron. Thanks for the question. So, we are – so a couple of things. So I mentioned the global clients and so the large, the top 15 or so multinational insurers, we see them coming back, I would say, the pendulum when we have talked about this over the last several earnings calls or years, where they were retaining more, centralizing their ceded, re-globalizing their treaties and sometimes that worked for them on a pro forma basis and sometimes, it didn’t – maybe it didn’t work as well on some of the classes of business with some of the volatility they wanted and we do see that there seems to be as the pendulum seems to be moving a little bit in the other direction that they are potentially ceding more. And that is a disproportionate advantage to Everest, because they have very strong type reinsurance security committees they want to trade with people in basically all lines of business, not just property they want to trade with re-insurers in all lines of business, and they want to trade with them around the world and given our broad portfolio and experienced underwriters that are situated in all the major markets, hubs around the world, we have that ability to trade with the global re-insurers locally as well as holistically at a corporate level and that is driving not all, but it’s driving some of it we are also seeing continued opportunities in the mortgage space and frankly, we are seeing other clients coming to the market with casualty and professional reinsurance treaties in a way that we haven’t seen the last couple of years so we had been bearish on the casualty space for many years and ahead of our peers on decreasing as the ceding commissions went up, and we didn’t like the trade as much or the strategic positioning of that and we are directionally moving increasing our capacity to that space as we do see more favorable dynamics for us to allow us to support casualty and professional treaties and again, we do have some strategic relationships there, not just with the global clients, that are resulting in some meaningful premium opportunities and you asked about the ceding commissions we are seeing, in some cases, the ceding commissions coming down there’s been a lot of talk about that, that maybe if property can’t subsidize other lines of business, that other lines of business will have to stand more on their own so at 1/1, we were pleased with that, and we continue to see some favorable movement on ceding commissions across our long tail book of business.
Yaron Kinar: That’s helpful. And just to clarify the increased use of your services and your balance sheet by the global clients, that’s coming that’s broad based or is it coming from a concentrated number of clients?
John Doucette: So, we trade basically with all of them, the top 14, 15, 16 of them, but it varies, where some of them, we trade a lot more and part of that’s their cession strategy, their reinsurance strategy on how where they are in that thought process part of it is long-term relationships that we’ve developed with them part of it is where they’re situated so there is a lot of moving parts, but we do trade with all of them but what we are seeing is our ability that when they come to the market, they would come and talk to Everest they will come and talk to a few other large global re-insurers, but they won’t necessarily talk to a broad reinsurance panel and again, that is disproportionately impacting favorably our ability to grow the book and diversify the book.
Dom Addesso: Our growth with these global clients, for most of those relationships, the total volume has grown not all, but so we can’t if you’re trying to get to is there are small handful, it’s across the spectrum, no.
Yaron Kinar: Okay, that’s helpful. And then on the insurance side, I guess given that net premiums earned are up over 15% in the first half of the year, why would the expense ratio deteriorate year-over-year?
Jon Zaffino: Good morning. This is Jon. I think you are going to see some movement in any discrete quarter based on the timing of our hiring effort, the timing of various investments in technology I think what we are aiming for is again as I said in my prepared remarks that 30% level is quite competitive but there’s a lot of moving parts as we continue to expand geographically in various lines of business and make various investments so that’s part of it we look at the on a trailing 12-month basis, it’s trending the right way and we also looked at it compared to first quarter, which obviously was a nice improvement. So we are pretty comfortable with where that’s been.
Yaron Kinar: Great. Thank you very much.
Dom Addesso: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Amit Kumar with The Buckingham Research Group.
Amit Kumar: Thanks and good morning and thanks for the color. I have three follow-up questions to the loss development discussion. Number one, just going back I guess in your opening remarks, you outlined two reasons for the loss development two other companies in our universe talked about the same reasons yet they actually released reserves from 2017 events how can we as outsiders reconcile these two things in which Everest is an outlier?
Dom Addesso: Well, I mean, I can’t speak to what their process is, and I think I’ve already suggested that we have to make some changes in the way we look at these things and I’ll point back to and I can’t speak to what the circumstances were in these two companies, some of which, by the way, we may have supported on the retro side and didn’t see losses from them until the second quarter. So that’s kind of an interesting sidebar, but we were disproportionately impacted by our retro ag book, which by definition is going to be late record and I think overall, I can’t speak to what they’ve done versus what we’ve done, but we know we have to make changes to how we address these multiple events going forward I will also point to the fact that you might recall that in the weeks following and the months following these events, that widespread press reports of claims being closed, the events were not as large as was expected so there was some market chatter, if you will, that wasn’t setting off any alarm bells for us and clearly, in retrospect, that was a mistake, and we had readily admitted that but for sure, the loss itself is certainly contained within our capabilities, within our earnings our long-term track record is still intact and when you go back and push this event back into ‘17, I still submit to you that our operating returns were better than all of our peers.
Amit Kumar: Fair point. I guess it’s just relating to that answer can we have some comfort or how much limit is left in this cover, which you were referring to and how will this respond if there is any additional development?
Dom Addesso: I’ll ask Craig or John to.
Craig Howie: So Amit, as we went through this from the ground up, we did look at the aggregate covers that had losses submitted on them, and we know what those limits are that remain on those covers but what we really did from a modeling standpoint and going to the underlying underwriters was try to find out what other aggregate covers have we written where we haven’t seen a loss selection yet, and we are trying to extrapolate that across our portfolio so that’s what’s included in our additional loss estimate for these events.
Amit Kumar: Got it. The third and final question it’s been a few years since we have discussed models and their efficacy I know in the past, I think you have mentioned using an AIR model any thoughts on AIR versus RMS and even any cost of changing the models that you use? Thank you.
John Doucette: Hi, good morning Amit, it’s John. So look, we are well aware of limitations of the models and that these are tools and one of the things that go into how we underwrite, how we price and how we reserve and there were many examples during not just the 2017 events but events prior to that, that showed model misses from the major vendors, and that happened multiple times, including during the 2017 events, with orders of magnitude missed so we agree with you that the models are a tool and need to be thought that way, and so we rely we look at the models, but we rely on first principles as well as underwriting who the clients are we want to support, what do we think of their underwriting, what do we think of our positioning with them, how they trade forward, how they treat reinsurance and/or retro writers and we think that allows us to both build a profitable book of business as well as build a sustainable, competitive franchise with clients that we have around the world.
Amit Kumar: But you still use the AIR model, right?
John Doucette: Yes, we use AIR. We also look at RMS. We look at other a lot of AIR and RMS haven’t developed in some of the more developed developing countries, and we looked at local models we try to look at all data sources, all modeling, all vendor models that we can to determine what we think is Everest to a risk.
Amit Kumar: Thank you.
Dom Addesso: Thank you, Amit. I have got – I think we are running over and we are more than happy to stay on, because we have got a number of other people in queue. So, next caller?
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley.
Kai Pan: Good morning. Thank you for fitting me in. My first question is on the current quarter, second quarter catastrophe losses $65 million seems to be higher than your pre-announcement 2 weeks ago, just want to clarify that?
Craig Howie: So Kai, this is Craig. We pre-announced a net after-tax number, and that number was net of other current year weather related losses so as you heard us talk about, we were able to lower our loss selection on the reinsurance side for non-cat losses, if you will, anything below $10 million we were able to lower that loss selection because we didn’t have many events during the first half of the year that were indicating reinsurance exposure so that’s what was offsetting that $65 million, and then the rest is after tax to get us to the $25 million that was in the pre-release.
Kai Pan: Okay. So that portion benefits your underlying core loss ratio in your reinsurance operations?
Craig Howie: That’s correct. It was not a cat event it was the underlying reinsurance attritional loss ratio.
Kai Pan: Great. My second question, on the insurance side it looks like if you take out adjustments a year ago, it’s pretty flat in terms of combined ratio, underlying combined ratio given the business growing and still probably not up to the goal of mid-90s combined ratio yet, so do you think there’s room for further improvement towards that goal and how quickly you can get there?
Jon Zaffino: Hi, Kai, it’s Jon. Good morning. Yes, let me remember, there is two things going on in the second quarter comparative first, as I mentioned, was the renewal rights deal, which moved some things around secondly was the onetime adjustment for our A&H book so achieving the flat both loss and combined on an attritional basis, that feels like we’re directionally moving the right way considering some of the deliberate underwriting actions we took throughout the first half of the year and actually, candidly, we have for the prior couple of years we expect that momentum to continue for instance, some of our newer businesses, which we think have very, very favorable risk-return characteristics, were about a third of our premium writings in the quarter that’s an all-time high from the inception of each of these so as that continues to earn through, we do expect further improvement again you might get some movement in any discrete quarter based on various movements across the book, but overall, we still think there’s room for improvement.
Dom Addesso: To add to that, Kai, we have some of our newer lines of business, longer earning periods, whether it’s surety, trade credit, political risk, transaction risks and those portfolios are beginning to build, and the earned premium is growing proportionally there and those are very low combined ratio classes.
Kai Pan: Okay, great. Last one, if I may. On the buybacks and it looks like you resumed buyback, $25 million in the quarter I assume that’s before you know this loss revision in 2017 events I just wonder what’s your thought process behind it and now you’ve started trading below 1.1x book. Will you be more aggressive in buying back your own shares even during the wind season?
Dom Addesso: It was a very attractive price.
Kai Pan: Thank you.
Dom Addesso: Thank you, Kai.
Operator: Thank you. We will take our last question from Meyer Shields with KBW.
Meyer Shields: Thanks. Two quick ones. I think first of all in reinsurance, was there any change in the accident year loss pick for casualty and specialty lines from the first quarter to the second quarter?
Craig Howie: There was always movement, Meyer, with respect to loss picks throughout the quarter we constantly look at, we hold reserve committees at the end of each quarter as part of that process, we do that both on the reinsurance side and the insurance side, but as we go through that process, we look at everything, we look at rate change up or down, we look at loss cost trend up or down, but there is constant movement in those expected loss ratios in any given quarter where the movements this quarter. The answer is yes, slight movements only.
Dom Addesso: But nothing material, and some of that has to reflect the fact that we had some newer business coming into that line so it has to be reflective of the business that we’re now putting on the books but generally, it’s been pretty stable.
Meyer Shields: Okay, that’s very helpful. So in the past few years, you have had phenomenal aggregate reserve development generally concentrated in the fourth quarter I know this is sort of an unrealistic question, but should we assume that some of the second quarter reserve releases came out of what we would normally see in the fourth quarter as a function of conservative reserving?
Dom Addesso: Well, part of the answer to that question and it’s not a ridiculous question, the reserve studies that we had done this time are the same reserve studies that we do every time for this kind of year typically, those reserve studies, because they are smaller lines of businesses, don’t produce these kinds of results, which and therefore they are not material. And therefore sometimes – if they are material, they get booked. If they are not material, then we wait for the fourth quarter. So this time around, we have some relatively smaller lines of business or classes of business that produced pretty favorable number obviously. And so obviously I don’t know the answer to your question, because we haven’t done the year end reserve studies yet, but typically you wouldn’t expect this level of releases from the lines of businesses that were under review and therefore you wouldn’t expect these lines of business to have contributed that much to the year end reserve releases. Is that helpful at all?
Meyer Shields: It is, yes. Very much so. And I guess just a final follow-up, is there any sense of the change in – or any quantification of the losses ceded to Mt. Logan because of the reserve shift?
Craig Howie: Could you say that again? What was that?
Meyer Shields: Yes, I am sorry. The magnitude of the change in 2017 tax free losses that were ceded to Mt. Logan?
John Doucette: Yes. So, this is John. So, the short answer is yes. As indicated previously, Mt. Logan participates on basically quota shares of layers and portfolios of business that Everest writes and consequently, the cession to Mt. Logan grew particularly – grew accordingly with the increase in the loss picks that Everest put forth.
Meyer Shields: Okay, perfect. Thank you so much.
John Doucette: You are welcome.
Operator: Thank you ladies and gentlemen. That ends our questions for today.
Dom Addesso: Thank you, Todd and thanks to all for your questions today. I hope you came away with a better understanding of the circumstances regarding our reserve change. But nevertheless, as we look back at the portfolio and our business model, we remain very confident that our underwriting strategy is solid. And as I mentioned, it’s evidenced by our 5-year average operating ROE through 2017, which after adjustment for the cat losses was 11.8%. This is better than each of the companies in our peer group and I think it’s worth emphasizing. Cat business is volatile. But as I pointed out, it’s profitable through the cycle and again as I mentioned previously, it’s less than 9 combined ratio points on average through those same 5 years. But what I really – I think the message we want to leave you with is the understanding of the breadth of our entire business model. And over the last couple of years, we have succeeded in lessening our cat exposure by diversifying our reinsurance portfolio and the credit, other specialty classes along with as John talked about, the resurgence in our casualty lines of business. And as a consequence, the attrition results continue to improve. Furthermore, the organic build of our insurance operation has been noteworthy. We now have profitable specialty insurance operation expected to exceed over $2 billion in premium. That’s double from 3 years ago. I recognized in the short-term that it maybe very natural to look at the current results in this business that can be sometimes misleading. And if you more closely examine the underlying metrics, I think you will find and get a better sense of what the future holds for Everest. So, we believe it’s a bright one. Thank you very much for your interest this morning.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today’s conference. You may now disconnect your phone lines and have a great rest of the day.

===== 2018 Q1  (2018-04-26 10:30:00) =====
Executives: Beth Farrell – Vice President-Investor Relations  Dom Addesso – President and Chief Executive Officer Craig Howie – Chief Financial Officer John Doucette – Executive Vice President and President and Chief Executive Officer of the Reinsurance Division Jon Zaffino – President and Chief Executive Officer of Insurance Operations
Analysts: Joshua Shanker – Deutsche Bank Kai Pan – Morgan Stanley Meyer Shields – KBW Elyse Greenspan – Wells Fargo
Operator: Good day and welcome to the Everest Re Group First Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. Today’s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Beth Farrell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma’am, please go ahead.
Beth Farrell: Thank you, Derek [ph]. Good morning, and welcome to Everest Re Group’s First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. On the call with me today are Dom Addesso, the company’s President and Chief Executive Officer; Craig Howie, Chief Financial Officer; John Doucette, President and CEO of Reinsurance Operations; and Jon Zaffino, President and CEO of Insurance Operations. Before we begin, I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I note that statements made during today’s call, which are forward-looking in nature, such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations and the like, are subject to various risks. As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations. Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements. Now, let me turn the call over to Dom.
Dom Addesso: Thanks, Beth. Good morning and welcome to the call this morning. As noted in the published financials, the core attritional results of the company continue to be quite favorable. And despite the prior year catch reported this quarter, the operating ROE of 10.5% is quite strong. Our reinsurance book produced a $96 million underwriting profit in the quarter and our insurance franchise more than double this underwriting profit to $12.5 million for the quarter. This reflects a continuing diversification effort due to classes of business that have adequate margins. With respect to the reinsurance segment, the underwriting profit is a consequence of improving margins in our property book, which I’ll get back to in a minute, but also expanded writings in casually, mortgage and structured products. While mortgage and structured products have generally had excellent margin, we’re finding the general casualty market is now firm perhaps in part due to less than expected improvement in company’s margins on property business. However more prominent in the casualty market is the demand side. As underwriting income and primary market has been under pressure due to the property results, buyers have become more tuned to reducing volatility generally across their entire portfolio, driving more demand for casualty and whole account solutions. Industry consolidation oddly plays a part in that due to large buyers needed capacity and quality markets that can support that. With respect to the property market in general, the renewal season for reinsurance offered a better terms, but was somewhat below our expectation. This resulted in us reducing our participation in certain areas. However, our first quarter premiums were above the prior year due to rate and select new opportunities. These two factors, of course, need to increase margin per dollar of PML year-over-year. April is a key renewal for the Japan and Asia markets, which saw a slight improvement in rates, but the bright spot was the Caribbean renewals, which of course were loss affected. On balance, the reinsurance property market remains inconsistent and that there is less business that needs our current return hurdles, but enough that allowed us to increase our margin year-over-year. Our approach to different parts of the cycle has been to match capacity of the capital at the most efficient point in the curve. That means period of contraction, expansion, attachment point change et cetera whatever suits that particular period in the market. Consequently over time you tend to outperform in the market. We think the reinsurance focus continue that trend here in the first quarter. Our insurance operation continues its tremendous progress. While it may not be obvious given the similar attritional combined ratio year-over-year in fact the North American operation produced a 95.7 combined ratio in the quarter. The headwind, of course, is the international insurance build out, which was in the plan. During the balance of 2018, we expect the international operation to improve substantially as we are beginning to see our investments there payoff. Insurance premium growth remains healthy, but this growth creates a pull on earnings as earned premium lags the resource investment required. In addition some of our newer product offerings with lower expected loss ratios have not yet fully have their impact as the earned premium build is still developing. As the year progresses, we expect our expense ratio and loss ratio to improve as the accelerated growth in premium becomes earned in conjunction with a more normalized resource growth. We are quite optimistic about the ability of the insurance group to increase this level of profitability. The market will likely make that a challenging objective. However, we have demonstrated that our product diversity and scale is one that allows us to find the right opportunities. This is not unlike what I described regarding the reinsurance operation and cycle management. Before I end my comments about the underwriting operations, you surely want my comments regarding the wildfire losses booked this quarter. First let me say that this tragic event was so much more devastating than people imagine. These record events late last year were obviously hard to evaluate especially as a reinsurer, it was one further step we moved. Our loss selection for any particular event is based on a three prolonged approach that takes into consideration the estimated industry loss, modeled estimates and client discussions. Generally, we placed greater weight on the highest believed outlooks when establishing our reserves for catastrophe events. The models for these wildfire events were the lowest of the various estimates and as a consequence the reserves were largely based on our clients’ insights into their expected loss. As many of you know our reserving philosophy, we believe that due to our various methodologies, our estimate was conservative. While this turned out not to be the case, we continue to expect that our overall 2017 year end reserve position will prove to be more than adequate to cover all losses that occurred in 2017 and prior, including cats. Finally, let me touch on investment income, which remains strong and is reflective of a continual evaluation of our asset allocation and a low but rising interest rate environment coupled with increasing volatility in the equity markets. Our slight rotation in allocation to the private equity markets with a bias towards fixed income from public equities has resulted in a pick up in investment income. Nevertheless, our core portfolio remains investment grade and naturally with the recent rise in rates is negatively affected our market values, thereby constraining our growth in book value. This is a relatively short-term challenge as our portfolio was on the shorter end with duration of three years. This of course means that over time these bonds will accrete to par and we will benefit from higher rates going forward. In summary based on the first quarter and what we see ahead, we remain quite optimistic and would expect to continue to produce a double-digit ROE including an expected cat load. This is a result of our diversified portfolio and strong market position as well as a solid balance sheet. Thanks for your participation this morning. I look forward to the discussion later and now to Craig for the financial report.
Craig Howie: Thank you, Dom, and good morning everyone. Everest had another solid quarter of earnings with net income of $210 million for the first quarter of 2018. This compares the net income of $292 million for the first quarter of 2017. The 2018 results represents an annualized net income return on equity of 10%. Net income included $19 million of net after tax realized capital losses compared to $32 million of capital gains in the first quarter last year. The 2018 capital losses were primarily attributable to fair value adjustments on the public equity portfolio. After tax operating income for the first quarter was $220 million compared to $267 million in 2017. As previously announced, the company’s reporting of operating income now excludes foreign exchange gains and losses. The overall underwriting gain for the group was $108 million for the quarter compared to an underwriting gain of $183 million in the same period last year. In the first quarter of 2018, Everest saw $100 million of catastrophe losses related to the 2017 California wildfires compared to $20 million of catastrophe losses reported during the first quarter of 2017. In comparing reported losses against our prior year catastrophe loss estimates and the impact of aggregate covers on attachment to specific events, we revised the ultimate loss estimates by event and by segment with no change in the overall loss estimates except the California wildfires as previously announced. No other events breached our $10 million threshold in the first quarter of 2018, therefore any losses arising from these events were more than covered in our attritional loss estimates, which include a little for events less than $10 million. The overall current year attritional combined ratio was 87.1%, up from 84.5% in the first quarter of 2017, primarily due to changes in business mix and higher retrocession costs in 2018. John Doucette will explain more about these changes and his comments. Our reported combined ratio of 93% was higher than first quarter last year, primarily due to the higher reported catastrophe losses in 2018. For our investments, pretax investment income was $138 million for the quarter on our $18 billion investment portfolio. Investment income was 13% above last year. This result was primarily driven by the increase in limited partnership income which was up $12 million from first quarter of 2017 and the investment grade fixed income portfolio which had a higher asset base this year. The pretax yield on the overall portfolio was 3% with the duration of just over three years. Foreign exchange is reported another income. For the first quarter of 2018 foreign exchange gains were $10 million, compared to $4 million of losses in the first quarter of 2017. Other income also included less than $1 million of earnings and fees from Mt. Logan Re, compared to $2 million of income in the first quarter last year. On income taxes, the 6% effective tax rate on operating income was at the low end of our expected range of 7% to 8% for the full year. The effective tax rate is an annualized calculation that includes planned catastrophe losses for the rest of the year. Should catastrophe losses come in lower than this estimate, it would be expected that the tax rate would go up. Shareholders’ equity for the group was $8.3 billion at the end of the first quarter, relatively flat, compared to year-end 2017. This is after taking into account the mark-to-market impact on the investment portfolio and capital return through $53 million of dividend paid in the first quarter of 2018. Our capital position remains very strong. Thank you. Now John Doucette will provide a review of the reinsurance operations.
John Doucette: Thank you, Craig. Good morning. The Reinsurance Division delivered a strong first quarter with $96 million of underwriting profit premium growth of 22% and a better risk adjusted portfolio as compared to Q1 2017. After the record loss activity in 2017, rates were up as we indicated last quarter. At this pivotal 1/1 renewal, we focused on improving the quality of our portfolio, including its diversification by line of business and geography. To this end we were successful. Our clients and brokers increasingly gravitate to Everest as an enduring, relevant, long-term trading partner. Against this backdrop of increasing uncertainty for some of our competitors who are distracted by M&A activity, Everest provides stability and focus to the customer. Our growing global reinsurance franchise with broad product and distribution capabilities and industry-leading expense advantage and sophisticated capital and hedging capabilities, position us to maximize opportunities born from the continued disruption and evolution of the reinsurance market. This is further enhanced by the growing number of strategic partnerships that we are adding and developing across our entire organization. Our deepening relationships continue with our core clients and partners and extend beyond the traditional P&C landscape. These strategic relationships come in various forms, including global clients, quality upcoming underwriting organization. Staffed with underwriters we know well and respect cutting edge insurers, brokers with specialized distribution capabilities, niche businesses accessing unique and diversifying risks, highly specialized MTAs and asset managers and alternative capital investors. Combining the accompanying, enhanced capabilities derived from these partnerships with our nimble execution, we are better positioned to thrive where the continuum of asset risk and insurance risk is blurred. Before I comment on recent renewals, here is an overview of the Reinsurance Division’s results. Overall, Reinsurance premium showed strong growth at $1.4 billion, an increase of 22% from the first quarter of 2017. This was driven by broad growth across the U.S., Middle East and Africa, Latin America and European operations, including both rate increases and a higher volume from pro-rata contracts. Our loss ratio was elevated by 9.8 points, with 6.5 points due to the $100 million of loss emanating from the California wildfires in our U.S. operations. Adjusting for these wildfire catastrophe losses and prior year development, the attritional loss ratio is up 3.2 points due to business mix with a higher share of new property and casualty pro-rata opportunities, additional long-tail treaties, some loss portfolio transfer business and higher retrocessional costs in the quarter, compared to Q1 2017. Our estimates for the Harvey, Irma and Maria losses remain unchanged in total across the group. However, the losses both across business segments and by event have been allocated differently as more data became available. Directionally, we saw upward movement on our estimates due to increased loss adjustment expenses, while we saw reductions on Maria and Mexican earthquake estimates as development has not been as significant as initially estimated. Now for some additional comments by Reinsurance Division. In our U.S. Reinsurance Division, we saw our first quarter premium increase 11% year on year to $644 million, benefiting from post loss rate increases, additional property and professional liability pro-rata business and increased structured products writing. The attritional loss ratio is up 3.4 primarily due to higher corporate retrocession cost recorded to this segment and the impact of business mix. The 14-point loss ratio improvement seen in our Bermuda segment and the 22 point improvement in the International segment are due to the aforementioned reallocation of cat losses between segments. Our Bermuda reinsurance segment premium grew 29% in U.S. dollars to $416 million and 25% on a constant dollar basis. Some of the growth was recognition of written premiums from prior underwriting years with the balance supported by new professional liability and casualty quota share business, capital relief trades and reinsurance opportunities. As many Lloyd’s markets increased their hedging activity, amidst the adjustments to their underwriting strategies. Adjusting for cats and prior year development, the attritional loss ratio was up about five points, mostly due to business mix. The international reinsurance segment premium was up 38% to $367 million. Premium growth was broad based across Latin America, Middle East and Africa, Canada, Singapore and facultative markets. Some growth was due to timing of premiums on certain accounts. However, the current year attritional underwriting result was largely stable compared to Q1 2017. In terms of catastrophe capital management, we recently executed on reinsurance protection supported by two new Kilimanjaro cat bonds. These new cat bonds with total capacity of $525 million, replace expiring bonds, protecting us from hurricanes and earthquakes in the U.S., Canada and some areas in the Caribbean. The maturities are split into four-year and five-year terms and all provide annual aggregate protection. The overall retro costs are up year-over-year, because of the additional Kilimanjaro II cat bonds that were issued in Q2 last year. This additional coverage along with Mt. Logan and traditional reinsurance and retrocessional hedges protect our group’s PML holistically, allowing us to prudently manage within our cat risk appetite across all reinsurance and insurance segments. Now I will provide a brief update on resent renewal activity. In our property operations, we have captured double-digit rate increases in loss affected markets, while ceding commissions where largely stable. Competition from ILS Capital prevented further rises in rates. At Everest, we focused on improving the risk reward balance as we lead the market with corrective rate increases on deal, while although finding new attractive opportunities. In casualty markets, there is a modest firming our reinsurance terms. Casualty access rates are generally up in the single-digit and ceding commissions down for our U.S. deal, internationally ceding commissions are stable. April 1 renewals in Asia would best be described as stable pricing with some increase in demand particularly from the larger companies and mutual such as in Japan. We also renewed some loss affected areas such as the Caribbean where prices were up, reflective of the 2017 loss activity. In these areas, we have been able to deploy the same or more capacity at increase rates. Alternative capital and M&A is a presence in our business. Given this reality Everest has taken the opportunity to step up as a stable partner, capable of navigating the increasingly dynamic reinsurance markets. This resulted in better access to good business through increase signings on layers we found attractively priced including some private deals not shown to the full reinsurance market. We also provide assistance to some of our clients experiencing operational disruption through both traditional and structured solutions tailored to address the evolving needs. A key lesson so far in 2018 that is already well known, but perhaps underappreciated, is that reinsurers cannot rely on hard markets to offset subpar results in non-loss years. Having understood this to be the case for some time, Everest will continue to develop its capabilities to maintain relevance namely global breadth of capabilities across various classes of business, while continuing our territorial expansion and developing new products, creative structuring to deliver customized solutions to our clients, meaningful capacity supported by advanced capital and hedging capabilities to Mt. Logan, Kilimanjaro cat bonds traditional reinsurance and retro and ILWs. All supported by an efficient expense structure and nimble execution in size leveraging our flat and empowered organization. Sustainable franchises must maintain relevance and profitability and the ability to trade forward through major industry losses to ultimately be successful in the long-term. Thank you. And now I’ll turn it over to Jon Zaffino to review our insurance operations.
Jon Zaffino: Thank you, John, and good morning. We’re pleased to report solid start of the year for our global insurance operations. As measured across numerous metrics, we are beginning to realize the benefits of the many strategic and tactical actions taken over the past several years to completion our insurance operations for sustainable success. This of course, include the achievement of consistent underwriting profits across our steadily expanding portfolio. Globally growth written premium was $505 million for the quarter, 16% increase over the first quarter of 2017 and as strong as first quarter production we have experienced in the history of Everest Insurance. We continue to invest in thoughtful only focused growth within our chosen product segments across our global operations and this quarter’s results are a testament to that. Most importantly in the quarter, this growth resulted in underwriting profit of $12.5 million more than double the $5.1 million underwriting profit from the first quarter of 2017. Further, our attritional loss and loss adjustment expense ratio improve 1.7 points to 66.1%, reflecting the continued migration toward the higher value and diversified specialty books of business in the earned premium impact of these businesses into the P&L. These more recently establish portfolios accounted for a record 22% of our net earned premium in the quarter and will continue to expand in the quarters ahead. We remain confident that our vision to organically build a world class specialty diversified insurance organization is being realized. As we have reported in prior calls, our leadership and underwriting teams in place across the globe continue to execute on their individual and collective mandates. Our teams remain focused and our opportunity set measured by our robust submission flows across lines of business continues to grow. We will look to build on this momentum throughout the year. Turning to the financial highlights. As mentioned the global insurance operations produced $505 million in growth written premium in the first quarter, an increase of $71 million or 16% over first quarter 2017, another solid quarter showing steady improvement and evidence of our growing relevance in the specialty insurance market. As in prior quarters contributions remain balanced across the diverse group of property and casualty and acted in health underwriting divisions within our global insurance operations. Further, this represents a 13th consecutive quarter of growth across the insurance organization. Turning to net premiums. For the first quarter of 2018 net premiums grew by 12% to $386 million. Net earned premium in the quarter was $393 million, an increase of $69 million or 21%. Net written premium will lag growth written premium as we continue to take a fairly conservative reinsurance position, which we believe supports our growth across our underwriting divisions. Our reported GAAP combined ratio for the quarter was 96.8%, an improvement of 1.6 points over first quarter of 2017. The attritional combined ratio was 98% in the quarter, which compares favorably to the first quarter of 2017 attritional of 98.1% and is roughly in line with the fourth quarter of 2017 attritional combined ratio of 97.8%. That stated this year’s first quarter, North American operations were 94% of the premium volume resided achieved a 95.7% combined ratio along with a 4 point improvement in the attritional loss and loss adjustment expense ratio. The overall reported GAAP loss ratio for the first quarter of 2018 was 64.9%, improving 3.3 points over last year 68.2%. In addition to the attritional improvement the loss ratio was beneficially impacted by 1.2 points of favorable prior year development from 2016 cat activity, again reflecting our conservative reserving position on these events. As anticipated, the downward drift and the attritional loss ratio continues. Again this is a result of an improved mix of business, the benefits from the many new business is launched and a strategic underwriting actions of the past three years. Turning to the expense ratio. Due to the timing of certain one-time expense items and the lag in earned premium from the build out of new businesses, our expense ratio in the first quarter was 31.9%, up from the 30.2% from the same period of 2017. We expect our expense ratio to improve throughout the year and to remain in a competitive range. It’s important to remember that we continue to invest in all patterns of our organization, while maintaining underwriting discipline. As a result, written premiums may fluctuate somewhat from quarter-to-quarter as well the expense ratio. However, we anticipate the annual expense ratio to be within our expectations. I’ll turn now to the market conditions and in particular offer some commentary on the rate environment. As the quarter progressed, we thought improved P&C pricing trend across the organization. Overall rate levels for Everest Insurance were slightly negative decreasing by 2.4 points in the quarter. However, it should be noted that this rate study was derived from a renewal book that was lighter than usual based on the lower planned retention. The retention softness was influenced by deliberate underwriting actions impacting our U.S. property portfolio and our delegated authority operation Everest underwriting partners. If we exclude the work comp book, the rate change for the organization was plus 4.6% for the first quarter, with a steadily progressing level of rates being achieved across a number of lines each month. This is more than double the increase from the fourth quarter of 2017, where we experience a 2% increase on the same basis and as the highest aggregate price change we had experienced in ten quarters. This result was led by various lines of business, notably property and commercial auto. Let me spend a minute on the property book, as it is one area of the market experiencing a notable degree of transition. We currently underwrite property portfolios across the globe with a concentration in the U.S. market through both retail and wholesale channels. But in the U.S. market, we have now experienced six consecutive months of positive rate change in our property portfolio, ending the first quarter at plus 13% on a risk adjusted basis. As HIM exposed renewals come up in the second quarter, we expect continued pricing improvement of a similar magnitude. Overall, we do believe there is a need for further rate firming within the property market cat and non-cat alike and across other markets as well. Turning to other lines, commercial auto continues to see meaningful increases, again, in the low double-digit range across our various portfolios. We continued to see slightly positive rate moment for GL and excess lines, each registering positive rate changes in the quarter, we believe continue to rate adjustments are needed within these areas as we moved to 2018. Various professional lines continued to see some rate pressure, although this trend is moderating in the first quarter particularly in March. And work comp markets remain competitive with single-digit rate decreases being common. We continue to feel comfortable with the composition of our workers’ comp book and margin associated with it in our underwriting strategies going forward. We have been in this market for many years and will continued to take a cautious view in this or any area of the market should rate pressures continue. The bottom line for us is that we are focused on the need to achieve adequate technical pricing across our portfolio and are working diligently toward that objective everyday. In conclusion, the momentum we established in 2017 across our global specialty insurance operations has continued into 2018. Strong premium growth and solid profitability are being achieved alongside continued investments across our platform. We continue to thoughtfully invest to ensure we have the talents, capabilities and resources to profitably expand our franchise, while building increased resiliency across our business. We look forward to continuing our momentum and reporting back to you in next quarter. Now back to Beth for Q&A.
Beth Farrell: Yes, Travis, we are now open for questions.
Operator: Yes, ma’am. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Joshua Shanker, Deutsche Bank.
Joshua Shanker: Yes. Thank you very much. Post tax reform, I would have thought in my mind that this means that more reinsurance business we were in onshore in the United States. The way you’re stagnant reporting work, it’s seems that the greatest on growths in international and Bermuda. I’m wondering if there is a weakest than U.S. reinsurance. I’m wondering if there’s something to that, maybe you can disabuse me of some facts that they have that are incorrect or what not.
Craig Howie: Josh, this is Craig Howie. Technically the tax rate is based on the operating tax, based on geographic region and where that income is coming from. What we have done throughout this year and that includes by the way catastrophes and any reserve development as well. But what you saw in the first quarter and the reason for a lower tax rate is the fact that we had the catastrophe losses were emanating from the United States and the majority of those releases were coming from the other segments, including the Bermuda segment.
Joshua Shanker: Well and not so much on tax which is about where clients put their reinsurance business is more business can be written in the United States going forward just in general post tax reform. Or is that incorrect way of thinking about things.
John Doucette: Hi, Josh, this is John. I think it really – I don’t know if we can speak for other people, because I think part of it’s going to be a function of the capital. What the capital structures of different reinsurers are. But a couple of things, we have a fair bit of capital both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. and we’re going to continue to try to access the business in the most advantageous way that we see based on our underwriting expertise, based on our connection to brokers and clients and things like that. And that will – so it really is opportunity dependent as to where we’re going to write the business, whether it’s going to be in the U.S. reinsurance segment, the Bermuda reinsurance segment or the international segment
Joshua Shanker: Okay. And as we had into mid-year renewals compared to what you saw at the beginning of the year. What is the trend on International property and U.S. property, I guess, do we think that will be about the same. Do we think that that one-one deployment was the way to go? What’s sort of your thing on the year at this moment?
John Doucette: So as we talked about last quarter, I think it really depends on geographically, where the business is and what the loss impact was by the specific business. That would drive a lot of what the rate discussions are going forward. So no surprise areas that had been affected by the HIM losses or the California wildfires saw more rate increase at one-one. As we mentioned earlier in our script, when it came to April 1, which is a big Asia renewal particularly Japan, it was a lot closer to stable. And, but we did see rate increases in some of the Caribbean areas that did have the losses. So I think it does follow the loss events, in terms of where it’s going to go at the upcoming renewals, we think that would also hold directionally true that the areas that had more losses would have upward pressure on rates. And we’ll see what happens and we’re positioned to take advantage of it based on what the rating environment is and what products that we think is most attractive. And as we talked about and you saw in this quarter, sometimes that’ll be excess or loss sometimes that will be proportional, sometimes it’ll be reinsurance, sometimes it will be retro. And we try to really capture where we think we’re getting the best risk adjusted return, irrespective of the product. And so that results in some of the changes you saw in this quarter. But we are comfortable that, no matter where the rate changes and the rate pressures are or not. And trends will be able to capture that.
Craig Howie: And I’ll add to that, as I mentioned as well in our opening comments that there’s an improving trend in casualty as well. So increased opportunity there to meet our margin requirements.
Joshua Shanker: Thank you very and good luck for the rest of the year.
Craig Howie: Thank you, Josh.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kai Pan, Morgan Stanley.
Kai Pan: Thank you, and good morning. So I just wonder, could you break down the impact from both mix change as well as the retro – high retro cost. The deterioration of attritional combined ratio about 260 basis points year-over-year. Just wonder, what are the sort of onetime impact or this could be dragging on for the rest of the year.
John Doucette: The onetime impact from the change in the attritional.
Kai Pan: Yes.
John Doucette: Well I mean, as my colleague’s comment as well, but let me just first make the comment that the change in the attritional is largely due to mix of business. And influx of pro-rata business in the first quarter was driving at the attritional. But remember that overall that our premium will be coming in for the balance of the year and will served increase our overall margin. But even though the ratios might be going up, because of pro-rata business has a lot more premium on the books and therefore that will contribute to an increased underwriting margin. So we have to be careful about whether we’re talking about ratios or margin. So…
Kai Pan: Okay.
Dom Addesso: Wonder that John may have a comment here as well.
John Doucette: Yeah, Kai. just a little more color on that. We also – we alluded to it a couple of times, but if you recall in Q2 2017, we won – we issued what was called Kilimanjaro II catastrophe bond. So that was in from second quarter last year and it remains in effect now. It was not in Q1 2017 and that’s part of the elevated, because of that additional issuance of catastrophe bond back in the second quarter, but not in the first. That’s why that Q1-to-Q1 comparison reflects that.
Dom Addesso: And that’s about one full point in the quarter.
Kai Pan: So, the second thing in quarter year-over-year comparison will be one point easier?
John Doucette: It would be more comparative in the second quarter, because it was issued in April of last year.
Kai Pan: Okay. Got it.
John Doucette: In the second quarter of last year.
Kai Pan: Okay. So the point is that the revenue will grow faster, but the ratio, attritional commodity ratio would go higher, because of mix change, but the net, the dollar amounts margin, underwriting margin, expiry margin will be higher.
John Doucette: That’s our belief.
Kai Pan: Okay, great. And then can you talk about that the loss cost trend, especially in the cash utilized.
Dom Addesso: I’ll ask Jon Zaffino, because that’s heavily impacted in the insurance book. But of course, it’s a direct carry-over to reinsurance. So Jon, maybe you can highlight some of the trends we’re seeing.
Jon Zaffino: Sure, Dom. Thanks. Good morning, Kai. As of the usual sort of caveat, loss cost trends do vary widely from a line-to-line, from geography-to-geography, from program structure-to-program structure. And I’ll tell you in general, we see a relatively consistent picture over the prior few quarters. If we would aggregate our book based on premium weightings, the short, medium, long tail lines, I think we feel we’re in about that 3% range, 2.5% to 3% could be higher and it’d be lower in certain areas. For instance, commercial auto, we think is running above that. Some of the comp lines depend on geography territory; it could be a little bit below. But it’s been relatively what we expected and anticipated, we are certainly looking at various frequency and severity trends quarter-to-quarter each one of our various books of business studies that we conduct throughout the year and keeping an eye on that. So, as we expected at this point based on our – what we thought pricing would be based on where we reserve our books, it’s been kind of in line for our early expectations.
Dom Addesso: So, I think the way to summarize that would be really nothing in excess or out of bounds relative to what we see as general inflation across the entire economy.
Kai Pan: Okay, great. And last one if I may just on the industry consolidation, do you see any opportunities for Everest Re?
Dom Addesso: This comes up frequently, and I think I’ve mentioned many times, we look at probably all of the opportunities that are around in the marketplace, and generally a bit while there will potentially be opportunity certainly nothing that we can speak to today. but generally, we have included in all of these that relative because of – in part, because of the price of many of these properties. And probably more importantly, the integration challenges in particular and the expense challenge of integrating operations. We tilt towards an organic build. And I think we’ve demonstrated that we can do that successfully and organic build you end up knowing exactly what you’ve got and you can shape and mold the operation to your liking as opposed to having to tear something apart. So that’s our preference, but it doesn’t mean if something wouldn’t come along that would – that would fit strategically for us in an area that move not yet fully developed, so that’s how I think about it.
Kai Pan: It’s great. Thank you so much.
John Doucette: Just to add a little more color, outside of the M&A question, the fact that there is a lot of M&A, and activity and discussion, we think does present opportunities for us particularly on the reinsurance side. And as Dom alluded to in his opening comments, some of the consolidation results and some of that we’ve seen the large global buying more, and they want to buy from companies like Everest that have a strong balance sheet, and right P&C lines of business all over the world. And so their capacity demands are increasing and we’re seeing some of the large global insurers buying more and buying more in the casualty and professional lines. And so that was part of the reason why we had the growth that we had in Q1.
Kai Pan: Thank you, John.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from our Meyer Shields, KBW.
Meyer Shields: Thanks. good morning. I want to dig in a little bit to John Doucette’s comment on relevance. Am I oversimplifying if I interpret that as implying sort of a desire to more rapidly increase your casualty book in reinsurance?
Dom Addesso: In reinsurance or insurance?
Meyer Shields: In reinsurance.
John Doucette: So Meyer, I think it we – I don’t think it’s – I don’t think that’s, we don’t start with, we want to write more causality business. We start with where can we build the footprint that makes the most sense on a diversified global portfolio across as many lines of business, and make the best risk-adjusted portfolio we can. We are seeing opportunities in the causality space more than we had. We have been fairly negative on casualty and professional liability for the last several years and maybe a little bit ahead of the curve. And we think that was the right call, and we are now seeing more opportunities. So, it’s more a function of what we think the risk-adjusted pricing is. But the point of the relevance is that we have the ability, we have the underwriting expertise, we have the market expertise in local markets all around the globe. And we have the relationships with the brokers and clients to be able to deploy the capacity in any property and casualty line as we see, witness our clients need to buy. And we think that helps us along with the alternative capital that we can use to deploy in the property space. We think helps us be more and more relevant to our clients.
Dom Addesso: But it doesn’t necessarily suggest that we’re riding business at any cost. I mean, again, get back to whether it’s in the reinsurance of operation or the insurance operation, the heavy emphasis on cycle management and that applies line-by-line. At the same time, we are trying to achieve greater diversification too. So these are all things that I think have led to a more stable result for the group, and we’ll continue to do so.
Meyer Shields: Okay. I didn’t mean to just you were accepting on the price business, I just wanted to know whether strategically clients recognize that there’s maybe more underwriting expertise in Everest than premium volumes themselves would suggest?
Dom Addesso: Well, I think that’s absolutely the case, and even more importantly, that’s clearly the case in insurance, where the brand is being fully – more fully developed.
Meyer Shields: Okay, that’s helpful. And second question if I can, just looking at the comments on larger global insurers looking for more reinsurance, are they a tougher customer to deal with maybe because of an additional specification?
John Doucette: This is John; I think you know there’s pluses and minuses with every type of client that we trade with. They have they bring stability, they bring diversity, they bring again, to our point of trying to have a diverse portfolio they are buying from us in Latin America, in Asia, in Europe and obviously in North America and Bermuda and London. And so it allows us to across that relationship have a more stable relationship. But again, there’s – some of them are more or less reinsurance dependent than if you go to the other end of the spectrum of much, much smaller clients that are very reinsurance dependent given their capital structure and their writings. So there’s pluses and minuses of all types of clients that we trade with.
Dom Addesso: Meyer, this is really – I don’t believe it’s a negative to have a sophisticated trading partner. In fact, I think it would be quite a positive, because they are more easily recognized the strength and the value that Everest can bring to the transaction. So I view it as a positive and as John was really highlighting, I think we find that having those broader and larger relationships tends to overtime; we tend to have a more stable margin. in any one area, you might be tilted the sideways a bit, but across the entire account, you tend to have greater stability.
Meyer Shields: Okay, that’s very helpful. Thank you so much.
Dom Addesso: Thanks, Meyer.
Operator: Our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan, Wells Fargo.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi, good morning. A couple of questions. my first question in terms of premium growth, I guess this is tied specifically to reinsurance, do you see – you guys being able to maintain the same growth level that we saw in the first quarter. As you think about these new opportunities that you’re seeing for the balance of the year. And then also if we could just get the color from most of your segments, you really highlighted where you’re growing geographically. a little bit more color by line and how much more crop and even credit mortgage business is within the growth that we saw in the first quarter?
John Doucette: Good morning, Elyse. It’s John. So in terms of the growth, I mean, so a part of the growth is kind of a two-pronged issue. We rode business including proportional business at one-one and we rode more, and we would see that earn-in over the next several quarters. So we will see some growth tied to that, in terms of whether we see new business that incept when we put on the books. in future quarters, we think so, we don’t know if it’s going to be at the same rate that we’ve seen so far. it’s a lot harder for us to predict that, but there is the embedded growth that we’ve had from the business we’ve already put on the books. We do think that we have been expanding our opportunity set for example, developing political risk and trade credit in our Zurich operation; it’s just one of the many examples around the group that we’ve been doing to try to build out our opportunities that expand that. and therefore that gives the opportunity to grow more. you mentioned crop. crop was fairly flat. So their growth isn’t really coming there. We are seeing more both in the U.S., Bermuda and in our Bermuda operation in London, we are seeing more casualty professional and some whole account opportunities, and we continue as we’ve said on the last several quarters. We are writing the mortgage business that’s up a little bit or close to flat, but we do continue to see new opportunities in the mortgage space and I think we’ll be able to deploy capacity on an attractive risk adjusted basis there, and as you may recall, a lot of the mortgage deals that are done with the GSEs or multi-year deals. So, we have effectively IBNR premium coming in over the next many years for deals that we’ve already put on the books.
Elyse Greenspan: How much mortgage businesses within the Reinsurance segment today?
John Doucette: We have a run rate of about a $150 million to $175 million give-or-take that shows the new business origination.
Elyse Greenspan: And that’s an annual number?
John Doucette: Yeah.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. And then in terms of – you guys didn’t see any reserve development quarterly from the cat. Was there any movements or was just kind of net neutral within all the segments in the quarter?
Dom Addesso: Elyse, we – as you know, we do our reserve studies that the bulk of our reserve studies in the latter part of the year in the fourth quarter. But of the other metrics that we use to develop to evaluate reserves along the way are at each quarter-end. Something we call actual versus expected were all trending favorable. But it’s a consequence we don’t – and we don’t make reserve adjustments based on those metrics. We wait for the reserves that’s quite – but the trends, the metrics that we use are all favorable.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay, great. And then one last question in terms of the primary insurance business, Don, when you – in your initial remarks, you said that the expense ratio and loss ratio would improve as the year progresses. I guess is the goal, should we think about modeling for the back three quarters that you guys will be in kind of that low 90s overall underlying margin within the primary insurance business.
Dom Addesso: We have said in last quarter’s call, low-to-mid 90s is kind of what our target is. It’s a little difficult to give you a precise number, but it would certainly be an improvement over – a measurable improvement over the last year.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Dom Addesso: Thank you, Elyse. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We have no further questions in the queue.
Dom Addesso: All right. let me thank you very much. Let me conclude with just a few thoughts. We’re up to a great start for the year. The changing mix, which we’ve talked about already will certainly impact being the attritional ratios, will in fact produce an overall increase to the total dollar margin as the year develops. We fully expect as you’ve heard from my colleagues rates to be improving both property and the casualty areas in certainly sufficient quantity and difficult, class of the business, who will allow us to increase our overall returns here and again, we are confident about our ROEs. Finally, if you just give me one second, I’d like to close with a tribute to our colleague Beth Farrell, who is retiring in early May after 15 plus years with Everest. I know she has been a valuable resource to those on the call. I certainly appreciate the support she is giving me. We will miss her, but wish her and her husband a full and enjoyable retirement. Thank you so much, Beth.
Beth Farrell: Thank you.
Dom Addesso: And again, thank you all for your interest this morning and look forward to our future discussions over the weeks ahead. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today’s teleconference. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day everyone. Welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Call of Everest Re Group. Today's conference is being recorded. And at this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Beth Farrell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Elizabeth Farrell: Thank you, Derrick. Good morning and welcome to Everest Re Group's fourth quarter and full-year 2017 earnings conference call. On the call with me today are Dom Addesso, the company's President and Chief Executive Officer; Craig Howie, Chief Financial Officer; John Doucette, President and CEO of Reinsurance Operations; and Jon Zaffino, President and CEO of the Insurance Operations. Before we begin, I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I note that statements made during today's call, which are forward-looking in nature, such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations and the like, are subject to various risks. As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations. Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements. Now, let me turn the call over to Dom.
Dom Addesso: Thanks, Beth. Good morning, and welcome to the meeting this morning. We are pleased that we’re able to report to you today an excellent fourth quarter result. This of course comes during the year that experienced a record level of catastrophe losses for the industry. It is noteworthy that despite this level of losses, we were able to report a profit for the full year and an ROE of 6% on the strength of the fourth quarter. This level of performance for the year demonstrates the ability of our platform to sustain periodic events and yet maintain an above average industry return through the cycle. Our value proposition and risk management has positioned us to succeed. No doubt there'll be questions today and beyond about rates, competition, return of capital, and acquisitions. And while we've readily admit these are certainly the issues of the day, our value proposition is such we continue to build diversification and scale that allows us take advantage of market dynamics. If you've heard from us in the past and will continue to hear from my colleagues today is the success we're having in achieving profitable growth, both the new products and existing ones. We reached a record revenue with over $7 billion in total gross premium written for 2017. In 2017, our reinsurance portfolio grew 20% with much of that growth in lines other than U.S. property cap. Crop, casualty, non U.S. property, mortgage and other credit related business, all exhibited meaningful growth during the year. The U.S. cap business grew in part due to reinstatement premiums and back up coverage, and true growth is offset by sessions to cat bonds and Mt. Logan. Therefore, there was no material change to speak of in our PML exposure relative to cap. All this points to a reinsurance portfolio that is becoming more diversified each and every year, thereby providing earnings resiliency with an attritional combined ratio of 81%, which was stable year-over-year. Further in this diversification is the continued growth in our insurance business to over $2 billion or 15% for the year and 32% for the year adjusting for the sale of our crop company. More important than the growth was the continuing improvement in our attritional combined ratio as we expected. And due to legacy issue coming under control, we have reserve releases come through in the fourth quarter. Those profit and growth trends are quite encouraging and ones that we expect will continue. Tribute to a great that has executed and capitalized on the brand, scope, scale and financial strength of the franchise. Another contributor to results for the year was our growth and investment income of 15%. Certainly, asset growth is a factor but the larger contribution came from the asset allocation decisions made during the year without meaningfully changing our duration or risk profile. Combination of strong investment results coupled with our underlying results on an after tax basis resulted in $375 million of operating profit, which given the weather events during the year we believe is an outstanding result. Book value per share rose by 4%, reflecting in part the return of capital to our shareholders both through dividends and share repurchases. So as we end the year and move into 2018, I do so with optimism. Our talent, execution and platform have never been better. We have a culture to take on new opportunities and be nimble, which is what the current market dynamics dictate we must have. Our risk appetite is continually evolving based on where the best risk adjusted returns are. Pricing and property lines both in reinsurance and insurance are moving in the right direction. At 1/1, a heavy reinsurance renewal date PMLs in the U.S. reinsurance book in particular are down year-over-year but the absolute margins are up. We expect that to continue. Capital markets are still a factor and likely to continue to grow. However, we do not expect this development to crab us out as opportunities for greater economic growth, privatization of public risk and continued movement towards closing the gap between economic and insured losses with all leads to the needs for greater capacity. Equally encouraging is the casualty space, which has been soft for some time, but is now firming to varying degrees in most lines. This will benefit both our reinsurance and insurance operations. And while the standard lines will benefit from RE, there will also be real growth as more offerings have greater appeal with expanded margins. Furthermore, the insurance team has been the greater upside as we continue to scale our platform. And on the reinsurance side, we will continue to expand our newer product offerings, which will further diversify our portfolio. These are all factors which we feel will contribute to growing success into 2018 and beyond. Now, I will turn it over to my colleagues for further details about our results and our journey. Thank you. And first to Craig for the financial report.
Craig Howie: Thank you, Dom and good morning everyone. Everest had net income of $571 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 with the strong underline performance, aided by reserve releases that impacted both current and prior years. This compares to net income of $374 million dollars for the fourth quarter of 2016. Net income for the year was $469 million compared to $996 million in 2016. After tax operating income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $556 million compared to $363 million in 2016. Operating loss excludes realized capital gains and losses and the tax charge related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. For the year, operating income was $375 million compared to $993 million in 2016. The primary difference was higher catastrophe losses in 2017. In the fourth quarter, Everest saw $184 million of gross current year catastrophe losses related to the California wildfire. Net of reinsurance, the current quarter catastrophe losses amounted to $162 million. We lowered our pretax estimates for the third quarter of 2017 catastrophe events by about $100 million. This was primarily related to reductions for the earthquake in Mexico and the third quarter Hurricane. The fourth quarter of 2017 also included $30 million of favorable development on prior year cap losses, largely from the 2016 year. Therefore, net catastrophe losses for the quarter were $29 million. On a year-to-date basis, the results reflected net pre-tax catastrophe losses of $1.5 billion in 2017 compared to $301 million in 2016. Excluding the catastrophe events, reinstatement premiums and prior period reserve development, the underlying book continues to perform well with an overall current year attritional combined ratio of 85% for the year, down from 85.5% last year. On reserves, we completed our annual loss reserve study. The results of the studies indicated that overall reserves remained adequate. In the fourth quarter, we booked $262 million of favorable prior year reserve development. This included favorable prior period development for both the insurance segment and the reinsurance segment. The insurance segment reported $65 million of favorable prior year reserve development during the quarter, which was largely related to its workers’ compensation business. The reinsurance segments reported $197 million of favorable prior year development, reflecting $234 million of favorable development, partially offset by a $37 million increase in the asbestos reserves to replenish our position at the beginning of the year. The $234 million of reinsurance favorable development during the quarter related to casualty and property business, both in the United States and internationally. These redundancies have developed over time, but we don't react until the position becomes more mature. We continue to hold our loss reserve estimates for the more recent years. For investments, pre-tax investment income was $149 million for the quarter and $543 million for the year on our $18.6 billion investment portfolio. Investment income for the year was up 15% from one year ago. The result was primarily driven by the increase in limited partnership income, which was up $45 million over 2016. We've been able to maintain investment yield without a dramatic shift in the overall investment portfolio. However, we have gradually shifted allocations within our alternative investment bucket by reducing exposure for high yield debt and public equity, while committing more towards limited partnership investments. The pretax yield on the overall portfolio was 3.1% and duration remained at just over three years. Other income and expense included $25 million of foreign exchange losses for the 2017 year compared to $21 million of foreign exchange losses in 2016. Other income and expense also included $7 million loss from Mt. Logan Re for the year 2017 compared to $11 million of earnings and fees in 2016. The decline essentially represents the higher level of catastrophe losses in 2017. On income taxes, the tax benefit was the result of the amount and the geographic region of the losses associated with the catastrophes this year, and the income associated with the loss reserve releases in the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter of 2017 included a tax charge of $8 million related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. This tax charge primarily related to the change in the corporate tax rate acquired for the company's net deferred tax assets. Shareholders' equity for the group was $8.4 billion at the end of 2017, up $294 million or 3.6% over year end 2016. This is after taking into account capital return through $50 million of share buybacks and $207 million of dividends paid in 2017. The company announced a 4% increase to its regular quarterly dividend and paid $1.30 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017. Our strong capital balance leaves us well positioned for business opportunities. Thank you. And now, John Doucette, will provide a review of the reinsurance operations.
John Doucette: Thank you, Craig. Good morning. Our operating team is following the 2017 catastrophes and the January 1st renewals are resilient, adaptability and partnership. Resilience is valued by our investors and is expected by our clients who depend on our financial security, and they rely on our evergreen promise-to-pay claims, especially in times of need. Everest has faithfully kept its promise for the last 45 years, through years with extreme industry losses such as 2017. Both sides of our balance sheet are built to withstand shock losses whether from actual 2017 cat events or worse hypothetical losses had Hurricane Irma directly hit Miami as a cat five. Supporting our strong conservative capital position on balance sheet, many levels of hedges protect our capital and our promise to our clients. This includes $2.8 billion of unexhausted catastrophe bonds and over $1 billion deployed in Mt. Logan, further protecting us from even more extreme events than seen in 2017. Following several major catastrophes in Q3, we are pleased with the strong profitability generated by our reinsurance book in the fourth quarter, and the overall results for 2017. In Q4, reinsurance generated $419 million of underwriting profit; $197 million from favorable prior year development offset by $33 million in net catastrophe losses this quarter. For Q4, California wildfire losses were $156 million, offset by releases on prior period catastrophes, including Q3 caps. For 2017, reinsurance withstood $1.3 billion of pre-tax net catastrophe losses. Our 2017 combined ratio was 103%, including 29 points of cat losses, highlighting our robust underwriting strategy, broadly diversified portfolio and strong risk management. Excluding cats, reinstatement premiums and favorable prior year development, our attritional combined ratio remained flat at 81%. Globally, Q4 gross written premium increased 21% from backup covers and new capital relief quota shares and some multiline deals. For 2017, reinsurance premium was up 20% to $5.1 billion with increased writings in property, crop, financial line and mortgage. Now, for some color on 2017 by segment. In our U.S. reinsurance segment, 2017 premium was up 22% to $2.6 billion from increased property writings, reinstatement premiums, back-up covers, increases in property quota shares crop and mortgage. This segment produced $30 million in underwriting profit for 2017 despite $700 million of catastrophe losses. The 2017 combined ratio was up 22 points, driven by the cats while the attritional combined ratio was relatively flat at 78.1%. For our international segment, 2017 premium was $1.3 billion, up 7% with growth in several regions, but only up 5% on a constant dollar basis. For 2017, cat losses were about $450 million, resulting in an underwriting loss. However, the attritional combined ratio was down about 2 points due to a lower commission ratio and higher property excessive loss writings. In our Bermuda segment, 2017 premium was $1.2 billion, up 35% with growth from new structured multiline reinsurance and increased financial lines deals. The 2017 combined ratio increased by 11 points to 98.5% from higher cats but the attritional combined ratio increased modestly to 89.5%. As with any major disruption, opportunity follows for those well positioned for post loss execution, and that was true for us this renewal. During this pivotal 1/1 renewal season, there were several disruptive contravening forces; one, large losses that impacted earnings or capital of clients, reinsurers and non-traditional participants; two, a new market sensitivity to risk, impacting managements and boards of both buyers’ and sellers’ views on pricing, accumulations, tail exposure and ERM; three, significant amounts of trapped capital and reloading of some of that alternative capital; four, across all lines of business, large clients, reevaluation of their ceded reinsurance strategies and in several cases, increased renewal sessions or placement of new treaties across several lines; and five, governments and other economic risk holders de-risking and bringing new exposures to the reinsurance market. With all of these market forces, 1/1 was complex as the market tried to decide what it was and what it wanted to be; a purely capital markets transactional marketplace with staggering velocity of capital formation or a market of longstanding reinsurance relationships between buyers and sellers that understand each other; valued continuity of trading relationships and agreed at rates need to go up after a loss. In the end, it was somewhere in between. Although, the market rebound was less pronounced than in past truly hard markets, many clients realized after several years of rate decreases and meaningful industry losses, rates must increase. While the rate movement overall was less than originally expected, we are pleased with the ultimate outcome of our 1/1 portfolio. At January 1st, our underwriting discipline and market leadership manifested in improved risk adjusted returns, significantly above the market average. We re-underwrote several accounts, achieved rates in loss affected areas and in most lines around the globe, increased shares on deals and layers we liked. And also wrote several new opportunities with our core clients. Short tail business, retro and loss effective property cat treaties achieved increases well into the double-digits. But we also re-under wrote portions of our property book and declines many deals with unacceptable economic terms, then reallocated that property capacity to core clients and better opportunities around the globe. The casualty market, which was a bright spot in this renewal, showed some stabilization and improvement. Ceding commissions decreased a few points and excess loss rates had mid-single digit improvements with differentiation between better and worst performing books. We capitalized on our franchise and long-standing client and broker relationships. We wrote a number of deals with better than market terms. And other times, we were one of only three or four reinsurers approached to solve the client's needs. These highlight our superior access to business and reinsurance opportunities, particularly global clients seek meeting global reinsurers, such as Everest, for solutions across all lines of business. And as a result, we were able to meaningfully expand our relationships with them, a trend we expect to continue throughout 2018. Our empowered underwriters excel as nimble, creative reinsurance experts in their local markets, listening to and understanding their clients' needs. Our clients and brokers benefit from the direct interaction with the decision makers in our decentralized model to access risk. This is done while adhering to a consistent global view of risk across all underwriters within every Everest division, including insurance and Lloyd’s. In the end, our 1/1 renewal was successful. Our premium is up by several hundred million dollars, this January 1st compared to last January 1st. And our combined ratios are lower and our expected profits are higher in 2018. The reloading of some alternative capital, in addition to competition from traditional players, had a muting impact on January 1st renewals, highlighting that alternative capital has become and enduring reality. While this threatened some traditional business models, Everest is successfully addressing these challenges by utilizing alternative capital to leverage opportunity, best match capital to risk and ultimately benefit Everest shareholders. Recognizing the market evolution between historical reinsurance trading relationships and new capital markets innovation, Everest strategic repositioning has been well under way for several years. We continue to further develop our robust risk and capital management infrastructure while adapting our strategies to capitalize on market changes. With our relevance as the leading global reinsurer, strong portfolio diversification across property and casualty lines around the globe, best-in-class expense ratio, industry leading earnings power and approximately $13 billion of capital resources through equity, traditional debt, Mt. Logan, cat bonds and other hedges, we have a competitive advantage in this dynamic market. In summary, as a resilient, adaptable reinsurer focused on delivering client solutions and building long term partnerships, utilizing efficient capital structures, we remain ideally positioned to successfully navigate the waters of this ever changing market into the future, and look forward to a strong 2018. Thank you. And now I will turn it over to Jon Zaffino to review our insurance operations.
Jon Zaffino: Thank you, John and good morning. Our global insurance operations finished 2017 on a strong note, in terms of growth and more importantly, profitability in the fourth quarter. As shared in prior calls, we have been consistently executing on a multifaceted strategic plan, encompassing every dimension of our global insurance organization. As measured by our key performance metrics, we have made considerable progress and are pleased with our expanded operating platform and the growing depth and diversity of our associated books of specialty business. 2017 concluded with record levels of gross written premium, the deepest roster of actively underwritten specialty products in our history, 150 and counting, the broadest geographic reach, 17 offices across the U.S., Canada, and Europe for us to execute our business from, and the highest number of insurance teammates across disciplines who are making all this happen. This quarter's 36% growth and 80% combined ratio are further testament to the corrective underwriting actions successfully executed upon over the past several years and our conservative reserving position across the portfolio. At $2.1 billion and 2017 gross written premium, Everest Insurance is maturing as the global specialty underwriting platform we had envisioned at the onset. And it's firmly positioned within the top 10 of the global lead table for specialty insurance carriers. We remain encouraged about our growing opportunity set globally and look forward to the many opportunities ahead of us in 2018. Turning to the financial results. The global insurance operations produced a record $575 million in gross written premium in the fourth quarter of 2017. This is an increase of $153 million or 36% over fourth quarter 2016. The fourth quarter growth profile is generally consistent with our experience over the last several quarters as the addition of dozens of new products and the many talented underwriters managing their thoughtful growth continue to make their impact. As mentioned, year-to-date we achieved $2.1 billion in gross written premium, again another record performance. This represents growth of $272 million or 15% over 2016. A significant percentage of this growth is emanating from new businesses and products incepted over the past three years, inclusive of our increasingly relevant Lloyd’s operation, which eclipsed $100 million in gross written premium in 2017. Each of these products chosen for particular risk return characteristics is playing an increasingly important role in our diversified portfolio. Our net written premiums in the quarter are $451 million and $1.6 billion for 2017, which represent increases of 33% and 18% respectively over the prior year period. Net earned premium in the quarter increased by $73 million or 22% to $398 million. For the year-to-date period, net earned premium of $1.5 billion increased by $170 million or 13% over 2016. Each of these are record highs for the insurance operations and provide a solid foundation for growth into 2018. The GAAP combined ratio for the quarter was 80.4%, benefited from 16 points of favorable prior year development, which I will discuss later on in my remarks. For the full year, the GAAP combined ratio was 104.8, which included 12 points or just over a $170 million of previously disclosed cat losses across our global portfolio emanating mainly from the hurricane activity in the third quarter along with the minor contribution from the California wildfires in the fourth quarter. The attritional combined ratio in the fourth quarter improved to 97.8% from the 99.9% experienced in the fourth quarter of 2016, a 2.1 improvement. Year-to-date, the attritional combined also improved 2.4 points from 99.3% in 2016 and 96.9% in 2017. The attritional combined ratio continues to improve as a result of the many underwriting initiatives instituted in recent years. While improving year-over-year, we anticipate an additional level of improvement around 2 points or so over 2018 as the impact of non-renewed businesses continues to lessen. Turning to the attritional loss and loss expense ratio for the fourth quarter. The global insurance operations produced 67.1%, which has slightly improved from the 67.5% experienced in the fourth quarter of 2016. This quarter's results also improved by nearly a point from the third quarter attritional of 68.4%. Year-to-date, the attritional loss and loss expense ratio also improved nearly 3 points to 67% from 69.7% in 2016. This despite nearly 1.4 points of impact from non-cat related convective storm activity experienced in the year. So again, we continue to see the steady and continued downward drift in the attritional loss ratio as a result of the strategic underwriting actions implemented over the past three years, improved mix of business and benefits from increased scale of our new business launches. As the impact of now divested businesses increases, such as Hartland, we further expect to realize benefit of our newer portfolio. Looking at the expenses, the fourth quarter expense ratio came in at 30.7%, nearly a 2 point improvement in the prior year fourth quarter of 32.4%. For the year-to-date period, the expense ratio was 29.9%, essentially flat with the 29.6% for 2016. And expense ratio of roughly 30% remains very competitive in the specialty insurance segment. With respect to the favorable reserve development, the conclusion of our customary fourth quarter reserve reviews resulted in fourth quarter releases totaling approximately $65 million from accident years 2013 and prior. Our workers compensation book predominantly concentrated in California contributed materially to this as it has been developing favorably for some time. On a year-to-date basis, favorable prior period development equates to $56 million. We remain confident in our overall reserve position across the insurance portfolio, particularly in light of reserve actions taken over the last several years. Turning to the operating environment. Overall, rate trends experienced from the first three quarters gained some momentum in the fourth quarter, particularly in the property line. Excluding our workers’ compensation and accident and health portfolios, overall rate change for the North American P&C insurance operations where the overwhelming majority of our renewal book resides, ended 2017 at plus 1%. While only slightly positive, it is the first time in several years that we have experienced position aggregate rates in the non-workers’ compensation lines of business. Inclusive of the workers’ compensation portfolio, the overall rate change turned slightly negative to minus 3%, indicating the continued mid single-digit rate pressure across the work comp line. This outcome was fully anticipated and factored into our pricing and reserving decisions for the year. Further, we have experienced a material improvement in our property portfolio in the third and fourth quarters where rates moved from essentially flat to plus 3% and plus 8% in 3Q and 4Q respectively. As many of you know, the heavier cat exposed wholesale books of business and meaningful part of our property book renew in the first and second quarter of 2018 thus we have yet to see the rate influence from these renewals. Additionally, the commercial auto segment of our portfolio continues to receive corrective rate actions, a trend that's now persisted for several quarters. Overall, we achieved meaningful positive rate across this book in 2017, delivering plus 12%. As with the general liability markets, primary and excess, we also achieved positive rate in fourth quarter. Although, roughly flat for the year, there're signs that this market continue to stabilize and positive rate movement is expected. Overall, across our portfolio, we anticipate moderately improved operating condition throughout 2018 with some pockets lagging this broader trend as they are in need of further corrective rate action. We will continue to focus our efforts and resources on those areas and lines of business that presented with appropriate risk adjusted returns. In conclusion, we are pleased and encouraged by our 2017 results. Despite a difficult cat year, the progress we have made organically build a top 10 global specialty insurer is encouraging deeply motivating to our colleagues. Our enforced book of business has meaningfully improved on an underlying basis and we anticipate increased resilience in our portfolio as our growth and diversification strategies continue building traction. Our platform and growing range of capabilities are well positioned for future growth. The Everest insurance brand is strong and we look forward to updating you on our progress in future calls. Now, back to Beth for Q&A.
Elizabeth Farrell: Thanks, Jon. Derrick, we are now open for questions.
Operator: Thank you [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Elyse Greenspan: My first question in terms of the PML disclosure, at the top of the call, you guys mentioned that your PMLs went down in U.S. reinsurance. Is this after reinstatement and taxes? I know you guys disclosed to PML figures?
Craig Howie: Elyse this is Craig. Yes, that would be the same basis that we typically disclosed our PMLs on a net economic basis, so it would be after reinstatement and after taxes. We do expect them to stay in relation to our overall capital. We expect them to stay relatively flat or even slightly down.
Elyse Greenspan: So then as we're thinking about the impact of tax reform and what that could have had done to your PML, to keep your net PMLs, to get your net PMLs to go down. Was there more retro that you were purchasing if you can just talk to I guess how you changed on your PMLs following on tax reform?
Craig Howie: After tax reform, as you know, the tax rate will go down. So the tax benefit for some of the longer bill depends on the return period. So the longer return periods will get less tax benefit, but we can cover that with other types of reinsurance purchases and lower catastrophe loss.
Dom Addesso: And also, Elyse, what we said was that our PML relative to capital about stable, so we were suggesting that the PML would go down necessarily, which is relative to capital it would be about similar position.
Elyse Greenspan: And then sticking with taxes for a second. How should we think about your tax rate as we think about modeling in 2018?
Dom Addesso: So overall with the tax rate coming down in the United States, as you know, we do business globally around the world in many different jurisdictions. But with the tax rate coming down in the U.S., we expect our overall tax rate to come down about a couple of points.
Elyse Greenspan: And then as we think about your outlook for the market for the balance of the year, you guys obviously reloaded Logan, your own alternative capital vehicle to a level well in excess of where it’s at last year, so more than covering of the losses. How do you view the impact I guess, so it's a two part question of both alternative capital as well as we see more of the insured losses for the third quarter events come down. How do you think that that can have an impact on the market as we think to the June and July renewals?
Dom Addesso: I still think that we feel the market was trending up in the property space, particularly those areas that have been loss affected. And we’re not anticipating perhaps the alternative capital of having some impact on wild swings in rates but generally markets are seeking some level of rate increase in those loss effective areas, and frankly they deserve it. So we do not expect the reloading of alternative capital if it is even reloaded entirely to impact or to have a rate decrease effect.
Elyse Greenspan: And then one last question, you mentioned I believe that some multiyear coverage written in the fourth quarter. How bigger or multiyear coverage in proportion to your reinsurance book?
John Doucette: That's one of the things we did net incrementally accounted for some of the premium, I mean across the entire $5 billion on premium, it's not that material. It does -- it's in different classes of business, credit, mortgage and different lines of business, there is a couple of property deals. But overall, it's not a very meaningful part of our book.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley.
Kai Pan: First question just follow-up on the January renewal, John mentioned that you guys had improved your risk adjusted returns above the market. Could you quantify that just in terms of how much do you see the market increase versus yours? And how the market would -- dynamics would play out at New Year renewals, is that -- would that rate increase sustain or improve in the coming renewals?
John Doucette: So there's a lot of moving parts. And I don't know that we know exactly what happened with the market. There's a lot of deals that are done in the market that we declined, and we don't know what the ultimate price that they were done at. And I think that's one of the ways that we get better than market results is that we maintain our underwriting discipline on deals that we don't agree with the absolute rate or don't agree with the rate increase or flat or decrease given the loss positions or the overall market condition. So it's hard for us to quantify that, but we are comfortable that we are building a better overall portfolio that exists in the market given our ratings, our global footprint, our very broad diversified portfolio, frankly our fantastic underwriters around the globe. And I think that just helps us. And as I mentioned, it helps us build relationships as we continue, we are and continue to be relevant to many of our trading partners. And one of the interesting things this January 1st is we saw across a whole lot of operations, our Bermuda, our London, Zurich, Canada, Miami, U.S., we saw many clients increasing their participation with us and that's across a lot of different lines of business. So that's probably the most -- one of the most optimistic things we saw is just the increase in demand for reinsurance, particularly with Everest. So we're very pleased with that. Again, Dom alluded to the mid-year renewals we don't know what it's going to be. We think given the rate decreases that have happened and the losses, there should be upward pressure on rates, but we don't forecast what we think it'll be. We are confident that we'll be able to execute irrespective of what the market conditions are.
Kai Pan: My second question -- If you look at your fourth quarter, especially insurance segment, that's the first meaningful release in more than a decade. So just wonder if you can give a more detail regarding to how much of that -- how much the legacy book developed, what accident year those workers’ comp release has been. And going forward, given you guys since 2010 has instituted more conservative reserve for last year. Will we see more reserve releases in the coming years?
Dom Addesso: I'm going to let Craig get to the specifics for that. But first let me say that you're correct and that we haven't had an overall net reserve release in insurance for quite some time. But let me highlight the fact that it has been due to our legacy portfolio and we have had net reserve releases in varying lines of business in the insurance book, it’s just that on the net basis, they haven't come through because they’ve been overwhelmed with the legacy issues, which we now feel we have control of it. I'll let Craig get into some of the more specifics about your question.
Craig Howie: It's a good comment, and Dom's comment is correct as well. We didn't see any drag from the prior year run off business in the insurance segment this year. So what you're seeing is the actual results come through on a net basis, you're seeing favorable development. Primarily from as John Zaffino mentioned, it's from 2013 and prior and mostly in the workers’ compensation area but some other small lines as well. So that's the major difference year-over-year, but our process hasn’t change that conservative process that you mentioned since even as early as 2010, remains in effect and we continue to go through that same process each year. We take our time to react to that favorable development and we don’t release those redundancies until they've developed overtime and become more mature.
Kai Pan: Last one if I may on the tax rate. You said it will be a reduction about a couple of points. What are the starting points? And are you guys going to change your ceding program, which currently is sitting about 40% of U.S. premiums to offshore affiliates?
Craig Howie: So the answer to that, first of all, is the starting point was our 2016 tax rate was about 10% that was last year. This year as you know, we had a tax benefit for the overall year, so that the actual exposure that we had after the catastrophe losses for the year. But we do expect it to be in the high-single digit going forward, that's number one. And your question about what are we doing going forward. We will be cancelling or have canceled our quota share already, because it is not economical for us to do that, going forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jay Gelb with Barclays.
Jay Gelb: First, just want to note that I think that tax rate is lot better than people thought it was going to be. Second on outbound reinsurance and retrocessional protection in 2018. How should we be thinking about Everest strategy on that?
John Doucette: So I think we buy traditional reinsurance, we buy have looked at retro from time-to-time, we cede business to Logan, we have the cat bonds, and probably use, et cetera and we continue to look at different capital structures traditional or non-traditional that we’re going to do. I think probably the way I would think about it is look at the metric gross ratios both for insurance and reinsurance over the last couple of years. And those should stay reasonably consistent. We're still in the process as Craig said with the change in the internal quota share. We're still in the process of thinking of PML management, risk management, capital management. And we haven't yet decided on everything we have some ideas. So that may result in the tail we do additional sessions but across the whole portfolio, that won't be that larger percentage. So I think the net to gross ratios that exist today are probably pretty good.
Dom Addesso: And part of the answer to that Jay is also that it's a little difficult to give you absolute numbers on that, because it somewhat depends on what we see coming in front door, so if our property business is down or that one strategy if it’s up that might be an entirely different strategy. What we are anticipating though is that our expected capital were go forward into 2018 would be just under 9%, which was about a point drop from where traditional is at.
Jay Gelb: Final question is on the merger and acquisition environment and opportunities. So in light of AIG's announced acquisition of Validus all-cash for what can be viewed as a pretty attractive multiple. Does that have any influence on Everest’s thinking in terms of acquisitions going forward or consolidation within the reinsurance market?
Dom Addesso: None whatsoever. In fact, I am not sure that we would -- maybe even detract a little bit more from an acquisitions team to the extent that that's the go forward multiple we think that an organic build is a lot more efficient for us. And I think we've demonstrated both on the reinsurance and the insurance side that we've been successful in that strategy.
Operator: Our next question comes from Josh Shanker of Deutsche Bank.
Josh Shanker: I just want to add a little bit on Kai's question about the timing on the reserve releases. Dom, you're I think up to almost nine years at the firm. When you came in nine years ago, what did the reserve situation look like? And in terms of your priorities, is there a different timeline on getting the different departments in order or are both the reinsurance and insurance reserving techniques the same and on the same track?
Dom Addesso: Well, Josh you have a good memory as to timeline. But when I first came in I think what I said at the time is that I thought we had an adequate reserve position. And I think that’s demonstrated to be accurate. I think if you look through the history at the various accident years, we have developed favorably, so that's number one. Some years develop more favorably than others, but all different. What did change and I did institute some reserving changes when I first came in just the way we established the current accident year number, and that I think frankly through time has proven to be perhaps a bit more conservative than it may have been prior to that. But nevertheless, reserves have developed favorably. And I think it's what we've been able to harvest over the last couple of years, probably is somewhat reflective of a slightly more conservative philosophy than we had in the past. But notwithstanding that again history would prove that our reserves have developed favorably at various accident years.
John Doucette: And the second part of that question Josh was the process and the process did the same for both reinsurance and insurance.
Josh Shanker: And then in usual with your peers you brought back stock in the fourth quarter. You obviously have a lower debt to capital ratio than everyone else does. Depending on how you view the stock. Why was it the right time, why not buy more, the decision in terms of how much capital you need to raise new business? What's the trade-off between debt financing share repurchase at this point? Can you talk about all the nuts and bolts behind that decision?
Dom Addesso: Well first of all, I think that we felt the stock was an enormous value at the time we bought it in. The amount that we bought in was somewhat contained because of how close it was to coming up with numbers as opposed to why it was 50 as opposed to something more. We have to be mindful of the fact that we’re getting closer to the year-end. And relative to our capital position, we were comfortable with where the third quarter events what that meant to our total financial position. So we weren’t particularly concerned about our capital position. And relative to debt-to-equity, what we stated in the past is that we'd like to keep that number conservative because it's a contingency reserve if you will to the extent that we saw an opportunity either despite my preference for organic build. If we did see an acquisition that made some sense that gave us some flexibility and/or if we saw some tremendous market opportunity again it gave us flexibility. So we tend to view the debt capacity as one that's gives us flexibility as opposed to leveraging that made up to the max.
Operator: Our next question comes from Meyer Shields of KBW.
Meyer Shields: I'm trying to put together a couple of data points. One is the fact that most companies and I think Everest as well has talked about the third quarter catastrophes being in line with modeled expectations instead of having any major surprises. And the second is that we're seeing bigger rate increases on loss affected accounts. Is that a fair observation and is that a rational response or is there -- I'm asking whether there’s an opportunity in there?
Dom Addesso: Is what rational response, that there is rate increases on loss affected….
Meyer Shields: Bigger rate increases on loss impacted accounts if that was more luck than a reflection of lower underwriting profitability?
Dom Addesso: First of all, the rate increases that have come through the market are probably less than people were anticipating based on other market events of a similar nature. And recognize that the market has been in somewhat of a rate declines for several years. So whether to the extent was it a rational response, even though the losses were as you described as expected, I absolutely think it was a rational response. And I think perhaps closing as rational as it needed to be. But nevertheless, from our perspective, the rate increases get us back to a point where it's a reasonable return relative to the risk we’re taking on. Whereas I think if you look at the results of the industry in last three years in many cases there were many markets that were operating at below the cost of capital. So I absolutely think even though it might have been an expected level of loss, if you’re riding business below your cost of capital then that absolutely is a rational response.
Meyer Shields: Is there -- the opportunity I'm wondering, is there an opportunity to target impact -- accounts that were impacted by 2017 catastrophes because rate increases are bigger there than elsewhere?
Dom Addesso: Well, that's what we do each and every day, and of course. And there are instances where we think it's the right rate and we’ll increase share. We think it’s the appropriate rate. And in many cases, as we saw 1/1 were instances where we defined or got off the certain businesses, because it was an inappropriate rate relative to the risk. So yes, these events always create opportunities, sometimes the opportunities make sense and other times, they don't.
John Doucette: I want to add a little more color to that. I think going back to your first part of your question, I think there's also -- you got to look at it as modeled results and then psychology of the market and also when losses like this have happened. And I am not sure I completely agree that all the -- that it's certainly across the buyers and even some of the sellers that everybody thought these losses were expected. I would highlight California wildfires, largest fires of all time. Houston being impacted by Harvey are one in a thousand event. I am not sure if people think in terms of one in a thousand type event, the flooding that happened there. As you may recall, Irma for a while was heading to Florida, to Miami as a Cat five and looked like it was going to be a direct hit and the market was talking about $150 billion, $200 billion of insured losses. And Maria heading Puerto Rico that was the first major hurricane to hit Puerto Rico since 1928. And all of that I think impacts what -- while it could be in a model, I am not sure about the wildfires and flooding is always a challenge, but the model. But there's certainly a lot about just the buyers and sellers and the market dynamics and what managements think and boards think of the buyers and things like that. I think there's some people maybe were surprised with the outcomes of some of these -- and some of the losses that happened, and the accumulation and aggregation of them. So I think there's a lot of moving parts beyond what did a model say.
Meyer Shields: Second question, as the property insurance book grows, is there any seasonality to how you plan to report results because so much of the ultimate profit is recognized at the back half of the year?
Craig Howie: I think we pretty much have a fixed pick loss ratio that we keep throughout the year.
Dom Addesso: And we do that -- it's less seasonal now that it’s on the reinsurance book than it was when it was on the insurance book.
Operator: And our final question for today comes from Brian Meredith with UBS. Please go ahead.
Dom Addesso: Let me just interrupt there for a minute. There are more questions -- we were perhaps a little longer than usual in our opening remarks. So I don't mind going over a bit if you've some additional questions in queue, given it's the year end and given the nature of the results. So anyway, go ahead Brian.
Brian Meredith: John, could you give us a sense of how much of the fourth quarter growth was one-off back up coverage those types of things?
John Doucette: So across reinstatements and back up covers, it was about $200 million in total.
Brian Meredith: Second question, I am just curious on your workers’ comp business in California. Do you anticipate any pushback from regulators with respect to pricing and rate given tax reform?
Jon Zaffino: Very uncertain at the moment. We're going to obviously watch the market carefully and continue to react based on what we see as underlying risk return characteristic. So we’re following the same early commentary and we’ll keep an eye on that. But at this stage, we have not seen anything different but we’ll certainly be watching that closely in California and other jurisdictions as information becomes better now.
Dom Addesso: I think that, Brian, will more likely be more of a personal lines issue than it’s likely to be a commercial lines issue. And I think overtime the market will self-correct itself I'm not sure that regulators necessarily sometimes can help themselves will necessarily need to get involved in that particular kind of activity.
Brian Meredith: And then a little bit bigger picture question here. As you’re pricing your business both reinsurance and the insurance side, obviously, you could have build in some type of kind of loss trend either inflation assumptions, which you think are going forward. Would you all thinking on the loss trend upside over the next year or two? And how are you pricing the business and reserving for it?
Dom Addesso: Well, that varies across various lines of business. So what we model in for work comp is different than what we build in for a casualty or excess liability, or property, it's were financial lines for that matter. So there isn’t one how to answer to that question, but suffice to say that we’re building trend in to all -- not only our pricing but also our reserving activities.
Brian Meredith: And then last question would be just curious lot of growth going on. Any thoughts about, in your expenses, it's been going up relatively modestly. Any thoughts about whether you've got the infrastructure to handle this type of growth and could you put more growth on the current platform?
Dom Addesso: Is that a question about reinsurance or insurance or both?
Brian Meredith: I would say, on both sides.
Dom Addesso: Well certainly, I'll talk to the reinsurance piece first. We've actually been adding resources. We talk a lot about adding new lines of business and diversifying our reinsurance platform. And we have been adding resources, technical resources to keep up with that or to generate those business opportunities and properly underwrite them. And I don’t see that on the reinsurance side as particularly the problem given both nature of the premium that comes in on the reinsurance side, so not an issue at all. And frankly from an infrastructure point of view, we've added the resources and we have the management debt to deal with those types of accounts. On the insurance side, as Jonathan pointed out, our expense ratio just up slightly year-over-year and that scenario we also continue to add resources, as well as continue to invest in fiscals. So fact that we're able to maintain that expense ratio, I think is attribute to Jonathan and his team, as well as the rest of the support units within the organization that provide services to our insurance operation. So we continue to do -- the earned premium continues to build on the insurance operation. I think we’re able to properly manage that expense ratio and at the same time, make the proper investments where we need to.
Operator: And we did have a follow-up question from Jay Gelb with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Jay Gelb: My questions have been answered. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And at this time, there are no further questions in the queue.
Dom Addesso: Well, good. Thank you all very much for your participation in the call this morning and for your questions as normal. Just to summarize, this has been record level of catastrophe losses. For the year, we think we've had more than respectable result and it's demonstrated the diversity of Everest, the growth that we've experienced in both on the reinsurance side and the insurance side, demonstrates that we continue to add value to our customers, clients and brokers. And we expect that success that we had in '17 to continue into 2018. So thank you for your interest and your participation this morning. We look forward to any follow-up questions you might have after this call. Thank you so much.
Operator: Thank you. And once again, that does conclude today's call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2017 Q3  (2017-10-31 10:30:00) =====

Operator: Good day everyone. Welcome to the Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Call of Everest Re Group Limited. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the conference over to Ms. Beth Farrell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Elizabeth Farrell: Thank you, Jennifer. Good morning and welcome to Everest Re Group's third quarter 2017 earnings conference call. On the call with me today are Dom Addesso, the company's President and Chief Executive Officer; Craig Howie, our Chief Financial Officer; John Doucette, President and CEO of Reinsurance Operations; and Jon Zaffino, President of North American Insurance Operations. Before we begin, I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I note that statements made during today's call, which are forward-looking in nature, such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations and the like are subject to various risks. As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations. Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements. Now, let me turn the call over to Dom.
Dominic James Addesso: Thanks, Beth, and good morning. Let me begin by first extending our sympathies to all those affected by the recent events. Community at large has responded to the relief efforts, but still there is more that can be done. I'm especially proud of the way our organization has responded on both the business and personal front. We have advanced moneys to our Reinsurance clients, so they in turn can quickly settle with their insurers, allowing them to start the process of rebuilding our lives and businesses sooner. On the insurance front, our claim staff is working diligently to do the same. These events teared us with many personal stories, but also remind us of the value that our industry and company can bring during times like this. We protect against volatility and therefore expect the periodic loss that we will discuss this morning. This means, of course, that during times of limited catastrophe loss activity, we should be able to produce strong results. It also means that after a series of events that claimed $100 billion from the system, there needs to be a reset in the market as we reevaluate pricing, terms and conditions, and the impact the recent years softening has had on the industry's risk-adjusted returns. For this reason, we believe that these recent events will lead to a general market firming across all lines and territory. In non-loss affected areas, the push will be to achieve adequate return levels over a reasonable timeframe. Events like these create a greater awareness in the market around the cost of capital and the price of risk. For those regions affected by loss, the price reaction will be more pronounced. This will start with the retro market since it is heavily supported by the collateralized market, whose capital is in large part locked up. This may very well create some unique opportunities for us, especially given our capital position coming out of these events. The firming of the retro market will also have a beneficial downstream impact on the rest of the property catastrophe market, and may very well push into other lines. We anticipate that well rated capacity will be in demand, and this will drive better rates, terms and conditions across the spectrum. Given our strong risk management practices, and laddered protection mechanisms, the losses from these events remained well within our expectations. One important factor, that is often overlooked is the tax benefit that is used to offset the loss. We manage our PML on a net basis, meaning net of tax and reinsurance hedges, despite many publications that only highlight our gross PMLs. Considering the reinsurance and tax recoveries against the third quarter events, our net operating loss for the nine months stands at $180 million. This suggests that with a normal operating result in the fourth quarter, inclusive of our cap cat load, we could achieve a profit for the full year. This would be an excellent outcome in a year with an unprecedented level of catastrophe losses. We managed to these types of scenarios and measure our success over the long term, as we recognize there will be periods of volatility. Over the last five years, including results so far in 2017, our average return on equity is 12%, which we consider exceptional relative to the industry. This is a testament to the long-term value of our strategy. The emerge from these events with a strong capital base and ample reinsurance capacity with our growing Mt. Logan facility, multi-year cap bonds and other third-party regions. And are therefore ready to respond to the new market demand. While I recognize, that the cat events are deservedly getting the focus. Let me now turn your attention to the underlying business trends, that support our long-term success. On the reinsurance front, our effective use of third-party capital has allowed us to grow the book and profits during periods of low cat active. But yet during one of the highest cat years in recent times contained the loss within full year earnings. Using alternative capital for U.S. cat exposure has allowed for expansion and diversification to other regions as well as other lines of business. Another expansion opportunity we have leverage with this essentially expanded capital base is our insurance business. For the past two years, we have experienced growth of over 20% in a balanced and well-diversified fashion. With that growth and repositioning has come an improvement in the underlying attritional ratios. A $2 billion of annual premium and growing, we are now in a known market that brings capacity and ratings to meet the needs of the commercial and specialty marketplace. The underpinnings of our collective organization have never been stronger. While this year is challenge from an income perspective over the long-term we are delivering what we promised, higher ROEs that the industry with our disciplined expense model and cat losses that on an average are within our expected outcomes. But I continually remind people, there are never any losses than we don't have a business. The goal is to produce an above average ROE through the cycle. And we believe we have thus far delivered and we'll continue to do so. Thank you. And we'll now have Craig for the financial report.
Craig Howie: Thank you, Dom and good morning everyone. Everest had a net loss of $639 million or $15.73 per common share for the third quarter of 2017. This compares to net income of $295 million dollars for the third quarter last year or $7.6 per diluted common share. The operating loss for the quarter was $16.43 per share reflecting the catastrophe losses in the quarter and the foreign exchange losses of over $1 per share, which is the primary difference from the consensus. The operating loss excludes realized capital gains and losses. You will note that 2017 earnings per share calculations utilized basic common shares instead of diluted shares, due to the loss in the quarter and on a year-to-date basis. The group had a net loss on a year-to-date basis of $102 million compared to $623 million of net income in 2016. These results were impacted by a series of major catastrophe events that are driving both the quarter and the year-to-date figures. In the third quarter of 2017, the group saw $1.2 billion of net pre-tax catastrophe losses, with a net economic impact of $900 million after taxes. The breakdown on the pre-tax loss by event is as follows. Hurricane Harvey was $270 million, Hurricane Irma was $475 million, Hurricane Maria was $400 million, and the earthquakes in Mexico were $85 million. There is considerable uncertainty in these estimates, and we expect it will take several months before relative clarity emerges from the multiple events. However, the company has significant unused retrocessional capacity, including aggregate protections, which would provide coverage above these estimated levels. On a year-to-date basis, the results reflected net pre-tax catastrophe losses of $1.3 billion in 2017 compared to $143 million in 2016. Excluding the catastrophe events, the underlying book continues to perform well with an overall current year attritional combined ratio of 85.6% through the first nine months compared to 8.52% for the same period in 2016. Our year-to-date expense ratio remains low at 5.3% due to higher earned premium, including reinstatement premiums after the catastrophe event this quarter. For investments, pre-tax investment income was $137 million for the quarter and $394 million year-to-date on our $18 billion investment portfolio. Year-to-date investment income was up 10% from one year ago. The result was primarily driven by the increase in limited partnership income, which was up over $20 million for the first nine months of 2016. We've been able to maintain investment yield without a shift in our overall investment portfolio. However, we have gradually shifted allocations within our alternative investment bucket by reducing exposure to high-yield debt and public equity while committing more towards limited partnership investments all while maintaining a conservative well-diversified high credit quality bond portfolio. The pre-tax yield on the overall portfolio was 3% and the duration remained at just over three years. Foreign exchange is reported in other income. Foreign exchange losses were $43 billion in the third quarter or over $1 of earnings per share. Year-to-date foreign exchange losses were $48 million compared to $29 million of foreign exchange losses in the first nine months of 2016. The foreign exchange impact is effectively an accounting mismatch since its offset in shareholders' equity mismatch since its offset in shareholders equity through translation adjustments. Overall, we maintain an economic neutral position with respect to foreign exchange matching assets with liabilities in most major world currencies. Other income also included a $6 million loss from Mt. Logan Re in the first nine months of 2017, compared to $10 million of income in the same period last year. The decline essentially represents the higher level of catastrophe losses during 2017. On income taxes, the tax benefit is based on the actual year-to date-loss, not the annualized effective tax rate. We would expect any fourth quarter income to be taxed at an effective rate of about 10%. Stable cash flow continues with operating cash flows of over $1 billion for the first nine months of 2017, compared to $961 million dollars in 2016. We expect this will decline as we pay claims for the recent catastrophe events, but still remain positive for the year. Shareholders equity for the group was $8 billion dollars at the end of the third quarter leaving us well-positioned to take advantage of business opportunities. Thank you. Now, John Doucette will provide a review of the reinsurance operations.
John Doucette: Thank you, Craig. Good morning. As a leading global reinsurer, we have consistently achieved industry-leading results in periods with low catastrophe loss activity. But the true test of our franchise and business strategies is our ability to demonstrate resilience in a quarter in any year with several major catastrophe losses or other large unusual shock losses. While some characteristics of the recent property loss activity were unusual, the magnitude of insured losses was well within our expectations, owing to our proactive and comprehensive risk management efforts. Learning from other large catastrophe and sharp loss years such as 2001 World Trade Center, 2005 Katrina Rita and Wilma hurricanes, 2008 Global Financial Crisis and 2011, a string of losses including earthquakes in Japan and New Zealand, floods in Thailand and Australia and severe convective storms in the U.S. We have continually enhanced and refined our group-wide enterprise risk management framework. This includes our large risk and catastrophe strategy, across all underwriting areas within the company. And now, both our reinsurance and insurance portfolios, each are expected to benefit from the post loss market condition. This applies across our underwriting risk spectrum, from property insurance to facultative, to proportional treaty, to property catastrophe access of watch treaty and ultimately, to retro. We believe it is essential that a global industry leading specialty reinsurer and insurer, such as avarice. Truly understand its risks and develop a comprehensive resilient business strategy that allows us to stand with our clients, while protecting our investors capital, a proactive, farsighted approach is critical to the continuity of an enduring franchise. Expect the unexpected, as every loss is different and unique. This includes relentless preparation for Black Swan and other tail events for an accumulation of varying losses across multiple lines of business. Everest continues to be well-positioned to bring tailored solutions and value to our reinsurance clients. We pride ourselves not just on paying our clients losses quickly and efficiently, but also maintaining our financial strength in a quarter with unprecedented catastrophe loss activity. More importantly, we provide continuity to our clients going on the offense and providing additional support and capacity when it is needed most. With our global geographic and line of business diversification across our underwriting portfolio, strong earnings power and substantial capital resources. We have once again demonstrated the success of our business strategies, which insulate the balance sheet from larger events such as those just experienced. As we head into the one-one – 1/1 renewals and onward into 2018, we will continue to harness capital whether in the form of traditional equity and debt, Kilimanjaro catastrophe bonds, Mt. Logan or other forms of traditional and nontraditional reinsurance capital. Across the spectrum, our Accordion-like capital structures provide ample dry powder to deploy commensurate with market opportunities. We remain very well positioned today and our existing hedges remain substantially intact with the vast majority of our $2.8 million of cat bond still in force and unexhausted, coupled with a growing Mt. Logan capital structure both of which help Everest efficiently manage its overall net risk appetite. Uniquely, we manage alternative capital in a fashion that believes our clients around the globe from the complexities and structural weaknesses of collateral, lock-up and release mechanism from unrated reinsurers, while delivering to our clients, our evergreen promise to pay from our highly rated balance sheet as we have proven over the last 45 years. Additionally, we have a significant portfolios of business across the entire P&C opportunity set, including meaningful books of business in mortgage, casualty, professional liability, structured reinsurance, international property, specialty, and other short tail lines throughout the world that have been unaffected by recent cat loss activity. Thus, our global geographic and business line diversification decreases volatility from any one line of business. Profits from these diversifying lines and territories offset losses such as those recently experienced in the U.S. and Caribbean. Going forward, we are ready and eager to capture market opportunities that convert the value we provide to our clients in the returns for our shareholders. We are especially pleased that we will one of the few reinsurers immediately deploying capital post-event as we actively quoted backup covers in all loss affected areas to meet the needs of our clients, whether they were U.S. regional clients, large U.S. national clients, retro clients, Lloyd's syndicate or Caribbean reinsurance clients with financial strength and resilience, we are headed into the January renewal with the clear message that Everest is open for business. However, that does not mean we will write reinsurance business at any price. As we have supported our core clients through hard and soft market cycle, the recent losses are reminder of the value that we deliver. As in the past, we will deploy our capital where that value is most recognized while reducing our positions on business with less attractive pricing terms and conditions. Our clients can rely on us to offer our reinsurance capacity whether the same or a higher amount of capacity needed as long as it meets an appropriate return on capital, and the cost of that capital has gone up with the industry. Now turning to specifics on our results. Excluding reinstatement premiums, gross-written premiums for our reinsurance operation increased 13% for the quarter and 15% year-to-date with broad-based growth in our U.S. and Bermuda operations from crop reinsurance, mortgage, strategic quota shares, [indiscernible] (00:21:00) business, international surety and property and structured reinsurance. Growth was offset slightly by lower international premium volume in the third quarter due to the renewal of certain structured deal that ran their course. This underscores our ability to not only seize opportunity in property cap business, but to continue to write and expand our franchise in diversifying and value-added lines for our client. While this quarter's reinsurance underwriting results were heavily impacted by the catastrophe losses in the quarter. The underlying trends in these businesses remain solid. The reinsurance operations overall attritional loss ratio was up 2.6 points on a year-to-date basis against the comparable period of 2016. This was due to growth in pro rata and crop business, both with naturally higher loss ratios, offset by some favorable loss trends in our international operations. Our year-to-date attritional expense ratio dropped over two points benefiting from a business mix with naturally lower commissions. Despite this year's loss activity, in the long-term, the reinsurance market will continue to trend towards more efficient capital management and scale with better operational and expense management. We believe we are very well positioned both now and into the future. Our ability to execute on these key drivers provides value to our clients and our shareholders in both hard and soft markets. Our strategy remains nimble and dynamic, and enables us to thrive in this ever-changing market. Thank you. And now, I'll turn it over to Jon Zaffino to review our insurance operations.
Jonathan Zaffino: Thank you, John, and good morning. As catastrophic events unfolded in the third quarter, particularly of the magnitude at scale that occurred across North America, the resulted impact to the primary insurance market has been predictably quite significant. While the Everest Global Insurance operations were not immune to the impact of this widespread devastation, the performance of our various books of business, notably our U.S. property portfolio were in line with our expectations. Further, we are pleased with the continued growth and development of our global insurance platform. We are increasingly confident that our vision to organically build a world-class diversified insurance organization that is relevant within the global specialty P&C industry is being realized. Our leading gross written premiums, our enhanced operating platform, the many new product launches, our successful talent acquisition strategies and our growing relationship with a diverse group of trading partners is a testament to this approach. Progress on our journey is also fairly measured by an increasingly resilient underlying combined ratio, which again was solidly profitable for the quarter. Notably in the quarter, we were pleased to receive conditional approval from the Central Bank of Ireland for our newest European operating platform Everest Insurance Ireland. This is another example of the thoughtful organic build of our franchise and the expansion of our global underwriting operation. Our Irish operating companies will be an important component of our overall international insurance strategy, and is an excellent complement to both our North American and Lloyd's operation. I'll turn now to the financial highlights in the quarter, following this I'll provide some comments on the cat activity experienced within the insurance operations along with our views of the operating environment forward. As in prior quarters, due to the divestiture of Heartland in late third quarter of 2016, I will discuss our comparative results excluding this business. For the third quarter of 2017, the global insurance operations produced $480 million in gross written premium, an increase of $109 million or 30% over third quarter 2016. Another tremendous result and a recognition of our growing relevance in the specialty P&C market. On a year-to-date basis, we achieved $1.5 billion in gross written premium, again another solid performance. This represents growth of $349 or 31% over the comparable period in 2016. As in prior quarters, contributions remain balanced across the diverse group of underwriting – underlying divisions within the Everest insurance global platform. This also represents the 11th consecutive quarter of growth for our global insurance operation. Turning to net premium, as we have shared in the past. Net premium slightly lagged gross written premium growth, due to the marginally more conservative reinsurance position we have taken to support the growth across our underwriting divisions. Net earned premium in the quarter was $376 million, an increase of $63 million or 20%. For the year-to-date period net earned premium of $1.1 billion, increased by $181 million or 21 or excuse me 20% over the prior year period. Our GAAP combined ratio for the quarter was 141.4%, clearly impacting by the catastrophe activity in the quarter, which contributed 43.5 points to this result. The attritional combined ratio however was 98% in the quarter, which compares favorably to the third quarter's 16 attritional of 99.5. The underlying loss ratio for the third quarter of this year was 68.4%, a 1.4 point improvement over last year's 69.8%. On a year-to-date basis, the GAAP combined ratio was 113.9, was again nearly 17 points of cat included in this result. The year-to-date attritional combined ratio for the global insurance operation is producing 96.5%, which also compares favorably to the 97.1% for the comparable period in 2016. Again the underlying loss ratio shows 1.2 points of improvement on a year-to-date basis coming in at 67% from the prior year 68.2%. Year-over-year, we are seeing a downward drift in the attritional loss ratio. This is a result of improved mix of business, the benefits from the many new businesses launch and strategic underwriting actions of the past two years. Our expense ratio in the third quarter was 29.5% essentially flat from the 29.7% from the same period last year. For the year-to-date period, the expense ratio remains 29.5%, up slightly from the 28.9% in the comparable period of 2016. As we have stated in prior calls, an expense ratio of roughly 30% remains very competitive in the specialty insurance segment. Turning now to the cat picture for the quarter. As you heard from Dom and John, Everest as an organization deploys a proactive and multifaceted approach to risk management. The insurance organization is deeply ingrained in the same processes and hence adopt many of the same views and strategies. The third quarter of 2017 certainly tested the efficacy of these strategies and the insurance operations results were consistent with our expectations and well within our tolerances. In addition to measuring our performance against modeled assumptions, we also gauge our performance against industry loss and market share analysis, and of course from a fundamental of bottom-up view of our underwriting decisions with a keen focus on any outliers that may emerge from these underwriting strategies and assumptions. Again, again for all of these measures, the various books of business performed well and has anticipated and consistent with our global view of Everest. And to put this in further perspective, we estimate roughly $160 million in net pre-tax losses from the three large cat events of Harvey, Irma and Maria. With the concentration of loss emanating for Harvey and Irma. The majority of this exposure was originated from our U.S. property underwriting division, covering the wholesale, retail and in the Marine markets, with some minor contributions from our Lloyd's platform. This loss is against roughly $450 million in annualized worldwide property insurance premium, and roughly $2 billion of similarly annualized premium within the overall insurance operation. Together these data points suggest that these events are in proportion to our portfolio, and again within our various models of expectations. One final comment on the cat side. It is important to remember that we are in the middle innings of a significant transformation of our insurance platform. As we have stated previously, this has caused a temporary lag in our earned premium and several of our new underwriting divisions have yet to achieve critical mass. As these new units continue to grow, as we are demonstrating quarter-after-quarter. We expect that our short tail property exposure will be even more balanced against the larger non-property base. This will further allow us to drive the consistent profitable results, we have been experiencing more recently in our attritional combined ratios. As for the question on market conditions, it is a very fluid situation and will take some months to find a balanced view. In fact, the current market is evidencing a fair amount of pricing volatility across lines. As we work through this adjustment process. Overall and as we stated we do believe there is a need for rate firming. Certainly within the property market cat and non-cat like and also in other markets. It is our sense that general farming will continue to occur across property line to different degrees and other major lines of business are likely to experience positive rate movement. Remember certain casualty lines of business mainly commercial auto have been experiencing rate increase for many quarters and based on underlying loss cost trends, that need to continue. Other lines of business likewise need to adjust proper technical pricing. And I believe the industry at all levels understands that we can perpetuate in an environment where pricing persist below these technical levels. Again each market, each geography in each line of business are different; however, they need to achieve adequate technical pricing remains universal, that is our focus. In conclusion, despite the impact of the cat event in the quarter, we remain pleased with the continued progress we are making and the establishment of a world-class specialty insurer. The underlying performance of our diverse books of business are encouraging and we feel we are well-positioned to create value for all of our constituents and the evolving market ahead. We look forward to continuing our momentum and reporting back to you on our progress next quarter. Now, back to Beth for Q&A.
Elizabeth Farrell: Thank you, Jon. Jennifer, we are open for questions at this time.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll have our first through Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi, good morning. My first question just going back to your introductory comments, when you pointed to marking farming across all lines in territories. I just, if we can get more color on you know, I mean, if – is this depending on alternative capital, reloading or not reloading following the events, I guess, how do you see the dynamics underlying the market firming as we get closer to the January 1 renewals?
Dominic James Addesso: Well, there's a number of factors, Elyse, that lead us to believe that there is an [ph] opening market (33:42). First of all, starting with the various industry events that clearly we have been attending throughout the past month starting with Monte Carlo and moving on to PCI and Baden and the CIAB. The strength of the market in terms of [ph] its resolve (34:01) continue to increase based on our assessment and various talking with customers, brokers, [ph] and other markets (34:09). So, that's number one. And underpinning all that has been what I've been saying for some time is that the returns on capital, return on equity of the industry in general, as you all know, has been in the mid single-digit for a period of time. And therefore, these types of events are unsustainable with mid single-digit ROEs in times of low to no cat activity. So, clearly, the market has been below technical pricing adequacy. So, that's number one. With respect to alternative capital coming back in, start off with a good portion, a significant portion of alternative capital is locked up. And it's our belief that certainly some new capital will come back in, but it's not clear yet that 100% of that, at least in the short term, is ready to move back in. And frankly, alternative capital is not going to come back in unless it sees some price improvement. So, that's my fundamental belief as to why I think there will be a market firming. I don't think it's dependent on alternative capital. There's technical pricing needs across many of our lines of business, not just property, and there has been a reassessment of cost of capital [indiscernible] (35:49)
Elyse Greenspan: What level of rate do you think we could see on both loss and potentially non-loss impacted accounts?
Dominic James Addesso: I knew we would eventually get to that question, and I'm not necessarily going to say that we're expecting X percent by this timeframe. I think we will see in the retro market a very, very strong double-digit rate increases early on, and perhaps that would last into a second renewal season. That of course, as you know, with firm retro pricing that has a waterfall impact on the rest of property cat. We're already, as Jonathan somewhat alluded to, on the primary side. It's mixed, early days, but we are seeing – beginning to see some price movement upward, but that will take a longer period of time to get to what we believe will be rate adequacy. So, at the primary level, ultimately, it's in the early days, it's high single-digit, but that might take several months to really play out. On the reinsurance front, straight up property cat, I think will start in the teens, again in loss affected areas and perhaps that will take multiple years to play out. But it is – we don't know for sure, but clearly, we are approaching the January 1 renewals with the anticipation that rates are going up.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. Great. I appreciate the color. And then, also if you could talk about the potential implications on the tax side if [ph] the NIL bill (37:34) is included within tax reform?
Dominic James Addesso: Potential implications to the industry to us? What is – where is the...
Elyse Greenspan: For Everest, sorry. For you guys specifically.
Dominic James Addesso: There is many derivations of that. We have various companies that are in place obviously in the U.S., in Bermuda, in Ireland, in other jurisdictions and we have capital in most of those locations. So, depending on what the final shape of that bill is, we'll dictate where we position our capital and what companies we will be running business on.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate the color.
Dominic James Addesso: Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley.
Kai Pan: Thank you, and good morning. First question, just a follow-up on Elyse's question on alternative capital. How much was the total losses for Mt. Logan and what's your investors sort of risk appetite after those events?
Dominic James Addesso: Let me ask Craig the total loss for Mt. Logan.
Craig Howie: The total loss for Mt. Logan was almost $200 million. And then, of course [indiscernible] (38:57) income as well. So, you'll see that there, AUM is down about $116 million for the quarter.
Dominic James Addesso: And then, I'm sorry the second follow-on to that, Kai, was?
Kai Pan: What are the sort of your – the investors in Mt. Logan, what's their risk appetite following these events?
Dominic James Addesso: We have and have had actually before the events but even after the events, we have investors that are ready to put capital in. Some reload, some new investors that are interested in going forward with the Logan platform, all with an expectation that rates are going up. That kind of relates back to my earlier response to Elyse.
Kai Pan: Okay. My second question is that [ph] you sit at about (39:48) 10% of your reinsurance premiums, about 20% of your insurance premiums. I just wonder if the retro or reinsurance rates going up [ph] some (39:56) double-digits, how would that impact your sort of underwriting strategy [ph] in term of net growth (40:02)?
Dominic James Addesso: John?
John Doucette: Good morning, Kai. It's John. So, I think there's a lot of dials that we look at both in terms of absolute and relative rate adequacy. So, we'll look at it both on the growth side in terms of how we're going to deploy the capital to which area, which product line, which territory, and then how much we want to deploy. So, how much we want to deploy and how much we want to retain, that will be a function of what we think would be overall rate adequacy is. And then, yes, we will look to the different hedges whether it's additional hedges of reinsurance and retro. But remember, we have a lot of dials to turn on how we get the business, as I mentioned, from insurance, reinsurance, all the way to retro. And we have a lot of different dials to turn in terms of how we manage our net risk appetite and net risk exposure. And those include Mt. Logan that takes shares of different pools of risk and stand with Everest on whatever the rates are that we get, and as well as the catastrophe bonds that we have where we have $2.8 billion of multi-year aggregate catastrophe bond, most of which [indiscernible] (41:27) vast majority of that is still intact going forward into January 1 and later.
Dominic James Addesso: To add to that, to pick up on something that John has alluded to there, keep in mind that what we have been doing through the market cycle here is the market had been softening over the past couple of years, we've been moving attachment points, and deploying our capital to where we felt was the best risk-adjusted returns. And where we will be going forward, perhaps we'll be changing that again so that where the market is getting the appropriate rate increase and where the best risk-adjusted returns are is where we will be deploying our capital. So, that could change over the next 12 months.
Kai Pan: Okay. If I may, the last question is a quick one on the tax rates. So, what's the expected tax rate for the first quarter, will it be normalized like 11%, 12%?
Dominic James Addesso: I mentioned in my script, Kai that I believe the tax rate for the fourth quarter, any income earned in the fourth quarter should be at an effective rate of about 10%.
Kai Pan: Great. Well, thank you so much.
Dominic James Addesso: Thank you, Kai.
Operator: We'll go next to Jay Gelb with Barclays.
Jay Gelb: Thanks very much. I know you mentioned the view that the third quarter catastrophe losses were within your risk parameters. Was there anything coming out of your after – accident reports in the third quarter that ever possibly could have done different or better, looking back on these catastrophe losses?
Dominic James Addesso: There is always things around the edges that you can improve upon. There's nothing material, but stands out. I guess in the very extreme and the absurd, could have been no property cat. That's obviously not a realistic scenario. I have to be honest with you, I think what we have done and the way we've managed our portfolio I think has been pretty much spot on, as again during the – over the last couple of years, as you know, we've been earning very, very good returns on our capital. We've been leveraging the retro market, the capital markets, and allowed us to maintain our writings while not diminishing our returns on capital. And the loss, frankly, has come out well within our parameters. So, there's not really – I suppose the only other thing that we could have done is again Monday morning quarterback, buy more reinsurance for our insurance portfolio. But looking at it from this vantage point, I'm certain we would make the same decisions.
Jay Gelb: Thanks, Dom. And using that is kind of as a starting point for the next question. The combined – [ph] the account of your (44:50) combined ratio in the third quarter in the insurance business, over 140%, is – what can be done differently there to bring this to obviously not in 2017, but in 2018 and beyond, bring this to a calendar year underwriting profit for the business?
Dominic James Addesso: Well, I mean that combined ratio that you cite includes the catastrophe losses. So, are you talking attritional, are you talking all-in?
Jay Gelb: All-in. I mean, looking out into next year, it's been a number of years I think since the insurance business has generated underwriting profit.
Dominic James Addesso: Well, on an attritional basis, it is generating an underwriting profit and we see the improvement in the attritional combined ratio year-over-year. So, we are moving in the proper direction. We view our cat book, we view on a corporate or global basis. So, when we are allocating capacity, when we're looking at the marketplace, we're looking at our cat exposure globally and I should say corporately. So, that was well within our risk appetite. To the extent that it is, then we could certainly entertain some intercompany reinsurance opportunities that would, in effect, manage that combined ratio perhaps to the point that you're describing. But overall, we are very confident and very pleased with the attritional performance of our book.
Jay Gelb: That's helpful. And then two final quick ones. One, any perspectives on exposure in the fourth quarter from the California wildfires? And then separately, since the company is more focused on deploying capital in the business, should we kind of zero out the potential for share buybacks going into next year?
Dominic James Addesso: As you know, we don't – let me answer the wildfire question first. At this point, it's fairly still early, but the losses we've modeled it and what we're hearing from customers and underwriters is that it is well within our normal quarterly cat load. So, we're not concerned about that event at least at this point. Relative to share buybacks, as you know, we don't give an indication of what our appetite is. We are in the process of just reformulating, if you will, our plans for next year and we'll have perhaps more to say on that in the weeks and months ahead.
Jay Gelb: Appreciate it. Thank you.
Dominic James Addesso: Thank you, Jay.
Operator: We'll go next to Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.
Josh Shanker: Yes. Good morning, everybody.
Dominic James Addesso: Good morning, Josh.
Josh Shanker: So, I want to square if talks about improving pricing was also your appetite for growth. Compared to many of your peers, you have found opportunities in this marketplace where others haven't and you grew very nicely in this third quarter as well. If someone says look, if there's attractive opportunities, prices maybe doesn't need to go up or how do I square those two things?
Dominic James Addesso: Well, is your question on the reinsurance front or the insurance front?
Josh Shanker: Well, you can [ph] talk both (48:13) I mean, clearly, the insurance book is obviously growing faster, but you're also finding I guess in financial lines, you found opportunities in reinsurance which is obviously not property. But there's a lot of – not just you [indiscernible] (48:27) pricing has to go up. But here's Everest and I respect your work and whatnot, and you guys are finding opportunities very helpfully, I think, or maybe I'm not reading it correctly.
Dominic James Addesso: No. So, in part, the reinsurance growth is – remember we took on a crop reinsurance portfolio, so the growth is coming from that. Mortgage has been growing as well. And then, few property – or few pro-rata deals have added to that as well. And some our structured products there, our structured solutions group has been adding some premium as well. Our straight up property cat business has not really grown all that much year-over-year and that's frankly because of softening market, moving attachment points, all those things in the mix have kind of capped out kind of our appetite on property risk, cat risk.
Josh Shanker: Yes. Yes.
Dominic James Addesso: Does that – I don't know if that...
Josh Shanker: And so, as you're adding on business in the primary insurance book, is that business dependent on the industry having cheap reinsurance on the property side to allow you to grow there?
Dominic James Addesso: Absolutely not. And as Jonathan pointed out in his opening comments, we expect the non-property lines actually to grow a little faster in the coming quarters. So, you'll see even a better balance between property and non-property.
Josh Shanker: And, okay, I will try and dig a little deeper on that. The other question, obviously you guys bought more protection throughout the year, lowering your PMLs, but we never really got any numbers to that. Is there any color you can give us on where your PMLs stand now versus where they stood at the beginning of this year?
John Doucette: Josh, it's John. Yeah. I mean, I think they were basically materially similar. There was a decrease due to the cat bonds that we issued in the March and April time period. But part of that, and we continue to use third party capital as a way to think about managing our portfolio, managing the overall risk appetite, shaping it. And so to the extent that we had some additional capacity through the aggregate catastrophe bonds that we purchased that covered Texas, Florida, and Puerto Rico among other areas, that helped us in terms of then as we went into June 1 and July 1 in terms of the renewal period to maintain a net PML position that we were comfortable with.
Josh Shanker: Okay. Well thank you for all the color and good luck with this renewal season.
Dominic James Addesso: Thank you, Josh. Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Amit Kumar with Buckingham Research Group.
Amit Kumar: Thanks and good morning, and thanks for the questions. Just two questions. The first question is the discussion on the catastrophe bonds, and I think what I heard was they didn't kick in. Can you remind us, and I know they all have different attachment points, what do the industrial losses need to get to for your cat bonds to trigger?
John Doucette: Good morning. So the catastrophe bonds, some of them we purchased, so across the $2.8 billion there was several layers, different [ph] parallel (52:14) covers. They all cover North America in some fashion and Puerto Rico, several of them. And then some of them are on an occurrence basis and including the most recent $1.25 billion as well as some of the previous ones are on an aggregate basis. So these bonds that we purchased are typically done tied to industry losses, and then there is different market shares that are applied as per the bond. There are different market shares based on territories that are exposed, so there's not really a simple answer to that question. So the market shares in each of the bonds in each of the territories will vary as we try to shape the bond to then best hedge our overall portfolio. So the most latest catastrophe bonds of the $1.25 billion that we issued, they are done on an industry basis so people such as yourself can do your own research on whether you think they're expected to be penetrated or not. There had been some markdowns in the bonds that reflected that there may be some potential penetration to the lowest layer, but that really is going to end up being ultimately up to what the final industry losses are going to be.
Amit Kumar: Got it. That's a fair point. Yeah, it's a bit tough to figure out with the weighted index attachment. The second question I had was, I guess, a discussion on the missing industry losses, and we've sort of raised this topic on other calls as to how do we get to the industry loss of $100 billion-plus versus the current addition of the disclosed losses. If the industry loss were to move downwards, does your net loss move up? Can you just help us understand that metric a bit better?
Dominic James Addesso: No. As the industry loss moves down, you're expecting our loss to go up? Is that what you asked?
Amit Kumar: No, I was thinking about the recoveries, at what level they trigger in. That's what I was asking, sorry.
Dominic James Addesso: Our net loss contemplates recoveries from the various instruments that John has just kind of outlined. Which does mean that if the industry loss goes down, our net loss position really doesn't change a whole heck of a lot.
Amit Kumar: Got it.
Dominic James Addesso: There is some movement that could occur, but it all depends on industry loss, where the loss is coming from, what the weightings are. So it's a little difficult to give a precise answer to that, but my point is that there shouldn't be – within a band, our net loss position doesn't change a whole heck of a lot. It's really...
Amit Kumar: And, Dom, just to your point...
John Doucette: And staying on the other side, which is if the losses go up because of the various protections, including the aggregate catastrophe bonds I was just talking about which are very close to the aggregate retention being exhausted or slightly into the first layer, it also means that if the industry losses go up then our net loss position won't change materially.
Amit Kumar: Fair point. And Dom, any view on this, I guess, the missing billions of industry losses. I mean, obviously we're talking about rate firming. You're quite positive on the market scenario. [indiscernible] (56:06)...
Dominic James Addesso: Now all you smart folks have been exploring this and asking managements on all the calls and have been looking at it for weeks and you can't find it, I don't know how you expect us, a simple man like me to figure that out for you. But if there was a place to look, I would look in the capital markets piece. That's my expectation of where kind of the missing numbers are.
Amit Kumar: Yeah, that's a fair point. That's all I have. Thanks for the answers and good luck for the future.
Dominic James Addesso: Thank you, Amit.
Operator: We'll go next to Meyer Shields with KBW.
Meyer Shields: Thanks. I had to two big picture questions and then one more number-specific. So Dom, I was wondering, one, if you could give us a sense of third party investor elasticity, in other words how various levels of rate changes might affect the supply of third party capital And secondly, whether based on your experience it makes sense to hold back some capital from 1/1 renewals in anticipation of better rate changes later in 2018?
Dominic James Addesso: Two great questions. Third party capital is looking to come back into the space where what I would call reload if it can get meaningful rate increases, and the definition of meaningful can vary by company, it can vary by investor. Do I see a material increase in third party capital if we have some level of market firming? I do not. I think first, the capital has to be reloaded, and I think what your question was implying was is the third party capital going to increase materially if there is some material increase in pricing. We don't see that just yet. I also think that the other side of the equation is that, and what we've heard from some clients, is that they're more interested in potentially increasing their purchases from rated paper as opposed to third party capital. The whole issue of reinstates are always a problem there, and so there does seem to be an increased interest in rated paper. Now, that doesn't mean by the way that reinsurers like ourselves, which utilize third party capital and see it as an opportunity to expand our capital base, wouldn't increase. But to the extent that it does allow reinsurers to perhaps increase the participations of clients directly as opposed to have those clients buy from third party capital, we think that might represent an opportunity certainly in the medium-term. In terms of holding back capital, we're in a marketplace. We have customers and we have sufficient capital and/or access to capital that, well, we can trade forward or trade in a bigger way if rates are even firming more into the year. I think that the fundamental question is we won't be deploying capital unless it meets our risk-adjusted return hurdles, so that's the first test. And if it meets our hurdles, and we would anticipate it would probably even, in some circumstances, exceed our hurdles, then we would deploy the capital, and there isn't a need to hold back capital in that regard. Does that answer your two questions?
Meyer Shields: It does, certainly well. Thank you. Follow-up, or not follow-up, but within the insurance segment, I guess, both last year and this year the attritional loss ratio was higher in the third quarter than it was in the preceding two. And I was wondering is there some element to seasonality or is that just a lucky draw?
Dominic James Addesso: In any one particular quarter, there's adjustments we're making to pick loss ratios. Our A&H book of business for example has been growing which, by definition, carries a little bit higher attritional loss ratio. We think it's more appropriate to look at the year-to-date performance since it takes out some of those quarterly anomalies which makes the business – where we're pegging loss ratios in any one particular quarter, we make adjustments in a quarter. But it's the year-to-date number that really is what we think and what we look at predominantly, and that's improving year-over-year. That's trending in the right manner.
Meyer Shields: Yeah. Absolutely. Thank you very much.
Meyer Shields: Thank you, Meyer.
Operator: And we'll go to our final question from Brian Meredith of UBS.
Brian Meredith: Yeah. Thanks. A couple of quick questions here for you, Dom. The first, I'm just curious. At Mt. Logan, how much collateral do you expect to be tied up at the 1/1 renewals and do you plan on kind of replenishing that with new money here on that?
Dominic James Addesso: Do it, John.
John Doucette: Yeah. It's John. So the amount that would be tied up would be consistent with the expected losses that are there plus a buffer that would be on top of that against the ceded losses. And then in terms of how much we would look to raise or redeploy, we're in the process of talking to Logan investors, both existing and new ones, and we would expect – we don't know what the final number will be, but we would expect it to be up.
Brian Meredith: Got you.
Dominic James Addesso: And those investors, to make it clear, are looking also for rates to be up, and they're not looking to deploy capital in a flat to down market.
John Doucette: Right. And it allows, as Dom said earlier, there clearly is a trend in the buyers both in the reinsurance and retro market looking for rated paper because there are some fundamental structural problems which we're going to see it's going to play out in real time because with the collateralized products. In terms of collateral release mechanisms, forced collateral release, people may realize they thought they had cover and then they don't have as much cover as they thought or they don't have continuity of cover from one year to the next as collateral gets trapped. So there's a clear demand for rated paper. And with our balance sheet, our ratings, and kind of our 45-year trading relationship with clients the around the world, expect to be in a good position to capitalize on that. And so part of that would be to make sure that we get the right net risk position to be able to use our different capital structures, such as Mt. Logan, to help. But basically, if Everest gets raised, the Mt. Logan investors will benefit from that, so we stand pari passu with them.
Brian Meredith: Right. That's great. And then I'm just curious. Given history has kind of shown that on the property cat line rate increases tend to be fairly short-lived. Not sure if you expect that this time around. But given that, would you expect to potentially disproportionally put more into Mt. Logan or some type of a soft capital facility to kind of help manage that risk?
Dominic James Addesso: I think, we have demonstrated over the last couple of years that we deploy our capital in the best risk-adjusted areas. We have used third party capital. We will write the business on the basis that we think is best for the organization and use the capital that's out there in the most highly efficient manner possible. So it's difficult to answer that question precisely, but I think what we've demonstrated is that we're flexible and we tend to be within ranges, opportunistic, and we move our capacity around. And we will continue to do that as we trade forward if what you're suggesting is that the firming would be short-lived.
Brian Meredith: Great. That's great. And then one last one. I'm just curious. So John and Dom, I appreciate your point about the industry, kind of cost of capital going up here. But do you think that the kind of cost to goods sold for property cat reinsurance based upon models and stuff is also going to rise here and it's going to drive some of this rate activity or do you not see that happening?
Dominic James Addesso: I'll ask John to address that.
John Doucette: Yeah. So I think a lot of times – every time a loss happens there's always something that the different vendors learn from, something different than before and they adjust it. That typically takes a few years to ripple through the system as they update their models to kind of fit the historical events set or the different events that happen. So certainly, I think take what happened in Houston, I think there's going to be a heightened awareness to flooding risk in different ways than people. Certainly, some of the vendor models had thought about it before. But this is true with the different earthquakes, whether it was the New Zealand earthquake or the four zones on the Japanese earthquake. It's been a long time since a catastrophe of that size hit, Maria, and I think the modeling agencies will think that through. And for a little while there, we were looking at a Cat 5 hitting Miami, and I think that will both change some customers' views of their risk management as well as potentially change some of the vendor models with that as they think about the possibilities with the different storm tracks. But a lot of that takes a – the customer views may be more – happen in real time as people think about what board of directors for some of our clients think about what their risk position is and how much they want to keep net, and that may put some upward demand on reinsurance. But in terms of the modeling agencies, it usually takes a little bit to go through the system.
Brian Meredith: Great. And then...
Dominic James Addesso: Bottom line, Brian, I think the models are great. Everyone in the industry uses them. Events like this I think caused all managements to take them with a little bit of grain of salt and recognize that there is risk that is not evidenced through the models, and that in fact will have some impact on pricing, will have some impact on buying behavior as well.
Brian Meredith: Great. And then kind of just one quick numbers question for Craig, let him do some talking here. In the operating expense line, was there any kind of reversal of maybe variable incentive comp that happened?
Craig Howie: Yes. We did that this quarter as well, Brian, just because of a matching with the events. But that'll be determined again in the fourth quarter depending on where we stand with respect to income in the fourth quarter.
Brian Meredith: Great. Thank you.
Brian Meredith: I'm glad Craig was able to be able to respond.
Craig Howie: That's right.
Dominic James Addesso: That's it. Okay. So we've had all our questions, and thanks for those. In summary, I think what you heard this morning is that our risk management practices have contained the losses within our expectations, and that kind of permits us to trade forward and participate fully in what we believe, and I think the market believes, there will be firming. We think this is true not only because of what markets in general are saying but also because there will be some dislocation of capital which, as I said before, will benefit highly rated papers such as ours. So this is the business we're in but this does create some opportunity for us going forward. Well thank you for your participation on the call and I look forward to our continued dialog. Happy Halloween.
Operator: This does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.

===== 2017 Q2  (2017-07-25 10:30:00) =====
Executives: Beth Farrell - VP, IR Dom Addesso - President and CEO Craig Howie - CFO John Doucette - President and CEO of Reinsurance Operations Jon Zaffino - President, North America Insurance Operations
Analysts: Elyse Greenspan - Wells Fargo Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank Meyer Shields - KBW
Operator: Good day everyone. Welcome to the Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Call of Everest Re Group Limited. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Beth Farrell, Vice President of Investor Relation. Please go ahead.
Beth Farrell: Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Everest Re Group's second quarter 2017 earnings call. On the call with me today are Dom Addesso, the company's President and Chief Executive Officer; Craig Howie, Chief Financial Officer; John Doucette, President and CEO of Reinsurance Operations; and Jon Zaffino, President of North American Insurance Operations. Before we begin, I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I note that the statements made during today's call, which are forward-looking in nature, such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations and the like, are subject to various risks. As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations. Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements. Now, let me turn the call over to Dom.
Dom Addesso: Thanks Beth and good morning to all. We're pleased to be able to report $246 million of net income for the quarter, which was $90 million above last year's second quarter. On a year-to-date basis, net income rose $210 million to $537 million. These results were primarily driven by excellent underwriting results of $130 million for the quarter and $313 million on a year-to-date basis, which includes $54 million of cat losses in the second quarter and $74 million in the six-month results. These results are improving year-over-year due to continued growth in premium, along with a lower combined ratio, due in part to lower catastrophe losses in the quarter. More important is the improvement evident in the Insurance segment, where we have an underwriting gain this year versus last. The attritional combined ratio for Insurance has now reached 93.6 for the quarter. The various growth and underwriting initiatives we have implemented are beginning to take hold. Overall premium is up $238 million or 17%, with growth coming from both Reinsurance and Insurance. However, on a percentage basis, Insurance is up 25%, while Reinsurance is up 14%. The growth in Insurance, which Jonathan will discuss in greater detail in a moment, is well diversified, coming from several new business units. We are extremely encouraged by the growth in all of our segments. In the Reinsurance businesses, while due to market condition, there are areas where we are contracting; there remains an array of opportunities in the credit and structured solution areas that are contributing to profitable growth. In addition, as John Doucette will cover in his report, proportional transactions, including crop reinsurance, are presenting profitable opportunities in today's market environment. The non-U.S. segments has also been a reasonable growth area for us more recently, as we have added resources there and established new locations. While Reinsurance is still a challenged space, we have been successful in achieving better than market returns due to our ability to reallocate our capacity in-scale due to better returning opportunities. Our size and relationships matter in this type of market. Scale also plays a meaningful role in the success we've been having in the Insurance segment. The ability to operate in sophisticated lines of business, with meaningful capacity and a strong balance sheet with A-plus ratings, matter to customers and brokers. These factors have also enabled us to attract terrific talent and armed with our financial strength, have propelled us to over $1 billion of premium in the first half of the year. At the same time, we have eliminated a number of underperforming businesses. For example, crop insurance and we have strengthened our reserve position, all these leading to a profitable first half. And as earned premium begins to catch up with the written premium, we would expect this profit picture to accelerate. Our Insurance operation in the best position that it's ever been, and is now a recognized market to brokers and their customers. On the investment front, there was also positive movement over the prior year as income was up 9% for the first six months. This is a result of some rotation into limited partnerships and public equities and traditional fixed income. However, our allocations are still quite conservative relative to the industry. Our investment team has done an outstanding job of enhancing performance to the cycle, while maintaining quality. Overall, our results were excellent, with an ROE of 13% for the first half, our shareholder's equity growing to $8.6 billion, and our market cap reaching $11 billion. These factors have led us to just recently being added to the S&P 500, a great accomplishment and acknowledgment to our shareholders and employees. Now, I'll turn it over to Craig for the financial reports and look forward to your questions in a bit. Thank you. Craig?
Craig Howie: Thank you, Dom, and good morning, everyone. Everest had a solid quarter of earnings, with net income of $246 million, this compares to net income of $156 million for the second quarter of 2016. On a year-to-date basis, net income was $537 million compared to $327 million for the first half of 2016. The primary differences were unimproved underwriting result, higher capital gains, higher investment income, lower catastrophe losses, and lower foreign exchange losses compared to the first half of 2016. Net income included $50 million of net after-tax realized capital gains compared to $30 million of capital losses in the first half of 2016. After-tax operating income for the second quarter was $227 million compared to $134 million in 2016. Operating income year-to-date was $487 million compared to $357 million for the first six months of 2016. The overall underwriting gain for the group was $313 million for the first half compared to an underwriting gain of $234 million in the same period last year. All segments reported underwriting gains for both the quarter and on a year-to-date basis. The year-to-date combined ratio for the group was 88.3%, down from 90.7% reported in the first half of 2016, with lower catastrophe losses contributing to this favorable variance. In the second quarter of 2017, the group saw $54 million of current year catastrophe losses net of reinsurance. Of the total, $25 million related to wildfires in South Africa, $15 million related to U.S. storms in Colorado and $14 million related to floods in Peru. This compares with $124 million of catastrophes during the second quarter of 2016. On the year-to-date basis, catastrophe losses totaled $74 million compared to $134 million for the first half of 2016. Excluding the catastrophe losses, the current year additional combined ratio through the first six months was 85.6%, essentially flat from 85.7% for the first half of 2016. Our expense ratio remains at 5.8% for the first two quarters of 2017. For investments, pretax investment income was $135 million for the quarter and $257 million year-to-date, on our $18 billion investment portfolio. Investment income was up 9% from one year ago. This result was primarily driven by the increase in limited partnership income, which was up $14 million for the first half of 2016, primarily due to the turnaround in energy-related investments compared to last year. The pretax yield on the overall portfolio was 2.9%, with a duration of just over three years. Foreign exchange is reported in other income. For the first half of 2017, foreign exchange losses were $5 million, compared to $31 million of foreign exchange losses in the first six months of 2016. The 2016 foreign exchange losses reflected the weakening of the British pound during 2016 related to the Brexit vote. Other income also included $4 million of earnings and fees from Mt. Logan Re in the first six months of 2017 compared to $3 million of income in the first half last year. The increase reflects the lower level of catastrophe losses during the first half of 2017 compared to 2016, resulting in a higher profit share to Everest. On income taxes, similar to the first quarter of 2017, the 9% year-to-date effective tax rate on operating income was lower than the expected range for the year. The 2017 rate is lower than the 10% tax rate for the full year 2016, due to a FASB tax accounting change related to share based compensation and the utilization of foreign tax credits for years 2008 and prior. These two items reduced the effective tax rate by about one point. The effective tax rate is an annualized calculation that includes planned catastrophe losses for the remainder of the year. Should catastrophe losses come in lower than this estimate, it would be expected that the tax rate would increase. Stable cash flow continues, with operating cash flows of $634 million for the first half of 2017 compared to $684 million in 2016. The decline reflects a higher level of paid catastrophe losses in 2017 compared to 2016. Shareholder's equity for the group was $8.6 billion at the end of the second quarter, up $500 million or 6% over year end 2016. This was after taking into account capital return for $103 million of dividends paid in the first half of 2017. Our capital position remains very strong and continues to grow. Thank you. And now John Doucette will provide a review of the range on its operations.
John Doucette: Thank you, Craig. Good morning. We are pleased to report another strong quarter with $126 million of reinsurance underwriting profit. The second quarter combined ratio improved to 87.4% from 89.9% in the second quarter 2016. The loss ratio improvement of 1.2 points to 60.2% was driven by lower catastrophe losses, offset by a 3.6-point increase in the attritional loss ratio. This was an anticipated outcome and was mainly due to the crop reinsurance book new this year as well as the increased property pro rata writings, offset by reduced attritional loss ratios on the international book. Total gross written premium for the second quarter was $1 billion, an increase of 14% compared to the prior Q2. This growth is due to several factors, but largely can be attributed to $54 million of crop premium associated with our strategic crop reinsurance relationship that resulted from the sale of Heartland last year. In our U.S. Reinsurance segment, second quarter gross written premium was up 17% to $475 million, driven by the new crop treaty and the impact of a large premium portfolio out in Q2 2016. The second quarter combined ratio in this segment was up eight points, primarily due to the waiting of crops and property pro rata earned premium in the quarter, with higher attritional loss ratios. While both lines have higher combined ratios, they maintained attractive ROEs due to their low capital consumption. The increased loss ratio was offset by a 1.5 point drop in the expense ratio, mainly due to lower contingent commission in the quarter. Our international Reinsurance segment second quarter gross written premium was $320 million, down 6% partly due to some large one-off deals with strategic clients written in the prior year. Net written premium for the quarter was down 3%, but up 7% on a year-to-date basis, due to the impact of timing on the receipt of several accounts. The combined ratio for the second quarter dropped to 93.7% from 115.8% in Q2 2016, due to lower catastrophe losses given the Fort McMurray wildfires and the Ecuadorian earthquake last year. The attritional loss ratio also dropped 6.2 points to 50.1% due to continued favorable loss trends. The lower loss ratio was offset by a 2.6 point increase on the expense ratio, primarily driven by the higher mix of pro rata premium affecting the commission ratio. Our Bermuda segment second quarter gross written premium increased 47% to $238 million, or up 51% on a constant dollar basis. The growth was derived from new product opportunities, timing of certain accounts, additional pro rata treaties in property, credit and casualty line, increased writings in U.K. motor, post Ogden rate changes and some large multi-class programs with core clients. The combined ratio increased to 90.3% from 88.9%, due to a 7.9 point increase in the loss ratio, offset by a 6.5 point decrease in the expense ratio. The loss ratio comparison was affected by a sizable catastrophe reserve release in 2016, a shift in business mix and an increase in the current year loss ratio, due to the change in the Ogden discount rate this year. The drop in commission was caused by a larger mix of business with naturally lower commission ratios. Turning to the 6/1 and 7/1 renewal, Everest continued to dynamically allocate capital to opportunities with the best risk-adjusted returns. Rather than chase the market down on non-performing deal, we reduced or declined these and selectively deployed capacity towards deals that were priced well. On balance, this approach resulted in similar amounts of capacity deployed with only a marginal deterioration in expected returns. This ability to successfully ship risk capital to the benefit of our overall portfolio was true at 6/1 in Florida and at 7/1 in the U.S., Canada, Latin America, Bermuda, London, Zürich, Singapore, China, and Australia, highlighting our very diversified portfolio and global origination capabilities. We also wrote more structured and customized transactions that are somewhat more shielded from market pressures. International property rates were, on average, down about 5% for us this 7/1, with some isolated pockets of rate increases in loss affected areas. In the U.S. property markets, June 1st XOL rates continued to edge down. Lower rated, smaller reinsurers and non-traditional players bore more of the brunt of the rate pressure as seasons gravitated to higher rated leading reinsurers like Everest, who received larger lines overall and better signings on the more attractively priced layers. We also cut participation on poorly performing XOL deals. Despite declining their placements, we typically continue to trade with many of those clients on different products or a different attachment point. We saw ongoing demand for our capacity on higher layers, where we currently find better risk-adjusted returns. This combination of strategies resulted in a better than market outcome for us, as we saw rates for our Florida XOL June 1st book being closer to down only about 3% and the rest of our U.S. July 1st book being closer to flat. In addition, having been impacted by Hurricane Matthew and AOB claim issues, Florida exposed pro rata deals saw improved reinsurance terms and we deployed more capacity accordingly to them. With our strong franchise, we've been able to increased our debt in various U.S. and international markets, continued to expand in areas dislocated by loss activity or grow with existing clients in new lines of business. Repeatedly, we are a go-to market for shortfall covers as market stabilization in these specific lines prevent deals from completing at aggressive firm order terms. In our casualty book, reinsurance terms are mostly stable, but original rate and loss trends pressure economics. We judiciously deploy our capital and cut back when necessary, favoring lines with healthier returns. Recently, some large casualty deals were not completed at the firm order terms, resulting in either not placing the deal and the clients retaining at net or the buyer had to improve terms for the reinsurers to get the deal fully placed, both signaling the casualty market is trying to find a floor. The persistent strength and financial success of the Everest franchise reflect the value that we are constantly trying to deliver to our reinsurance clients. We continually strive to build adorned and strategic client relationships, highlighted by the fact that 75% of our reinsurance clients have been trading with us for at least a decade, and over 50% of our clients worldwide have been trading with us for over 30 years. Leveraging our leading global franchise, our empowered underwriters nimbly provide customized solutions to our client, earning us a first look at new and unique opportunities. Consequently, we remained optimistic about our future and our ability to deploy capital profitably despite a tough market. All said, the mid-year renewals continued the macro theme of delivering the most value for reinsurance clients at the best costs. Thus, the reinsurance market continues to sprint towards; one, more capital efficiency through size, scale and diversification; two, alternative risk transfer mechanisms to enhance capital efficiency and best match capital to risk; three, increased focus on distribution to access profitable business, which is becoming increasingly more important; and four, improved operational and expense efficiencies. Those reinsurers that can execute on these objectives will succeed in both good and bad reinsurance markets, but those that do not could be disintermediated or diminished as the reinsurance value chain compresses. Everest continues to remain nimble in its approach to this changing market environment, adopting its operating strategies to ensure success today and into the future in the new reinsurance world order. Thank you. And now, I will turn it over to Jon Zaffino to review our insurance operations.
Jon Zaffino: Thank you, John, and good morning. Our Global Specialty Insurance operations delivered a solid quarter of performance. The significantly transformed Everest Insurance platform continued to take shape, and the momentum we are generating in the market as a result, remains encouraging. The second quarter marks the highest level of quarterly gross written premium realized in our insurance operations history. The achievement of this milestone was a result of a highly diversified growth, generated from over 150 specialty products, despite no premium contribution from the now divested Heartland Crop portfolio. Importantly, this quarter build upon the underwriting profitability achieved in the first quarter of this year. Most notably, when compared to the second quarter of 2016, we achieved an excess of $30 million of improvement of underwriting profit. The many strategic actions executed upon since 2015 are beginning to take hold and evidence themselves in our results. Turning to the financial results for the quarter and year-to-date period, as in prior quarters, due to the divestiture of Heartland in late third quarter of 2016, I will discuss comparative results, excluding this business. For the second quarter of 2017, the Global Insurance operations produced $569 million in gross written premium, an increase of $164 million or 41% over second quarter of 2016, a tremendous result considering the challenging market conditions. On a year-to-date basis, we achieved $1 billion in gross written premium, again, another record performance. This represents growth of $240 million or 31% over the comparable period in 2016. Contributions were relatively balanced across most underwriting divisions. The significant addition of new products, which continued to gain scale, coupled with strong performance from our many existing product areas, namely accident and health in the quarter, contributed to this excellent result. This represents the 10th consecutive quarter of growth for our Global Insurance operations. Also in the quarter, our new product launches and recently assumed portfolios contributed 19% to total premium production, along with an additional 4% from our Lloyd's platform, numbers that are consistent for the year-to-date period. Let me offer a bit more context at the divisional level. Our property portfolio experienced meaningful growth in the quarter and year-to-date period. The U.S. wholesale property book, aided in part by the previously announced renewal rates transaction closed at the end of the first quarter, was a large driver of this growth. Further contributing was the steady expansion of both our inland marine and newly launched retail property groups. Growth in various other property portfolios globally was balanced and in line with our expectations. Globally, this line represents roughly 28% of our year-to-date premium production. Everest specialty underwriters, the division focused on professional and management liability and various other specialty products, also grew nearly 25% over the prior year-to-date period. Growth, however, was not experienced across the Board. Some of our management liability books were down significantly in the same period, as we simply do not find the rating environment to be supportive of our profitability ambitions. We have been able to redeploy our resources to areas within ESU that better meet our objectives. The Everest Risk Management division, which houses our primary large account casualty operation, our mono line work comp unit, the commercial casualty team, and our multinational group, also achieved meaningful growth in the quarter and year-to-date period. Overall, premium production increased 41% and 33%, respectively over the prior year quarter and year-to-date period and profitability remained solid. This business is also a strong bellwether of the growth in our brand across the market. In the case of large account primary, we worked with our brokers and risk managers to design thoughtful risk financing casualty programs, inclusive of the suite of services. There are many hurdles entering this business, yet we find ourselves in a position of growing strength as the operation continues to mature. Everest Underwriting Partners, our delegated authority operation, was essentially flat in the quarter and in fact, down 3% in the year-to-date period, yet profitability was the strongest we have seen in several quarters. Impacting our growth were various underwriting actions taken to address a few underperforming portfolios, namely nonstandard auto. Finally, our Lloyd's operation also continued its expansion. The syndicate contributed $24 million to the insurance growth in the quarter and $45 million year-to-date. The steady and cautious build of our portfolio continues with a balanced contribution from several lines of business, including professional indemnity, financial institutions, liability, accident and health, and contingency. Again, we remained deliberate in our growth pursuits and will continue to seek opportunities for profitable expansion. So, again, meaningful growth coming from balanced contributions across the global portfolio, yet not all divisions are growing as profitability remains our number one objective. Turning to net premiums, as we've shared in the past, net written premium slightly lags gross written premium growth, due to the marginally more conservative reinsurance position we have taken to support the growth across our underwriting divisions. Net earned premium in the quarter was $364 million, an increase of $70 million or 24%. For the year-to-date period, net earned premium of $688 million increased by $118 million or 21% over the prior year period. Earned premium growth has lagged in net written premium growth due to a few factors. First, our growth rate has accelerated in recent quarters, as our new underwriting divisions became fully operationalized in the market. Second, various lines of business we are writing long-term very profitable lines earned over a period longer than 12 months. As these businesses gain additional scale, we expect earned premium growth to accelerate, which we are confident will lead to growing underwriting profit. Turning to the combined ratio, for the quarter, the GAAP combined ratio was 99.1%, almost a 10 point improvement from the second quarter of 2016. While we are pleased to have produced an underwriting profit of just over $3 million in the quarter, there were some headwinds from various cat events that distorted the progress we expect to show on a run-rate basis, which I'll get into. On a year-to-date basis, the GAAP combined ratio was 98.8%, a four point improvement over the first half of 2016. Our attritional results for the quarter and year-to-date period are 93.6% and 95.7%, respectively. This compares favorably to 2016's second quarter of 95.7% and 95.8% year-to-date. So, again, improvement in the quarter and stability on the year-to-date results. The quarter's loss and loss adjustment expense ratio improved significantly from the prior year period to 70.3% from 80.2%. As you will recall, the second quarter of 2016 was impacted by significant cat activity from the Texas hailstorms and the Fort McMurray wildfires, which combined, had a 13.1 point impact to the loss ratio. While this quarter was also impacted by a variety of well-publicized cat events, it was not the same magnitude of last year. On an attritional basis, the second quarter 2017 loss ratio improved to 64.8%, three points better than the 67.8% attritional produced for the first quarter of this year and two points better than the attritional loss ratio of 66.9% in the second quarter of 2016. We are beginning to see the drift down in the attritional loss ratio based upon improved mix, the benefits from the many new businesses launched and the strategic underwriting actions of the past two years. Looking at the year-to-date period. The GAAP loss ratio improves to 69.3% in the prior year up 74.3%, a five point betterment. The attritional loss ratio also improves a full point to 66.2% from 67.3%. A few additional comments. First, as I mentioned, the second quarter experienced another elevated level of cat activity in the U.S. PCS cat event 17/32, the Colorado hailstorms, in particular, impacted our North American results by almost four points. Second, the significant convective storm event across the first and second quarter added roughly two points to our attritional loss ratios. Certainly, all manageable outcomes, based on the profitable growth in our earned premium base, but nonetheless creating some quarterly pressure on the results. We also recognized a small amount of adverse prior year development from our non-standard auto book of nearly two points in the quarter. This is an area we continue to deemphasize in our go-forward portfolio. Offsetting these increases to our loss ratio was a four point improvement in the accident and health division exiting year loss ratio. Our A&H group delivered an outstanding quarter. Our expense ratio in the second quarter was 28.8%, down from the first quarter result of 30.2%. For the year-to-date period, the expense ratio is 29.5%, up slightly from the 28.5% in the comparable period of 2016. Our operating expense ratio for the second quarter was 12.5% compared to 12.4% for the prior year quarter, essentially flat. Year-to-date operating expenses were 12.8% for 2017 compared to 12.2% last year. Again, we anticipate the expense ratio to stabilize as we continue upon our growth plan and as earned premium continues to come through. As we have stated in prior calls, an expense ratio of roughly 30% remains very competitive in the Specialty Insurance segment. Turning to the operating environment, the second quarter trended quite similar to the first quarter. Suffice it to say that it's a competitive market and underwriting excellence is paramount in this environment. Clarity of risk appetite, clear knowledge of the rating environment, and the thoughtful assumption of risks are all key attributes of our approach. As in prior quarters, the overall level of rate change can vary meaningfully by major line of business. In general, and outside of commercial and personal auto, there are various degrees of rate pressure. Worker's compensation, particularly in California; professional liability; and various casualty lines are all feeling some degree of mild pressure, generally in the flat to mid-single-digit range, again consistent to prior quarters. Commercial and personal auto remained the outliers and are each achieving low double-digit rate increases across our portfolio. As discussed in prior calls, we feel the U.S. property market continues to find the bottom. While the rate environment has not turned consistently positive yet, we feel it is flattening out, again, with some caveat between cat and non-cat exposed areas. So, another quarter of predictable trend for each line, yet with a tone of stabilization across the overall portfolio. In conclusion, we are pleased with our results to-date. As our portfolio continues to gain scale, we are encouraged by the increased resiliency of our platform to achieve underwriting profitability. Our additional results are a special especially encouraging. Our many new and existing colleagues continue to execute well on their individual underwriting mandates and we look forward to continuing our momentum and reporting back to you on our progress next quarter. Now back to Beth for Q&A.
Beth Farrell: Thank you, John. Operator, we are ready to take questions at this time.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll have our first question from Elyse Greenspan.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi good morning. My first question on the reinsurance growth, pretty strong growth again in the quarter. Last quarter, you guys have pointed to about high single-digits growth as the sustainable level that you saw at the time for the book. The second quarter was stronger than that, and I think part of that was probably due to the some of those property pro rata signings you pointed out. But how do you see -- I mean, the rest of the year trending just in terms of on the growth prospects of your Reinsurance business? Just based off how you so June and July renewals? And how you're thinking things through right now?
Dom Addesso: Elyse, this is Dom. I'll ask John to comment as well. As we mentioned and you mentioned, part of it was due to the shift to couple of new proportional deals which that earned premium and that will have an impact on the remainder of the year, so that will affect premium growth. And then also, crop the -- crop reinsurance transaction, which will also have similar impact on the remainder of the year. But absent that, the renewable seasons are pretty much over, other than we had in July 1. But again, most of the activities in the first half of the year in terms of renewals and new business opportunities. The growth areas for us though continued to be mortgage credit, structured solution and that's where -- absent the other items I just mentioned, that's where, frankly, the growth opportunities are and that our previous guidance on that in terms of growth. As you indicated, the high single-digit would still remain unless John has anything to add to that.
John Doucette: No, I agree.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. And then in terms of the Insurance business, pretty strong growth and a lot of commentary that you guys gave. If the growth remains at 40%, do you think that based off of how you put it all together, that you could maintain an underlying margin in the low 90s? And one question I had, you did call out, Jon, convective storms of about two points, is that stuff that fell outside of your cat definition in the Q2? Meaning, the margin might have been better adjusting for that, I'm just trying to tie that together. 
Dom Addesso: Yes, the two points that Jonathan referenced falls within the attritional number that he quoted. So, it's not -- in our vernacular, it's not a cat. There are cat events, but they don't get disclosed by us as a cat, where we quoted in our numbers as a catastrophe, it is in the attrition. And again, in terms of growth, I think we set for some time that we would anticipate an improvement in our attritional and we'll have those levels where we think it is sustainable. We have great diversification across the entire platform, so we're not dependent on any one line of business or any one product, which not unlike the reinsurance sector, enable us to increase our capacity or increase our appetite and those lines of business that we feel or giving us the requisite profit and return our capital, and deemphasize those class of business that are not. It doesn't mean we totally withdraw, but it allows us to shift our capacity around. So, several new business units and allows for greater diversity across the entire platform. Johnathan?
Jon Zaffino: No. That's [Indiscernible]
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. And then one last question. Can you talk -- the losses in the quarter, you guys saw some losses in the South Africa and Peru, can you just talk about your exposure there? And what kind of returns are you getting in normalized years in both of those markets?
Jon Zaffino: Good morning Elyse, Jon. So, we write a significant portion of our business outside the U.S. and have been strong in many countries around the world including those and we write -- in each of those countries, we have a strong franchise and an attractive book of business that we've been writing for many years. They would typically run in the 80s across the cycle. So, 80s combined ratio, it could go up or down based on cat activity.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. Thank you very much.
Dom Addesso: Thank you, Elyse.
Operator: We'll go next to Kai Pan, Morgan Stanley.
Kai Pan: Thank you and good morning. The first question is on -- follow- up on Insurance segment. The second quarter topline grows 41% ex-crop and margin improvement of 210 basis points, very impressive. I just wonder, you mentioned it's very competitive marketplace. Could you tell us a little more how exactly do you gain market share in the marketplace? And why, after improving your margin because I'm assuming if you grow very fast, you probably -- there are certain so-called, I don't know the terms, new business apparently apply to this line of business as well. Can you maintain the margin or even improve the margin going forward?
Dom Addesso: Kai, this is Dom. I don't necessarily agree with your assertion or assumption that growth comes -- with growth underwriting deterioration. As I just kind of described in response to Elyse's question, the diversification across many different product segments allows us to maintain our underwriting integrity and increase capacity to those lines of business getting adequate returns. We do think that we are improving our traditional, there still some improvement that we think we can garner particularly in the Property segment, remembering that the first half of the year. So, Property, as Jonathan pointed out, had a number of cat events, but also, as we described in non-cat events, adding two points of the attritional, and we anticipate that, as the year plays out, that we'll some improvement in those areas. So, we would certainly anticipate an improvement in combined ratio picture on the insurance side, again, coming from diversity, diversification most business unit, and products within those business units. And remembering that we are a specialty insurer, and we are not commercial. We're not into [Indiscernible] business or those areas that are subject to, in our views, some of the more competitive pressures in the marketplace.
Craig Howie: I would just add to that Kai that there's really a couple of things here to remember. Number one is that we have doubled our underwriting staff over the last two years. So, we had a lot more boots on the ground, seeking profitable opportunities in the lines of business we have chosen. Secondly, we have launched literally dozens of products. So, to Dom's point about diversification across platform, it significant, it's coming from a number of different areas. To the point I tried to raise earlier, it's not -- growth is not linear across our platform, it's not all moving in lock step. There are several actions being taken still to try to drive a better attritional result. So, we're seeing now the effects of all those efforts that have happened over the last couple of years.
Kai Pan: Thank you for the expanse answers. My second question on the Reinsurance side. You talked a little bit more about what caused the deterioration, 210 basis points, what are the moving parts? And you mentioned about the crop reinsurance, about property pro rata treaties. How much -- could you quantify how much each basically contributed to the year-over-year deterioration? And do you think that will be a normal stable run rate going forward?
Dom Addesso: Well, what the stable run rate. The attritional that we have on the reinsurance?
Kai Pan: Yes, exactly. Yes.
Dom Addesso: Well, some of that is dependent upon what happens with future rate levels, right? And I don't know that we have all the details that could give you that. So, we do have some of it. So, growth in crop that have 4.6 point impact, we had -- some of the increase due to pro rata had an impact of approximately three points, so that will give you some indications on the attrition. That's what what's driving the higher attrition.
Kai Pan: That's in the U.S. Reinsurance segment?
Dom Addesso: That's U.S., yes.
Kai Pan: Okay, great. Last one--
Dom Addesso: On the international side, we had explained improvement in some of the operations there, Middle East, Africa, showing some improvement in the non-cat loss trend and that we had Bermuda site, we had an increased due to higher ERR on some of the treaty -- higher ERR picked on some of the treaties we've written. So, it varies across the entire portfolio. And the reason I kind of go through some of these in detail is reflect the fact that, it's what I said before, Everest has -- generally is an operational strategy, moves around various lines of businesses and I can't tell you necessarily what 1/1, for example, will bring us and we could change our portfolio again. So, it's little difficult to answer.
John Doucette: And Kai, this is John. Just to add a little bit color to that. And a lot of this is -- you also may be better to look at the year-to-date numbers as opposed to the quarter, because there's always going to be quarterly volatility just from large risk losses that happen, non-cat-cat events or weather losses that happen that that move these things around. So, we think the year-to-date attritional combined ratio is more reflective for the Reinsurance operation.
Kai Pan: Great. Thank you so much. I probably back in the queue. Thank you.
John Doucette: Thank you, Kai.
Operator: We'll go next to Josh Shanker, Deutsche Bank.
Joshua Shanker: Yes, good morning everyone. You guys have already surprised [ph] yourselves on expense ratio and expense management were not being much better than peers; to what extent you need to grow the Insurance business to be competitive from an expense management standpoint?
Dom Addesso: What do we need to grow the expense ratio to?
Joshua Shanker: No, the overall volumes for your scale where you think you said that you cannot have a competitive run rate expense ratio better than peers?
Jon Zaffino: Hi, Josh, this is Jon. I think we're there. Generally, I think--
Joshua Shanker: You're there. You're there now.
Jon Zaffino: We're there now. I mean, if you look at where we are year-to-date, I think that expense ratio compared to those who write the lines of business we do across the geographies we write them, I think it will stock up very, very well, in fact well above the pure average. Secondly, when you look at a lot of the activities that we have pursued, our investments have been all across our platform. We're equally excited about the investments we're making our claims department, our actuarial teams, technology, et cetera. So, I think we have a pretty good feel for the expenses that are coming into the system and against the earned premiums that we're forecasting. I think we feel pretty good about it.
Joshua Shanker: Okay. And as you grow, obviously requires more capital, you're not buying back stock; you're using it to grow your business. Are you growing at the pace of excess capital generation or is that the limiting factor that you had more capital; you could grow faster or you growing faster than you're generating capital?
Dom Addesso: Our capital growth is kind of consistent with our premium growth. Our premium growth is -- we have sufficient capital for the growth that we've had for the first half of the year. If anything, our excess capital position has maybe just inched up a very little bit, but not enough to warrant that we would increase -- go back in terms of the short-term. We've purchased particularly at the levels that are stock of that today.
Joshua Shanker: Okay. That's that. And thank you very much.
Dom Addesso: Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll next to Mayor Shields, KBW.
Meyer Shields: Thanks. Good morning. Two really quick questions. One, is it fair to infer with U.S. Reinsurance that the movement to higher attachment point is limiting your exposure to what seems to have been really bad non-catastrophe weather?
John Doucette: Hi, Meyer, this is John. There's certainly some of that, that we -- and I think that you saw that last quarter as well, that some of the noise. So, in general, market losses of certain size are going to be more an Insurance loss than a Reinsurance loss. And I think, directionally, given what we've been doing with the book, it would mean that it would take larger, the real noteworthy headline cat losses and not just the things you see on TV with the good video images. It would really take larger ones to cause larger losses for us.
Meyer Shields: Okay. Thanks. And then broadly, I guess, this would be Insurance and Reinsurance. There's been a lot of commentary about sort of accelerating social inflation, are you seeing that? How are you booking that in your current accident effect [ph]?
Dom Addesso: I'll ask Craig to speak to that.
Craig Howie: I'm sorry could you repeat the question?
Dom Addesso: Social inflation and its impact on our portfolio?
Craig Howie: I think we always take a look at what the inflation is when we look at loss cost trend on the overall portfolio, Meyer. And we look at not only social inflation, but we look at everything that's going on claim inflation, social inflation. We look at the frequency and severity of the claims as they come through as well. But that's always part of our process as we go through picking our loss estimates.
John Doucette: And Meyer its John, just to add a little more. I think also there's no one simple one line answer to that. We have -- across the group, we have 300 IBNR groups in many lines of business, in many territories around it and what -- and how social inflation or claims inflation or other things like that are driving loss cost. It is dynamic, it varies. I would say though that we have spent a lot of time between feedback loops, between pricing actuaries and underwriters and reserving estuaries and the underwriting and pricing to make sure that we are thoughtful and how we think about that, and are able to respond to what we see as changing market condition.
Dom Addesso: And that's not something that's new to the industry. It's something that all companies have to deal with. And if you look at our reserving history, I think it demonstrates that we're properly taking those factors into account and establishing our reserve position.
Meyer Shields: Right. No, that's very helpful. I'm just -- I'm trying to get a handle on whether on the sort of simplistic trends or aggregate trends that we look at from the outside with anything material going on?
Dom Addesso: No, loss cost trend obviously have been rather tamed for a number of years. And it's a little tough to project when that social inflation for example kicks in, but general inflation, of course, has been relatively modest. Other than healthier trends, of course, which impacts [Indiscernible].
Meyer Shields: Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you very much.
Dom Addesso: Any -- I don't think we have any other questions on the call?
Operator: We'll go next to Kai Pan, Morgan Stanley.
Kai Pan: Thank you for a couple of follow-ups. First one, there's on your Lloyd's business, recently there are some additional interest in the acquisition in the marketplace you're building your own, at this time, do you prefer build versus buy?
Dom Addesso: Across all of our businesses, that's our preference. It doesn't mean, however, that we wouldn't -- if something came across our desk that looked very strategic and could propel us to a different level more quickly and didn't have huge integration issues and/or legacy concerns, we would certainly consider it. And of course, if you're pointing to Lloyd's, but I would say that Lloyd's is a platform. It's not necessarily the entire strategy if you will. It's a platform that enables us to execute our Continental European strategy as well as outside of North America and Europe. And we can -- we have other areas that we are pursuing, our other platforms that we're considering again internal build that would enable us to move forward on those ventures.
Kai Pan: Okay. Last one if I may for Craig, it's about tax rates. What's your normalized tax rate if you think about your budget level of catastrophe losses?
Craig Howie: Well, we typically have looked at the range before Kai. When we look at our tax rate, we essentially go and we look at with and without catastrophe losses as you've heard us say in the past. So, last year for 2016, was a mild year for tax rates, but -- and we had a full year effective tax rate of about 10%. What I would say to you is, if we had no catastrophes in the year, in other words, more taxable income, that rate could go as high as up to 13%. But that would give you a relative range of where I would expect to be.
Kai Pan: Okay, great. Well, thank you so much for your time and good luck.
Craig Howie: All right.
Dom Addesso: Thank you, Kai.
Operator: That does conclude our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the conference back over to Mr. Addesso for any additional or closing remarks.
Dom Addesso: Again thank you very much. And thanks again to all for your participation this morning in the call and your questions. As we mentioned, the growth in the first half for us has been strong both Insurance and Reinsurance, but our first priority continues to be underwriting profit. That's why you see us continually optimizing our portfolio on the Reinsurance side, for example, as we change attachment points, increase pro rata, non-renewal certain layers, diversify into various regions, and rotate into other risk classes like mortgage, credit, or structured solutions. So, it is with an emphasis on an underwriting profit. In the Insurance segment, our underwriting strategy is a product specialty and diversification again, which is, as I said earlier, allows us to provide capacity to the most attractive areas and also clearly minimize the impact of any one line of business to the extent it reaches some difficulty. So, diversification and specialization remain cornerstone of what we do. And so for the reasons that I just mentioned, we remain optimistic that through the cycle, we can outperform the overall market. Again, thank you very much and I look forward to meeting with many of you in the weeks ahead. Have a good day.
Operator: That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2017 Q1  (2017-04-25 10:30:00) =====
Executives: Beth Farrell - VP, IR Dom Addesso - President and CEO Craig Howie - CFO John Doucette - President and CEO of Reinsurance Operations Jon Zaffino - President, North America Insurance Operations
Analysts: Elyse Greenspan - Wells Fargo Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley Sarah DeWitt - JPMorgan Jay Gelb - Barclays Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank Brian Meredith - UBS Nicholas Mezick - KBW
Operator: Good day everyone, and welcome to the First Quarter 2017 Earnings Call of Everest Re Group. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I will turn the conference over to Ms. Beth Farrell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Beth, please go ahead.
Beth Farrell: Thank you, Debbie. Good morning and welcome to Everest Re Group's first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. On the call with me today are Dom Addesso, the company's President and Chief Executive Officer; Craig Howie, our Chief Financial Officer; John Doucette, our President and CEO of Reinsurance Operations; and Jon Zaffino, our President of North American Insurance Operations. Before we begin, I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I note that statements made during today's call, which are forward-looking in nature, such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations and the like are subject to various risks. As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations. Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements. Now, let me turn the call over to Dom.
Dom Addesso: Thanks, Beth. Good morning to all, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call, and we have a positive report for you today. Before we dive into the quarterly results, I would like to touch briefly on the characteristics that have helped the Everest Re Group deliver above average returns. Certainly our size and scope are important differentiators, but more critical to our success is the entrepreneurial and decisive culture that permeates our organization. We are not satisfied with the status quo, but instead, continually seek to expand our horizons for new opportunities as well as increase our penetration to existing clients. Examples of this would be our expansion into credit opportunities in both our Reinsurance and Insurance businesses. And just this quarter, we participated on the new National Flood Reinsurance Program which represents new business to the market. As governments seek to privatize certain markets, we could see similar additional opportunity. So why is this important? These new market segments allow us to continue to diversify our portfolio away from the more competitive markets and sustain underwriting profitability. This, and a constant focus on expenses, and our expanding use of capital market tools explains why we continue to outperform the market. This now leads me to our discussion on results, which again were quite positive for the quarter. Operating income increased 17% in the quarter to $260 million, giving rise to $6.29 in earnings per share, and a 13% operating ROE for the quarter. The increase in earnings is a result of an increase in both the underwriting and investment income. Furthermore, the underwriting result improved in both the Reinsurance and Insurance division. While our reinsurance combined ratio was up slightly over the prior year, due to a relatively minor increase in cash, the increase in earned premium propelled us to a higher underwriting result. Increase in earned premium is a continuing result of broadening our reinsurance product set over the last several quarters into crop, mortgage, and other credit-related opportunity. Entering into credit-related business has contributed to the almost one-point improvement in quarter's attritional combined ratio, 80%. John Doucette will discuss this in greater detail in his Reinsurance operations. The Insurance segment results improved year-over-year to an underwriting gain position. This was in part a result of the drag in the prior year from the crop operation that we sold late last year. Excluding the Heartland crop business, the attritional combined ratio of 98.1 for the quarter reflects a stable loss ratio, but an uptick in the commission and operating expense ratio. The commission ratio was up on a changing business mix, while operating expenses are trending as planned. We continue to build out the North America and European platforms, and have had great success with gross premiums written up 21% in the quarter excluding crop. Expenses are still outpacing earned premium thereby putting pressure on the expense ratio. But we would expect this to stabilize as the operation matures. However, despite this more elevated expense ratio, you will find that by comparison we are still quite efficient relative to the market. We are pleased with what the team has accomplished in a relatively short timeframe, which was aided in part by the market dislocation created by a few large players. In fact, given the opportunities presented by this market turmoil, we accelerated our investment in the operation. You will hear more details on all this later in Jon Zaffino's operations report. Another strong spot this quarter was investment income, which increased approximately $20 million. Our alternative portfolio accounted for some of that improvement, along with a higher asset base. Our strategy here is not much different than the fundamentals principles we use in our total business, conservative yet look for differentiated opportunities that provide good margins relative to risk. As a result, our overall portfolio has a beta of less than one, but yet our returns have been in the upper quartile relative to our peer group. Overall, we continue our optimism in our ability to not only outperform, but also provide above-market returns through the cycle. I maintain that optimism because of, as I referenced earlier, the well-diversified platform we have built, but perhaps more importantly because of our adaptability to market changes and opportunities. That comes from a corporate culture that embraces new opportunities, and that has the skilled talent to execute. You will hear more about our newest initiatives from my colleagues and how we continue to build our franchise for the future. Thank you and I look forward to your questions later on. Now to Craig, for the financial report.
Craig Howie: Thank you, Dom, and good morning everyone. Everest had another solid quarter of earnings, with net income of $292 million for the first quarter of 2017. This compares to net income of $172 million for the first quarter of 2016. The 2017 result represents an annualized net income return on equity of over 14%. Net income included $32 million of net after-tax realized capital gains compared to $51 million of capital losses in the first quarter of last year. 2017 capital gains were primarily attributable to fair value adjustments on the equity portfolio. After-tax operating income for the first quarter was $260 million compared to $223 million in 2016. The overall underlying gain for the group was $183 million for the quarter compared to an underwriting gain of $171 million in the same period last year all segments reported underwriting gains for the quarter. In the first quarter of 2017, Everest saw $20 million of current year catastrophe losses related to Cyclone Debbie in Australia compared to $10 million of catastrophe losses during the first quarter of 2016. The overall current year attritional combined ratio was 84.5% down from 85.3% in the first quarter of 2016 primarily due to a lower commission ratio in 2017. Our overall expense ratio of 5.8% was down slightly from the first quarter of 2016. Our reported combined ratio of 86% was flat compared to the first quarter last year. For investments, pre-tax investment income was $122 million for the quarter on our $18 billion investment portfolio. Investment income was 19% above last year; this result was primarily driven by an increase of limited partnership income which was up $17 million from the first quarter of 2016 primarily due to the turnaround in energy related investments compared to last year. Pre-tax year on the overall portfolio was 2.8% with the duration of just over three years. Foreign exchanges reported another income, for the first quarter of 2017 foreign exchange losses were $4 million similar to the first quarter of 2016. Other income also included $2 million of earnings and fees from Mt. Logan Re compared to $3 million of income in the first quarter of last year. On income taxes, the 9% effective tax rate on operating income was on the low end of our expected range for the year. First quarter of 2017 tax rate is slightly lower than the 10% tax rate for the full year of 2016 due to a $5 million tax benefit for a size B tax accounting change related to share based compensation. Previously these tax benefits were book through additional paid in capital in the balance sheet. The effective tax rate is an annualized calculation that includes plan to Catastrophe losses for the rest of the year should catastrophe was coming lower than this estimate it would be expected that the tax rate would go up. Stable cash flows continues with operating cash flows of $382 million for the quarter compared with $375 million in the first quarter of 2016. Shareholders' equity for the group was $8.3 billion at the end of the first quarter up $272 million from year end 2016. This is after taking into account the capital return for $51 million of dividends period in the first quarter of 2017. Capital position remains very strong and continues to grow. Thank you and now John Doucette will provide a review of the Reinsurance operation.
John Doucette: Thank you, Craig. Good morning. We are pleased to report another strong quarter with a $178 million of reinsurance underwriting profit. Our earnings reflect the continued strength of our reinsurance franchise the stain by product and geographic diversification, underwriting discipline and ultimately relevance to our client. Everest long standing global presence high ratings and nimble execution underpin our outperformance through this part of the underwriting cycle. Before discussing renewals, here's some color on the first quarter results. Total gross written premium for the first quarter was $1.2 billion an increase of 19% compared to Q1, 2016. There were a combination of growth on existing business and new business opportunities. This included $53 million of crop premium on the new quarter share arrangement done in conjunction with the sale of Heartland as well as new structured reinsurance business. The growth in these profitable, diversifying, and strategic line, fortifies our competitive strength in an otherwise difficult market. Additionally, these customized transactions require a differentiating breath and skill from a sizeable and strong partner. Our agility in executing these bespoke transactions is highly valued by our clients, and accomplished to attracting best-in-class underwriting actuarial and analytical talent and providing them appropriate resources within a lean and responsive organization conducive to creative solution. The Q1 loss ratio increased from 55.6% to 53.2% in Q1 2016, driven in part by an increase in the cat loss ratio with losses in Cyclone Debbie impacting the quarter. In addition, the quarter experienced lower favorable prior year loss development and an uptick in the current year attritional loss ratio. The shift in the composition of our book to the higher expected loss ratio on a new crop business accounted for the slight increase in our attritional loss ratio. In our U.S. reinsurance segment, Q1 2017 gross written premium was up 8% to $579 million. Growth was driven by crop and credit related reinsurance writing, offset by a 9% decrease in property line as we walked away from underpriced pro rata business. The Q1 combined ratio for the U.S. reinsurance segment was up 3.1 point, affected by the new crop writing with a higher attritional loss ratio and non-catastrophe weather-related losses. This was partially offset by a lower commission ratio. Although the crop writing produced higher combined ratios, they consumed relatively little capital. Our international reinsurance segment, premium was $266 million, up 13% for the quarter and up 8% on a constant dollar basis. We saw growth across most of our territories: Middle East, Africa, Latin America, Singapore, and Canada. Increased property pro rata business and some higher cat XOL business, particularly in loss-affected region coupled with our growth in our worldwide facultative operation provided for this growth; the combined ratio for this segment improved by 1.1 point to 86.6% despite higher cat losses and lower level of reserve release. This was due to an almost 6 point improvement in the attritional loss ratio, driven by better experience in certain region and a lower mix of casualty pro rata business. Our Bermuda segment written premium increased 57% to $321 million, about 61% on a constant dollar basis. The growth was largely from new business including new credit opportunities and account true ups on financial line treaty. In addition, premium growth also came from both London and Europe, including motor quota shares and new strategic reinsurance deals with large core global client. The combined ratio improved to 83.5% with a lower current year attritional loss ratio, no prior year reserve development, and a lower expense ratio. Moving on to the 4/1 renewals; Everest is well positioned in a market that appears to be stabilizing. Rate pressures continue but are showing signs of moderating, as ample capacity is partially offset by increase in demand in some zones. In the Asia-Pacific market, renewal rate in loss-affected area such as New Zealand were up an average of 5% with rates in a range of flat to down 10% in other areas. Japanese renewal decreases were more moderate at flat to down 5%. In the U.S. property markets, excessive loss rates were flat to down 5% with indications that some early 6/1 renewals will be flat. We are expecting incremental Florida demand fostering some market stability, but this could be somewhat offset by decreased purchasing by citizen. As Dom mentioned, we did participate on the new National Flood Program that came to the market and we are exploring other potential opportunities around flood coverage. In our casualty book, reinsurance rates, terms and conditions are stable but reductions on underlying business continue, put pressure on overall economic. Nevertheless, we were able to reallocate our capital to more favorable opportunities, and we see some improvement in certain facultative lines. Internationally, some of the recent currency movements have allowed foreign-based competitors to report accounting gains, softening the otherwise REIT profitability across major classes and delaying market stabilization. However, rate decreases were smaller than in prior renewal. In the U.K, augment rate change which has affected the UK model market has caused the market disruption with treaties being extended as insurers reassess their strategy. Large rate increases and program restructurings have been the norm on affected motor programs. Throughout the world, our clients demand multi-faceted solutions commensurate with their expanding scope, complex capital requirements and unique demand. Our clients clearly want to trade with reinsurers like Everest that offers scale, expertise, and a sustainable franchise. We just completed our latest cap fund transaction with the issuance of $1.25 billion of Kilimanjaro 2 catastrophe bond. That brings our total catastrophe bond capacity to $2.8 billion, which in conjunction with Mt. Logan and our balance sheet elevates every total capacity and capital across those rated and unrated balance sheets to almost $13 billion. This place is among the very largest reinsurers in the industry making us even more relevant to our clients and brokers. Overall, Everest Reinsurance operations remain well-positioned and diversified by product, distribution, geography, client, and capital, giving us numerous levers to control our market efficiency and effectiveness. We continually enhance our strategic focus to succeed in the new reinsurance world order. Thank you. And now, I will turn it over to Jon Zaffino to review our insurance operations.
Jon Zaffino: Thank you, John, and good morning. The Everest Global Insurance operations performed well and in line with our expectations in the first quarter. Many strategic actions we have taken will establish a world-class specialty diversified insurance organization by becoming increasing evident in our results; they consistently expand in top line across a balance portfolio, a testament to the relevant we are achieving among our insurance and brokers. We continue applying opportunities to profitably expand our business across our global platform despite a challenging market environment. As a result, Everest Insurance is firmly positioned in the market landscape as a specialty provider offering a live breadth of product solutions in lines of business that we expect to outperform over the long-term. As in prior quarters, due to the divestiture of Heartland in late third quarter of 2016, I will be discussing our comparative results, excluding this business. For the first quarter of 2017, the Global Insurance operations registered $434 million in gross written premium, an increase of $75 million or 21% over first quarter of 2016. Another outstanding result and consistent with the growth rate we saw in 4Q 2016; this represents the ninth consecutive quarter of growth for our Global Insurance Operation, each division within the North American segment contributed to this with notable strong performances from our Canadian and accident and health platforms. Each of which grew in excess of 30%. A further note, roughly 18% of our production in the quarter was derived from our recent new business launches and from our Lloyd's operation, which as you will recall has entered only second year of account. We remain encouraged by this balanced contribution across the diversity of our growing underwriting platform. Net written premiums for the quarter were $346 million, an increase of $37 million or 12% over 2016. As we've shared in the past, net written premium growth slightly lags gross written premium growth due to the marginally more conservative reinsurance position we have taken to support our many new underwriting divisions. There were notable transactions in the quarter particularly within our teenage group that also contributed to a slightly lower net to gross ratio. We expect this to normalize throughout the year. Net earned premium in the quarter increased by more in line with our gross written premium on a percentage basis producing $323 million, which represents 17% growth from the first quarter of 2016. Turning to the combined ratio, the GAAP combined ratio for the first quarter was 98.4%. While we are pleased to produce and underwriting profit with more than 5 million in the segment, we expect to show continued improvement as earned from new develops in future quarters. The overall loss and loss adjustment expense ratio for the Global Insurance Operations remained essentially flat year-over-year registering a 68.25 in the first quarter of 2017 were 68.1% in the first quarter of 2016. On a nutritional basis, these ratios improved 67.8% and our flat period-over-period. Let me offer a couple of additional comments to further amplify our performance. First, for the 1Q '16 and 1Q '17 had unprecedented levels of connectivity in the U.S. with 12 PCS events declared in first quarter of this year. Despite this our book is performing well, our conservative loss estimates for our US property lines coupled with a series of deliberate underwriting actions taken over the past several quarters are largely mitigated the impact of these events to us. Second as earned premium comes in on several of our new business launches referenced earlier, which have historically generated better combine ratios, we expect the shipping portfolio mix will result in improved overall profitability. Again the bottom-line, we expect improvement in the underlying loss ratios as we move through the year. Our expense ratio in the first quarter was 30.3% up when compared to 28.2% in the first quarter of 2016 were essentially in line with the full year 2016 results up 29.9%. The changed first quarter of 2016 represents roughly a one point increase in our commission in premium tax expenses and a one point increase in our operating expenses. There remained moderate pressure on our expense ratio due to the continued organic build of our operation along with the impact from the lag of earned premium. We anticipate the expense ratio to moderate and stabilize as we continue on our growth path. As Dom mentioned an expense ratio of roughly 30% remains very competitive in the Specialty Insurance segment. I'll now turn to the performance of our major insurance portfolios starting with the North America P&C book which is our largest business. In the first quarter, the core P&C portfolio grew 15% or $353 million over the prior year period. They continue to gain momentum across the breadth of our specialty P&C operations headlining the quarter were a continued steady growth from our new business initiatives, which represented 17% of our total premium production in the quarter; the highest level we have experienced today. The continued addition of outstanding talents supports our strategy across underwriting claims technology, actuarial and several support areas. And the announcement of a portfolio transaction, we consummated to effectively acquire renewal rates to a direct and facultative book of property business. This book of business closely aligned with our own appetite newly into our property expansion strategy, and we are pleased to welcome several new talents and underwriters to the Everest family. Our assets in health group also delivered an excellent quarter of growth, with a 38% increase over the prior year comparable quarter. Our continued efforts to thoughtfully diversify and grow our product lines, including medical stop loss continue to prove successful. Notably in the quarter, several of our new A&H products, particularly our sports visibility offering also contributed meaningfully to growth. We expect we will continue to find opportunities across the balance book of A&H business as the year progresses. Our Lloyd's operation also continued its expansion. The Syndicate contributed $21 million to the insurance growth in the quarter, nearly double the contribution from 4Q 2016. All lines of business ranging from our property through our professional indemnity books experienced growth despite a challenging rate environment. We remain deliberate in our growth pursuits and are finding opportunities for continued expansion. Turning to the operating environment, the first quarter represented a predictably mixed picture from a rate perspective. The overall level of rate change varies meaningfully my major line of business. As a general statement across the entirety of the North American portfolio, I would say that rate pressures are somewhat mitigating. In fact, we have many lines of business that are gaining rate across our book. Let's take a look at this my major line of business. Commercial Auto again headlined our rate change results in the first quarter, as it has in several prior quarters. We continue to achieve high single to low double-digit rate changes for this line of business. Again, our exposure to this line is limited as it continues to represent less than 5% of our overall writings. Also, as in prior quarters, the primarily general liability and umbrella markets continue to remain in the tight range and are basically flat year-over-year. The professional liability markets remain competitive with continued rate pressures in the mid single-digit range across various lines. We continue to take a conservative posture in this market. Of particular interest to us is the broader attention to rate in terms being exhibited in the U.S. property market, while capacity remains plentiful, the market continues to find the bottom. Directional price changes month-by-month are recognizing this reality. 12 PCS convective storm cat events in the first quarter, a record for insured losses, on top of last year's prior record quarter should add momentum to this price action. As we noted last quarter, we feel there is a larger positive story emerging that will allow us to selectively expand our portfolio. Finally, workers' compensation, our largest line of business, continued to experience moderate rate pressure in the low to mid single-digit range on the back of continued favorable underwriting results. While not an unexpected result, there is still an opportunity to consider new business in certain select territories as we closely monitor the many trends across this line. So, while the rate environment is trending predictably line by line, the overall rate picture is improving across the entirety of our portfolio. In conclusion, we are pleased with our start to the year. Our team continues to execute very well against the major strategic objectives within our organic growth plan. As a result, our market brand and capabilities continue to grow. The Annual RIMS Conference, which is underway as we speak, is reaffirming our belief in the Everest insurance value proposition. Based on the client interaction and meeting schedules of our colleagues in attendance, it is clear we are being embraced by a growing range of brokers and insurers alike. We look forward to continuing our momentum and reporting back to you on our progress next quarter. With that, let me turn it back over to Beth for q-and-a.
Beth Farrell: Thank you, Jon. That ends our prepared remarks. I'd like to open up for the Q&A session.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question today from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi, good morning. My first question, I was hoping just to get a little bit more color. You guys saw exceptional growth in your reinsurance business to start the year. I know lots of moving parts with the crop, some growth in credit, and then also in other geographies outside of the U.S., but when you kind of blend your market outlook together, how do you really see the growth trajectory over the remaining three quarters. And just a question in relation to the Q1, is any of the premium growth that you saw kind of one-time in nature or are there any multi-year covers included within the strong growth you saw in the first quarter?
John Doucette: Good morning, Elyse. It's John, and thanks for the question. So, I think there were some one-off parts to the growth in the reinsurance operation. As we mentioned, there were some true ups, but there is also a combination of growth in the mortgage and credit lines. Some of those are new deals, and some of those are multi-year deals where we're continuing to get premium from prior quarters. So we would think a normalized growth rate would be high single-digit.
Elyse Greenspan: And do you think that high single-digit is something that's sustainable over the balance of 2017 based on how you see the market right now?
John Doucette: We do. We do think that -- I mean, there's a lot of gives and takes in that, but we continue to see new opportunities. There's places where we're coming off business that we don't think is attractive, but at the same time we continue to find new opportunities, both -- we talked about the motor quota shares in Europe tied to Solvency II. Also, in the U.K. motor market there's opportunities. But then also in the mortgage and the credit and one-off structured deals that we have in the pipeline now.
Dom Addesso: And this is Dom. I mean, it's also highly dependant upon June 1. So while we have had lots of new opportunities and growth in new areas, new types of products that we're offering, in particular credit, but depending on what happens with rates is just one; it's still yet to be determined. So hard to predict some sustainability to our growth rate, and we don't yet know what June 1 will be offering us.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay, great. You guys [indiscernible] loss, did you guys have any adverse development associated with the change in the rate there?
Dom Addesso: The [indiscernible] loss, the prior period event, and that was covered in our prior year-end reserve position. And it's a kind of thing that though not specifically known at prior years, the kind of thing our reserve analysis contemplates for things that can go wrong. So it's completely covered in that reserve position. We estimate that with the current discount rate that they're applying up to $30 million was the impact.
Elyse Greenspan: And that's included in how your reserves are set today?
Dom Addesso: Yes, absolutely.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. And then in terms of capital return, there was no share repurchase in the quarter. I know we also saw a slowdown at the end of 2016. When you guys are thinking through capital return right now, how do you kind of balance just the growth opportunities that you're seeing in reinsurance as well as insurance? And then just also where your staff is obviously trading at a higher valuation, so can you just update us on your thought process for the first quarter, as well as when you think about capital return over the balance of 2017.
Dom Addesso: Sometimes I feel like a broken record on this one. As you know, we do not give any predictions as to what we will be doing in terms of share repurchases. But relative to the first quarter how we were thinking about it was that, as you did see, we had significant growth. So we remained a little bit more cautious on capital return, to the point of not buying in any shares. This coupled with the fact that we had a number of cat events that were potentially swirling out, surround [ph] out there. So that was part of our deliberations. And then the third, I think that you made reference to of course, was our rise in stock price. While in and of itself and by itself not a sole determinant, but along with the other factors led us to not be purchasing any shares back in the first question. And none of that means that we won't be back into the market throughout the year. But again, it has to be balanced up against events are the occurring in the marketplace as well as our premium growth trajectory.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. Thanks so much, and congrats on a great start to the year.
Dom Addesso: Thank you, Elyse.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley.
Kai Pan: Thank you and good morning. And so first question on the insurance side. What do you think are your competitive advantages that you can grow in this -- like a more changing market condition, at the same time improving your core or your combined ratio towards your 95%, like maybe long-term target? How soon do you think you can get there?
Jon Zaffino: Good morning, Kai, this is Jon. I think our competitive position in the market is quite strong. And think sits on the backs of we are obviously trading with the benefit of a significant balance sheet from the Everest Group, which credentials exceedingly well in a number of our chosen markets. We have been able to amass what we feel is very distinguished talent, taking advantage of the dislocation in the market over the past couple of years. And remember, our insurance platform has been around for a while, so we have a pretty good reach in terms of different market segments, different product lines, et cetera. So as we refined our strategy and focused on the areas that we thought would contribute more to our bottom line and also help us increase our relevance with clients by providing solutions. We're now starting to see the momentum of all those actions take hold. So that's been very encouraging. As for why we feel that's going to produce better results, there's a lot of changes. So to borrow John's comment earlier, there's a lot of ins and outs here, lot of different mix scenarios coming in. Our new businesses tend to trend at a lower ELR, expected loss ratios, than we've had in the past. So as those gain more scale, as we exit certain lines, such as our crop operation which is better handled in our reinsurance side, as we deemphasize a couple of other areas that had higher loss ratios, we expect that combination and mix to produce better performance that we've seen historically.
Dom Addesso: And I think in part, Kai, to answer that, the -- a little bit of market disruption along with, as Jonathan pointed out, the significant capital base that is attractive to our clients and brokers, but that market disruption again allowed us to get very capable people, but also as other competitors were reevaluating their strategies, that enabled us to grow certain segments faster than we might otherwise would've been able to do.
Kai Pan: And do you see yourself can get down to the mid-90's combined ratio next couple of years?
Dom Addesso: Well, one interesting point that we shouldn't gloss over is that the first quarter, while none of the events -- the weather events, catastrophes if you will, PCI events that Jonathan referenced, while none of them reached our threshold for declaring them to be cats, nonetheless, we had $15 million of weather losses in the first quarter of the insurance operations, which amounts to four-and-a-half points in the combined ratio for the insurance results. So as you could see, we're pretty much already where you're referencing.
Kai Pan: Okay, that's great. My second question is on the reinsurance side. So I just wonder, is there any seasonality because now you have the crop reinsurance in the U.S. reinsurance book. That would impact your second quarter and third quarter year-over-year comparison in term of the core combined ratio.
John Doucette: Hi, Kai, it's John. There isn't that much seasonality. And crop, while it's a new piece given the move from the insurance to the reinsurance, in the grand scheme of things it's relatively small across the overall global portfolio for the reinsurance operations. So I would say, no, there's not really much seasonality.
Kai Pan: So the fourth quarter and the first quarter results should be a good indication for the coming two quarters?
Dom Addesso: You're talking in terms of loss ratio?
Kai Pan: Yes, just the overall, the core combined ratio, attritional combined ratio, because there are probably different mix between loss and, like, commission expenses.
Dom Addesso: Yes, that doesn't move around all that much because from quarter to quarter based on our pegged loss ratios. Obviously, when we get to the fourth quarter we have our reserve here, and reserve review which could impact the attritional in that quarter. I don't know that you'd refer to that as a seasonality, but our earned premium is earned ratably through the year, and we book a consistent estimated loss ratio absent any [indiscernible] type events.
Kai Pan: Great. Just quick number clarification, there it's $30 million Ogden [ph] rate impact, is that already including in this quarter reserve development, or in the fourth quarter one? You said year-end [technical difficulty] reserve…
Dom Addesso: What I was referencing was that the impact of Ogden in terms of a dollar amount wasn't made known of course until the first quarter. But what I was referencing was that we consider that to be a prior-year event which was more than covered in our year-end reserve review. While not specifically of course an item in the year-end reserve review just like many other discrete events that occur many quarters or years later frankly when you look at reserves pointing this is that our reserve review contemplates the fact that things can go wrong, things can happen, but you cannot specifically identify what they might be. So, our reserve review has a certain amount of conservatism built into it, or I would describe as a fact that the point of the reserve review as an unknown event and we have been in situation it was prior year event for us and well within the balance of being covered in our year-end reserve review contemplations.
Kai Pan: It's great. Well, thank you so much for all the answers.
Dom Addesso: Thank you, Kai.
Operator: We will take our next question from Sarah DeWitt with JPMorgan.
Sarah DeWitt: Hi, good morning. In the Reinsurance segment, I was surprised with the underlying combined ratio improved year-over-year in what is still competitive market, can you talk about how you're achieving this and how sustainable is that going forward?
Dom Addesso: The simple answer is, Sarah, is just the changing mix, so as for example as mortgage and other credit related opportunities as that premium begins to flow through the books that carriers a lower loss ratio, combined ratio than which you would think about as the more traditional lines. That's frankly the simplest example of explanation. We will also have quota share coming into the reinsurance book, which also helps maintain that ratio.
Sarah DeWitt: Okay, great. And then just a couple of numbers questions, how much did the crop Reinsurance transaction contribute to the top line and then how much is your mortgage and credit business?
Dom Addesso: Crop was about $50 million.
Craig Howie: Yes, $53 million in the first quarter.
Sarah DeWitt: Okay. And how big is the mortgage and credit business?
Craig Howie: And the total mortgage of gross written premiums, it's about $150 million to $200 million.
Sarah DeWitt: Annually?
Craig Howie: In the quarter.
Dom Addesso: Sorry could you say that again?
Sarah DeWitt: That's an annual number or in the quarter?
Dom Addesso: Yes, that's annual.
Sarah DeWitt: Okay, great thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Jay Gelb with Barclays.
Jay Gelb: Thanks and good morning. My first question is on the outlook for the, the midyear Florida renewals where I believe you said hoping for flat rates I think it's pretty well understood that citizens insurance capacities can be down midyear in terms of demand for reinsurance protection but I just wanted understand if I have you correctly are you saying demand from other primary writers in Florida is going to enough to offset that. 
Dom Addesso: Well citizen is down because private market as soon much of that exposure so capacity will be soft from private market.
Jay Gelb: Okay, is there any influence do you think it midyear as a result of Matthew.
Craig Howie: We hope we think that there could be some influence but that all dependence on how much capital has been go into the market so look, based on the returns that the industry is producing on overall capital. We do you think it, it suggest that that rate should be in flat but there's no way for us to know what that might be right now.
John Doucette: This is John. There's also other contributing factors with AOB issue that's out there and that impacted people in 2016 including the capital position. The assignment of benefits, so the assignment of benefits issue that happened in that has been happening that has resulted in an increase in the attritional loss ratio for many of the Florida teams and so some of them had to go get more capital or in the process of getting more capital or raising more capital and as reinsurance is the form of capital. And so a lot of them are potentially looking to increase their buys whether it comes, whether that's on a quota share or on an excess loss basis, as well as some of the larger Florida seasons have also been diversifying outside the state, so as they've been growing, they have natural exposure growth for their overall books of business, their reinsurance demands to protect that book have also been increasing and we would see that to directionally to continue.
Jay Gelb: That is helpful, thanks very much. And then my separate question, Dom, in this year's annual shareholder letter, you talked about the decision to build in the Insurance segment as opposed to buy I'm kind of glad you brought that up in the letter hopefully it's pretty good jumping off point just to touch on it in a bit more detail.
Dom Addesso: That was specific question.
Jay Gelb: Yes, just in terms of -- in terms of that decision and kind of where you see the insurance segment going forward?
Dom Addesso: We have had this view for long time and it's not because we haven't considered opportunities that are out there and our view was based on the fact that integration since we had an existing operation as contrasted with not having one at all, we felt it was easier for us to grow our existing franchise. In the phase of acquisitions are tough because the integration issues are challenged in addition you're not quite sure talent that you're getting, the legacy issues that you might be attaining, there is a whole different face to the market in terms of how a particular company might be presenting itself to the distribution partners, they will have ability to kind of build our message, or culture or products or appetite all those things from the ground up is more attractive to us. And then, of course, it coupled with many of these acquisitions as you know are occurring at tremendous multiples creating lot of goodwill but that aside we are potentially buying businesses that have mid-single digit ROEs that is not and I'm paying a premium for that, that's not all that attractive. And what we think we have done here in the short years has been too we're still in the legacy issues that we've had but you think the current enforce portfolio as I mentioned before. Absent the weather losses as already we had in the first quarter as already in the low to mid single 90s combined ratio so, I think our strategy there is proving to be so far so good one.
Jay Gelb: And a final one, if I can, the reinsurance performance in the first quarter was incredibly strong especially taking to account it was a worst first quarter for catastrophe losses in the U.S. in over 20 years, is that -- can you talk a little about whether that's risk management program structure primary companies just retaining more exposure, or what -- how come we didn't see more that impact on Everest results on the Reinsurance side?
Dom Addesso: There wasn't one event right was many events which for the most part has fallen on within company retentions along with the fact that as we've mentioned each quarter for many quarters now we keep, we tend to keep moving up our attachment point there is a most competitive part of the market has been down low. And so, and it have been spreading our aggregate, so we have been diversifying our cap portfolio slightly moving up attachment point coupled with the fact that many scenes as their capital base is going to continue to retain more so it's all of those things not any one of them, but it's all of those things come into play.
Jay Gelb: Thank you again.
Dom Addesso: Thank you, Jay.
Operator: We'll go next to Joshua Shanker with Deutsche Bank.
Joshua Shanker: Yes, thank you. Can I start with mortgage reinsurance, for a second? I want to know how you think about catastrophe risk versus mortgage reinsurance risk, is it similar and whatever remodeling in terms of its exposure to a mortgage catastrophe, and to how much business is there to be written out, there what's going to cause mortgage insurers want to see that risk in the future?
John Doucette: Good morning, Josh. It's John. So, couple of things, so we have then as we've talked about on the last several calls focused on the mortgage opportunity within a broader credit play that we are doing, but mortgage is a meaningful part of that. And we do see -- so we have focus on that both in the underwriting side but also and arguably more importantly building out underwriting capabilities, analytical capabilities, ERM risk and very technical capabilities for us to be able to think about that really to get it -- to bring it up to the level of, which it has, we have done to the level of how have been moved to best-in-class over the last several years in the property side. So, in terms of how we think about to model it, we look at it from at the macro macro level and how it overlaps in intersection correlates with our asset portfolio. We think about it on an overall economic capital model to the group. We look at it on a realistic disaster scenario. We look at it as total limits that we deploy. We think about across years the correlation and the aggregation that can happen and really try to focus on what the economic situation is today and where we think it will be in the future so to determine how we want to play, where what attachment points we want to play at, how that would impact if something like the financial crisis of 2008 happen again, how that could perform.
Joshua Shankar: So, along those lines, is it normal think that sometime in the next decade, there will be a mortgage ad event? And is there a way to have that occur and avoid the loss of the underwriting?
John Doucette: Well, we have no idea if a loss is going to happen just like we don't know if catastrophe loss is going to happen. We…
Joshua Shankar: I can promise you a catastrophe loss will happen in the next 10 years. I am certain of that.
John Doucette: I am going to write that down. So -- but we -- we're going to build a book and have an underwriting strategy that we think will succeed based on underwriting conditions, macroeconomic conditions, pricing conditions, and we're going to adjust the book. And that's our job. That's Dom and mine and the rest of the team's job to do that to react and how we think the book will best move going forward. But we do –- we certainly manage to idea that a loss could happen and try to think of limits deployed and capital required in that context.
Dom Addesso: And it's also -- keep in mind that it's -- we tend to agree with you that you have to consider the fact that a loss can happen but it's also where you attach, how diversified you are. There is many factors which go into what the level of loss might be. And from a realistic disaster scenario perspective, the exposure that we have to the mortgage base is relative to property cat risk is much less and of course also relative to our capital, it's pretty small.
Joshua Shankar: And then I guess one more, can we expect that if you've done your homework correctly, a well-run mortgage rebook should outperform primary mortgage book?
John Doucette: I think the strength -- advantages and disadvantages of both clearly from a -- we have decided to make a reinsurance bet on it. And that gives us the benefit of hard dollar limits, that gives us the benefit of retentions, that gives us the benefit of having a compared to running an insurance operation far less resources, both capital and people wise. So, it gives us more ability to navigate the underwriting market, market cycle that could happen. So we feel like -- we feel pretty good about how we're deploying capacity and capital and our underwriting strategy and will be able to hopefully expand it if the market - the pricing and the market conditions allow but also be in a position to dial it back if we don't think we are getting paid a good risk adjusted return.
Joshua Shankar: And then quickly for Jon Zaffino, I want to know how he thinks about one, three, five-year plan? When you started like at the beginning of '15, did you have a three-year plan? Do you have a five-year plan? Wouldn't you sort of in the check points to note that the insurance business is performing in line with sort of the predicted plan on how to get this be important part of Everest Re?
Jon Zaffino: Sure, Josh. We have very much phased out a deliberate roadmap that aligns with what Dom mentioned before about an organic growth plan. What does that look like? What are the key milestones along that journey and how do we get there? So, certainly for us there was a few prominent themes in that process. Number one was sort of foundationally preparing the organization for that journey which is an ongoing everyday type of exercise. Certainly looking to enhance our market relevance in the form of people and products and distribution connectivity has also been very much a part of that. And then, certainly along the path we are going to make portfolio selection along the way. A lot of that work has been at the forefront of our activity in the last several quarters if not year and a half or so. But remember, we are still adding talent as we go here to make sure that we continue keep up with our growth and aspiration. So that's ongoing work. So I would say that we're very much on track. We're going to follow market opportunity where it presents itself. We don't have a sort of hard dollar specific target in mind other than we certainly see a lot of growth opportunity that we want to pursue in our chosen markets. But certainly looking to foundation prepare, refine our operations, add the talent, increase the relevance. There is a lot of work going on day to day which the tactical activity that drives success on the insurance side that we're working hard at across the board.
Joshua Shankar: Well, thank you for all the answers and I appreciate the extra time.
Dom Addesso: Thank you, Joshua.
Operator: We will go next Brian Meredith with UBS.
Brian Meredith: Yes, thanks. Just a couple of quick questions here; first, I am just curious in the Bermuda segment, what was the current dollar figure of the true-up which you had in the first quarter, just so we get a good sense of kind of what the year over year growth was looking like without this true-ups, the Bermuda segment?
Dom Addesso: Just one second.
Brian Meredith: Sure.
Dom Addesso: Yes, it's roughly about $60 million.
Brian Meredith: Great, that's truly helpful. And then, second question on the credit mortgage business, I am just curious when you think about the capital allocation to that business, how do you think about it? Are you using call it rating agency models? What are you using in -- and what is the risk here that perhaps has changed and where the rating agency look at the mortgage reinsurance business to get to maybe some type of capital requiring closer to [indiscernible] particularly with quota share, would that change your kind of view of the business?
Jon Zaffino: So, Brian, it's Jon. As a -- I think a couple of things. I think we feel like just overall first principle that Everest given our overall capital position and diversified book business, we feel we are pretty capital efficient in deploying capital in the areas like mortgage. We also know there has been conversations and some of the rating agencies have been looking at this fairly carefully about what the rating, how they should think about the capital required to support this book going forward. More times than not when more capital is required whether it's on the [indiscernible], or the rating agencies that puts pressure on supply. And we do that -- given our strong capital position and balance sheet and ratings, we do that as positive that will drive increases in demand and put downward pressure on supply. So, in terms of we think about it, we think about it as all of the above rating agencies with limits deployed, realistic disaster scenarios, stochastic, pricing, reserving, looking at an overall economic capital model, thinking about the assets and the liabilities and whole balance sheet.
Brian Meredith: Got you. Great. And then, another just quick question here. Given that you are moving to more shorter tail type businesses which on the liability side with MI and crop and stuff, is that causing any changes in your investment portfolio and kind of where you are going to invest and proceed?
Dom Addesso: No, it hasn't. The duration on the liability side really hasn't moved much approximately three years - four years, and our asset portfolio is underneath that. So that has not changed.
Brian Meredith: Great, great. Thanks. And last quick question here, workers comp market, I know you guys did mention that there are some dislocation of the insurance market in general and you are taking immense opportunities there. How about he workers comp market with some of the recent activity that we are seen there, any opportunities there?
Dom Addesso: In the insurance side?
Brian Meredith: Yes, insurance side, sorry, yes.
Dom Addesso: There are a lot of select opportunities. And we have expanded slightly some of our offerings we have expanded into some different states, but only selectively into certain states. California you know which is our biggest comp market, very profitable for us, rates are off a little bit, but we're still very bullish on sector given where rates are. And we will use comp frankly as a competitive advantage. There is a lot of -- a lot of markets we compete against that don't have comp capability and that gives us an edge to get into some other -- some of the other lines of business. So that's how we are thinking about it.
Brian Meredith: Got you. Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our final question today from Nicholas Mezick with KBW.
Nicholas Mezick: Hi, good morning everyone.
Dom Addesso: Good morning.
Craig Howie: Good morning.
Nicholas Mezick: Thanks for fitting me in. A year ago, you mentioned that you have not done hiring in the insurance division. And in the prepared remarks today, you mentioned due to market turmoil, you have accelerated those investments. At Heartland, I see other underwriting expenses up about $9 million quarter over quarter. Where do you see the notional dollar amount is going in 2017 and 2018 or the other underwriting expense?
Dom Addesso: I don't know that we have an answer for you on that because it is all dependent on market opportunity. So, we think about it more as an operating expense ratio. And I think where we are at today, we are lower, particularly as the earned premium begins to catch up, because our lead of add for resources is not necessarily plateauing but not going up at the same pace that it has been over the last 18 months as we have been building up some of these new businesses. And as these businesses have - the premium begins to earn in, the expense ratio all other things being equal, should moderate. And as Jonathan pointed out earlier, we will continue to make new additions consistent with what we see as the growth opportunity. So it's a little difficult for us to give you nominal dollar amount because that will emerge as opportunity emerges.
Nicholas Mezick: Okay. And one of the governors to that sort of the sub 30 expense ratio target?
Dom Addesso: Right.
Nicholas Mezick: Okay, thanks.
Dom Addesso: And by the way, if it remained at 30 for foreseeable future again as we pointed out before, most of our competitors aren't even close to us there. So, while everyone seems to be focused on the increase in expenses, reality is that where we are at today is competitive relative to the market.
Nicholas Mezick: Just a quick follow-up on that last point, any overrides from the more conservative reinsurance program?
Dom Addesso: We have overrides in our reinsurance purchases, is that what you are asking?
Nicholas Mezick: Yes, that's driving the expense ratio to that sub 30 target?
Dom Addesso: Not to any significant degree. We do have some overrides but that's not driving.
Nicholas Mezick: Okay, thanks guys.
Dom Addesso: Thank you.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn it back to management for closing remarks.
Dom Addesso: Well, I'll conclude by just thanking everyone for participating in this morning. And as you can surmise from our prepared comments as well as some of the answers to questions, we remain optimistic about our ability to deliver -- continue to deliver solid returns. Conservative management of our cat exposure, solid reserve position along with expense discipline and all that positions us to withstand what the market might bring to us. Coupled with growth into newer product areas and our reinsurance operations as well as what's proving to be a successful growth strategy for our insurance division, these things should continue to help us maintain our above average returns. So, thank you for your interest, and I look forward to perhaps meeting with many of you in the months ahead. Thanks again for participating.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does include today's conference. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, everyone. Welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Call of Everest Re Group Ltd. Today’s conference is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Beth Farrell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Beth Farrell: Thank you, Jessica. Good morning and welcome to Everest Re Group’s fourth quarter and full year earnings conference call. On the call with me today are Dom Addesso, the company’s President and Chief Executive Officer; Craig Howie, our Chief Financial Officer; John Doucette, our President and CEO of Reinsurance Operations; and Jon Zaffino, President of North American Insurance Operations. Before I begin, I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I note that statements made during today’s call, which are forward-looking in nature, such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations and the like are subject to various risks. As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations. Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements. Now, let me turn the call over to Dom.
Dom Addesso: Thank you, Beth and good morning to all. We are pleased to provide our final report for the 2016 year, where we closed the year with a record fourth quarter and an industry leading 13% ROE for the year. There are many moving pieces in those results, which my colleagues will take you through. But let me highlight a few key themes. In the quarter and a year that saw a heightened level of cat activity relative to the prior year, yet the overall impact of these events was easily absorbed into our results, given the benefits of our diversified global platform that provides for premium across many geographies and lines. Notably, we reached a new high this year with over $6 billion of gross premium written. In addition, we realized the benefit of sizable reserve redundancies this quarter, a reflection of our conservative reserving practices, which we have been pointing to for some time now. While we had sizable reserve releases from our reinsurance portfolio, our insurance portfolio did experience some unfavorable loss reserve development. But this was largely isolated to construction defect claims arising out of runoff books of business. The size of the charge this year reflects our best effort to fully fund these liabilities and put this behind us. We also topped up our asbestos reserves. This reserve addition was not the result of any change we have experienced in the underlying claims, but rather reflects a reallocation of reserves to the segment that is fraught with uncertainty. Despite all these reserve movements, the net result was a positive $209 million to full year earnings. As a result of these reserve savings and frankly many other important factors, our core operations have done very well as you will note in the numbers. Overall, reinsurance generated an underwriting gain of over $900 million, bettering last year’s number by almost $40 million. While it is a challenged market from a rate perspective, as seen in the top line, we continue to expand our product set, shifting our risk appetite to achieve better risk-adjusted returns. These achievements are not one-off. There is a consistency to our performance relative to the market where our returns on capital have measurably outperformed. Albeit while returns are creeping down as a result of market conditions, I think it is pretty clear that the overall market will reach its breaking point before us. In the insurance front, we remain extremely satisfied with our progress. Premium growth, excluding our crop business, which was sold earlier this year, has been in excess of 20% due to new product and business launches. The benefits of these increased writings have not yet been fully captured due to the lag in earned premium. The underperformance in 2016 reflects this lag in earned premium and its impact on the expense ratio as well as the reserve adjustments I previously mentioned. However, we remain confident that the new business that will come through earnings in the year to come will outperform the historical record. Why this optimism in such a tough market for both reinsurance and insurance? First, the inevitable law of gravity and the race to the bottom, that is one race we don’t intend to win and already have shown we are far behind. Based on industry returns relative to cost of capital, the race is almost over. That race includes third-party capital, where our future of higher investment rates will cause those markets to raise their targets. Second, the scale of our organization and scope of our relationships allows us the opportunity to selectively grow and introduce our new products and businesses. And finally, great people in a culture that inspires smart underwriting and risk selection with an eye towards being creative and entrepreneurial in everything we do, a lean organization that allows us to be nimble and quick to the right trade in the most expense-efficient rate possible. These are the qualities we continue to emphasize and that will continue to generate market leading returns. Thank you, and now to Craig for the financial highlights.
Craig Howie: Thank you, Tom and good morning everyone. Everest had an excellent end to 2016 and a record quarter of earnings with net income of $374 million helped by reserve releases that impacted both current and prior years. This compares to net income of $357 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. Net income for the year was $996 million compared to $978 million in 2015. After-tax operating income for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $363 million compared to $353 million in 2015. For the year, operating income was $993 million compared to $1.1 billion in 2015. The primary differences were catastrophe losses and foreign exchange partially offset by favorable reserve releases. The overall underwriting gain for the group was $689 million for the year compared to underwriting gain of $787 million for 2015. The results reflect a slight increase in the overall current year attritional combined ratio of 85.5%, up from 84.8% last year. This attritional measure increase of less than 1 point reflects a higher expense ratio as we anticipated, with the build-out of the insurance platform and our Lloyd’s Syndicate. In the fourth quarter, Everest saw $185 million of gross current year catastrophe losses. Of the total, $150 million related to losses from Hurricane Matthew, $20 million related to earthquake activity in New Zealand and $15 million related to the Tennessee wildfires. Net of reinsurance, the current quarter catastrophe losses amounted to $169 million. The fourth quarter of 2016 also included favorable development on prior cat losses largely from the 2015 year. Therefore, net catastrophe losses for the quarter were $150 million. Net catastrophe losses for the year were $301 million in 2016 compared to $54 million in 2015. For 2016, gross catastrophe losses were $420 million but were offset by reinsurance and $87 million of favorable development on prior year cat losses, primarily from the 2015 Chile earthquake and U.S. storm events, the 2013 U.S. storms and Toronto flooding and the 2011 Japan earthquake. Our reported combined ratio was 87.0% for the year 2016 compared to 85.1% in 2015. The 2016 commission ratio of 22.3% was essentially flat compared to 2015. Our expense ratio of 5.7% for the year is up from 4.8% in 2015. The expense ratio for the Reinsurance segment remained low at 3.1%, while the overall expense ratio was influenced by the build-out of our insurance segment. Everest maintains one of the lowest internal expense ratios in the industry. This is a strategic competitive advantage for Everest. On reserves, we completed our annual loss reserve studies. The results of the studies indicated that overall reserves remained adequate. In the fourth quarter, we booked $205 million of favorable, prior year reserve development. This included prior period development in the insurance segment and for asbestos, which was more than offset by favorable reserve development in the reinsurance segments. The $160 million of prior year reserve development in the insurance segment during the quarter, as referenced by Dom, is largely related to construction liability and umbrella program business. These run-off programs were discontinued by the company several years ago. The $365 million of favorable prior year development in the reinsurance segments reflected $419 million of favorable development, partially offset by a $54 million increase in asbestos and environmental reserves to replenish our position at the beginning of the year. The $419 million of reinsurance favorable development during the quarter, mostly related to property and short tail business, both in the United States and internationally. These redundancies have developed over time, but we don’t react until the position becomes more mature. We continue to hold our loss reserve estimates for the more recent years. For investments, pretax investment income was $150 million for the quarter and $473 million for the year on our $17.5 billion investment portfolio. Investment income for the year remained flat compared to 2015, which was better than expected. We have been able to maintain investment yield without a dramatic shift in the overall investment portfolio. The recent rise in interest rates drove bond prices down and had a negative impact to book value during the quarter, related to the unrealized capital losses in our bond portfolio. However, this increase and the expected rising interest rates during 2017 will have a positive impact on the net investment income over time. The pretax yield on the overall portfolio was 2.8% and duration remained at just over 3 years. Other income and expense included $21 million of foreign exchange losses for the 2016 year compared to $61 million of foreign exchange gains in 2015. Both of these results are unusual and representing $82 million pretax swing year-over-year. For 2016, foreign exchange losses resulted from the relative strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other world currencies, primarily the British pound. Overall, we maintained an economic neutral position with respect to foreign exchange, matching assets and liabilities in most major world currencies. Other income also included $11 million of earnings and fees from Mt. Logan Re for the year 2016 compared to $28 million in 2015. The decline in 2016 essentially represents the higher level of catastrophe losses in 2016 and the corresponding reduction in incentive or profit sharing fees. On income taxes, the 2016 operating income effective tax rate was 10.3%. This effective tax rate for the year was lower than our expectations for the year. The tax rate was lower due to the amount and geographic region of the income associated with the loss reserve releases in the fourth quarter. Additionally, we closed the U.S. tax audit during the quarter and allowed the utilization of foreign tax credits from years 2009 through 2012. These credits reduced the effect of tax rate by about 2 points. Strong cash flow continues, with operating cash flows of $1.4 billion for the year, up $276 million compared to 2015. This is primarily due to our continued premium growth. Shareholders’ equity for the group was $8.1 billion at the end of 2016, up $467 million or 6% over year end 2015. This was after taking into account capital return through $386 million of share buybacks and $195 million of dividends paid in 2016. The company announced a 9% increase to its regular quarterly dividend and paid $1.25 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016. Book value per share increased 11% to $197.45 from $178.21 at year end 2015, generating 13% growth in shareholder value, including dividends. Our strong capital balance leaves us well positioned for business opportunities as well as continuing share repurchases. Thank you and now John Doucette will provide a review of the reinsurance operations.
John Doucette: Thank you, Craig. Good morning. We are pleased to report an outstanding quarter and a record year, with $903 million of reinsurance underwriting profit despite catastrophe activities. Our earnings reflect our strengthening position in the global reinsurance market and are a testament to our continued disciplined efforts to build a diverse and profitable portfolio. Globally, REITs were under pressure except where material catastrophes occurred, such as Canada. Our position as a large, global, nimble, highly rated and long standing reinsurer allows us to successfully underwrite through this tough rating environment to grow profitable business and once again, to achieve market beating results. Before discussing renewals, here is some color on the fourth quarter and 2016 results. Total gross written premium for the fourth quarter was $1.1 billion, a decrease of 1% compared to last year, but flat on a constant dollar basis. Year-to-date, global reinsurance premiums of $4.2 billion were down 3%, but flat after eliminating the currency impacts. For the quarter, the loss ratio increased to 36.3% from 33% in prior Q4 and included 12.5 points of cat losses and also about 5 points of asbestos strengthening, both of which were more than offset by 38 points of favorable prior year reserve releases. The impact of fourth quarter cats was $139 million, which included $158 million of Hurricane Matthew, the Q4 New Zealand earthquake and the Tennessee fires, offset by reductions of $19 million for prior year cat events. The favorable prior year reserve development emanated across the portfolio, weighted towards our shorter tail lines. The level of these releases demonstrates the strength and diversity of our global portfolio, the foundation for our strong balance sheet. For the full year 2016, our reinsurance loss ratio improved from 50.6% a year ago to 50.1%. Excluding cats and prior year development, the current year attritional loss ratio was down slightly to 53.5%. Each year was impacted by a significant risk loss, with 2016 having $40 million of loss for the Jubilee Oil platform and 2015 having $60 million for the Tianjin, China explosion. Note, in 2016, our prior year reserve adjustment reflected the release of $43 million of that $60 million Tianjin loss estimate. The 2016 reported combined ratio and the 2016 attritional combined ratio, excluding cats and prior year development were also lower relative to the prior year, reflecting our disciplined underwriting approach and rigorous expense management. Bottom line, our reinsurance profit produced an all-time high underwriting profit of $429 million in the fourth quarter and $903 million for the full year 2016, placing us among the best performers in the reinsurance industry. We believe we have one of the very best reinsurance teams in the industry. In addition to a very strong technical staff, we have talented, experienced, smart underwriters who know their markets and clients well and with outstanding skills to underwrite risks, build profitable books and grow the long-term franchise, collectively enabling Everest to continue to outperform the market. In our U.S. Reinsurance segment, 2016 gross written premium was down slightly to $2.1 billion. Changes year-over-year were caused by a decrease in our property writings as we walked away from a significant volume of under-priced pro rata business. However, this was offset by our new strategic property insurance deal and the continued growth in alternative risk products, including credit-related business such as mortgage reinsurance. Our alternative risk capabilities remain a differentiating bright spot in a difficult market where more sophisticated clients increasingly seek bespoke products for capital relief, unique risks and often multiple lines of business. Everest’s lean and agile operations, coupled with our broad experience and expertise, quickly provide solutions to both our long-term trusted partners and new clients seeking a creative solution. The 2016 combined ratio of the U.S. Reinsurance segment was up 6.6 points, while the accident year attritional combined ratio of 78.4% was up only 2 points. The attritional increase, in large part, was caused by the increased crop reinsurance writings, which generally requires less capital to write, but produces a slightly higher combined ratio. Our International Reinsurance segment premium was $1.2 billion, down 8% for the year, but only 5% on a constant dollar basis. Lower premium across many of our regions, Latin America, Middle East, Africa and Asia was due to both rate pressure and termination of under-priced business. For 2016, this segment produced $314 million of underwriting profit, up 86% over the prior year despite increased catastrophes. This was largely due to a significant level of current and prior year reserve releases, highlighting the conservatism in our reserving process. Excluding cats and prior year losses, the attritional combined ratio for 2016 was down 4 points to 80.4%, with the improvement due to the impact of Tianjin losses in 2015 and a lower level of attritional cat losses, catastrophes that do not reach our $10 million threshold, to be classified as a cat in 2016. Our Bermuda segment premium was $890 million, up 1% for the year, but on a constant dollar basis actually had growth of 5%, driven primarily by casualty reinsurance. The combined ratio was up about 1 point, but excluding cats and prior year development, the accident year attritional loss ratio was down 2.4 points to 89%. This was the result of changes in business mix and the impact of the Tianjin loss in 2015. Moving on to the 1/1 renewal, Everest was well-positioned to withstand the market pressures. Globally, our clients are demanding solutions that address their operational breadth, the increasingly complex capital requirements and unusual risks. We have the expertise, responsiveness and capital to meet these demands quickly aided by our unique and client focused operational structure, geographic and product breadth and diverse capital sources, including Mt. Logan, Kilimanjaro, catastrophe bonds and other hedges. In the property markets, we continue to perform well in face of heavy competition. Facilitated by robust relationships, we re-underwrote our property portfolio substantially at 1/1 reallocating capacity from under-priced business to more attractive layers and programs, while supporting our core clients and newly marketed programs. We will also explore new structures that will strengthen our core client relationships well into the future. Overall, the market property rates were down at 1/1, on average mid single-digits across most markets unaffected by material losses. Our portfolio fared better than that, where the combined ratio of our 1/1 renewal portfolio had modest slippage of less than 1 point compared to last year’s portfolio. In our casualty markets, the 1/1 pressures were mixed, with the reinsurance terms easing somewhat, but economics in certain underlying segments are still tracking in the wrong direction. We achieved improvements on classes with material losses and increasingly focused on structured and credit-related deals. Our London operation saw excess of loss rates declined from 2.5% to 5%, although some other international markets are seeing decreases of 5% to 10%. On the positive side, Solvency II is causing a demand uptick in London in European markets, specifically the pro rata structures. Overall, Everest reinsurance operations remain optimally diversified by product, distribution, geography, client mix, and capital sources giving us the ability to quickly identify and move from market weaknesses to market opportunity. We recognized the markets may face continued pressure from the supply demand imbalances. But as reflected in our results, we are well equipped to adapt and excel in the new reinsurance world order. Thank you. And now, I will turn it over to John to review our insurance operations.
John Doucette: Thanks, Jon and good morning. 2016 was the transformative year for the Everest Global Insurance operations. The year finished on a strong note despite the impact of profitability from elevated levels of natural catastrophe losses and as you have heard from Dom and Craig, prior year reserve development originating from the one-off books of business. Nonetheless, we are pleased with the underlying performance of our portfolio, particularly so in a difficult trading environment. Further, we continue to make significant progress on our journey to organically build a world class specialty diversified insurance organization. I will provide further commentary on this progress later in my remarks. Similar to last quarter, due to the divestiture of Heartland in late third quarter of 2016, I will be discussing our results, excluding this business. The full results of the Insurance segment, inclusive of Heartland, are covered in our financial supplement released yesterday. Additionally, for reference, we have also included a supplemental exhibit with the quarterly insurance results, excluding Heartland. For the full year 2016, the global insurance operations achieved record premium levels, registering nearly $1.6 billion in gross written premium, an increase of $274 million or 21% over 2015. It should be noted that this result exceeds 2015 gross written premium, including the result of Heartland. This strong top line performance is an acknowledgment of the value our clients, brokers and insurers alike recognize in Everest insurance. Further contributing to this strong top line performance were nearly a dozen new underwriting divisions that steadily contributed throughout the year. For the full year, these new divisions, which have been selectively added to the portfolio, contributed nearly 7% in total 2016 gross written premiums. This represents over $100 million of new premium within desired segments and classes of business. A result we are certainly encouraged by, as many of these divisions are not yet a year old. For the quarter, we registered $423 million of gross written premium, an increase of $89 million or 27% over the prior year period. This represents the eighth consecutive quarter of growth for our operations. Each division within the North American segment contributed to this growth, with the U.S., Canada and asset and health teams each growing in excess of 20%, along with meaningful contribution from our Lloyd’s Syndicate. We remain encouraged by this balanced contribution across the diversity of the underwriting platform. Net written premiums for the year were slightly over $1.3 billion, an increase of $180 million or 16% over 2015. As discussed in prior calls, net written premium growth slightly lags gross written premium growth due to a marginally more conservative reinsurance position we have taken to support our many new underwriting divisions. For the quarter, net written premium increased by $50 million or 17% over the prior year quarter, reflecting a strong end to the year and solid momentum from all of our businesses. I do want to make a quick comment as respect to net earned premiums in the quarter. Net earned was down 14% due to the sale of Heartland and the accompanying loss portfolio transfer of this business from the Insurance segment to the Reinsurance segment. Again, excluding Heartland, earned premium was up 14%, which is directionally similar to the trend at net written premium, however, slightly lags due to the significant growth in the portfolio over the past couple of years. Turning to the combined ratio, the GAAP combined ratio for the year, again excluding Heartland, was 116%. As we look back on 2016, there are two notable impacts to our performance. First, was the prior year development of various runoff books of business, principally related to construction defect exposures that contributed 14 points to our loss ratio. Second, the insurance results were impacted by a year of significant cat events across North America, from the Fort McMurray wildfire, a number of Texas hail events, the worst experience over three decades, and finally, Hurricane Matthew. These cat events contributed slightly more than 4 points to our loss ratio in 2016. Taking at the look of the attritional results. The ongoing global insurance operations delivered a 97.9% combined ratio for the year, in line with our expectations, however, elevated from the 93.4% attritional from 2015. Let me breakout some of the factors driving this increase. First, our expense ratio was 29.9% for the year, which again is inclusive of the expenses associated with the build-out of our U.S. and Lloyd platforms and is expected to moderate as we continue our expansion. It should be noted that this expense ratio remains very competitive within the specialty P&C environment. Second, for the full year, the loss and loss expense ratio was 68% compared to 67.1% in 2015. The slight deterioration in the attritional loss ratio for the year is attributable to a number of factors, predominant among these are the adverse impact of various non-cat weather events in ‘16, a slight deterioration in our U.S. auto book, and also some additional pressure on the loss ratio due to the growth in our A&H segment, which carries a higher loss ratio than our P&C products. That stated we are very pleased with the ultimate results of this book. Let me now turn to offers and commentary on the performance of our major insurance portfolios, again starting with the North America P&C book which is our largest business. Year-over-year, the core P&C portfolio grew 15% or nearly $174 million. The momentum within our P&C operations steadily increased throughout the year, again reflective of our significantly enhanced underwriting capabilities and increased market profile. In fact, the fourth quarter represented the strongest performance of the year, registering growth of 21% compared to the comparable quarter in 2015. We experienced meaningful growth in our short tail portfolios and our casualty lines, while specialty grew more moderately. Further, our new business lines launched in the U.S. again contributed nearly 11% to gross written premium in the quarter, a similar figure to last quarter. Our assets in health group also delivered another solid quarter of growth, with a 44% increase over the prior year comparable quarter. Our efforts to thoughtfully grow our medical stop loss segments within key geographies and business segments proved successful. Our new A&H products also contributed to growth throughout the year and we anticipate this to continue. We have recruited very capable distribution partners and as a result, expect to grow in the senior market segment into 2017. Our Lloyd’s operation also continued its expansion. The syndicate contributed $10 million to insurance growth in the quarter, building on the momentum from the third quarter. While still early in its growth cycle, this platform, despite a difficult trading environment, is performing as expected. For 2016, the syndicate has delivered $45 million of premium to the insurance segment, yet only $16 million of earned premium, which again, temporarily impacts the expense ratio. Turning to the operating environment, we see a similar picture to what we experienced throughout much of 2016. With that stated, there is an early emergence of some trends within various lines of business that we are watching closely. I will comment on the dominant lines of business, starting with commercial auto, which continues to be a challenging line of business. Building on the prior three quarters of 2016, we again achieved positive rate across commercial auto lines, with a low double-digit mean increase for the quarter. Over 85% of our book is receiving rate increases. Internet tends to address the frequency and severity trends that we have experienced across the line. That stated, our exposure to commercial auto is somewhat limited and this line of business represents less than 5% of our overall P&C premium. The primary general liability and umbrella markets continued to remain in a tight rate range and are slightly positive for the year. As with the prior quarter and really all year, the professional liability market remains competitive, with rate decreases in the mid single-digit range. Let me spend a minute on the U.S. property market. This market remains very competitive. However, it is our sense that the market is trying to find the bottom on the rates. The elevated frequency of natural catastrophe losses, are acting as a resistance towards continued large decreases. Further, in many occupancies and geographies, we believe the industry has reached the juncture that there is simply no additional rate reduction to be had. Perhaps this is driving the exit of some catastrophe from the space, but we feel there is a large story here that we will keep an eye as we move forward. That stated, we continue to find opportunities to deploy our capacity in a manner that meets our risk and return objectives. Finally, workers’ compensation, our largest line of business by premium size, experienced moderate rate pressure throughout the year in the mid single-digit range, which was largely expected. The favorable underwriting results in the largest work comp market, California, were greeted with steady rate pressure throughout the year. Other markets reacted similarly, although with moderately less rate pressure. So again, the environment trended predictably in ‘16 and we expect much of the same, with the exceptions noted in ‘17. Wrapping up, we are very pleased with the many efforts undertaken in 2016 to position us for future success. We entered 2017 with our leadership team in place, our market profile expanding, a portfolio aligned to our business objectives and a significantly enhanced operating platform. We are confident we will carry our strong top line momentum into 2017 as our many new underwriting initiatives continue to gain scale both within North America and at Lloyd’s. Yes, it remains a challenged operating environment, yet the growing diversity of our platform, again with the top line expanding by over 20% and a firmer handle on our existing portfolio, positions us well for the future. With that, let me turn it back over to Beth for Q&A.
Beth Farrell: Thank you. That ends our prepared remarks. And we are now open for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we will go first to Elyse Greenspan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Elyse Greenspan: Hi, good morning. First off, if you could just spend a little bit more time just I know throughout you guys have kind of said that you booked on some of these insurance programs following on the reserve review kind of to give you confidence that you fully addressed this. What are you booking on the construction liability and umbrella programs to and what really changed this year that gives you confidence that 12 months from today we won’t see another charge stemming from some of these runoff programs again?
Dom Addesso: This is Dom. Thank you for your question. I think each year, when we have examined these portfolios we have been booking to what I would call the expected results from our actuarial review. And as Craig or someone else could comment on what we are actually booking at to, I don’t know if your question was on loss ratio question, which I don’t really think is relevant, but perhaps this answers it. This year, after undertaking that reserve review, frankly we asked ourselves the same question. We don’t want to be sitting here next year and the year after and taking another charge, of course what drove the higher estimate this year was just an increase of frequency and severity. So hopefully, comeback in this year we selected the upper range of the actuarial estimates. So therefore, we have some confidence that it’s ever an absolute, but of course therefore we have some confidence that they should be behind us. And again, keep in mind this is in the overall context of overall reserve position. And I know it sounded like a broken record, but when we have over 200 different reserve buckets and what we are most concerned about is our overall reserve adequacy at the balance sheet level, because this is clearly a run off business, this not a concern over our existing portfolio. And as evidenced by the reserve release we have this year in addition to other years, you can see that our overall reserve position is solid and in fact was redundant. So that’s what we are most concerned about. But to answer your more specific question, this year we run a little higher in the range to give ourselves the comfort that we can hopefully put this to bet.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. And then as we think about the margin kind of outlook for your segments, I know within the commentary you guys kind of pointed on the property reinsurance side, slippage probably about 1 point on the combined ratio, how do you see the overall kind of reinsurance margin just in context of tying what you see on the casualty side and also do you – I guess we should expect some kind of slippage on the combined ratio as you bring the crop business to the reinsurance side, I am just trying to kind of tie all your commentary together to really how you see the margin profile of the reinsurance book in 2017?
Dom Addesso: Well, what we have been trying to – the message we have been trying to make sure everyone understands is that this is a book of business that is not dependent upon property cat business. And of course what you have seen in our margins has been some shift in the attritional and the shift in the attritional still we are getting improvements as a result of new products that we offer. So as John Doucette highlighted in his comments, diversifying it to different product lines and geographies and more importantly product lines, so for example, take credit reinsurance more specifically, mortgage reinsurance, those obviously are carrying much lower loss ratio fits and better combined ratios. So that’s helping to offset some of the declines and actually business that we will let go in the more traditional areas. So we are not necessarily seeing any dramatic change in our attritional going into ‘17.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. And then in terms of just capital return, I knew you guys have always said you look to return less than your earnings, share repurchase, it seems like you guys did not buyback any stock since your last call, so how do you kind of think about I guess just the level of potential capital return for 2017 and any things kind of change on your capital return philosophy over the last three months?
Dom Addesso: No, nothing has changed, Elyse. And part of the reason that you didn’t see us do anything last quarter, fourth quarter was the fact, that we had Hurricane Matthew sitting out there and clearly, we had information, more precise information so we become a little reluctant to we buy in shares given the fact that there is major events hanging out there that we are not clear as to what the final outcome will be. So that’s what was driving that, but certainly, there has been no change in our, the way we manage capital. We have a very good long-term track record of doing so that of course gets balanced with what we see as the future business opportunities and the need for capital. And I think we have been, yes, we buy in less than earnings, growing our capital base because we continue to see new opportunities. And that’s – and we look at this from a very long-term perspective. It’s not just any one year, any one quarter for sure. And we will look out to more than just where are our projections are for book value currently or the current book value, we will look out six months or so to determine where our threshold might be for buying in stock. So essentially, it’s a long way of saying, no change in our philosophy on how we think about capital management.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. Thank you very much.
Dom Addesso: Thank you.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Kai Pan: Thank you and good morning. First question on reserves, so the 2016 reserve release that was actually the largest in your history. And Dom you mentioned that since you came on Board, you are taking probably more conservative reserves stance, so is that – there is the question is really, why now certainly big reserve it is, basically because their basic reserve cushion build-out over time, now you have to release it and also how sustainable is that reserve releases going forward?
Dom Addesso: Yes. Kai, I mean I have – for several years now that we have taken a more conservative view of picking the current loss year, in terms of big loss ratio. And that’s frankly driven out of some of uncertainties as do – in the current market conditions an increased level of uncertainty. But that of course has resulted in some of those older years coming in part of the and positively. And that’s – it was a good thing. What we tend to do is we handle the casualty and the property. We hold a couple years on casualty studies and we hold less years on the property side. So this release reflects the release from a few years ago from accident years a few years ago. And that will – that is kind of the process that we go through and we will continue to go down that path. And our – we still continue to feel that our current reserve position is very strong and adequate. And I can’t sit here and give a prediction as to what the level of reserve releases are not, might be into the future, but as I said, we still remain very confident about our reserves...
Kai Pan: So the release, most are related short tail lines in last few years and not sort of some of the potentially long tailed line you have booked since late 2010?
Dom Addesso: I am sorry can you repeat that, you broke up a little bit on that question.
Kai Pan: Yes. The question was, is that the reserve release is most related to short tail line of business rather than some long-tail line?
Dom Addesso: Kai, the process has not changed over the years. As Tom mentioned, what we do is we set a conservative loss pick and then overtime, we are slow to react to any favorable development, but we are very quick to react to any unfavorable development. So what you are seeing right now, most of what was released at this point in time were short-tail business more than 2 years ago. Short tail lines and property lines of business was what the majority of what was released. But there was some casualty in there. And I should also mention, because I know there has been a lot of focus on the insurance adds, we have to make, but it should be noted that we did have some current book of business within the insurance actually did produce redundancy coming through the results in 2016. Net-net, it was a reserve ad, because of the construction defect of umbrella that we highlighted earlier, but it should be pointed out that the current book of business is beginning to produce some releases.
Kai Pan: Great. Then second question on the insurance side, the 2016 attritional combined ratio 97.9%, I just wonder, given your gross like projection, you are still growing the business expense ratio probably still a little bit elevated and then there is a business mix shift, some potentially to your high combined ratio, so do you see 2017, 2018, these attritional loss combined ratio going to improve or going to deteriorate before it would becoming improving?
Dom Addesso: Our expectation is that it would improve. Again, just to highlight again the things that why it came in at that level. We had some of it was A&H, the growth rate in A&H relative to some of the other lines. We had the non-cat – heightened level of non-cat events in 2016, which drove that. We had a little bit of auto. Frequency and severity that drove that, which as Jonathan highlighted is lots of rate increase coming on that line of business. And beyond premium catch-up to the written should begin to benefit the results. The expense ratio hasn’t improved yet, because we have actually accelerated some of our business development efforts later in 2016, more so than we anticipated that we would do it, all a good thing, but I would have expected the expense ratio to improve by now, but it hasn’t because of an up level of investment relative to our initial plans.
Kai Pan: Great. Thank you so much for all the answers.
Dom Addesso: Thank you.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Sarah DeWitt with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Sarah DeWitt: Alright. Good morning and congrats on a good quarter. Just following-up on the insurance business, what do you view as the underlying run rate combined ratio in the quarter ex some of these one-time items that you outlined?
Dom Addesso: For ‘16, it would have been in the mid-90s.
Sarah DeWitt: And is that in line with your target combined ratios in this segment or do you target something lower?
Dom Addesso: We will be continuing to target something lower than that. We would expect improvement in that over time.
Sarah DeWitt: Okay. And then, separately just want to talk – get your thoughts on some of the macro issues following the U.S. election, if we got U.S. corporate tax reform, how much would Everest Re benefit and are there any implications from border adjustments for Everest Re?
Dom Addesso: I know this is a question that’s hot in everybody’s mind, but it’s a little difficult, not knowing what the final outcome would be to give you any view. But let me just say this. For the last 2 years, we really – if you take in tax – lower tax rate plus the cross border tax adjustment, it would have been very minimal impact if any on our overall effective tax rate in the last 2 years. But the bigger question comes in a year where cat losses you are not expected or maybe even higher than expected, that’s the great unknown. But we have got different platforms globally that we could trigger in different ways in which we could really underwrite business. So it’s not – I can’t give you a clear answer on that other than the fact that we don’t think that it would have any meaningful impact at this point.
Sarah DeWitt: Okay, great. Thank you.
Dom Addesso: Thank you.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Josh Shanker: Yes. So, good morning everyone. One off, we can talk in numbers about bridging the expense to build out the insurance press and Lloyd’s and whatnot and the timeline for what we think that should be in ‘17 and should even be there in ‘18?
Dom Addesso: What will be there at all on ‘18?
Josh Shanker: The increased expense – spend associated with the build-out?
Dom Addesso: Is that a Lloyd’s question or an overall insurance question?
Josh Shanker: It’s the 300 basis point gap between the ‘16 expense ratio and the ‘15 expense ratio and I take – I understand your reasons behind that, I am wondering how long I should model that to persist?
Dom Addesso: I would expect that just to drift down slightly in 2017, and frankly, then level out maybe slightly again in the ‘18, but then level off from there. I don’t believe that we will get back to our historical expense ratio. I mean, you have to remember that we now have the different distribution model. So previously, we were primarily an MJ focused insurance operation, there were more of a direct brokerage operation, which by definition forgetting even the commission element of it, just a general expense ratio element of it requires different types of resources and different systems. So – it will not get back to maybe what you would have as seen historically from us. Having said that, I think if you could our expectation would be as we even today, we have a much better expense ratio than the industry, we expect that gap doing work to remain.
Josh Shanker: Okay. And I am going to go through the 4Q ‘15 trends once again, read about the insurance reserve charge there. I can’t remember exactly where the overlap is between where the charge for this quarter that was charged for 1 year ago. Is there some whack-a-mole sort of situation that while you have taken take you think what’s problematic that you saw in ‘16, can there be other things that come out in ‘17, do we have some limits in place to give us specific comforts or are you surprised 1 year later from the ‘15 charges that you have these charges today?
Dom Addesso: We are always surprised because if I said we wanted surprise, then we would have put out a higher number back in 2015. Yes, it is a surprise. And with reserves, you will never know what an increased level of frequency or severity might in fact due to you. But as I mentioned, our other pieces of our portfolio that are active are in fact running at the fast year, produce the redundancy. So we are confident that those reserves are frankly in good order. But again in the context of our overall balance sheet, our reserve position is quite strong. And I think that applies to the various segments as well even though I know I keep emphasizing the overall balance sheet, which is important and worth emphasizing. We do go through each of our segments to make sure that we have got positive reserve or strong reserve position in each of those segments.
Josh Shanker: And then finally, I guess in terms of the Heartland premium coming into the reinsurance segment, given that you sort of explained the economics of Heartland as insurance contract, how different are the economics of it as a reinsurance contract?
Dom Addesso: John, you answer that. John?
John Doucette: Good morning, this is John. So a couple of things, the strategic relationship we entered as a reinsurance opportunity with the buyer of Heartland is it has a couple of advantages for us. First of all, it runs, we believe to a meaningful improvement in expenses and because of just economies of scale that we were unable to achieve on our own book, given the size of the premium. And then secondly, we also had struggled in our insurance book to develop a broad, diversified portfolio. And so individual localized weather events were causing more problems for us and caused more volatility in the book as an insurance play. What we are going to get is the benefit of a much, much larger book, a share of that book on a reinsurance quota share basis. So we think we are going to run to a better combined ratio, meaningfully and we think there is going to be less volatility in the results.
Josh Shanker: One of your competitors in the crop business has said this is 89%, 90% combined ratio business, do you think that’s adequate or fair?
Dom Addesso: I don’t know specifically, what you are talking about and if you are talking about it as an insurance player or as a reinsurance play, we would think as a reinsurance play, it’s low-90s.
Josh Shanker: Okay, that’s excellent. Thank you for the color.
Dom Addesso: Thank you, Josh.
John Doucette: Thank you, Josh.
Operator: And we will take our final question from Quentin McMillan with KBW. Please go ahead.
Quentin McMillan: Hi. Thanks very much guys. I just wanted to tie together something that you have historically said versus what we saw today, so Dom, you mentioned that 2016 is a heightened year of cat loss activity at a little over $300 million in cat losses on a net basis and then I think Craig mentioned $420 million on a gross basis when we net out prior year cat losses, but that $300 million number, it’s about – it’s a little under 6 points on the cat loss ratio and historically you guys have said that you expect about 10 points of cat losses in a normal year, so can you help to sort of tie those thoughts together of this being a heightened loss year, yet you were running much better than what that cat loss would indicate?
Dom Addesso: I am actually going to ask – I am going to make a few comments and then ask John to set the comment on it as well, but keep in mind that the asset was a heightened year, many of the losses though were low in the attachment point, a lot of the losses were assumed by primary. And what is consistent with what you have said is through the last couple of years given risk-adjusted pricing in order to maintain our level of risk-adjusted pricing we have moved attachment point, gotten off in certain things that we didn’t like the pricing on and we believe that, that’s had an impact on our result relative to what the overall level of tax were in the industry. So, I think that’s just a general comment and maybe John Doucette might have something to add to that.
John Doucette: Yes, Quentin, I think a couple of things. The reinsurance strategy, we continue to look to how we can improve the book and deploy and take cat risk better and deploy and build a better and better portfolio and taking into account market conditions but also the buying habits of local companies, regional companies and global clients. So to the extent that we – the global clients – take the global clients, to the extent that they are looking to do more across the board and across multiple lines of business at multiple territories with companies like Everest, we are deploying more cat capacity to them. And that usually means given the retentions that they want to take in order to control the pricing of the reinsurance program, they typically are protecting against the real major losses, very big earthquakes, very big hurricanes, etcetera. And so that wouldn’t necessarily impact us as much in a year like this, with the exception of the Canadian wildfires and Hurricane Matthew. And then we also, as Dom said, we are trying to shift our book and we have been moving not in every case, but generally, we have been moving up the tower. That also means it takes larger losses to affect us. But then I would also highlight the different hedges that we have in place, including Mt. Logan. And Mt. Logan continues to be a strategic platform for Everest and we saw some benefits from that in 2016, with recoveries that we saw from both Matthew and Fort McMurray wildfire losses in Canada as well as some other smaller losses around the group. So, we think that, that helps mitigate some of the cat loss activity that Everest faces on its inward book of business through the various hedges that we have in place as well.
Quentin McMillan: Great. That’s very helpful. And just on a capital-related question, you guys paid out about 60% in the form of dividends and share repurchases and I know you don’t have a specific capital plan that you are going to guide us to. But how much of the remaining 40% of the operating earnings that you produced was used to fund the strong growth in the insurance segment this year on Jonathan’s side?
Dom Addesso: I am going to answer that as really an overall question as opposed to specifically to insurance. Overall, we still have about the same level of what we call excess capital. And so all of the metrics that we used to measure what our economic capital needs to be remain about the same. So that capital growth basically is supporting all of the lines of business both insurance and reinsurance remembering that we are doing some different things on the reinsurance side that consumed different levels of capital.
Quentin McMillan: Okay, very hopeful. And then sorry to sneak out last in, in terms of the investment portfolio. Obviously, there is a big move and you guys did have a mark-to-market loss as everybody did unrealized loss as everybody did in the quarter. But the yield in the portfolio looked like it ticked up a little bit. Did you guys shift anything around? Can you just talk about what the new money yield is versus where they, I believe Craig said that portfolio pre-tax yield currently is 2.8% so maybe versus that currently?
Craig Howie: This is Craig. Quentin, we did not make much of a shift. What we did do was shift it a little bit as I mentioned last quarter within the alternative capital or our alternative investment buckets. But overall the portfolio remains very stable, very high credit quality investment grade volumes. It makes up the majority of the portfolio. And then we have alternative investments. The new money rate that you are suggesting is about the same, about 2.8% compared to what the current yield is, at 2.8% as well.
Dom Addesso: And the returns, the yield that you are referencing essentially what happened in the fourth quarter, it all depends on timing of the limited partnership and alternative investment income and that can get a little lumpy. So, we are pleased that frankly, year-over-year investment income was flat. We think that was a pretty terrific outcome.
Quentin McMillan: Perfect. Thanks very much guys.
Dom Addesso: We are going to expand a little bit, because I know we are running over. But perhaps, we’ve got a little worry in our opening remarks. So we will extend beyond our usual hour and if there is one or two more questions and perhaps we can entertain, I am sure you won’t mind.
Operator: Yes. We will go next to Jay Gelb with Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Jay Gelb: Thank you. I was hoping you could comment on the M&A environment broadly within insurance and reinsurance and any update on Everest view on consolidation? Thanks.
Dom Addesso: Well, I still think the same factors are at play, scale being one of the more relevant factors, continues to put pressure on many of our competitors who seek partners and that’s not necessarily a bad thing. And I think that will continue to be the trend going forward, scale and efficiency. For us, as you know, our strategy remains the same. We are not a big fan of putting a ton of good role in the books. And frankly, acquisitions are difficult to – in our view, others have certainly – could have a different business model, but in our view, acquisitions are difficult to assimilate and with it comes perhaps elements of the portfolio that you don’t wish to be engaged in. It will require some remediation. And we think it’s a lot cleaner to get the talent that we think we can secure the good talent and build out the portfolio in the manner and shape that we feel is most desirable. So that’s kind of our continued strategy. If there are things that we don’t think we can build out on our own successfully meaning elements of the different lines of business, very, very focused areas, we have continued to look at things, but I am not giving it a highlight that would be – you would see something in that regard, but I wouldn’t rule it out completely.
Jay Gelb: Thank you.
Dom Addesso: Thank you, Jay.
Operator: And we will go take our final question from Brian Meredith with UBS. Please go ahead.
Brian Meredith: Yes, thanks for putting me in. Just two questions here for you. First, Dom, John, do you have any exposure to changes – potential changes in the [indiscernible] rate table?
Dom Addesso: Brian, I think you said the [indiscernible] rate table…
Brian Meredith: Yes.
Dom Addesso: You broke up a little bit, yes. So we write business all over the world. We write a very little bit of motor business in the context of our overall over $4 billion of premium. It’s not material to us. So the short answer to your question is, it’s what we watch that. We look at the rates. We are probably a little less – we are probably a little more pessimistic on that over the last couple of years, so we have not deployed that much capital in that respect of area. So, we do not think its material to us.
Brian Meredith: Great, thanks. And last question, John, I was intrigued by your comment that you said, that you are exploring new structures that will strengthen kind of core client relationships well into the future. Are you referring to new multiyear kind of reinsurance agreements? Can you give us some examples of what you are talking about?
John Doucette: So we have – it really applies to a lot of different things. It applies to strategic relationships that we are trying to dealt with some of our core clients. We have added some of those in 2016. We have – some of are doing half a dozen and a dozen of these kind of core strategic relationships. We are looking to expand that and continue to deploy that where we really become a strategic partner to the clients and not just a large reinsurer to them. And that’s worked out very well for us. We continue to deploy and really holistically deploy capacity with the global clients and we see that as the big opportunity for us in the future as they want to trade more with companies like Everest and less with others, either because of too much concentration with some of the big directs or they want to narrow their reinsurance panel. We are spending more time really strategizing about how we, as one of the very largest broker market reinsurers, how we can grow more with the brokers in the reinsurance area and we think that’s something that won’t be to the benefit of both of us and we expect to continue to make headway in that in different products that they have different initiatives and different strategies with that going forward. And then frankly, just a lot of these new alternatives really building out what we called the nontraditional space for this product, new products, new distribution, new clients and we are making good headway there, both hiring people, developing resources internally and have had recently some few nice wins in that space. And we look to continue to deploy that going forward.
Brian Meredith: Great. Thanks for the answer.
Dom Addesso: Thank you, Brian and thanks to all for participating in this morning’s call. Apologies for going a little longer, but we had the questions in queue. We obviously were pleased with our performance this past year. And we recognized as to you that it’s very challenging market, but we are still quite confident that we can outperform on a relative basis and an absolute basis. My colleagues here this morning kind of outlined some of the new things we are doing and I have highlighted our balance sheet strength, the reserve position, which certainly bodes well for the future. So, we are very confident that we can continue to perform well. And that’s not without taking an increased level of risk. It’s continuing to do what we do. It’s underwrite through the different parts of the cycle and diversifying, diversifying into new products and new areas and continue to expand our franchise, in particular, expand the insurance franchise, which we think is one of the ways forward as well as product diversification on the reinsurance side. So thank you very much for your interest and your participation this morning. We look forward to seeing you probably over the next several weeks. Thank you.
Operator: This does conclude today’s program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.

===== 2016 Q3  (2016-10-25 10:30:00) =====
Executives: Elizabeth Farrell - Vice President of Investor Relations Dominic Addesso - President and Chief Executive Officer Craig Howie - Chief Financial Officer John Doucette - President and Chief Executive Officer, Reinsurance Jonathan Zaffino - President, North America Insurance
Analysts: Elyse Greenspan - Wells Fargo Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Jay Gelb - Barclays Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank Quentin McMillan - KBW
Operator: Good day everyone, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Call of Everest Re Group. Today’s conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Beth Farrell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Elizabeth Farrell: Thank you Keith. Good morning and welcome to Everest Re Group’s third quarter earnings conference call. On the call with me today are Dom Addesso, the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer; Craig Howie, our Chief Financial Officer; John Doucette, the President and CEO of our Reinsurance Operations; and Jon Zaffino, President of our North American Insurance Operations. Before we begin, I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I note that statements made during today’s call which are forward-looking in nature, such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations and the like, are subject to various risks. As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations. Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements. Now, let me turn the call over to Dom.
Dominic Addesso: Thanks, Beth. Good morning and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. This morning we have very positive results to report, although many are probably already more interested in next quarter as a consequence of Hurricane Matthew, we will get to that but first a bit about the third quarter. As you have seen the operating earnings per share were $6.53 which translates to a 14% annualized operating ROE, this of course leads expectations impart due to another light cat core, however that is only part of the story. Overall, the attritional combined ratio has improved year-over-year and I believe represents the more relevant part of the message. In both the reinsurance and insurance segments, there is positive movement. Reinsurance for example on a year-to-date basis has improved the attritional combined ration from 82.7 to 80.7, this is partially due to a lower frequency large risk losses, but also a result of continuing to modify our portfolio in the phase of a declining rate environment to achieve the best risk adjusted return. In addition and perhaps more impactful are the newer lines of business we are taking on, which in general include mortgage and credit exposure as well as structured products, John Doucette will give some detail on these individual reports. On the insurance side, the story is also favorable after excluding Heartland, as you know was our crop operation that was sold during the quarter. Excluding crop, the North American insurance operation reported a year-to-date attrition combined ratio of 96.4%. This is higher than our longer term objective partly due to an increased expense ratio, as we are currently ramping up and investing heavily in this segment, both domestically and internationally. This is consistent with the strategy we have discussed in the past. Build versus buy strategy has been our best option as we have been able to capitalized on the Everest brand, and the talent availability coming from recent M&A transactions as well as corporate restructurings. Also elevating the insurance attritional combined ratio this year was an abnormally high level of weather event. Taking all this into account, we are extremely pleased with our portfolio on how the operational build is progressing. Jonathan Zaffino will later give you further detail on the insurance operations. To sum up our reinsurance and insurance operations generated underwriting income excluding cat losses through the nine-months of $583 million, which on average is almost $200 million per quarter. When combined with average quarterly investment income operating earnings are in the range of approximately $315 million per quarter before cat losses. At our effective tax rate that equates to approximately $275 million. This number is relevant as you begin to think about the impact of Hurricane Matthew on fourth quarter results. Currently our modeled estimate, for an industry loss that ranges between $3 billion and $9 billion are $75 million to $200 million net of taxes in reinstatement premiums. At this early stage, this is our best estimate and would appear to be containing within our otherwise normal quarterly operating earnings. Turning to other items of note, first is that investment income was above the prior year's quarter and on a year-to-date basis essentially flat. Given the current investment environment and the current reinvestment rates are lower than the maturing assets this is an outstanding result. Not unlike underwriting portfolio, we take similar action on the investment front. Rotation into good risk adjusted bets has been the strategy, which has maintained yield but with one of the lowest data in the industry. Second was the aforementioned sale of our crop operation in the third quarter. And clearly we are not at the scale we needed to be in order to be sufficiently profitable. The outcome was essentially a transaction, which converted our insurance book into a reinsurance program, taking the advantage of the expense synergy that our client can bring to bear in larger portfolio. Finally, I would like to highlight the $200 million of share re-purchases that we have made since last quarter. This brings the year-to-date number to $386 million. We continue to manage capital with an approached that considers our long-term business opportunities. This essentially means that while we do buy in capital our bias is that we will continue to find ways to put capital to work profitably and grow the franchise. Our history would suggest that we have managed this effectively. And therefore as always we elect not to give guidance on this point to maintain our flexibility. While current market conditions in our point of any rapid growth there remain numerous opportunities to put capital to work. In particular we see a continued pace in insurance segment as well as specialty areas in the reinsurance sector. Therefore, for now, we will maintain our current capital management strategy of share repurchases and dividend at a level less than our projected earnings. With that I would like to thank you and turn it over to Craig for financial highlights.
Craig Howie: Thank you, Dom and good morning everyone. Everest had a solid quarter of earnings with net income of $295 million, this compares to net income of $89 million for the third quarter of 2015. Net income includes realized capital gains and losses. On a year-to-date basis, net income was $623 million compared to $621 million in 2015. After-tax operating income for the third quarter was $273 million compared to $200 million in 2015. Operating income year-to-date was $630 million compared to $755 million in 2015, a primary differences were catastrophe losses and foreign exchange. The overall underwriting gain for the Group was $432 million for the first nine-months compared to an underwriting gain of $498 million for the same period last year. On a year-to-date basis, the overall results reflected gross catastrophe losses of $151 million in 2016 compared to $61 million in 2015. In the third quarter of 2016, the Group saw $18 million of catastrophe losses, these losses primarily related to the Hurricane Hermine in Florida, this compares to $34 million of catastrophes during the third quarter of 2015. The overall current year attritional combined ratio for the first nine-months was 85.2%, down from 85.8% for the same period in 2015. The 2015 attritional ratio included $60 million loss estimate for the explosions at the Chinese port of Tianjin. Our year-to-date expense ratio was 5.8% as we anticipated with the build out of our insurance platform and our Lloyd's Syndicate. For investment, pre-tax investment income was $123 million for the quarter and $358 million year-to-date on our $17.5 billion investment portfolio. Investment income year-to-date declined only $5 million from one year ago. We have been able to maintain investment yield without a dramatic shift in our overall investment portfolio. However, as Dom mentioned, we have gradually shifted allocations within our alternative investment bucket to de-risk the portfolio. We have reduced our exposure to emerging market debt and public equity while committing more toward fixed income, limited partnership investment, all while maintaining a conservative, well diversified, high credit quality bond portfolio. The pre-tax yield on the overall portfolio was 3% and duration remained at about three year. Foreign exchange is reported in other income, foreign exchange gains were $2 million in the third quarter. Year-to-date foreign exchange losses were $29 million, compared to $62 million of foreign exchange gains in the first nine-months of 2015. Both of these results are unusual and represent $91 million pre-tax swing year-over-year. The 2016 foreign exchange losses primarily reflect the relative strengthening of U.S. dollar against other world currencies including the British Pounds and the Euro. The foreign exchange impact is effectively an accounting mismatch, since it's offset in shareholders equity through translation adjustments and unrealized gains due to the positive impact of holding foreign investments that are available for sale. Overall, we maintain an economic neutral position with respect to foreign exchange, matching assets with liabilities in most major world currency. Other income also included $10 million of earnings and fees from Mt. Logan Re in first nine-months of 2016, compared to $15 million of income for the same period last year. The decline essentially represents the higher level of catastrophe losses during 2016. On income taxes, the 13.2% year-to-date annualized effective tax rate on operating income was lower than the 14.8% tax rate at this time last year. This is primarily due to foreign exchange losses and the higher level of catastrophe losses in 2016. A 13 to 15% effective tax rate on operating income for the full-year is in line with our expectations, depending on the amount of catastrophe losses for the remainder of the year. Stable cash flow continues with operating cash flows at $951 million for the first nine-months of 2016, compared to $802 million in 2015, which in part is reflective of our strong reserve position compared to actual paid losses. Shareholders equity for the group was $8 billion at the end of the third quarter, up $433 million or 6% over year end 2015. This is after taking into account capital return through $379 million of share buybacks, and the $144 million of dividend paid in the first nine-months of 2016, which combined represent a return of 84% of net income. Additionally, we repurchased another $7 million of stock after the third quarter close. These purchases will be reflected in the fourth quarter of 2016 financial statement. Book value per share increased 10% to $196.67 from $178.21 at year end 2015, generating 12% growth in shareholder value including dividends. Our strong capital balance leaves us well positioned for business opportunities as well as continuing share repurchases. Thank you and now John Doucette will provide a review of the reinsurance operation.
John Doucette: Thank you Craig, good morning. We are pleased to report another strong quarter for our reinsurance operation, delivering $203 million of underwriting profit to the bottom line. This compares very favorably to Q3 last year, with profits up $87 million quarter-over-quarter. The difference is predominantly driven by higher cats and the loss of the Chinese port Tianjin last year, ultimately resulting in about an eight point improvement to the combined ratio to 80.1% this quarter. The attritional combined ratio also dropped from 85.2% to 78.9% as the Tianjin losses added six points to the third quarter attritional loss ratio last year. Despite the soft market conditions, we successfully executed our reinsurance strategy with our global reach, long standing client and broker relationship, responsiveness, strong and sizeable balance sheet and innovative capital structures, sustaining and even modestly growing our premium writing. For the quarter, our total reinsurance segment gross written premium was $1.25 billion, up 1% from Q3 last year, on a constant currency basis premiums grew 2%. Our total reinsurance net written premium was $1.22 billion for Q3, up 13% from last Q3. The net premium result was affected by the Heartland sale and the assumption of this crop portfolio out of the insurance segment and into the U.S. reinsurance segment. Year-to-date, our gross reinsurance premium was down 3% but down only 1% on adjusted for currency movement. On a net basis year-to-date reinsurance premium were up 1%. The U.S. reinsurance premium growth was strong in the quarter, up 9%, due to growth in structured reinsurance transaction in particular in the mortgage and credit space. In addition, the increased premium on facultative casualty and crop reinsurance business. This was offset by lower premium on weather, Marine, surety and property pro rata business. Notably the structured reinsurance deals required broad expertise and scale to execute and often provide significant benefit over and above the pure risk transfer and consequently are not subject to the same pressures as the remainder of the reinsurance market. The segment combined ratio was up to 78.4% from 73.8% Q3 last year. We had 3.4 points of cat losses versus none in the prior Q3. This driven this quarter by Hurricane Hermine and some development on events that occurred earlier in the year due to late reporting. Our attritional loss ratio was up almost five points due to non-cat weather events in Texas and the Midwest in addition to a higher loss ratio on the new crop reinsurance premium. Conversely the crop reinsurance premium has lower expenses contributing to the 2.3% decline in the commission expense ratio. Our international reinsurance segment premium was down 4% for the quarter, but only 2% on a constant dollar basis. This was primarily due to lower property pro rata business in the Middle East, which was offset by growth in our Latin America and international factors. Overall, we had better attritional ratios due in part for the Tianjin loss last year as well as better experience in certain region. Lower cat, including the least prior year catastrophe reserves further benefitted results this quarter. Our Bermuda segment premiums were down 9% or 7% on a constant dollar basis, driven by lower motor business in Europe. Excluding FX, we saw growth in London this quarter. Overall, the combined ratio improved 6.8 points to 19.7%. The current year attritional loss ratio was down about 15 points with roughly half due to the impact of the Tianjin loss in last Q3. This was somewhat offset by higher commission expenses due to changes in business mix. Recently, the reinsurance industry was confronted with its first significant borrow to win loss over a decade, but Matthew will be a lesser impact to the industry than initially feared. Nonetheless, we are comfortable that our exposures are well controlled given the gross portfolio we have built as well as the various mitigation tact that’s being forth. Additionally, our global diversification across various lines of insurance and reinsurance buffers the group loss and such event making them manageable. Although, Matthew will not be a game changing loss for most collateralized or traditional players, it may tests the functioning of various collateral mechanisms. As a buyer of both traditional and collateralized reinsurance, we are familiar with the complications and potential headaches of collateralized arrangement. These complications compound with uncertainty around the ultimate outcome of a large event such as Matthew, given new season and untested claims management process. However, while Mt. Logan provide significant collateralized support ultimately serving our client, it stands behind Everest and is in visible through our season, unburdening them from the inherent complexity of such arrangement. With the suite of solution to best match the risk capital including our $8 billion of equity, Mt. Logan, our catastrophe bond and other internal and external sources of capital, we offer our client meaningful capacity from a trusted partner. And we continue to look for ways to broaden our value proposition to our clients with these various solutions. Mt. Logan in particular continues to draw interest of new investors including various pension fund and we look forward to increasing the scale and the scope of the benefit that Logan provides to Everest client and shareholders. With respect to the current activity in the market and looking ahead to 1/1 renewal, the reinsurance market seems to be trying to find the floor with many underwriters resisting furthering the rate concessions over the last several renewals. Many competitor's management teams are increasingly realizing that the returns may no longer cover their cost of capital, assuming a normalize level of cat losses and also seeing that they can easily miss earnings estimates with a few large risk losses or small medium cat event. Everest with its significant expense advantage and broadly diversified global portfolio continues to produce solid returns despite to competitive rate environment. As the business is also stabilizing and the market is taking a stand against further increases [indiscernible] session. We have also seen some aggressive firm order terms for casualty placement face stiff resistance in the casualty treaty markets. In addition, some of the loss activity seen by our clients, spark demands for facultative casualty reinsurance, and we continue to see increased demand in the mortgage credit area. The casualty reinsurance pricing stabilization is offset somewhat by the moderate decreases in a regional casualty and E&S rate. We also remain cautious of new large capacity in the broker markets. Nevertheless, as large insurers continue to bundle their program, they are seeking partners like Everest, who have underwriting expertise in all classes of business and in multiple territories around the world. This plays into our strength as a large diversified global reinsurer that addresses the market with decades of relationships and creative, responsive underwriting all at a significant scale. Thank you. And now, I’ll turn it over to Jon Zaffino to review our insurance operation.
Jonathan Zaffino: Thanks John and good morning. I’m pleased to share with you third quarter results for the Everest Global Insurance Operations, similar to last quarter and a consideration of the divestiture of Heartland on August 24th. I will be discussing our quarterly results excluding this business. The full results of the insurance segment inclusive of Heartland are covered in our financial supplement released yesterday. As respect premium production overall, our many strategic initiatives align towards a singular objective of building a world-class specialty diversified insurance organization continue to gain momentum. Many of the new underwriting divisions incepted over the past several months are showing increased contributions to our growth and ultimately to profitability. Third quarter marks the seventh consecutive quarter of underlying growth for our global insurance business again excluding Heartland. As a result of these efforts, gross written premium in the quarter expanded 25% over the prior year quarter to $371 million. This is reflective of the continued investments we have made in our U.S. and London platforms along with the continued strong contributions from our Canadian and Accident and Health operations. Net written premiums for the quarter increased 23% compared to third quarter of 2015 to $318 million, which is in line with our net-to-gross ratio for the second quarter. On a year-to-date basis, gross written premiums increased by $185 million or 19% over the prior year period to $1.1 billion. Likewise, net written premiums increased a $129 million or 15% to $970 million which again was in line with our expectation. Turning to the combined ratio, the GAAP combined ratio for the quarter was a 101%, which improves to 99.5% on an attritional basis. Year-to-date the GAAP combined ratio was 102.2 again on an attritional basis excluding the impact from previously announced cat events and prior year development, the year-to-date combined ratio improved to 97.1%. This is inclusive of the expenses associated with the build out of our U.S. and Lloyd’s platforms, which added nearly two points to the expense ratio year-over-year. We do anticipate our Lloyd’s operation will absorb much of this increase as earned premium increasingly works its way through thus mitigating the impact here. The loss and loss expense ratio for the quarter was 71.3% which improves to 69.8% on an attritional basis. The loss and loss expense ratio for the quarter was impacted by some notable property per risk losses and a slight change for the loss ratio for our medical stop loss business. This was a result of a reevaluation of our experience over the first six months of this year and our expectations of this business going forward. It should be noted that this particular unit continues to deliver strong results for us including post this adjustment. On a year-to-date basis the GAAP loss and loss expense ratio was 73.3% with an attrition of 68.2% essentially flat year-over-year with the difference being predominantly 4.4 points of cat activity or events in the second quarter. I'll now provide some color on the performance of our major insurance portfolio starting with the North America P&G book which is our largest business. The core P&G portfolio delivered 19% growth in the quarter building upon a similar number from the second quarter of this year. Growth was balanced across short tails, specialty and casualty lines. Further our new business lines launched in the U.S. which have been discussed on recent calls, contributed nearly 11% of gross written premium in the quarter double the contribution from the second quarter of 2016. We are encouraged by the growing momentum within these portfolios and hence the opportunities ahead. The Accident and Health Group delivered another solid quarter of growth with the near 30% increase over the prior year comparable quarter, continuing the consistent trend we have experienced throughout the year. Our efforts awfully grow our medical stop loss segment have been successful and have our efforts to complement this growth with new products across Medicare supplement, sport disability and short-term medical markets. Our Lloyd’s operation also continue to expansion. Syndicate contributed $16.4 million to insurance growth in the quarter demonstrating the increased momentum we are gaining within this platforms despite the difficult trading environment. Year-to-date the Lloyd’s has now delivered nearly $35 million of premiums in reinsurance segment yet only $9.7 million earned premium which again temporarily impacts the expense ratio. We are encouraged by the growth trajectory of this platform and we will maintain our discipline in seeking profitable opportunities for growth. From the rate side, we see a very similar picture to what we have witnessed in the second quarter of this year. Within the U.S. market, we continued to achieve positive rate on auto lines both commercial and personal as well as on the general liability side. The professional liability market continues to be competitive with the rate decreases in the mid-single digit range across lines being common. The U.S. property market remains in a prolonged soft cycle; however, the magnitude of rate decreases continue to moderate from the third quarter. Large individual risk losses coupled with the severity of North American cat losses this year, punctuated by the first main storm making land fall in Florida in over a decade has provided a dampening to the rate decreases often sought. Thus despite a competitive market dynamic, we believe opportunities for profitable growth through a diversified portfolio remain. As respects to Canadian market, again a similar story to second quarter. The market remains competitive for most lines of business, but the major lines liability rates remain essentially flat to prior quarter. Canadian property rates have generally flattened in cat exposed areas within certain provinces, yet outside of these areas, there remain some moderate rate pressure. We will keep a close eye in January first renewal cycle to see how the market reacts to the record cat losses within Canada this year. Particularly the upcoming reinsurance renewals and any corrective rate measures that may follow. Management liability lines remain very competitive while other specialty lines are likewise still on the rate pressure but ultimately a bit moderated. So again, it’s a bit of mix situation yet trending similar to prior quarters. A notable difference here is the uncertainty of the property market as we enter year-end. In conclusion, we look forward to carrying our strong top-line momentum into the fourth quarter and into 2017. We are encouraged by the underlying trends of the many businesses we have cultivated over the past many months, and especially with the talented leaders we have attracted to Everest to lead these missions for us. As we continue to add skills through our grown operations, we expect these ventures to become a more meaningful profit contributor to our global portfolio. With that, let me turn it back over to Beth for Q&A.
Elizabeth Farrell: Thank you, Jon. Keith, we are open now to take questions from the audience.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] and we will take our first question Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, your line is open. Kai, please check the mute button on your phone. Okay we will go next to Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Elyse Greenspan: Yes, good morning. First off, I was hoping to in terms of your premium outlook, and it was the commentary on marketing systems Re. But as we think about going forward, do you think the reinsurance growth will kind of stay at about 2% or so ex-currency and the insurance growth kind of stay in-line with them the Q3 level as we think about the Q4 in 2017?
Dominic Addesso: Elyse, we don’t really try to give guidance on where we think our premium growth will come from. We do of course think that directionally on the insurance side is that will be the side of our business that will grow at an increased pace relative to reinsurance. It's hard to say at this point until we get a little further long into renewal season, depending on where rates are and depending on what the opportunities that are presented to us. So, I think a conservative view like you are describing is not unreasonable, but there is a lot of variability around that numbers.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay great. And then in terms of the international reinsurance segment, the underlying loss ratio in that segment was pretty strong about a 47% in the quarter, was there anything one-time impacting that number?
Craig Howie: Else, this is Craig. What happened this quarter was in the past we had seen a number of one-off type losses that were non-catastrophe type losses that held up the attritional ratio in that segment. We were able to bring that loss ratio down more in-line with where it should be absent those losses.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay, great. And then in terms of the insurance business, now that the crop sale has been completed, do you think we are at a point where on a go forward basis that segment maybe running a little bit off of your long-term goals, but the margins stabilize on a profitable level from here? And then combined with that at what timeframe do you think we will see the expense ratio normalize there for some of the hiring that you have done in that business?
Dominic Addesso: Well certainly for the next several quarters I think we will see the expense ratio remain where it is. Remembering that we will continue to pursue growth, so there will be quite a few quarters frankly where the written and the earned will be at a line so to speak, in other words the written will be well above we earned. Our expense growth through the nine-months have actually been consistent with our top-line growth. So the raise in the expense ratio is explained purely by that. I would also add, if you compare our expense ratio to many of our competitors or peer companies, we are well below industry average from the expense ratio point of view. So we are not discouraged by the amount of the investment we have make in order to grow this business. And as far as the overall combined ratio, we should expect that given the fact that crop is now out of the picture, we should expect that to be more stable and frankly even improve overtime, particularly as we grow some more of the specialty lines of business that we are focused on.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay, great thank you. And then one other thing, is at all possible in the supplement in the future, maybe you could include the insurance results the prior year, quarter just on a pro forma basis including the crop business to help with the comparables that would be pretty helpful. Thanks very much.
Dominic Addesso: We appreciate the suggestion and we will certainly talk about that. The other thing I want to add at least to your question is that - not to add to your question but to add in response to your question is that the other thing keep in mind that affects reinsurance premium growth, we have a fair bit of pro rata business, so depending on what happens with some of those accounts that can have an impact on the percentage growth. So you have to keep that in mind as well.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. Thanks very much.
Dominic Addesso: Thank you.
Operator: And next we'll try to go back to Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Kai Pan: Thank you, can you hear me now?
Dominic Addesso: Yes, Kai.
Kai Pan: That's good. Thank you. Sorry for the earlier trouble. Maybe expense control on my side. So, just to follow up on Hurricane Matthew losses, $75 million to $200 million in net losses. I just wonder, could you give a little bit more detail in terms of in Florida or North Carolina? Is it wind or flooding? And how does that compare with your expectation? Because you have been pretty proactively shaping your portfolio in that part of the region.
Dominic Addesso: Well I'm going to make a few comments and then ask John Doucette to jump in here. But I think frankly it's a little early to maybe get into the specifics that you are after. The estimates that were used were based on modeled output as I said the industry range we frankly use greater but $9 billion I know there is a number lower than that on both the low side and the high side, we just rounded it as three to nine so that you had the full range of what the outcomes might be. I don't think the loss here is outside our expectations, frankly, our market share numbers again on this net basis that we are describing here is somewhere between 2% and 3%, probably middle of that would be a good estimate to use. So that's kind of the range of the outcome and that's not outside of our expectation. John, do you have anything further to add to that?
John Doucette: Thanks Dom, good morning Kai, just a little bit more on the loss. Most of the loss would be a reinsurance loss to us most likely, although we would have potentially some insurance losses, potentially in South Carolina and in terms of the overall split of the of the loss. We would point you that some of it would be coming from the Bahamas, where Everest is one of the larger reinsurers and have been for a long time in the Caribbean. So maybe about 25% of the loss and again that number will move around, but I'm just trying to give some directional guidance, but the majority of the loss would be a reinsurance loss coming from our Florida clients.
Kai Pan: Okay, that's great. And then given we had some sizable losses this year, it looks like January 1 renewal rates probably further stabilize. I just wonder, given the current market environment, basically flat pricing, would you expect to keep your reinsurance attritional combined ratio stable going forward? Or it will continue to have some pressure on the core margin side?
Dominic Addesso : I would think that it would be relatively stable and again keep in mind that I think in large part that’s a question about property cat. And things can change a lot based on other lines of business growing the casualty portfolio, growing mortgage, credit. All those things have an impact on the reinsurance attritional combined loss ratio and result to combined ratio. So a mix can play a big factor as well as what I mentioned to at least pro rata, some of those accounts go away or get reduced that has the favorable impact as well.
Kai Pan: Okay, that's great. My last question, and we have seen recently some tick up in terms of the merger acquisition activities in the space, and also in the press. There's a specialty insurance business, like a potential looking for sale. I just wonder, looking at your strategy, build-versus buy, are you interested in some of the -- like a potential business out there, you might be interested, as through acquisitions as well? Or any particular platform you would like to look into, to grow?
Dominic Addesso : Well, of course it's hypothetical, because it all depends on what is out there. Generally, I would have to say that most if not all properties that where companies are seeking strategic options, given Everest size and scale we get an opportunity to look at. And obviously we've made a decision to continue on the path that we are on. In most cases or in many cases it can be result of price, it can be cultural fit, integration is a challenge, and in many cases in acquisition you have to look not only to what you can combine but what you have to eliminate and what we prefer to stay focused on is what we can add to our existing portfolio. In addition, over the last 18 months or so the market has presented many opportunities to hire some great talent. We are very pleased with that and frankly that’s a more cost effective alternative, without having to put on a goodwill on the book.
Kai Pan: Okay, thank you. Yes, thank you so much. And if I may, just quick last one, is that your survival ratio on asbestos has dropped to 5.1 in the quarter. I just wonder, what do you see the trends here, and when do you do your annual reserve study? Thanks..
Craig Howie: For asbestos, we always look at asbestos on a quarterly basis Kai. We do the annual review during the fourth quarter, we always continue to look any and all trends that are out there, as well as any clients that are taking charges that we would have exposure too, but again we will look at that in the fourth quarter.
Dominic Addesso: And anything material as Craig says during any particular quarter we would have to put something there. But again it is subject to the yearend reserve reviews as well.
Kai Pan: Thank you so much.
Dominic Addesso: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Michael Nannizzi: Thank you so much. Just a couple of numbers once if I could Craig you mentioned the tax rate would be in that sort of 13% to 15% range. If there are more losses in the U.S. proportionally than any typical fourth quarter, I would think the tax would be lower or is there something else that would cause the tax rate in the fourth quarter.
Craig Howie: Michael that’s correct, if there are more losses or higher end of the catastrophe losses, we would be at the lower end of that late that I said 13% to 15%.
Michael Nannizzi: Got it. The year-to-date is around 13, right so it wouldn’t be lower than what you experience through the year-to-date, it would just be at that same level?
Craig Howie: It really depends on how high it is and with respect to our planned losses in the fourth quarter. So again, that’s a annualized effective rates. So guidance that I gave was 13% to 15%, would be on the lower end if we had higher catastrophe loss.
Michael Nannizzi: Got you, okay thanks. And then we don’t see Mt. Logan on a standalone base anymore, but can you give us some color on sort of what the performance was in that portfolio in third quarter and whether you would expect the fourth quarter and the impact of Matthew to be similar there as it is in your on balance sheet book?
Craig Howie: So what we take through are the earnings and fees that we take are through other income. So far, year-to-date we've taken for $10 million compared to $15 million last year, the reason that it's lower this year is because the anticipated estimates for losses in the Logan book will remaining fees that we get until those losses are settled. So essentially that’s what you are seeing for Logan so far this year.
Michael Nannizzi: Got it. And then any change to 4Q deployment expectations given your sort of early read on Matthew or is that within your sort of load enough that it doesn’t change your perspective on deployment?
Craig Howie: I am not sure, the deployment you mean…
Michael Nannizzi: Sorry, a buyback capital share repurchase?
Craig Howie: No, I think what my comments and my remarks related to really the annual earnings, so quarter only as it impacts the annual earnings. So again, we look at the entire year, not just a quarter.
Michael Nannizzi: Okay. And then just one last if I could, just following up on Elyse's question on the international segment. The losses look like it was mid-40s pretty low by historical standards even going back to like hard market years. Was it that losses there were sort of more normal relative to higher losses in that linked quarter last year or were they actually sort of even lower than a more normal year, more normal environment?
Craig Howie: Yes, so in the past, we had elevated losses including losses all around the world, Latin America as well as you know floods in Middle East and North Africa as well. So in essence what has happened is we have seen lower levels of those losses as well as a different mix of business that’s coming through those books and what you are seeing is ratio that’s more in-line with where it should have been in the past.
Michael Nannizzi: Got it, great. Thank you so much for the answers.
Craig Howie: Thank you, Michael.
Operator: Next question will come from Jay Gelb with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Jay Gelb: My only question is Baden Baden, in terms of the Continental European Reinsurance Conference, is ongoing. Any live feedback you can provide us in terms of what the expectations are coming out of there?
John Doucette: Well, good morning Jay, it's Jon. So it's going on right now, so we haven't had too much feedback from our team to build there. But we do send a meaningful team from recovering both Continental Europe plus Middle Eastern African clients and others that make their way there as well. So I think one of the messages that we have is the continued build out of our capabilities, we've added various people in our European operation and with that have added product lines that we can support. So I think the larger buyers are continuing to consolidate their placement which we are a net beneficiary of and the fact that we have meaningful capacity to deploy with Mt. Logan and Everest also helps us be even more relevant to the client. And as I said we have been viewed as a stable partner and with the increase in our capabilities we expect to have more trading opportunity with our European and Middle East, Africa clients.
Jay Gelb: That's helpful. Thank you.
Dominic Addesso: Thanks Jay.
Operator: And we'll go next to Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Joshua Shanker: Thank you for taking my question, if we think about 2017 and beyond, as we look at the expense ratio in insurance, how much of a drag is there from the significant growth going on, and so where do you think next year as Heartland changing into whatnot, where does that shake out.
Dominic Addesso: Well, as I mentioned before currently and I don't know that I would describe it as a drag, given the fact that as I pointed out we have even on the insurance side, one of the lowest expense ratios in the business. So our expense ratio insurance wise year-over-year is elevated by two points. I would expect that differential to remain there for few quarters if not several quarters, because we certainly would expect the written premium growth to far outpace the earned premium growth and our actual expenses are growing consistent with the written premium growth. So when the earned premium starts to stabilize relative to the written, then you will start to see that expense ratio come in a bit.
Joshua Shanker: Given the current size of the book at 200 basis points sort of build out expense on top, is that the right way to think about it.
Dominic Addesso: That's how we're thinking about it right now, correct. And by the way my point though is that you are calling it a build out, but in one word you could use is investment, the reality is, is that those expenses will be covered once the earned premium comes in to match it. or said a different way our expense growth is consistent with our written premium growth.
Joshua Shanker: And I think there is I have to go review the last quarter as well, but as Heartland comes out, as I'm looking back trying to compare 3Q 2017 to 3Q 2016 on the expense ratio how is that going to direct it.
Dominic Addesso: The expense ratio, maybe I'll answer it by a combined ratio basis, because I think this is what you were getting at, if not come back again. But right now our attritional combined ratio is in the mid 90s, 95, 96 somewhere in there.
Joshua Shanker: You need a 101 for the quarter.
Dominic Addesso: But I'm talking about ex cats and et cetera. So we think that our base book is running right now in the mid 90s, we would expect overtime frankly that number to improve more dramatically from improvements in the book of business and affecting the loss ratio, because that I think is where we see the major benefit coming from.
Joshua Shanker: And the quarter’s share relationship with Heartland incepts on 1/1 that's right?
John Doucette: The new quarter share in our business, in other words the Heartland was actually sold on August 24, so essentially what happens at that date is that insurance business then transfers over to be reinsurance business on the Everest books. And then we have quarter share with the new company to take in certain percentage of their overall book going forward in 2017.
Joshua Shanker: On the first debut?
John Doucette: Right.
Joshua Shanker: Will that be a considerable thing; are we going to notice that in a large way? I mean I don’t know how to model that exactly. In this relation besides of Heartland how big this new crop business is?
Jonathan Zaffino: This is Jon. I think for the next year or so we would expect it to be about the same size maybe a little bit larger than what the Heartland book was.
Joshua Shanker: Okay. Thank you for the answer, I appreciate it.
Dominic Addesso: Thank you, Josh.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Quentin McMillan with KBW. Please go ahead.
Quentin McMillan: Thanks very much guys. Sorry to beat the dead horse in terms of the expense ratio question and the insurance segment, but I’m just thinking about it on an absolute dollar basis. The dollar that you spent were about $44.5 million in the third quarter. Is the dollar value a better maybe run rate basis of a way for us to think about it, because obviously you have been very active in hiring. Just not sure if there was also any incentive bonuses that were paid that maybe gets stripped out next year or anything else in there that we should think about outside of the ratio, but just on an absolute dollar basis to help?
John Doucette: By the way Quentin thanks for referencing to us as a dead horse. Quentin $44 million that Quentin is referencing, I think includes our - rate so we have to carve that out. But as we carve that out back to the point yes you are right, expense dollars or definitely up, as Dom said expense dollars are going to be up as net written premium is up as well, because we are growing that book. I don’t think you are seeing in outsized increase and expenses with respect to the increase in net premium. So from a percentage basis the overall ratio, the expense ratio has gone up just over two points. And that’s the way we are looking at it for now that it will stay at that level until we build out this book and then as you see the build out of this book in some of these new programs that business will earn in overtime. And as it earns in that’s when you will see that expense ratio start to moderate.
Dominic Addesso: And the other way that you might want to think about Quentin is in terms of building models, you might want to also consider modeling the expenses or looking at our expense ratio relative to written as oppose to earned.
Quentin McMillan: That’s a good thought. Thank you and then just in terms of coming back to 1/1, it sounds like Jon your expectations sounds like its four or flattish, renewal which will be better than we have obviously seen recently. Can you just talk about any change in sentiment or perception, obviously Matthew was on a crash course to a lot more damage than what ultimately happened when it turned East. Do you think that there is psychological impact from that that we are going to feel at 1/1 where when you go to clients you will be able to have a more honest conversation that the risk is real and that there is more ability to give more in pricing. I mean just should I talk about that dynamic at the 1/1 renewal please.
Jonathan Zaffino: Sure, I think it is something that’s real. Remember this is the first real land fall in 10 years, so I think that’s factoring into the psychology of the conversations and psychology of the buys of some of the clients. I mean look there is a lot of capital out there and we ultimately don’t know how we will go, but there will be profits we think we will better than others. We do think that U.S. is stabilizing particularly in the property and on the casualty as per the by our conversations about exceeding commissions on casualty rates and push back we have seen. So I mean we saw some of that as 6/1 and 7/1 on both the property and the casualty side. So international, it really depends on the geographic territory or where do we think rates are going to be flat or not. So but as you think to your point, I do think that it's not just the Matthew, but it's also risk losses, we have seen some large risk losses that can do some real damage to reinsurers as a quarterly income, and I think that also is starting to factor into the conversation.
Quentin McMillan: Thanks guys, and if I could just speak one last one on the mortgage insurance opportunity. You guys have sort of indicated in the past that you would preferred to play it on the reinsurance side I believe, because you can be a little bit more nimble to enter and exit the market as you see opportunistic options available to you. But can you just sort of give us a sense of what size you are and potential sort of what you might look to grow that book of business over the next couple of years?
Craig Howie: So, we have written a couple of these deals and multi-years deals and so they earn in over seven year period or longer. And so earned premium certainly from the GSEs has not been that high, but from the deals we have already executed we expect to see in future premium is coming in from those, from some of the MIs. They spend been more on quota share basis, those have been larger to date. And it really depends on what their capital needs are going forward as to whether those are going to be a growth opportunity or not, it really depend on a lot of different things. Certainly the regulations have caused them to delever from 25 to one to about 18 to one and they are using reinsurance to buffer that capital support, we like that. So to answer your question about opportunity in capacity, we see a lot of run rate there on the reinsurance side, and we expect to continue to put forth capacity at the appropriate price.
Quentin McMillan: Great. Thank you so much guys.
Operator: And it appears we have no further questions. I’ll return the program to our presenters for any closing remarks.
Dominic Addesso: Thank you to all that participating in the call. And kind of in summary, let just say that we are very obviously pleased with the quarter. Notwithstanding that to these challenges remaining at there as you all know. Certainly, market pricing is to top of the list and insurance growth for us is a journey that requires a lot of lot of hard work. We remain confident however that as far as cycles are concern, we had proven that we can effectively manage through these cycles, managing our exposures and our P&Ls and taking advantage of the opportunities that the market is giving us. On the insurance side, we remain focused on specialty areas in particular because this gives us better opportunity to avoid commodity type pricing. Ratings and scale make a difference and give us an opportunity to grow our insurance book, and while, as evident by the questions, expenses are up; but the growth there as I said is consistent with our written premium growth as it should be, the earns just has to catch up. And again, I want to emphasis that we are still best-in-class on the expense ratio side. So that’s something organizationally we pay attention to in both businesses. Overall, our flexibility allows us to commit our capital and resources to the best opportunity and our plan is to just continue this approach which has been successful for us in the past. Thanks for your interest in Everest and have a great day.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen this will continue today's program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a great day.

===== 2016 Q2  (2016-07-26 10:30:00) =====
Executives: Beth Farrell - VP, IR Dom Addesso - President and CEO Craig Howie - CFO John Doucette - President and CEO, Reinsurance Jon Zaffino - President, North America Insurance
Analysts: Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Jay Gelb - Barclays Quentin McMillan - KBW Amit Kumar - Macquarie Elyse Greenspan - Wells Fargo Sarah DeWitt - JP Morgan Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank
Operator: Good day everyone, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Call of Everest Re Group, Ltd. Today’s conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I’d like to turn the conference over to Ms. Beth Farrell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Beth Farrell: Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Everest Re Group’s second quarter earnings conference call. On the call with me today are Dom Addesso, the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer; Craig Howie, our Chief Financial Officer; John Doucette, the President and CEO of our Reinsurance Operations; and Jon Zaffino, President of our North American Insurance Operations. Before we begin, I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I note that statements made during today’s call which are forward-looking in nature, such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations and the like, are subject to various risks. As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations. Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements. Now, let me turn the call over to Dom.
Dom Addesso: Thanks, Beth. Good morning. We are pleased to report this morning another favorable quarter, particularly during a period where there have been a number of global cat events for the industry. Despite these events, we posted $3.67 of net income per share for quarter. On an operating income basis, earnings were $3.17 per share, compared to $5.03 for last year’s second quarter. This difference is primarily due to cat losses with the net impact of $105 million after reinstatement premium and taxes. Also impacting the quarter were foreign exchange losses of $27 million or $0.44 per share after tax. Excluding cats, the underlying attritional combined ratio is virtually the same at 86% in this year’s second quarter versus last. Furthermore, the attritional loss ratio has actually improved year-over-year. This highlights the changes to businesses and product mix that have been achieved. You will hear later when the business leaders describing some of those changes, but it is worth emphasizing as we have in the past that the flexibility and nimbleness of our business model continues to yield good outcomes. Of course offsetting the decreased loss ratio is an increased expense ratio as we invest in our insurance build out. As I mentioned in the first quarter, this will moderate through time thereby allowing the improved loss ratio to work its way through the overall combined ratio. This moderation is already occurring, as you note the decrease in the expense ratio from the first quarter to the second. Notable however is that the total expense ratio for the insurance segment coming in at 28.3% for the quarter remains several points lower than our competitors and we intend to maintain this advantage as we expand the operation. That expansion is well-underway. Growth in the insurance book is beginning to take hold as gross premiums increased by 32% in the quarter. On the other hand, somewhat offsetting this is the decline in the reinsurance segment. Rate levels and foreign exchange continue to affect this sector. Nevertheless, as John Doucette will later detail, we continue to move our capacity to the better risk-adjusted business and new product areas, particularly credibility. I am always encouraged by our ability to remain bottom line focused. Another item of interest in the quarter was the recovery of investment income in the lower than expected first quarter due to improvements in our limited partnership investments. On a year-to-date basis we’re still slightly off of last year, but given the continued interest rate levels, this is completely within our expectations. The impact of lower rates will diminish over time as all the maturities come in. While overall returns on capital continue to face pressure, we remain as one of the top performing companies in the industry. In an environment with a so called risk-free rate as low single-digit, our returns are quite strong with a 9.4% ROE and growth in book value per share of 7% in the first six months. Our book value per share growth also benefitted slightly from our continued share repurchases during the quarter. However, this was less than anticipated due to a pause in buying when cat events began to emerge during the quarter. So, it’s not a concern over the amount but just the fact that we had knowledge of events affecting the quarter. Finally, I’d like to address our other announcement regarding our crop insurance business. As you may have seen, we have received a letter of intent for the purchase of Heartland, our crop MGA from CGB Diversified Services. This transaction creates an opportunity for us to more quickly expand and diversify our exposure to this business on a more efficient basis. In the short-term, there will be no appreciable premium impact. However, it will now be recorded as reinsurance rather than insurance. In addition, we will see an expected improvement in margin due to the benefit of a lower expense structure. Buyer scale creates a more efficient deal for us and given their presence in the market, we should continue to benefit as a result of our strategic alliance. In summary, we believe there are many great initiatives underway at Everest. Yes, there are many challenges but we continue to work through many of them successfully. My colleagues will next offer some further details on the progress we are making. I look forward to your questions after that. Thank you. And now to Craig for the financial detail.
Craig Howie: Thank you, Dom. And good morning, everyone. Everest had a solid quarter of earnings with net income of $156 million, this compares to net income of $209 million for the second quarter of 2015. Net income includes realized capital gains and losses. On a year-to-date basis, net income was $327 million compared to $532 million for the first half of 2015. The primary differences were catastrophe losses and foreign exchange. After-tax operating income for the second quarter was $134 million compared to $225 million in 2015. Operating income year-to-date was $357 million compared to $554 million for the first six months of 2015. The overall underwriting gain for the Group was $234 million for the first half compared to an underwriting gain of $370 million in the same period last year. In the second quarter of 2016, the Group saw $149 million of current year catastrophic losses net of reinsurance. Of that total, $90 million related to losses from the Canadian wildfires, $36 million related to Texas hailstorms, and $23 million relate to the earthquake in Ecuador. The 2016 cat losses were partially offset by $25 million of favorable development on prior year cat losses, primarily from the 2011 Japan earthquake. The net impact of these losses after reinstatement premiums and taxes was $105 million. This compares with $23 million of catastrophes during the same period in 2015. The overall current year attritional combined ratio for the first six months was 85.7%, up from 84.5% for the first half of 2015. This is primarily due to the one point increase in the expense ratio. Our year-to-date expense ratio rose to 5.7% as we anticipated with the build out of the insurance platform and our Lloyd syndicate, but it was below our first quarter 2016 expense ratio of 5.9%. Foreign exchange is reported in other income. For the first half of 2016, foreign exchange losses were $31 million compared to $44 million of foreign exchange gains in the first six months 2015. Both of these results are unusual and represent a $75 million pretax swing year-over-year. The 2016 foreign exchange losses primarily reflect the weakening of the British pound during 2016 related to the Brexit vote. The foreign exchange impact is effectively an accounting mismatch since its offsetting shareholders’ equity for translation adjustments and unrealized gains due to the positive impact of holding foreign investments that are available for sale. Overall, we maintain an economic neutral position with respect to foreign exchange, matching assets with liabilities in most major world currencies. Other income also included $3 million of earnings and fees for Mt. Logan Re in the first six months of 2016, compared to $7 million of income in the first half of last year. The decline essentially represents the impact of catastrophe losses during the first half of 2016. On income taxes, the 11.9% year-to-date effective tax rate on operating income was lower than the 13.9% tax rate at this time last year. This was primarily due to the foreign exchange losses and the higher level of catastrophe losses in 2016. Stable cash flow continues with operating cash flows of $674 million for the first half of 2016 compared to $532 million in 2015, which in part is reflective of our strong reserve position compared to actual paid losses. As for loss reserves, last week we released our sixth annual global loss development triangles for 2015. There were no major changes since the 2014 release. Our overall quarterly internal reserving metrics continue to be favorable. Shareholders’ equity for the Group was $8 billion at the end of the second quarter, up $377 million or 5% over year-end 2015. This is the effort taking into account capital returns for $186 million of share buybacks and the $97 million of dividends paid in the first half of 2016, which combined represent a return of 87% of net income. Our strong capital position leads us with capacity to maximize our business opportunities as well as continue share repurchases. Thank you. And now John Doucette will provide a review of the reinsurance operations.
John Doucette: Thank you, Craig. Good morning. Despite a very active quarter for the industry with property catastrophe losses around the world, our reinsurance book performed well with $97 million of underwriting profit. This outcome highlights both, strong underwriting by our experienced underwriting teams and the benefit of a mature well-diversified book of business. We maintain a highly diversified portfolio by line and geography around the globe, which allows underwriting profits in one part of our book to offset losses that might arise in another part of the book. Our sub 90% combined ratio for reinsurance for the quarter demonstrates the value and robustness of this strategy, despite all the cat events. For our total reinsurance segment, net premiums were $771 million, down 8%. On a constant currency basis, they’re down approximately 6% as we carefully manage our net reinsurance book with hedges, higher attachment points and reduced exposures on deals with less attractive risk adjusted returns. Our reinsurance underwriting profit was $80 million lower than the underwriting profit in Q2 2015. The difference is driven predominantly by the $85 million in cat losses this quarter in the reinsurance segment compared to $27 million of cat losses in Q2 last year. As Craig indicated, cat losses this quarter emanated from Canadian wildfires, Texas hailstorm and flooding, and the Ecuador earthquake. Underwriting profits were also impacted by lower net earned premium and exchange rate fluctuations. Drivers of lower net premiums this quarter were non-renewals and reductions on some property pro rata treaties, which did not meet our risk adjusted return requirements. The attritional loss ratio this quarter is 53%, 2 points below Q2 last year and in line with Q1, as well as the full year 2015. Business mix and deployment of capacity in profitable areas such as mortgage and credit helped us maintain strong loss ratios despite tough reinsurance market conditions. The Q2 attritional combined ratio of 82.1% is up slightly from the 2015 full year 81.1%, but down 1 point when compared to Q2 2015. The improvement was largely driven by a 4-point year-over-year improvement in U.S. reinsurance which has been impacted by a higher level of attritional losses for weather and large risk events last year. The international segment also improved with lower commissions in the quarter. The Bermuda segment though experienced a higher attritional combined ratio, primarily due to commission and changes in business mix. Now, some color on our June and July 1 reinsurance renewals, which reflect approximately 10% and 15% respectively of our full year reinsurance premium. June 1st renewals are mainly Florida. Changes in programs vary, but the renewal process was orderly. Some of the largest programs shrank as we expected, and we reallocated capacity to larger and new layers for preferred clients. Rates were up by low single digits. The Florida renewal market fell like it has found the floor with more treaties not fully placed and more shortfall covers coming to help us. We are pleased with the overall results of our June 1 renewal; and with the re-underwriting of some underperforming treaties, we head into the wind season with somewhat reduced net PML for southeast wind compared to last wind season. At June 1, the U.S. property market also fell as low as it has bottomed out and the rates were closer to flat. This provides a good start to the upcoming 1/1 [ph] renewal discussion. Outside the U.S., the July 1st market conditions for short-tail were less rosy and still very competitive in Europe and Latin America. However, Asia and Australia renewals were better as we found more attractive places to deploy our capacity. In Canada, the Fort McMurray wildfire loss is the largest insured loss in Canadian history and reinsurance rates were up substantially. We seized the opportunity to deploy more capacity at higher pricing, particularly with the demand for backup covers in this region. The other loss affected areas around the globe also had increased rates at July 1. The market for 7/1 casualty business also fell as though it was finding the floor with several programs renewing as expiring, more resistance by reinsurers to broaden terms and conditions, and some high profile treaties with low take up with either pulled from the market or re-priced with more favorable terms. Anecdotally, we have heard some broker conversation is now shifting to managing client expectations on renewal pricing, terms and conditions. We continue to find pockets of attractive long-tail reinsurance including auto liability business and we also continue to provide meaningful capacity in the mortgage space, where there remains a robust pipeline of attractive business. In recent months, we continued to add strong talent to our reinsurance underwriting branch in Europe, U.S., Latin America, Singapore, Canada and Bermuda as well as further expanding our footprint into one-off structured risk solution. These deals are complex, difficult to source and require a broad set of underwriting, accounting, actuarial, legal, tax, contract wording, and structure and capabilities to execute them successfully. These opportunities are diversifying and much more shielded from the broader market pressures and therefore provide meaningful margin and strong risk-adjusted returns, adding to Everest bottom line. We are also seeing several reinsurance opportunities, driven by macro issues including capital and solvency requirements created by the market turmoil including Brexit; Solvency II, Dodd-Frank and related regulatory changes around the globe; profit and expense pressures at large clients who are now motivated to buy more reinsurance; Florida and other clients looking to expand geographically and the additional reinsurance capacity to support their growth; and some global clients are buying down retentions for individual risks or territories. Even in the mix of a tough market, these and other demand drivers provide accretive opportunities for Everest to capture as the leading global reinsurance. In Mt. Logan, we increased the number of investors, opened new fund and raised additional capital from existing investors. Overall AUM is about flat compared to last quarter given some redemption. We expect long-term growth and interest by investors to continue, given the unique, Logan Everest value proposition, which has resulted in best-in-class returns every year since Logan’s launch. As we have reached Logan’s third anniversary, new types of investors which we have been engaging with for some time, open up to potentially invest in the platform. Through Logan and additionally Kilimanjaro cat bonds, traditional reinsurance and IOWs we continue to optimize our network which remains well within our long standing group risk appetite. We are pleased with the outcome of both our quarter’s underwriting results in the face of several cat losses and large risk losses and the outcome of our June and July renewals, despite the current market conditions. And we are well-poised for a solid finish in the back half of 2016. Thank you. And now, I’ll turn it over to Jon Zaffino to review our insurance operations.
Jon Zaffino: Thanks Jon and good morning. Everest insurance continued its expansion in the second quarter as we made steady progress on our core strategic initiatives. We experienced another quarter of solid growth across our global operation, marking the sixth consecutive quarter of underlying growth with contributions from each insurance business unit. Echoing earlier commentary, North American division’s results, our largest insurance division were impacted by cat activity within the quarter. Despite this, our underlying attritional performance was solid and in line with our expectations. As announced yesterday and discussed on this call, given the sale of Heartland, I will share 2016 numbers with you excluding this operation. The full results including Heartland are outlined in the financial supplement released yesterday. Our global insurance operations inclusive of the North America division and Lloyd’s, gross written premium increased 23% quarter-over-quarter to $405 million while net written premiums grew to $343 million, an increase of 19% over the prior year quarter. Looking at the first half, again excluding Heartland, we produced gross written premium of 764 million, an increase of 17% and net written premium of 652 million, an increase of 12%. As mentioned on previous calls, net written premium growth slightly lags gross written premium growth, primarily due to a marginally more conservative reinsurance strategy in our U.S. operations as we add new businesses. The insurance segment GAAP combined ratio for the quarter ex-Heartland was 109 impacted by 13 points of cat activity or 38 million. This was attributable to exposure with our U.S. and Canadian property portfolios from the Texas hail events in April and the Fort McMurray wildfire. On an attritional basis, the calendar year combined for the quarter improved to 95.7% while the attritional loss and loss expense ratio for the quarter improved 130 basis points over the comparable prior year period to 66.9%. I’ll now turn to the performance of our major insurance segments, provide an update on market conditions and also briefly comment on the strategic expansion of the Everest insurance platform. Although the quarter was impacted by cat activity in the U.S. and Canada, we remain encouraged regarding our progress and the build out of our global insurance operation, the results of the underlying portfolio, and the opportunities ahead. Within our PNC operations, both our U.S. and Canadian units, demonstrated solid growth in the quarter. Gross written premium was up nearly 18% in the U.S. and up 22% in Canada. Further, our Lloyd’s insurance operation contributed nearly 11 million in gross written premium in the quarter to this segment, which we expect to accelerate in the months ahead. Nearly every underwriting unit contributed to these results, although similar to the first quarter, the growth varied across units and lines of business. Of note in the second quarter, we were pleased to see a meaningful contribution of 5% of premiums from our various new North American underwriting units launched principally over the past six months. Again, it’s early in the growth phase for these businesses and we remain optimistic about their trajectory. Our A&H group experienced another strong quarter of growth of registering nearly 42% increase quarter-over-quarter. Our effort to enhance our platform via expanded product and distribution capabilities are proving successful, and opportunities in certain medical stop loss markets headlined this quarter’s growth. Turning to the rate picture, the second quarter evidenced many of the same dynamics and challenges as those in the first quarter. While we did experience marginally more rate pressure in the second quarter, actual results were mixed by line of business. As noted earlier, our attritional loss ratio continues to improve despite this pressure and due to changes in our mix of business, various underwriting actions taken on selective portfolios and the achievement of positive rate in various areas, namely commercial auto. Further, we continue to believe that for the majority of lines, we are operating within a relatively tight range but the magnitude of rate volatility is limited. In the U.S. the property market overall continues to see low double-digit rate decreases on average. However, there are signs of moderation as the market seeks a bottom. Clearly, pressure from recent cat activity in the quarter is having an impact but it’s too soon to quantify this. Additionally, we are also noticing some select tightening in terms, particularly in states prone to convective storm activity. Third-party casualty lines are mixed with slight pressure or even flattening for both general liability and excess casually lines, once again, offset by positive rate movement in commercial auto. As in the prior quarter, management professional lines continued to experience mid-single digit decreases overall. There remains more intense pressure on excess layers with the rate reductions moderating on the primary. The work comp market also experienced moderately more pressure in the second quarter with low-to-mid single digit decreases being common. There remain pockets of opportunity across classes, segments and geographies although we continue to note new and expanded competition in this market and we’ll watch this closely in the months ahead. And within the A&H market, the medical stop loss segment remains competitive other than for accounts with challenging loss experience. Turning to Canada, the liability market mimics that of the U.S., slightly rate adjustments are noted yet remain essentially flat year-over-year. The property market likewise remains relatively flat. Post the Fort McMurray loss, there have been some pockets of increased rate adjustments within various territories and classes of business. Although early, we’re not seeing any wholesale firming across lines. We will keep a close eye on the market to see if the tone changes as we near the 1/1 [ph] reinsurance renewals So, again, a mix market landscape depending on the many factors influencing various lines of business. That’s stated, due to our increased product depth across geographies, we are able to seize profitable growth opportunities, despite challenging market conditions. Final thought regarding the strategic expansion of our global insurance operations. We continue to capitalize on the dislocation within the commercial market to build out our global specialty insurance capabilities with the new and enhanced products, additional leadership and underwriting depth, and expanded geographic reach. Each of our operations are making excellent progress on their 2016 goals and we anticipate increased momentum from actions executed over the past year. With that, let me turn it back over to Beth for a Q&A.
Beth Farrell: Operator, we’re ready to take questions now.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Michael Nannizzi: Maybe, start a bit on the insurance book and the growth there, clearly a very nice growth. Are the dynamics in the markets that you’re growing in, is there a shortage of capital that is allowing for you to pursue growth and continue to see a profitability improve or what other dynamics are at play just because I haven’t seen a lot of growth in insurance from some of our other companies so far? So, I just want to get an understanding of how the dynamics there? Thanks.
Dom Addesso: Michael, I don’t think it’s a case of capital. We all know that this industry is awash in capital. I think it’s really taking the opportunity to -- there are certain markets and particularly that in disarray. Companies are changing and the marketplaces always influx. And I think brokers are in particularly always looking for highly rated carriers coming to the space to either replaced markets that are reshaping their own portfolios or the distribution for one reason or another or changes in their in their own teams, in addition perhaps upgrading some of the credit quality of markets that they offered to their customers. So, it’s more -- it’s not about capital, it’s ore about taking advantage of opportunities from what I’d describe as dislocation and the offering that we could make to brokers of top quality.
Michael Nannizzi: So, these are opportunities that you are not winning on price specifically, you are able to come into the market to help fill a gap based on the profile of reinsurance counter-parties, either the brokers or the insurers want, is that?
Dom Addesso: I thought -- what I was answering was an insurance question; I thought that’s what you are referencing, correct?
Michael Nannizzi: Yes, your insurance, so either brokers that you’re placing. You said that brokers like you’re rating and profile. And so, I would think that either the brokers want you there and that’s part of the reason why you can write the business at attractive profitability or the insurers themselves want you there, is that…?
Dom Addesso: What I was specifically addressing though was the insurance segment, not the reinsurance segment, although some of the same qualities are there as well. And also, remember that on the insurance side, we have hired some notable talent in the industry, and with that comes relationships and business flows that way as well.
Michael Nannizzi: Okay. I think I was saying insurance not insurers, but okay; that’s right. And then, I guess is it possible to give us a little bit more color on the impact of the sale of the crop business, how much premium should come out of the insurance segment; how much should we expect to come into one of the reinsurance segments, I guess in U.S. reinsurance, just any context on -- and was there a dollar amount for the sale or was it all kind of bit part and parcel of then exchange of the franchise for a reinsurance premium on the back of that?
Dom Addesso: We are not at this point, since it’s just really a letter of intent, we are not disclosing detail [ph] of the transaction. But, I can say that there will be no material impact, gain or loss from the sale of company. As I mentioned in my comments that the premium impact of these from the short-term to the Group will be minimal, will be about the same in another words. So, right now, we have approximately $200 million of premium in the insurance base that we will transition forward to and be reflected in the reinsurance segment. So, it will be about the same, at least in the short-term. And then of course going forward, our participation with the buyer on reinsurance arrangements could -- and their expansion could make that -- the reinsurance premium go up over time. But no [ph] significant premium change to the Group; it’s just basically shifting it from one segment to the other of what we think as improved profitability.
Michael Nannizzi: And then, just on the prior year development of attritional cats, I just wanted to understand, was there a reason that number, the 2011 development didn’t go into a prior year category and why it ended up in -- I mean that was just accounting but why that ended up in the current accident quarter attritional cat load?
Craig Howie: Mike, this is Craig, We show cats on one line, that’s the only reason that we don’t breakout prior year cats and current year cats, that’s the only significance. That’s the reason we book it out in our discussion topic for the call.
Dom Addesso: That’s where [multiple speakers] originally, so, it flows through the same line item, if you will, in the second quarter.
Michael Nannizzi: So, in the past, when you had reinsurance prior development that’s been casualty development or underlying loss ratio development but not catastrophe development, is that the difference?
Craig Howie: That is correct.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Jay Gelb with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Jay Gelb: I think there was a fair amount of concern going into the second quarter around the catastrophe loss exposure, especially in Canada. When you think about the end result of roughly 10 points of earned premium and still generating around 9% return on equity on an operating basis in the first half, how does that shake out relative to what you would have thought of catastrophe of these magnitudes in the quarter?
Dom Addesso: How does that translate into earnings?
Jay Gelb: No, I mean, is it -- would you expect it to be this size or when you go through your risk management, would you expect it to be a bigger impact or maybe that’s just kind of jumping off point where you can talk about the risk management framework?
Dom Addesso: Well, I think this loss and how it impacted our results was kind of what we would have expected. We speak to kind of writing business with the best risk adjusted returns. So, as an example, in Canada, we tended not to write reinsurance deals that are heavy personal exposure. So, that obviously had some benefit to us. In addition, at least for last renewal season, we tended to be in the higher attaching layers. So, the lower layers did not meet our risk-adjusted return characteristics. So, yes, it kind of translated into what we would have expected. Given our presence in Canada, we did not experience any kind of an outsized loss, generally because we are directing our underwriting to those areas that we feel give us the best returns. I don’t know if that’s frankly what you’re asking.
Jay Gelb: It is, yes. That’s helpful. Thank you. My next question is on the international reinsurance segment, the 14% gross written premium growth in the second quarter. Can you give us some insight in terms of what was driving that and whether we should anticipate growth at that level going forward?
Dom Addesso: I think that was adjustments due to some large transactions that happened in 2015.
Craig Howie: That happened in 2015. So, this is -- 2016 year is more consistent with what you would expect to see going forward. There were accounting adjustments made in 2015, which is causing that comparison.
Jay Gelb: So, just to clarify that 14% growth is normalized for international?
John Doucette: I think the way to think about it is look at the entire six months of last year and compare it to the entire six months of this year and that is a more appropriate comparison, because it was basically a kind of -- and we talked about it on last quarter. And it kind of washes over the first six months of the year.
Jay Gelb: Okay. So, normalized down high single digits, gross?
Craig Howie: Right.
John Doucette: And that’s partially given by the FX.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Quentin McMillan with KBW. Please go ahead.
Quentin McMillan: Just a quick numbers related question, Dom, I think you had mentioned 27 million in FX losses. I just wanted to ask about Mt. Logan. Is the remainder of the other income expense bucket, the 28.4 million, is that all just a small loss from Mt. Logan basically?
Craig Howie: Mt. Logan actually had 3 million of income year-to-date for…
Dom Addesso: The number 27 million by the way was after-tax [Multiple Speakers]
Quentin McMillan: So, the 28.4 million is a 3 million gain from Mt. Logan and then like a 31 million pretax loss in FX, is that about right?
Craig Howie: 3 million of gain was for the year, Quentin.
Quentin McMillan: Oh, for the year, my apologies. Okay, but for the quarter -- okay, I think the rest of the numbers are actually in 1Q, so I can break it out that way. Secondly, just John, thanks very much for sort of just talking about the cat related losses in the quarter. I just wanted sort of understand a little bit more, it sounds like you are saying they came from Canada and then from the Texas hailstorms, but the 38 million is a lot higher than we’ve ever seen out of that portfolio. Can you just talk us about sort of why there might have been elevated property losses in the cat line this quarter, should we expect sort of a higher cat load in the insurance segment going forward?
John Doucette: Quentin, I don’t think it’s really out of line from our perspective. You remember, we’ve been steadily growing our E&S property book over the last several years, it’s been incredibly profitable for us. We do manage all of our accumulations at the Group level. So, in relation to a number of different benchmarks we look at, first and foremost group accumulation, our cat model, but secondly also our representative market share and any given market, the nature of the underlying events, both obviously two extreme events here with Fort McMurray and the Texas hail. So, the number might seem bigger than you’ve seen in the past, but in relation to depth of these books of business, we think it’s very much in line.
Quentin McMillan: So, if I could just say that slightly different way is sometimes the wind doesn’t blow your way, this might have just been a little of an outsized quarter, correct?
John Doucette: I think that’s correct.
Quentin McMillan: Okay. And then, just last question, Dom, you had mentioned in the first quarter the 11% growth rate in the insurance segment was a little bit below what we should expect for the full-year but the 20% you had previously mentioned maybe not quite in that level. Given the strong growth in the second quarter, is it safe to assume that you guys are targeting more of a 20% plus type growth rate or still sort of no real change?
Dom Addesso: Yes, our growth rate in the insurance sector will certainly be in the high teens. I don’t know if we readily admit over 20%. But, again that’s going to be based on what the market opportunity presents to us. If pricing continues deteriorating to any great degree then perhaps we pull back in certain areas. But we have got a number of new initiatives that we are just getting off the ground. So, I think the growth rate should be solid teens.
Operator: Next question is from the line of Amit Kumar with Macquarie. Please go ahead.
Amit Kumar: Thanks and good morning and congrats on the beat. Just a few follow-ups. The first question is on the Canadian wildfire. Can you tell us what industry loss you had used to compute that number?
Dom Addesso: Amit, we did not -- we really don’t go at it really that way. That certainly can be one methodology but we obviously had people on the ground assessing what’s going on there, as well as report from our clients. And it’s a little difficult with this of events because models aren’t unnecessarily built for this -- for wildfires. So, basing an estimate off of an industry loss is, in our view, very difficult and frankly not really appropriate. You can use that as a benchmark but at the end of the day, it really is about being on -- within the site as well as talking frequently to our clients and getting reports from our clients.
Amit Kumar: Got it. That’s a fair comment. And was Mt. Logan impacted by these cats?
Dom Addesso: A little bit, yes, sure.
Amit Kumar: And did the reception -- I know that you are talking about the reception from investors, did that change? Because as you mentioned, this is not a modeled peril?
Dom Addesso: Not to my knowledge; we have not heard any negative feedback from investors about these kind of events.
John Doucette: This is John. I think we communicate a lot with them on a regular basis, the Logan does and talks about the types of losses and exposures that they had and the Logan investors get access to a global portfolio and frankly expect to get losses all over the world, not just from hurricane, not just from earthquake. But again, given the returns that Logan has seen, Logan investors have seen which really are best in class, I think it just highlights the strength of diversification and the value of the mousetrap, the value competition of the mousetrap that we’ve built between Logan and Everest. I think if the investors -- it was nothing out of line for the investors side to the Canadian wildfires.
Amit Kumar: That’s very helpful. And just moving onto capital management, I know you talked about I think buybacks were blacked out for maybe a period, how many days were you blacked out? Because I am looking at the buyback number, it’s higher than Q1 and just trying to reconcile that and asking myself is valuation still attractive to ramp the buyback during the wind season or should we think differently about that?
Dom Addesso: First of all, it’s not technically a blackout period. What I was -- have mentioned is that the -- because we possessed material amount of public information about cat events, the fact that those reports of what those losses might be were streaming in, it became frankly little difficult for us to be in the market, not because of the size of the events but more because we were in the possession of material non-public information. But that’s -- I don’t know that that will technically be called a blackout period. As Craig pointed out earlier, we returned almost 90% between dividends and share repurchases, 90% of income. So, frankly, that’s not out of line with what we said we would do in the past, so.
Amit Kumar: And then, just finally wrapping up, I know there was this question on Heartland, and I appreciate, it’s difficult to share all the mechanics. I’m curious what led to the decision. Was it a function of scale or was it A&O payments, what prompted it and was it sort of shopped around? Some background on that would be very helpful, because we’ve seen other companies also do these kinds of things, I’m just curious as to the background.
Dom Addesso: As we’ve said in responses to questions about our crop operation for a long time that we’re always looking at strategic options. So, strategic options, in the earlier days, many months ago were more ago how we could build scale and how we could diversify because those were the two things that we needed to do to be successful kind of the primary MPCI [ph] writer. And folks at Heartland put certainly the great effort. But given the market dynamics it was very, very difficult to we found out to grow it organically and to diversify. And when we were presented this opportunity or this option from CGB, it was something that as we looked it, we said well, this would be a way given their scale, they’re already there in the space and we can immediately get the diversification of the scale that we need. And that’s what led to the decision to move in this direction. But, it was always with an eye towards wanting to grow it and diversify it, and recognizing that needed to be a scale business.
Operator: Next question is from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Elyse Greenspan: I was just hoping to talk little bit more about the insurance book that pointed to about 96% attritional combined ratio ex the crop business. Is that the right margin to assume on that book on a go forward basis? And then just tying into that in terms of your expense ratio, you did mention that it came down a bit sequentially. Is that something we should expect to continue to see as we go forward through the rest of this year?
Dom Addesso: So, the 96, I would expect overall to frankly improve a little bit more from there, as we grow the Lloyd’s operation. The Lloyd’s premium has been slow to book because of the accounting that takes place in our Lloyd’s operation. And frankly if you look at attritional without Lloyd’s, it’s more like a 95%. So, as Lloyd begins to prove its economics, which it will do through the balance of the year, that attritional combined ratio we would expect to move even lower. The improving expense ratio, as I said in the last quarter, I would expect that to continue to moderate over time, but compared to historical levels it will probably still be above those for certainly probably the next 12 months at least, but trending downwards towards the more normalized level.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay. And then, in the reinsurance commentary, you guys mentioned some one-off structured risk solutions, is there kind of a way to quantify kind of the impact of that on top line, was that a Q2 comment or was that a more about when you guys were looking forward towards the rest of this year?
Dom Addesso: Those kinds of transactions generally are pretty lumpy. And so, there really isn’t any way to quantify that frankly on the top line basis. And I think the value we’re mentioning that was more of a strategic choice and direction that we’re taking relative to our bottom line focus. These are transactions that require a lot of time. And so, there really isn’t any smoothness to the premium that we can outline for.
Elyse Greenspan: Okay, thank you. And then, last on just the capital management, you guys -- last year, at the Q3 was actually when you were most the active in terms of capital return. Is there any thought process behind slowing down repurchases surrounding hurricane season or is it kind of a similar philosophy the last year where just depending upon opportunity?
Dom Addesso: Probably depends upon opportunity; we do tend to see more cautious going in the wind season, but that obviously is relative to the opportunity as well.
Operator: Next question is from the line of Sarah DeWitt with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
Sarah DeWitt: On the insurance business, given your new initiative there, how big you think the segment could be over time?
Dom Addesso: What’s time?
Sarah DeWitt: 3 to 5 years.
Dom Addesso: Certainly, it could easily double.
Sarah DeWitt: Okay, great. And what’s driving, is that mostly from new hires or can you just elaborate a bit more on that?
Dom Addesso: Well, I think certainly new hires. You need to have the staff in place in order to garner the business, but it’s really more about distribution relationships and opportunities in the marketplace to fill in void created by disruption, the disruption in the market that I mentioned earlier.
Sarah DeWitt: And then, on reinsurance prices, do you think prices are bottoming, and what’s your outlook there going forward?
Dom Addesso: Well, I do think, it does appear in certain sectors that we’re kind of hitting a bottom. I am not though here predicting that next quarter or the quarter after that we’ll see some uptick. Perhaps we’ll be at this bottom point for a while. But I do think that at these levels, there really isn’t any room to go lower, if you want to maintain any semblance of adequate returns in your capital. And I think that’s -- those are the pressures that we all face. And we are seeing some discipline in the marketplace for now. But, I am certainly not predicting any major uptick at this point. So, there is still opportunity. You’re seeing some areas that are showing rate increase in the loss affected regions. So, those will be the opportunities to think about going forward.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Kai Pan: The first question is just a follow-up on Heartland deal. I just wonder from your experience for the last three years buying a business, eventually it’s like sorted, [ph] does that change your appetite how do you think about acquisitions? 
Dom Addesso: Kai, as you know, we have not been that acquisitive. So, I am not -- it doesn’t necessarily change my appetite. You always have to be very mindful of any kind of acquisition, what it’s going to do to the business, is it strategic, what are the integration concerns et cetera. In this particular case, the acquisition is done because of round of skill sets that it did have, the marketplace was changing, but then a change began on us and we were really unable to really get the scale and diversification we needed. But no, it doesn’t necessarily change your appetite for looking at transactions that are -- that can be strategically important to us. But having said that, we are not a very acquisitive company.
Kai Pan: That’s fair. I was just curious because this is a real deal you have done in past few years. It didn’t turn out as well as you had hoped for. Then if the business, $200 million is transferred from the insurance to reinsurance, you mentioned better combined ratio. The insurance segment I think in the past you had targeted 95; if you look at reinsurance running at the low 80s. Is that magnitude of difference in terms of profitability?
Dom Addesso: I mean crop business doesn’t run to the low 80s on an expected basis; it’s probably more high 80s, low 90s kind of business.
Kai Pan: And then, on the foreign exchange losses, I just want to make sure this is like mark-to-market especially if exchange rates stay the same, you will not see big movement in the third quarter?
Craig Howie: That’s correct; it’s quarter-to-quarter.
Kai Pan: And lastly, just a very philosophically, if you look at insurance segment, you are growing pretty fast. Is there any risk you worry about growing that business that fast; what could be the downside there? Because if you look the history of insurance operation, the profitability of it has been like near breakeven. And what gives you confidence by growing it at like high teens and at the same time, you can have -- actually you can improve on the combined ratio really having right now?
Dom Addesso: The insurance model today is much different than it was back 10 years ago, which was mostly a program-oriented model. So that’s number one. Number two, I think we have offered or added awful lot of great talent to the organization that’s focused on the underwriting of business. So, it’s risk by risk, which we think gives us potential for a better outcome, as well as kind reengineering, if you will, of our program business. So, those two things we think will help dramatically. In addition, keep in mind that we are not growing at these kinds of percentages in one line of business in one territory, it’s a very diversified play across a wide distribution network. And so that I think we’ll also ensure that we have good outcome.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is from the line of Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Josh Shanker: The first question, during the prepared statements, Jon Zaffino said that the Heartland -- the ex Heartland combined ratio for insurance was 109. Is it reasonable for me to think that historically Heartland has been a maybe 150 basis points, 200 basis points drag on your results?
Dom Addesso: 150 basis points of what, combined ratio?
Josh Shanker: The combined ratio, yes.
Dom Addesso: I hope that’s the right math or not, Josh, but...
Josh Shanker: That’s why I’m asking.
Dom Addesso: You bet. I mean generally that business over time has been running at just the Heartland operation itself?
Jon Zaffino: I don’t think over time, it’s been over Z100; we have shown losses. I don’t think it would be quite that high. The current quarter, it’s running at about 120, 119 for the current quarter.
Josh Shanker: And the premium on that is?
Jon Zaffino: For the current quarter, the earned premium is about 31 million.
Josh Shanker: And this is going to sound incredibly nitpicky, I apologize. But, I’ve gotten a few questions about it. It’s a question about when did you know what -- you guys were sort of -- due to material non-public information, you guys were locked out of repurchasing shares. But, you could have put out a press release and sort of brought yourself back to the market. When did you know what sort of the cats were -- why didn’t you put out a press release? And when did you know you had a favorable development which offset your need to put out a press release?
Dom Addesso: Yes, Josh that is incredibly nitpicky.
Josh Shanker: I’m sorry.
Dom Addesso: The challenge with Canada was that the number was moving around quite a bit. And we did have a number early on. And in fact as we got more and more information, that number frankly got a little better, but it kept changing. We did not have -- because of the question I was asked earlier, we didn’t think it was appropriate, we weren’t getting a right answer by using kind of an industry loss estimate, market share given how we participated in that particular event and with those particular clients. It wasn’t a simple matter of taking an industry loss estimate and a market share number. We had reports from clients as well as on the ground investigation. We didn’t know that frankly until relatively late in the game, probably two weeks ago, that we were comfortable with the number. In the meantime, as we have said in the past, we generally look at -- in an event or series of events going to be within our expected cat load. And thought that this was probably going to come in at the expected cat load and therefore a release on the event was not required. That’s kind of what we said in the past. Had we thought that this was going to be materially above our expected cat load, then we probably would have had reconsidered weather to put something out.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that’s all the time we have for questions. I’d like to turn the call over for closing remarks.
Dom Addesso: Thanks everybody for participating in the call. As I mentioned, we’re quite satisfied with our results given the frequency of events, some of which didn’t even reach the level of cat for us. So that’s a testament to our numbers. Our insurance initiative as we’ve mentioned is going well. And with crop moving to the reinsurance segment, improved underlying performance of this book should become more apparent on a go forward. On the reinsurance side, we continue to manage through the cycle. And as noted in some areas, our PMLs are down, pricing does appear to be bottoming, and we’re well-positioned to shift when warranted. So, again, thank you all and talk to many of you in the weeks ahead. Thanks again.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you again for your participation. And you may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day everyone, welcome to the First Quarter 2016 Earnings Call of Everest Re Group Limited. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the conference over to Ms. Beth Farrell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Beth Farrell: Thank you, Roxanne. Good morning and welcome to Everest Re Group's first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. On the call with me today are Dom Addesso, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer; Craig Howie, Chief Financial Officer; John Doucette, President and CEO of Reinsurance Operations; and Jon Zaffino, President of North America Insurance Operations. Before we begin, I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I note that statements made during today's call which are forward-looking in nature, such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations and the like, are subject to various risks. As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations. Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements. Now, let me turn the call over to Dom.
Dom Addesso: Thanks, Beth, good morning. For the opening quarter of 2016, Everest had another solid underwriting performance with a combined ratio of 86%. This is slightly higher than where the full year 2015 ended which was due to an uptick in the expense ratio. The loss ratio in the first quarter is in fact slightly better than where the year 2015 ended. In comparison to the first quarter of last year, the loss ratio was higher due to some level of cat activity in the first quarter of 2016. The growth in our expense ratio in the first quarter was fully anticipated due to the expansion efforts in our insurance operation. The more modest change was in our reinsurance operation and the slight increase there is reflective of the reduction in premium as competitive pressures continue. Our Group gross written premium for the first quarter was $1.4 billion, down 5% from the first quarter in 2015, which reductions in reinsurance had growth in insurance. The rate environment and foreign currency is driving the reinsurance premium reduction. Offsetting this is continued growth in our insurance operation as we build out our capabilities. You will hear more on this in the operations report. Despite premium pressures in the reinsurance sector, these segments overall had a combined ratio of 81.3%. The year-over-year difference as mentioned is namely due to caps and a small uptick in the expense ratio driven by premium volume. This is an outstanding result in this market and will likely compare very favorably to industry results. The insurance operations first quarter attritional combined ratio of 98.7 came in higher than last year solely due to the expense ratio. As I mentioned, this was fully anticipated but as our platform extends and premium earn grows, we expect that the abnormally for us high expense ratio will moderate throughout the year. Nevertheless our current expense ratio remains better than the industry average. More important is that the attritional loss ratio continues to improve. Calendar year loss ratio was up due to some late reported crop hail claims. Overall however, our insurance operation continues on a very positive trend as each of our business initiatives continues to show accelerating growth into the second quarter. Beyond the underwriting results, there was some headwinds. First investment income is down $20 million compared to last year's first quarter. Lower limited partnership income was the major cause. Based on what we see to-date in the second quarter, we expect that to be more positive in the second quarter. Nevertheless, low yields generally continue to have a slightly depressing impact on income and while this will moderate overtime, there is limited upside that we see over the next several quarters. The other items working against this quarter earnings was foreign exchange. However this was largely offset in shareholders equity through unrealized gains due to the positive impact of holding foreign assets. Overall for the quarter the company had a very positive result generating a 12% annualized operating ROE and book value per share that rose 4% in the quarter. With the right mix of underwriting discipline and our continued investment in the insurance franchise, we will be able to continue to outperform the industry even with the second quarter events on the horizon. As you know, there have been earthquakes in Ecuador and Japan as well as hail and flood events in Texas. But for all of this events combined, we currently expect them to be well below our expected cat load for the second quarter. Finally I want to touch on our recently announced reorganization which changes this morning's presentation from prior quarters. Consolidating some our department into distinct operating units, with a superb leadership of John Doucette in Reinsurance and Jonathan Zaffino in North America Insurance, we’ll improve the brand for each. As well as allow us to focus on intensely on each of these separate markets. We’ll now ask Craig to review with you the financial detail followed by John Doucette for Reinsurance Operations and Jon Zaffino for Insurance. Craig?
Craig Howie: Thank you, Dom, and good morning everyone. Before I provide an overview of our quarterly results, I would like to point out a change in our segment reporting and our consolidation presentation. Effective this quarter we no longer consolidate the segregated accounts of Mt. Logan Re into the Everest Re financial statements. This follows amended consolidation accounting guidance and is consistent with how Mt. Logan Re operates with third party investors. This is a retrospective application of an emended accounting guidance and all periods have been adjusted to present on a comparative basis. This change had no impact to prior reported net income, operating income, earnings per share or retained earnings of Everest. The Mt. Logan Re earnings and fees will now be shown in the other income line of the Everest's financial. Now, for the quarterly results. Everest had another solid quarter of earnings with after-tax operating income of $223 million or $5.19 per diluted common share for the first quarter of 2016. This compares the operating income of $330 million or $7.34 per share for the first quarter of 2015. The 2016 result represents an annualized operating return on equity of 12%. Net income for the first quarter was $172 million or $4 per diluted share compared to $323 million or $7.19 per share in 2015. Net income included $51 million of net after-tax realized capital losses compared to $7 million of capital losses in the first quarter last year. The 2016 capital losses were primarily attributable to the fair value adjustments on the equity portfolio and impairments on the fixed income portfolio. The impairments mainly related to credit right downs on energy investments. The majority of the equity portfolio adjustments have improved since the end of the quarter. The overall underwriting gain for the group was $171 million for the quarter compared to an underwriting gain of $215 million in the same period last year. In the first quarter of 2016, Everest saw $10 million of current year catastrophic losses related to the earthquake in Taiwan. There were no catastrophic losses during the first quarter of last year. The overall current year attritional combined ratio was 85.3%, up from 83.1% at the first quarter of 2015. But only a half point higher compared to the full year of 2015, primarily due to the increase in the expense ratio that Dom mentioned. Our expense ratio was up to 5.9% as we anticipated with the build out of our insurance platform and our Lloyd's syndicate. For investments, pretax investment income was $103 million for the quarter on our $17.1 billion investment portfolio. Investment income was below last year as expected. This result was primarily driven by the low interest rate environment and by the decline in limited partnership income. Limited partnership income was down $13 million from the first quarter of last year, primarily due to energy related investments. The pretax yield on the overall portfolio was 2.8% with a duration of just over 3 years. Foreign exchange is reported in other income. For the first quarter of 2016, foreign exchange losses were $4 million compared to an unusually high $47 million of foreign exchange gains in the first quarter of 2015. This $51 million pretax swing reflects the relative weakening of the U.S. dollar during the first quarter of 2016. Other income also includes $3 million of earnings and fees from Mt. Logan Re compared to the $5 million of income in the first quarter of last year. The decline essentially represents the impact of the catastrophic losses during the first quarter of 2016. On income taxes, the 11.4% effective tax rate on operating income is on the lower end of our expected bench for the year. This rate is slightly lower than the 12% tax rate at this time last year. Stable cash flows continues with operating cash flows of $367 million for the quarter compared to the $351 million in the first quarter of 2015. Shareholders equity for the group was $7.8 billion at the end of the first quarter, up $232 million from year end 2015. This is after taking into account, capital return for the $86 million of share buybacks and the $49 million of dividends paid in the first quarter of 2016. Our strong capital position leaves us with capacity to maximize our business opportunities, as well as continue share repurchases. Thank you. And now John Doucette will provide a review of reinsurance operations.
John Doucette: Thank you, Craig. Good morning. For our total reinsurance segment, gross written premium for the first quarter was $977 million, down about $100 million or 9% compared to Q1 2015. Adjusted foreign exchange rates, it is down 8%. Net premiums were $858 million, down 7%. On a constant currency basis, it is down approximately 5%. Roughly 60% of the decrease in gross written premiums in the quarter compared to the last Q1 is due to timing issues. This relates to the timing of what accounts were received and a one-off adjustment in last year’s first quarter, it did not repeat this Q1. The remaining 40% of the decrease in reinsurance premium is due to four items; first, foreign exchange rates. With the strengthening of the U.S. dollar impacting some of our segments topline, particularly our international reinsurance segment. Second, rate decreases. Third, migration to higher attachment points with inherently lower premiums but better risk adjusted pricing. And fourth, non-renewal declinations or reduced shares on underpriced treaties. Our reinsurance book generated $174 million of underwriting profit in Q1 2016, down $30 million compared to Q1 2015. This decrease is driven by two main causes. A reduction in earned premium which was down 8% quarter-over-quarter, and a $10 million increase in catastrophic losses in this Q1 compared with the prior Q1. This relates to the Taiwan earthquake that occurred in 2016. The attritional loss ratio is 53% which is essentially flat compared to Q1 last year, as well as the full year 2015. The attritional combined ratio is 81.1%, down slightly from the 2015 full year 81.8% but up 1.3 points when compared to Q1 2015, largely due to business mix quarter-over-quarter. This is predominantly due to the U.S. reinsurance segment which is up one point compared to Q1 2015. Now, some color on the April 1 reinsurance renewals which reflects approximately 10% of our full year reinsurance gross written premium. April 1 is a key renewal date for Japanese and other agent business and for some Latin America and U.S. regional property business. The market remains challenging with reinsurance rates down. But not as significant as rates decline at 11. For core accounts, we successfully gained preferential signings on desirable layers and programs in many different areas. Despite increased pressure from multi-year deals in Japan, we generally secured the annual timings which we wanted. In loss affected areas such as Korea, India, and Guam, we were able to achieve improved pricing, terms and conditions. With our key global reinsurance clients in Asia, the USA and other places around the world, we mutually benefit from our broad strategic relationships. As part of our hedging strategy, we maintained outward seating relationships with some of these large global players providing them high quality seating premium. In turn, this improves our reinsurance signings as a select core trading partner, thereby solidifying our long term strategic relationships.  While several areas remain challenged, we are seeing robust submission flow, reflected increased demand including the following: Solvency II surplus relief treaties, facultative casualty particularly in loss affected auto departments, increased lines on existing treaties with several global clients and new layers for global clients. Some of them are reversing the trend of holding larger net retentions. We scaled down our non-renewed treaties which do not compensated adequately for putting our capital at risk. This results in significant turn in our renewals. This combined with a nimble reallocation of capital to the best price business has resulted in the outperformance of our reinsurance portfolio relative to the broader market. As of 41, Mt. Logan rule again with AUM now over $900 million, a growth of 33% in AUM from Q1 of last year. Logan remains one of the fastest growing capital markets convergence vehicle and continues to be a core part of Everest Re's long term capital management and business strategy. 100% of Logan's capacity was fully deployed at 41 renewals allowing for efficient and timely hedging of the Everest portfolio. This also benefits Logan's investors as their capital is deployed immediately rather than being uninvested earning no return, a common problem for investors in other convergence vehicles. From the suite of hedges including Mt. Logan, Kilimanjaro cat bonds, traditional reinsurance, retrocessional program and IOWs, we manage our catastrophic risk well within our long standing group risk appetite. As of April 1, we reorganized the worldwide reinsurance operation under one division, streamlining little podium lines while maintaining local market presence and controlled underwriting autonomy. We have added to our reinsurance bench strength hiring a deputy CUO along with recent additional hires throughout the operation to compliment our best-in-class global reinsurance team. This reorganization and increased bench strength will provide for expanded product offerings and capabilities allowing us to grow and diversify our reinsurance book profitably. We’re pleased with the overall outcome of both our 11 and 41 renewals despite the current market conditions and believe that we are off to another strong start this year for our reinsurance book. Thank you. Now I will turn it over to Jon Zaffino to review our insurance operations.
Jon Zaffino: Thanks John and good morning. Everest Insurance performed well in the first quarter. The transformation into a vibrant and diversified specialty insured is gaining momentum. As a result, we remain encouraged about our ability to pursue profitable growth. Our global insurance operations inclusive of the North America division and Lloyd's, gross written premium increased 11% quarter-over-quarter to 376 million. Net written premiums grew to 324 million representing an increase of 7%. The net written premium growth lagged GWP growth primarily due to a marginally more conservative reinsurance strategy in our U.S. operations to support various new business launches. The insurance segment gap combined ratio for the quarter was 101% impacted by prior year development of about 7 million mostly related to the late reported crop hail losses in Heartland. On an attritional basis, the calendar year combined for the quarter was 98.7%, slightly above last year due to a higher expense ratio. Excluding Heartland, the attritional calendar year result improves further to 96%. The attritional loss ratio remained essentially flat and in fact showed 40 basis points of improvements quarter-over-quarter coming in at 69.1% versus 69.5% for 1Q '15. As previously noted, the operating expense ratio increased 2.8 points quarter-over-quarter reflecting both seasonality and net earn premium particularly within Hartland and our continued investment in our global insurance capabilities both in the U.S. and at Lloyds. To highlight this, our expense ratio is reduced by 80 basis points or 29% if we adjust with the organic Lloyds expansion. As Don mentioned earlier, this was fully anticipated and is also something we expect to normalize as the year progresses. Let me offer some commentary on the performance of our major insurance segments, provide an update on market conditions and also on the build out of the Everest insurance platform. Our U.S. and Canadian operations demonstrated growth and profitability in the quarter, although growth was not linear across all product areas. We continue to build capabilities across both of these platforms, enhance our underwriting sophistication and selectively launch new product lines. These efforts are supported by additional talent which should translate into meaningful growth and profitability overtime. To be clear the rate environment is not favorable everywhere, nor is it the same as prior years, that stated opportunities continue to exist and we will pick our spots accordingly. Notably in the quarter, we began benefitting from our increased product diversification. For example in the U.S., the California work comp market came under further pressure as favorable fundamentals attracted increased competition. Despite these favorable underlying dynamics, we underwrote selectively a mid single digit rate reduction environment. That stage is we did find several opportunities within our specialty casualty portfolio both in the U.S. and Canada and also within Everest specialty underwriters our DNO, ENO and related lines platform. Additionally, we continue to find opportunities for diversify growth across our property portfolio again despite rating pressure. Further, our A&H segment continued its strong performance with meaningful year-over-year within and medical stop loss and sports disability markets. It’s important to note that the strong premium growth experienced over the last several quarter’s largely as a result of our strategic growth and diversification efforts has not yet been reflected through earnings. Therefore we would expect the continued build in earning in the insurance platform throughout the year. Let me now turn to market condition. The market is exhibiting similar trends to those experienced in the fourth quarter of 2015. Headwinds continue to exist and negative rating pressure remains. That stated we are operating within a defined trading range across many lines of business with further rate pressure somewhat abating or in certain cases stabilizing across lines. In the U.S. market property lines particularly in cat zones remain competitive. Rate reductions are on average, high single to low double digit. These reductions often widen peak cat zones where competition is more intense. Third party casualty lines are mixed with some softness or flattening for the general liability lines, offset by positive rate in the commercial auto segment. Professional lines continue to experience a mid single digit decreases overall, less on primary layers, work comp is mixed depending on state and class of business and within the A&H market the market staff loss segment remains competitive other than for account of challenging loss experience. So, again a mix market landscape depending on the many factors influencing various lines of business. As a result, and due to our increased product depth, we are able to adjust our underwriting empathy towards the lines with more favorable underlying dynamics. Finally, a quick update on the status of our operational build-out within the insurance operations. We are capitalizing on the dislocation within the specialty commercial market to grow and diversify our platform notably by adding leading talent in several geographies across the company. Our robust and diversified footprint in the North American market, empowers this talent to drive improved operational performance. In fact, everyone of our new and selected business launches in 2015 contributed to grow in the first quarter of 2016. We expect this investment to further materialize as the year progresses and as we continue to execute on this plan into the balance of 2016 and beyond. With that, let me turn it back over to Beth for Q&A.
Beth Farrell: Thank you. Joanne, we are ready for question.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we’ll take our first question from Kai Pan. Please go ahead.
Kai Pan: Good morning. Thank you. First, a quick question on the second-quarter cats - you said well below your second-quarter budget. What is that budget?
Dom Addesso: As we mentioned previously, our annual cat load is approximately 10 points of command ratio points - 10%.
Kai Pan: Okay. But if that has seasonality, the second and third quarter, I would imagine, would be higher?
Dom Addesso: Everyone deals with that differently. We actually treat that for capital rating or effective tax rate, we maintain a flat budget. But people do it differently, so – 
Kai Pan: Okay, that's great. Then back to your expense ratio, you guys have been sort of the competitive advantage, one of the competitive advantages, low - the expense ratio. I just wonder, given the buildout and also given the premium decline in the reinsurance segments, what's the near-term implication on the expense ratio? Do you expect to - because you are still building out teams, then could trend a little bit higher in the near term? And what is long-term, what -- are you back to where you were the last few years? Or it will be settled down to a rate which is higher - lower than current now, but could it be still higher than what you have been?
Dom Addesso: Let me take the two pieces of that. On the reinsurance side, the rise in the expense ratio is predominantly driven by the topline. And we are going to maintain our discipline on topline and that will return to more normal levels once the market returns to a more normal level. The other segments are pockets of business that we can find to offset the premium decline. We obviously have the bandwidth or the room to tolerate that expense movement because we already started from the very, very low base. On the insurance side, that's elevated primarily because of the investment we made there, and the premium earned is not caught up yet to the investments we've made. That would moderate throughout the year and I think over the longer term, we would expect our expense ratio to be consistent with where we historically have been.
Kai Pan: My last question is really stepping back, look to your ROE profile over the last few years. In recognized catastrophe years, you've been able to achieve, like, mid-teen to high-teen ROE. This quarter the cat is relatively low, but the ROE is much lower. I just wonder, besides the expense ratio, what are the key drivers? What do you think is a one-off, and what are those that will be persist?
Dom Addesso: I understand, Kai. I think first of all the annualized ROE is frankly little bit understated and realizing that it’s one quarter. We’ve had some one time impacts in the first quarter and of course, that gets multiplied out for the four years on an annualized basis, the most notable of which is investment income. But you also have foreign exchange which is I mentioned in my script though. You’ve got an offset to that flowing it through the other comprehensive income because we’ve got the investment in foreign assets which offsets what’s coming through the P&L. So we have to recognize that. You also had the reserve charges in the first quarter as well. So I think if you kind of adjust for those things - however you see fit when you see that our ROE on an annualized basis, on a pro forma annualized basis is higher.
Kai Pan: Okay, great. Well, thank you so much for the answer.
Dom Addesso: I should also add to that, excuse me Kai - I’ll just add to that. Some of the things I mentioned is reflected in the book value per share growth, the 4%. That doesn’t quite align with the 12% ROE but it is due to the some of the factors that I mentioned.
Kai Pan: Okay. That’s great. Thanks.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Michael Nannizzi. Please go ahead.
Michael Nannizzi: Thanks. I think you addressed most of our questions in your prepared comments. But on investment income, just - that ticked down in the fixed income component, like the core fixed income component of the portfolio. So I was just wondering if that was impacted by the carveout of some of the Mt. Logan assets, potentially? Or should we be looking at that sort of downdraft year-over-year? Is that something that we should anticipate will continue at this level for the foreseeable future?
Dom Addesso: Mt. Logan does not impact that number at all. And I think essentially what you are seeing is just long term decrease in the interest rates and the impact on our fixed income portfolio. Also driven by the fact that some of our limited growth in the invested assets were limited by the amount of share repurchase we’ve made and the dividends we’ve made. So that will also not as much of an increase in invested assets. So the combination of those things is pointing to a drift down as I mentioned in my remark. We do anticipate though that’s going to be flattening out here not just in future.
Michael Nannizzi: Okay, great. Thanks for that, Dom. And then just in terms of the insurance business, when we think about the expense side, should we be looking at notional dollars in the other underwriting expenses category? Like, should we be looking at that as, like, a notional dollar amount; and then the ratio for the more likely variable costs on the commission side as you're building out? And in that, if we do, should we be thinking that that other underwriting expense dollar amount should rise from here? Or how to think about the pieces? Because obviously, on the insurance there's been a lot of movement of premium dollars, and changes, and now some investments. Just trying to get a better handle on how to think about that segment. Thanks. A - Dom Addesso Well, I think a straight ratio approach would be difficult. As I mentioned, we expect the expense ratio to moderate throughout the year and even more so in the longer term. And that’s exactly to your point it’s better to look at the increase in expenses in a notional dollar now, because that will give you a sense of the build and an additional expense year over year. And of course if you project, depending on your projection of premium earn, that will produce the result in expense ratio. And again, to our point earlier, we would expect that expense ratio to moderate through time. As well as the increase in notional amounts year over year, essentially, we’ve had a pretty rapid build here over the last 6 months. Into the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year, we’ve made a significant number of new hires. So that’s what impacting the notional amount as well.
Michael Nannizzi: Got it. Okay, great. And then just one last one, if I could. Just on the 2Q events so far -- I realize, Dom, you mentioned that you don't expect that to have a material impact on Everest. Have you guys given some thought in terms of how large you think these events might be just for the industry? I mean, when we look at whether it's the San Antonio hailstorms, or at the Houston floods, or maybe the Japan quake -- just some idea in terms of how you're thinking about with the total industry loss exposure might look like?
Dom Addesso: We don’t have, at this point, any better information than what you’ve been reading in the trade presses about the ranges. And if we did, we frankly, we’d have a more precise estimate that we could give you relative to each of those events. Given the ranges that have been spoken about, we obviously feel very comfortable that it’s well below our annual expected cat load or quarterly expected cat load if you will. And now, whether or not we say it’s not material, it’s your judgment. But it’s still well below our annual expected cat load. But I don’t have a better sense of what those numbers are. It’s early days. We are getting reports, and we have losses that will come to us from obviously our insurance book which are coming in slow. Although we do reach out to potentially affected accounts. Same thing happens on our facultative side and then the biggest piece- I’m talking about Texas now in particular. The other piece would be treaty property. In Ecuador, we would only be affected by our reinsurance book.
Michael Nannizzi: Got it. Thanks for that Dom.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Amit Kumar. Please go ahead.
Amit Kumar: Thanks, and good morning and congrats on the quarter. Just a few follow-ups, I guess, on the previous questions. Maybe starting on the insurance side, Dom, you talked about the rapid build, the new hires. I think what a lot of us are trying to figure out -- is there some way to sort of talk about how big the books were of these people whom you've hired? Are we talking about a materially large number of premium coming in down the road? I guess that is what we are sort of struggling with: how to ballpark that number.
Dom Addesso: There is no way that I can give you our specific plans but I want to. We certainly would expect some meaningful percentage growth year over year. We’ve hired resources in the inland marine space and workers comp area. In the professional lines and the PNO and ENO areas. Political risk trade credit; surety. What have I left out? But excess casualty. So all of those sectors we have added talent to- they come to us with many years of experience from, in many cases large global entities. And so we would expect year over year some meaningful percentage increases. However, just like we do on the reinsurance side, it is a difficult time to be growing because of the rate environment. So my comments have to be tempered by some degree of prudence that we are going to take on the premium that we put on the books. And that’s the challenging part in terms of giving you some sense of what the actual dollar projects are.
Amit Kumar: And are these new hires sort of sitting back and waiting for the markets to turn with a specific ROE target in mind? Or is there a combination of premiums plus ROE target for them as they are -- as they have been joining you over the past several months?
Dom Addesso: As people in this room can attest to, no one around here, sits around, waiting for anything. So, no, we are not doing that. There are opportunities in each of these segments to put business on the book. I’m not saying that there aren’t opportunities. What I am saying though is that perhaps what the market will give will dictate how quickly we add to those ranks. And how patient you are with marketplace. So it’s really more about what the additional expense numbers are in terms of what the marketplace will give us. But we do think that there is opportunities for the staff that we have here today and they are busy not only building relationships with our distribution partners, also building our infrastructure needs, underwriting guidelines, all that things that takes to run an effective insurance operation.
Amit Kumar: Got it. And then switching to the reinsurance side: would it be fair to say -- in your opening remarks, when you talked about it, were there more pluses than minuses on net met. It was a positive on the 41 renewals or did I read into those comments?
Dom Addesso: I’ll ask John to - 
John Doucette: Good morning Amit. This is John. I think overall, again, it’s not market but we are pleased with our ability to execute in that market. I think rates were down about 5% or so in Japan which is the major part of the 41 renewal. We saw some combining of wind and quake programs into combined layers. We really did see a lot that we’ve talked about this in the prior quarters. We really did see a lot of our ability to get signings that we want. Signings by layer, increases on deals in layers that we liked. Moving up when we wanted to move up. The clients let us do that. And also leveraging some of the strategic relationships that we’ve been building over the last several years. So again, health market, but we’ve felt pretty good about how 41 went for us.
Amit Kumar: And last question: is there any way to sort of draw that arc from 4/1 to 6/1 renewals? And how do you feel about that? Thanks.
Dom Addesso: We don’t know what’s going to happen at 61. There is a lot of moving parts on, there is obviously a lot of supply of capital that’s out there. There is potential demand shifts, variations on what citizens in Florida cat plan would do. There is the talk of less buying that’s happening for citizens for example. But that may in fact mean more limit being purchased by some of our longstanding clients. So in some ways it might be more of a reallocation. So we are not sure what’s going to happen at 61. But we are confident we will be able to successfully execute our plan about both writing a gross footprint that we are comfortable with and then combining that with our ability to match the risk to the capital, the appropriate capital as we talked about earlier. So our ability to build a portfolio that we are pleased with and feel has strong potential in it.
Amit Kumar: Got it. I'll stop there. Thanks for the detailed answers and good luck for the future.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Vinay Misquith with CRT Capital Group. Please go ahead.
Vinay Misquith: Hi, good morning. So the first question -- I just wanted to follow up on the expenses, the other underwriting expenses for US insurance. So that was about $42 million this quarter. Curious whether the hiring is largely done, and whether we should be using this as the base for the future? Or should we see an uptick in those expenses near term?
Dom Addesso: I think you’ll see a continued addition as we continue to build up the insurance platform as I mentioned before. But that will be consistent with what our expectations for growth are. So we are not done given what our premium plans are for the longer term. No, of course, we are not done adding resources.
Vinay Misquith: Okay, the second question is on the reinsurance premiums. So this quarter, I believe 60% of the decline was because of one-time items. So the core decline in reinsurance premiums -- is it on 3%-ish? Should we think of this as a normalized number for the near-term future? Or based on your renewals, do you think it's going to be less or more?
A – Dom Addesso: It’s somewhat of the derivative of the question that John just answered right I mean it’s some of that is dependent upon what the 61 and 71 will be which we really have no idea yet but certainly were not anticipating any strong premium growth in the reinsurance sector through the balance of the year that’s that helps at all just given what generally the rate environment has been over the most recent quarters.  Having said that there is always new opportunities that we might see that could change the answer to that, so its an extremely difficult to answer to give you Vinay and when we really don’t know what all the opportunities that will be presented to us but on a like for like basis we just looking at a renewable book and then may be some normal what I call normal may be new submissions that we would see then I would expect certainly a more a very flattish premium expectation. Premium amount. 
Q – Vinay Misquith: Sure, thank you. And then just one last thing: this quarter we saw not much in terms of share repurchases. Can you talk about capital management for the future, please? Thanks. 
A – Dom Addesso: I would like to answer that with just a brief know and but because obviously it does get asked every quarter and that’s fine and I just taken that and we think we do have obviously at some level of repurchases this quarter and it’s what we do each and every quarter and we look at what the opportunities are ahead of us and what the price of the stock is in the marketplace and we make decisions accordingly, we don’t give any guidance on what our level of share repurchases are going to be other than to say that we will continue to repurchase shares at the appropriate prices in the market and we will look forward, when making that evaluation we do look forward a couple of quarters in terms of what we would anticipate vis-à-vis our book value.
Q – Vinay Misquith: Okay, thank you.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Sarah DeWitt. Please go ahead.
Sarah DeWitt: Hi good morning. On the insurance premium volume, I think you said previously that you hoped you could grow 20% or more annually, given some of the new hires you were making. Do you still think that's achievable, given the first-quarter results?
Dom Addesso: Well I think the part of that is going to be tempered back a little bit by the rate environment that we are seeing. But keep in mind that as I mentioned earlier some of the recent hires we just made into the late fourth quarter of last year and into the first quarter of this year and that is going to take sometime for them to have their impact. But I think we can get at a higher level of growth than what we experienced in the first quarter, whether or not we can get up to that 20% number we will see. But I think it will be higher than percentage growth I believe will be higher than what we saw in the first quarter.
Sarah DeWitt: Okay, great. And then just on the net investment income, I know you have the loss of a limited partnership over also the line item what is the right run rate to be thinking about?
Dom Addesso: Well I think I would say generally our expectation it wasn’t for the energy related issue in our LP limited partnership income which was solely due to price of oil and now that that is kind of seemingly at least for now stabilize. We would have otherwise expected our investment income to be kind of flattish. So that is what I would expected the run rate.
Sarah DeWitt: Okay flat quarter-over-quarter or year-over-year?
Dom Addesso: Well because we already the first quarter down so quarter-over-quarter.
Sarah DeWitt: Okay, great. Thank you. 
Operator: And we will take our next question from Josh Shanker. Please go ahead.
Josh Shanker: Yes, so I guess I'm a little confused. Following up on Vinay's expense question, it seems like some of the guidance is that the expenses are elevated in this quarter and trickle down; and there's also new hires, and there might be a few more hires going forward. And I'm trying to understand the directionality. I guess there's a few moving pieces I need to zero in on, I guess.
Dom Addesso: Okay.
Josh Shanker: Can you sort of walk through how both of those things work? How it should trickle down, but also the hiring is sort of -- obviously, you're going to have to pay those people for the next two, three quarters as well.
Dom Addesso: I am not quite sure I understand the question but let me try.
Josh Shanker: All right, so just to say -- I don't understand. Why should we expect expense ratio to decline, I guess, is the question?
Dom Addesso: Because the pace of hiring that we have in the fourth quarter and the first quarter will not be as robust in the remaining quarters and we’ll start to begin to see the premium earned take hold.
Josh Shanker: Okay. So the premium earned one was -- and there were large one-time procurement fees in sort of getting those people on board?
Dom Addesso: No, no, you're basically looking at an expense number year-over-year that's elevated because we have a group of people on staff that are here this year that weren’t here last year and at the same time the premium earned this year compared to last year hasn’t yet earned in for the business that these folks are now beginning to write. So that’s why the expense ratio is going to moderate over time.
Josh Shanker: All right. Okay. That makes sense. And -- although, obviously, to Sarah's question, the growth -- we'll have to see where the growth comes in, I guess, overall. And then in terms of the sort of assets under management: when you think about Mt. Logan this year versus last year, did you have more interest than you are willing to put capital to work in the third-party vehicle?
John Doucette: Josh this is John. We have continued interest from a lot of people that have been looking at us for a long time and one of our goals is to continue to diversify the investor base and the types of investors that are in there. And so we have a lot of people, a lot of the ramp up from somebody who expresses initial interest to making an investment sometime that's measured in 12, 18, 24 months. So, we take money in that we think we can deploy and we would expect that we continue to grow that over time and it’s a balancing act between the two our opportunities set and the investor appetite.
Dom Addesso: If what you’re asking Josh is and forgive me if I am reading too much into your question, but certainly I think overall demand in this space seems to have quieted a bit because of where rates are or rates are headed. So I think that’s in part maybe perhaps what you're getting at. We still have an increased interest in Logan, but it doesn’t mean that it’s at the same pace that it might have been a year or two ago.
Josh Shanker: Okay. That's -- I'm trying to figure out what the -- I guess the supply/demand equation on that, which is a little loosey-goosey. But that definitely helps. And then finally, when we look at the -- you know, thinking about going forward over trailing 12 months, combined ratio in the insurance segment: how big do you think the insurance segment needs to be on a dollar basis for you to be confident that this is a business that runs at a consistent combined ratio below 100%?
Dom Addesso: I don’t think the answer to that is a function of size. I think we had $1.5 billion of premium I think we're of sufficient size. I think what's been challenging for us as, has been some of the legacy issues that we had to deal with. But I do think that at our size we can produce very profitably the kind of insurance bottom line we would all like to see. So I don’t think it’s a function of size. What will happen though if this is in part the answer to your question, I am just measuring but my answer to you is in part driven by just focusing on the loss ratio. But we will have during this ramp up period, obviously the pressure on profitability just driven by the expense ratio. But that’s not the function of nominal size, that’s a function of how we have chosen to invest in the business and how we’ve chosen to grow it. So there will be some short term pressure until we get the premium earned catching up to the expenses that we put on the books.
Josh Shanker: Do you believe the rigor and conservatism of the reserving habits in the insurance segment is equal to that of the reinsurance segment?
Dom Addesso: You bet, it’s the same management team. It’s the same approach. It's the same diligence that frankly has started when I came here several years ago. It doesn’t mean we've always gotten it right in sector by sector, but we're just as diligent in every one of our reserve buckets that we have.
Josh Shanker: Okay. Thank you very much for all the answers.
Dom Addesso: Thank you, Josh. 
Operator: And we will take our next question from Meyer Shields, please go ahead.
Meyer Shields: Thanks, good morning. One brief question, just to make sure I didn't misunderstand. I think, Dom, you said that the cat load overall was 10%. Wasn't it 12% not too long ago?
Dom Addesso: I am sorry. That’s the difference between with and without Logan. If you include Logan premium that was 12% on all of that, but if it's just on the premiums without Logan it's 10 points.
Q – Meyer Shields: Okay, then that makes perfect sense. On a year-over-year basis, I guess, besides the insurance segment -- and I think you've explained that well -- corporate expenses also rose by about $2.5 million. Is there anything unusual there?
Craig Howie: Meyer this is Craig, that was partially the startup of our Lloyds operation. The startup cost associated with that and then also some other share-based compensation that comes through there as well.
Meyer Shields: Okay, well, just -- I guess both of those. I thought it was like --.
Craig Howie: One off accrual type items.
Meyer Shields: Okay, got it. Okay. And then, last, you mentioned earlier that there's been some disruption in the marketplace as competitors retrench. Are the margins in that sort of freed-up business different from what you're seeing in the overall marketplace?
John Doucette: Yeah. This is John Doucette. I think it depends on sort of what pocket you're referring or we're seeing in the business. I would say as sweeping comment, no, I don’t think the margins are materially moving yet beyond some of the fundamental drivers of the business. So one of the work they're not dislocation change premium or premium rate for that matter. So we're seeing different pockets react differently to this cycle in the market. But the biggest dislocation impact obviously is in the form of human capital. That’s been significant and severe and we've taking full advantage of that, but not quite seeing that translate into a broad based different rating environment.
Meyer Shields: Okay, fantastic. And just one final, if I can. Is there any way we can, I guess as part of reporting, split off FX and the earnings from Mt. Logan?
Dom Addesso: Meaning split them out separately out of other income?
Meyer Shields: Yes
Dom Addesso: We will take that under advisory, thank you
Meyer Shields: Thank you.
Operator: And we will take our last question from Jay Gelb with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.
Jay Gelb: Thank you. I believe second quarter is a pretty large seasonal quarter for crop insurance. Can you give us some perspective on what you're seeing so far in terms of overall trends that would affect Everest in the crop insurance market -- things like yield and price activity?
Dom Addesso: I think at this point it’s a little early to doing that, I think the weather conditions that we've noted we’ve hit early so there doesn’t seem to be any impact on not expecting any adverse impact on yield. Of course price has been down this year on many of the commodities, So that’s affected the premium, but in many ways that’s not such a terrible thing given that it provides some floor if you will on the price protection. So we're expecting -- we're expecting normal crop season, nothing hopefully profitable. We're not anticipating any adverse at this point any adverse outcome. That’s the best I can give you on that.
Jay Gelb: That's helpful, Dom. And that usually means kind of like a low 90s combined on that business?
Dom Addesso: Correct
Jay Gelb: Okay. If you could just remind us, what are the commodity prices we should track to kind of keep on top of this stuff?
Dom Addesso: The main one is corn followed by soybean basically. That accounts for most of the revenue products within the crop space.
Jay Gelb: That’s helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Now I'd like to turn the call for our presenters for any additional or closing remarks.
Dom Addesso: Let me just close out with a few thoughts, and thank you everybody for participating and your interest and your questions this morning. In closing, I think, it’s worth emphasizing again that 12% ROE and a 4% growth in book value per share, we think it’s an outstanding result in this market. And we will likely see that as the best in the industry. And, again as I said in answer to one of the questions that the ROE for the quarter is slightly understated due to one-time items in the first quarter. And as planned, we will continue to make investments in the insurance segment. In the short term, this has resulted in an increased expense ratio but again, we believe that will be normalized over time. And as mentioned on previous calls, this is a result of our build out not by strategy which is producing an improvement in the loss ratio. In the reinsurance business, we continue to do what we said we would do all along. That is to be disciplined, manage through the cycle, not being bound by the top line. All this does have short term implications, it is still resulting in superior returns. So those were my thoughts for you for today and again thank you all for participating. Have a great day.
Operator: This does conclude today's conference. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at any time.

Operator: Good day, and welcome to the fourth quarter 2015 earnings call of Everest Re Group Limited. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Beth Farrell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Beth Farrell: Thank you, Holly. Good morning and welcome to Everest Re Group's fourth quarter and full year 2015 earnings conference call. On the call with me today are Dom Addesso, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer; John Doucette, our Chief Underwriting Officer; and Craig Howie, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I note that statements made during today's call which are forward-looking in nature, such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations and the like, are subject to various risks. As you know, actual results could differ materially from our current projections or expectations. Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements. Now, let me turn the call over to Dom.
Dom Addesso: Thanks, Beth, and good morning. I'm pleased to report record operating earnings per share for 2015 of $25.04 per share. This translates into an operating return on equity of 15%. The underwriting account produced record underwriting results of $912 million as a result of continued discipline and portfolio shifts undertaking in a very challenging market. Of course, the absolute number is stronger than expected, due to the low level of cats. However, it is noteworthy that in a declining rate environment, the combined ratio remained relatively stable at 83.4% versus 82.8% one year ago. The slight uptick is due to the growth in the insurance portfolio. In fact, the reinsurance combined ratio stood at 78.5% in the last two years. In 2015, reserve releases helped, but other contributing factors were portfolio shifts, expanding mortgage credit ratings, increased facultative business, and profits derived from our Mt. Logan operation. All in, we have been extremely pleased with how the organization has navigated through this market. On the insurance front, it very much remains an improving story, although the overall results at first glance continue to look challenged. The attritional combined ratio improved eight points and came in at 94.3%, demonstrating that our current strategies are producing the desired outcome. Nevertheless, the overall result came in at 106.3%. This was due to prior year development, once again coming from two of our run-off books of business. One is an excess casualty program book and the other is a construction liability account experiencing late reported construction defect claims. While this has been a difficult sector to reserve, it should be noted that our overall reserve position was more than adequate to absorb these developments resulting in an overall reserve release of $36 million for the year. Going forward, we remain confident that our overall reserve position is sufficient to handle developments in any of our many lines of business, but more importantly we feel the same as it relates to the Insurance segment specifically. The Insurance segment has made great progress during the past year, and key additions have been made to our executive management, underwriting, and distribution ranks. Overall premiums grew by 26%, led by our property, E&S, and crop lines as well as A&H, casualty, D&O, and our sports and entertainment business. We continue to build up these sectors as well as some new areas that will come online in 2016. Profitability in each of these sectors is strong despite some rate climbing. John will get into some of these details in his report, but overall we would expect continued momentum in the Insurance segment into 2016 and beyond. Overall, we were very pleased with our underwriting results and initiatives in both reinsurance and insurance. A bit of a continual challenge, however, remains on the investment front. As we all know, the low interest rate environment continues, and new money rates are less than the yields for maturities rolling off. In addition, certain sectors have been more recently challenged, and in particular, the energy sector along with emerging market debt and high yield generally. As we along with others have well-diversified portfolios, we are not immune to some of these impacts. As a result, investment income is down mostly driven by lower limited partnership income impacted by the aforementioned factors. In addition, there were some realized losses due to write-downs taken on certain oil and gas investments. The factors in the investment markets also had an impact on book value, where growth was constrained due to a decline in the unrealized account. Nevertheless, book value per share grew 7% to $178.21 from $166.75. In general, as I mentioned previously, this was another successful year. We are appropriately navigating through continual competitive pressures, and going forward, we expect to maintain our utilization of alternative capital to maximize returns. In addition, we expect continued growth in specialty risks in the North American insurance platform as well as in continental Europe through our new Lloyd's Syndicate. No doubt, the rate pressures we saw at 1/1 will further challenge us and the industry, but we remain confident in our ability to outperform. Thank you, and now to Craig for further details on the results.
Craig Howie: Thank you, Tom, and good morning everyone. Everest had a terrific end to 2015 with one of our strongest quarters in history, helped by reserve releases that impacted both current and prior years. For the fourth quarter of 2015, operating income was $353 million or $8.17 per diluted common share. This compares to operating income of $331 million or $7.28 per share in the fourth quarter of 2014. The 2015 quarterly result represents an annualized operating return on equity of 19%. For the year, operating income was $1.1 billion or $25.04 per share compared to $1.1 billion or $24.71 per share in 2014. Net income for the year was $978 million or $22.10 per share compared to $1.2 billion or $25.91 per share in 2014. Net income included $130 million of net after-tax realized capital losses compared to $55 million of capital gains last year, or a difference of about $4 per share year-over-year. The 2015 capital losses were primarily attributable to fair value adjustments on the equity portfolio and impairments on the fixed income portfolio. The impairment is mainly related to credit write-downs on energy investments. The results reflect a slight increase in the overall current year attritional combined ratio of 82.9%, up from 82% last year. This attritional measure increase of less than one point includes higher than expected current year losses in the Reinsurance segments, including $60 million of estimated losses for Tianjin and numerous weather-related losses that did not meet our $10 million catastrophe threshold. In the fourth quarter, Everest saw $20 million of current year catastrophe losses related to the U.S. storms that occurred during the last week of the year. The fourth quarter of 2015 also included favorable development on prior cat losses, largely from the 2013 year. Therefore, net catastrophe losses for the quarter were negative $4 million. Catastrophe losses for the year were $66 million in 2015 compared to $62 million in 2014. For 2015, gross catastrophe losses were $100 million, but were offset by $33 million of favorable development on prior year cat losses, primarily from the 2013 German hailstorms, European floods, typhoon Fitow, and U.S. storm events. Our reported combined ratio was 83.4% for the year 2015, compared to 82.8% in 2014. The 2015 commission ratio of 21.9% was slightly down from 22% in 2014. Our expense ratio remains low at 4.9% for the year compared to 4.6% in 2014. The expense ratio for the Reinsurance segments remained flat at 2.9%, while the overall expense ratio was influenced by the build out of our insurance platform. Everest has one of the lowest internal expense ratios in the industry. This is a strategic competitive advantage for Everest. On reserves, we completed our annual loss reserves studies. The results of the studies indicated that overall reserves remained adequate. In the fourth quarter, we booked prior year development in the Insurance segment and for asbestos, which was more than offset by favorable development in the Reinsurance segments. The $121 million of prior year reserve development in the Insurance segment during the quarter, as referenced by Dom, was largely related to Umbrella business and construction liability. These run-off programs were discontinued [technical difficulty] our position becomes more mature. We continue to hold our loss reserve estimates for the more recent years. For investments, pre-tax investment income was $111 million for the quarter and $474 million for the year on our $17.7 billion investment portfolio. Investment income was below last year as anticipated. This result was primarily driven by the low interest rate environment and by the decline in limited partnership income. On the fixed income portfolio, income was down $30 million year-over-year. Limited partnership income was down $26 million year-over-year, primarily due to energy-related investments. The pre-tax yield on the overall portfolio was 2.8% compared to 3.2% in 2014, and duration remained at three years. Other income and expense included $61 million of foreign exchange gains for the 2015 year, compared to $30 million of foreign exchange gains in 2014. The foreign exchange gains resulted from the relative strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the other world currencies. On income taxes, the 2015 operating income effective tax rate was 14.5%. This effective tax rate for the year was in line with our expectations for the year. Operating income does not include capital gains or losses. Strong cash flow continues with operating cash flows of $1.3 billion for the year, essentially flat, compared to 2014. This is primarily due to our continued premium growth. Shareholders' equity for the Group was $7.6 billion at the end of 2015, up $157 million compared to year end 2014. This is after taking into account capital returned through $400 million of share buybacks and $175 million of dividends paid in 2015. The company announced a 21% increase to its regular quarterly dividend and paid $1.15 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015. Our strong capital balance positions us well to continue share repurchases. Thank you, and now John Doucette will provide the operations review.
John Doucette: Thank you. Good morning. As Craig mentioned, we had a very strong Q4 finishing a successful 2015 year. Our Group gross written premium for Q4 was $1.5 billion, up 6% from Q4 in 2014, predominantly driven by growth in insurance. Our Group net written premium was $1.4 billion, which was up $70 million or 5% over Q4 2014. For the full year, our Group 2015 gross written premium was $5.9 billion, up almost $130 million or 2% from 2014. Our Group net written premium was $5.4 billion, also up 2%. Let me first review our Reinsurance segments, starting with 2015 full year results, then give some color on January 1 renewals and how we are navigating the market. For our Global Reinsurance segments including both total reinsurance and Logan, gross written premium for 2015 was $4.3 billion, down 4%, but adjusted for exchange rates, it is essentially flat year-over-year. Net premiums were $4.1 billion, down 3%. On constant currency basis it is closer to flat. Our reinsurance book including Mt. Logan generated $991 million of underwriting profit in 2015, up 6% compared to 2014. This is noteworthy given a similar amount of property catastrophe losses in 2014 and 2015 as well as some other large losses this year including the Tianjin Port loss. These record reinsurance underwriting results, despite the soft market, highlight the successful execution of the strategy and initiatives that we put in place over the last couple of years. These expanded our opportunities and reinsurance profits by developing new and enhancing existing strategic relationships with key reinsurance clients across multiple lines of business, deploying capital to credit opportunities and other new products worldwide, offering meaningful line capacity on attractive property catastrophe treaties utilizing both Mt. Logan and cat bonds, and growing both our regional and facultative books. These initiatives broadened and enhanced both our broker and client relationships, and continue to provide new opportunities to expand with longstanding clients, whether on new deals or larger shares of existing ones. Offsetting this, we are scaling down on non-renewing treaties which inadequately compensate us for putting our capital at risk. In the current market, this causes significant churn in our renewals. This combined with a dynamic allocation of capital to the best priced business resulted in the out-performance of our portfolio relative to the broader market. Now, some color on the January 1 reinsurance renewals. We wrote about $2.1 billion of premium across all reinsurance lines, which was down 3% compared to last 1/1. As we continue to face currency headwinds, on a constant dollar basis premium was roughly flat. Our catastrophe exposed property book saw a risk adjusted rates down low single digits for U.S. business, but down more in other areas such as Europe, Asia, Australia and some Latin American countries. We moved to higher attachments where risk adjusted rates were generally better. Globally, our expected combined ratio was up about 1% for our property cat XOL book compared to the 1/1 renewals last year. Overall, our 1/1 cat XOL premium was about flat, driven by increased signings in the U.S., but offset by reductions in some emerging markets and Europe due to FX and softer rates. Our purple book which has had strong results shrunk this 1/1 due to elevated competition, which drove rates down to inadequate levels. Consequently, we redeployed some capacity to better priced reinsurance fields. We did have some wins at 1/1 in our traditional casualty book with several large quota shares for strategic clients. But generally, this area remains challenging. In particular, we continue to deemphasize management and professional liability. On the positive front, casualty pro-rata seeding commissions began stabilizing. We also found attractive opportunities in the credit space, and we continue to enjoy meaningful opportunities with key P&C clients where we have the ability to offer multi-line capacity. We executed on new opportunities at 1/1 that added meaningfully to our top line, including several solvency II surplus relief quota shares, increased lines on existing treaties with several global clients, as well as new layers for the same customer group where they are looking to reinsure their growing global retentions. In aggregate, these new deals offset some of the premium lost on deals that we non-renewed. We continue to utilize Mt. Logan, cat bonds, and traditional hedges, which have allowed us to grow our gross portfolio over the last few years while generally keeping our net P&Ls on our 1/1 renewal book fairly stable relative to our capital base. During the fourth quarter we sponsored another $625 million of cap bonds protecting us from wind and quake losses in both the U.S. and Canada, where we have a dominant lead reinsurance market position, and enjoy preferential access to and signings on favorable deals. This brings the total multi-year protection provided by Kilimanjaro cat bonds to $1.6 billion. As of 1/1, Mt. Logan's assets under management was up to $860 million, a growth of 25% in AUM from 1/1 last year. Once again, 100% of Logan's capacity was fully deployed at 1/1 renewals. During 2015, Everest's common shareholders earned $27 million from the Logan platform including fees. The combination of cat bonds and Logan have added $2.5 billion of off balance sheet capacity for deployment in the property cat market, which has enhanced our competitive position in this very important class. As highlighted before, Everest possesses sustainable competitive advantages that continue to position us well for success in this reinsurance market. These include, number one, we have one of the lowest internal expense ratios in the industry, at 2.9% for our total reinsurance segment. Therefore on the same rates, we have higher dollar margins and higher ROEs than our competitors. Number two, all across zones and perils, we are more diversified than most competitors, which naturally lowers our internal capital charges and improves our risk adjusted returns. Number three, our scaled up retrocessional strategy, including growing Mt. Logan, upsizing Kilimanjaro cat bonds, and utilizing traditional hedges also lowers our internal capital charges further and increases our risk adjusted returns as well. And number four, our operational structure and culture, decentralized, but controlled. We empower experienced leading underwriting teams to provide responsive service and direct customer access to decision makers. Unconstrained by narrow geographic scope or overly centralized approval processes, we deploy highly rated capacity faster, more creatively, and in scale. We are pleased with the outcome of our 1/1 renewal despite market conditions. And we are off to another strong start this year for our reinsurance book. Now, turning to our insurance operations; we wrote about $360 million of insurance gross written premium in Q4, and wrote $1.5 billion for the year. This is up 17% for Q4 and up 26% for the 2015 year compared to prior periods. Our direct operations including our property, casualty, professional liability, and contingency businesses were up 23% year-over-year. Our specialty operations, Heartland, our crop insurer, EVCAN, our Canadian company, and accident and health, each saw a meaningful top line growth in 2015, achieving gross written premium increases in excess of 40% year-over-year. Our focused growth initiative in each of these sectors has provided an improving opportunity set. While calendar year results for insurance were marred by prior year development on run-off books of business, the 2015 accident year results have been improving and showing a strong bottom line result. This year, we had a notable 94.3% accident year combined ratio, translating into $73 million of underwriting profits meaningfully improved from the $102.3% combined ratio for 2014 accident year. While this improvement was driven in part by better results on our crop business, we are continuing to see improvement in the accident year results of our other businesses as well. Excluding Heartland, this business had 1.6% improvement to the accident year combined ratio, lowering it to 93.4%; a very strong result. We have successfully attracted talented underwriters in many segments, added a new distribution team, and hired operational staff to enhance our processes and technology to support the scale, diversification, and geographic scope of our growing insurance platform. We are also launching several new product lines in excess casualty, private company D&O, and in the marine with additional new products planned for 2016. Regarding the rating environment, in 2015 we've seen slightly positive pricing in most lines led by commercial auto at about 7%. However, we saw negative rate trends in financial institution and commercial management liability, which both remained very competitive due to excess capacity. Insurance property rates were down slightly, but margins remained adequate to deploy capital. We are bullish about our opportunities despite the challenging market and are excited by the development of our insurance platform, and the launch of our new Lloyd's Syndicate. We continue to leverage the strengths in both our reinsurance and insurance books to be the best-in-class manager of capital in the new insurance globe order. Thank you. And now back to Beth for Q&A.
Beth Farrell: Thanks, John. Holly, we are open for questions at this time.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from Vinay Misquith. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Vinay Misquith: Hi, good morning, and congratulations on a very strong quarter and a super year. The first question is on the primary insurance operations. Was there some favorable reserve development, prior quarter favorable development that happened in the fourth quarter of this year? 
Craig Howie: I'm sorry, Vinay, was there a favorable development in the Insurance segment?
Vinay Misquith: Yes, prior quarter, because –- right, because you get a 66.6% accidental loss ratio ex-cat. So was there some prior quarter reserving true up that was favorable?
Craig Howie: There was some favorable prior year development that came through as well in this segment, but it's very small in comparison to the reserve charges that we took for construction liability and Umbrella. That's what represents the majority of that.
Vinay Misquith: All right, I was talking about from prior quarters, but never mind.
Dom Addesso: Prior -- Vinay, this is Dom; prior quarters, that would just be movement in the expected loss ex with the current accident year. That wouldn't relate to any prior period development or any reserve studies set forth [ph].
Vinay Misquith: Right, okay, okay…
Dom Addesso: Mixed business, portfolio shifts, and assessment of what the current year loss trend is.
Vinay Misquith: Sure. Now, on the primary business you've certainly grown the top line very strongly. We've heard press reports of you making a lot of hires. Dom, what are you doing in that business to ensure that the new business you're getting is priced appropriately?
Dom Addesso: Well, there are several things. First of all, as mentioned in my comments, and John referenced as well, we are adding underwriting talent across the organization, but that also includes a separate office of - or Chief Underwriting Officer within that unit. And John, as the Group Chief Underwriting Officer, is in regular contact with him as we expand our writings, as we talk about the underwriting template, and the underwriting box, if you will, and our risk appetite. So that occurs at the individual insurance level, and then of course monitored at the Group level. That's the first thing. The other thing that we have is a very strong price monitoring process. So we're able to understand what's going on at the transactional level from a great adequacy point of view, that all of our business units report appropriately to us on a quarterly basis. So those are some of the factors, in addition to the regularly scheduled underwriting audits and risk management committee that we have, not only internally, but also reported up through the Board of Directors. So it is a comprehensive process.
Vinay Misquith: Okay, that's helpful. And on the reinsurance side, I think what was mentioned was that the new business on January 1 was written at a 1% higher combined ratio. Did I hear that correctly?
John Doucette: Vinay, this is John. Yes, that was a -- that was for our overall worldwide property catastrophe XOL book.
Vinay Misquith: Okay, that's great. So it would be lower than the rate declines that we're hearing in the markets. So, was that because of a mix change that you did this year?
John Doucette: Right. So it's a combination of things, but as we alluded to in our script, one of things we found at this 1/1 was that higher layers in general were priced, we thought had a better pricing to them. So on average there's exceptions to this, but on average, the attachment point of our property cat book went up. And that helped mitigate it. But I also think -- you know we've talked about this before, when it comes to signings across the program, given Everest relationship, 40-plus-year relationship with our clients and brokers, and given our balance sheet and high ratings, we get a lot more selection of the layers that we like than others. And that allows us to mitigate the overall market rate softening.
Dom Addesso: Another factor there, Vinay is that we are down generally in all non-U.S. territories, and in the U.S., being a better price of that that portfolio mix, while your question is why is the commodity ratio only -- expected to combine down 1/1 [ph] maybe what we reported in terms of generally rate decreases might suggest otherwise. So a little bit of mix shift on a geographic basis is part of the answer there as well.
Vinay Misquith: Okay, that's helpful. And the last question is on capital management. This year I think we saw about 50% of earnings being returned to shareholders. Just curious about 2016, and it seems that your primary business growth going pretty meaningfully. I would have thought that that would be diversifying versus reinsurance. So curious why you're consuming capital for that growth?
Dom Addesso: Vinay, I'm glad you were the first one to get that question out of the box. And clearly we expect it at every call. And look, we don't telegraph what we're likely to do in terms of share repurchases. Yes, we look at operating earnings. Yes, we look at the opportunities that are ahead of us in the marketplace, and look at the growth opportunities. And all, and look at our rating agency capital requirements, as well as our own internal economic capital. What I'll say is that we continue to remain bullish on repurchasing shares into 2016. We did do some in the fourth quarter. But then of course price kind of got away from us a little bit, and we probably did a little less than we might otherwise would have. But we still will be repurchasing stock into 2016, but I'm not going to be giving any forecast of what that might be.
Vinay Misquith: Thank you.
Dom Addesso: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today comes from Michael Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Michael Nannizzi: Thanks. John, I have one question on the insurance business, you mentioned 160 basis points of improvement excluding crop. I was just trying to figure out what was the basic in switch you were looking at that number? And maybe I got that wrong, but I thought that's what you said.
John Doucette: Good morning.
Michael Nannizzi: Hi, good morning.
John Doucette: It's basically the accident year combined ratio, attritional combined ratio looking this year for our insurance book excluding Heartland compared to last period. And the reason we gave that number was because there was a meaningful improvement in the Heartland results from last year to this. So we wanted to identify that it wasn't just the improvement in the Heartland results.
Dom Addesso: So Michael, the net written premium for the insurance group for the year is 1.325 billion, of that 250 million approximately was Heartland, if that's getting to your question.
Michael Nannizzi: Yes, that helps. I mean, is there anyway, John, to know sort of what the number is in terms of 160 basis points, like, could we know what that number was last year just to have some idea of -- just because there's obviously been a lot of change, there's new business. There's been a lot of mix shift in that book. So it would be just helpful to sort of square what that sort of baseline looks like, or maybe give the Heartland piece, and then we can figure out the other side.
Dom Addesso: Right. So this is Dom, Mike. And I gave you the 2015 -- the 2014 Heartland premium number…
Craig Howie: It was 130 million.
Dom Addesso: Right, does that help you figure that out?
Craig Howie: So excluding Heartland last year -- and Mike, this is Craig, excluding Heartland last year it was a 95% -- 95.0% combined. And this year it's 93.4% [ph] excluding crop. This year crop had a profit. Last year crop was running at a loss.
Michael Nannizzi: Okay. So 95 to -- you'd cut out for a second there, 95 to 90.4…
Craig Howie: Last year, the combined ratio excluding crop on the insurance book was 95.0. That number is now 93.4. That's the 1.6 points of improvement that John mentioned.
Michael Nannizzi: Perfect. Okay, great. That really helps. Thank you so much. And then John, the 800 million or so in Mt. Logan, just so we can right-size it, what was the comparable dollar amount for 2014? Was that -- I mean, obviously you'd raised a 600, but was that -- I'm guessing there was some retirement of bonds as well. So I just want to know what was the comparable number there last year?
John Doucette: So it's up about 25% -- this is Mt. Logan, not the bonds that I'm answering.
Michael Nannizzi: Correct. Yes.
John Doucette: Mt. Logan is up 25%, so bringing it to $880 million.
Michael Nannizzi: Excellent, that's what I needed. And then just last one, just on the commentary about 1/1 renewals and the higher attachment. So the rate online was better on the high-attachment versus low-attachment. Should we take that to understand that there's just less competition at those higher levels or is there some other aspect of the landscape just from an operational perspective that would contribute to that dynamic?
John Doucette: I think a lot –- that's really where there's more limit purchase. So from a demand point of view that's higher. Typically how the programs are laid out, the lower layers are smaller. And then increasingly, as you go up the tower, the dollar limits that are purchased are larger. So there is more demand at that point. And to the extent that our business is being impacted by alternative capital, those higher layers have lower rates online, which are more challenging for alternative capital, unrated capital to find an attractive return for that. So I think that's partially playing into that too.
Michael Nannizzi: Got it. That's great. Thank you so much.
Dom Addesso: Thanks, Michael.
John Doucette: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question now comes from Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Kai Pan: Good morning. Thank you. Just a follow-up on Mike's question, could you tell the other piece in your insurance, basic crop, basically we're trying to understand what's your, like, current year commodity ratio running at. And I just wanted to see if that's your mid to long-term average, or it just is like -- is better than expected?
Craig Howie: This is Craig, Kai. Current year crop is running at a 99. That is certainly better than our long-term average because this is a profitable year for us in crop. It is not where we expect to be over the long-term. This business needs scale and geographic diversity. And that's what we've attempted to do this year. We've grown the premium, and we've grown it diversifying it into other states as well. So that will help you -- that will help you…
Kai Pan: I'm sorry.
Craig Howie: [Indiscernible].
Kai Pan: I'm sorry. So there is still room for improvements. It's not like you have anomaly like a good year on the crop side.
Craig Howie: There is still room for improvement, yes, but we did show a profit this year for the first time.
Kai Pan: Okay, that's great. And then on the reserve charge, $120 million in the Insurance segment, the two run-off business, could you tell us how big is the remaining reserve on the book?
Craig Howie: The remaining reserves on the book for insurance overall or…
Kai Pan: No, for these two run-offs?
Craig Howie: For these two run-offs, this is what we are attempting to do with these is look at where we expect these reserves to be over time, and I don't have that number in front of me, Kai.
Kai Pan: Okay, that's fine. And then it looks remarkable that, Dom, you mentioned that you'd be able to keep the underlying combined ratio stable in your Reinsurance segment despite the pricing pressure. Part of that might be business mix. I just wonder on the -- like, accident year loss ratio peak side on the loss trend inflation, what trend do you see there in your major line of business?
Dom Addesso: Well, I mean the underlying combined ratio on the reinsurance side is comprised of several factors. We have obviously a property cat book. We have a property pro-rata book, a casualty pro-rata, casualty excess, facultative mortgage credit etcetera. And all of those things when combined together obviously produce the overall combined ratio. Our expected combined ratio on property cat XOL year-over-year in terms of what was slightly up, but of course with no cats then that has a very positive impact on the results. Our treat casualty results have been improving year-over-year. We've been expanding our facultative operations, which typically have had higher margins than the treaty book of business. And the mortgage credit of course has been something that we've mildly added to our portfolio, also contributing to that. So to point to any one factor is difficult, but it's just the composition of the portfolio, and as it evolves, we're able to maintain a decent level of profitability and return on capital as a result. And partly to your question if you're asking about trends, it obviously depends on the line of business, but clearly in all of our businesses and all the lines of business, business' trend is not -- it's not strong. There isn't a high loss inflation factor that we're seeing in any of our lines of business.
Kai Pan: So, do you book to the lower like cost trends or you're taking probably more longer term approach on your assumption?
Dom Addesso: Well, I mean loss gross trends generally are going to be more of a factor in casualty than anything else. And what our underwriters are looking at, and actually they're looking at -- it depends on the client's book of business, and those loss gross trends are the average trends that we've seen over the last couple of years. It's not anything -- I wouldn't describe it as being at the low-end of the range or at the high-end of the range, it's essentially based on the experience that we've seen in the market place over the last five or six years.
John Doucette: And Kai, it's John. Just to add to that, you know, we have a very experienced actuarial pricing team that have priced all property and casualty lines of business all over the world and have been doing that for 20 plus years. And we've added over the last several years more talent to that team and enhanced the analytics. So we feel pretty comfortable that we understand what the trends are, what the loss picks are for the reinsurance business that we're putting on the books.
Craig Howie: I think I'll add one other thing that maybe -- will hopefully answer the question and maybe provide you some comfort relative to that question. And that is if you look over the last 12 years at our accident year -- initial accident year pick combined ratio, every year in the last 12, that accident year combined ratio has developed positively. In other words, each accident year has had redundancy in it. So that basically tells you that our expected loss pick in the [indiscernible] account is a conservative pick.
Kai Pan: That's great. And lastly, Dom, can you talk a little bit more about some of the growth areas, including Lloyd's?
Dom Addesso: Well, Lloyd's, of course we just got off the ground at January 1. It was a process that we were able to move relatively quickly on into Lloyd's, and I think we got it done in near record time. But given our scale in the marketplace I think it was a win-win not only for us, but I think also for the Lloyd's as a market in general. So we're pleased with that. And in that space, and Lloyd's in particular as a growth area we're looking at primarily continental Europe. In addition to Lloyd's will be a platform that will help us in some of the Asian markets, particularly China and Australia, where it's advantageous to issue Lloyd's paper is contrasted with what we had been doing was issuing paper at Everest Re; just some cost advantages to that. It also provides a facility for U.S. business that might have multinational exposure. So those are the opportunities for Lloyd's. Generally in the insurance base, as we mentioned, property E&S is a big growth area for us, A&H, commercial D&O, private company D&O -- we've got an inland marine team. We're doing some -- we're looking at growth in the excess casualty in environmental areas. Our work comp book particularly in California has been growing. And we're looking at how we can possibly use that capability in other jurisdictions that are favorable as far as work comp is concerned. So there's just a number of areas, whether it be lines of business or segments that we're focusing on. The contingency business, our sports and entertainment as well, I mentioned, is growing nicely. So it's across a number of different areas.
Kai Pan: That's great. Well, thank you so much for all the answers, and good luck.
Dom Addesso: Thank you, Kai.
Craig Howie: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sarah DeWitt of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open. 
Sarah DeWitt: Hi, good morning, and congrats on a good quarter. The underlying combined ratio for the whole company, you've done a good job keeping this stable in 2015 versus '14, despite some rate pressure, as well as growing the insurance business. Could you just talk about your ability to maintain margins going forward or should we expect any deterioration?
Dom Addesso: Sarah, this is Dom. And I think clearly with the rates going down, I mean, it's fairly obvious that margins are no doubt going to be under pressure. The way we look at it, as opposed to looking at it from a combined ratio point of view, maybe just give you a high level view. Based on what we say 1/1 and perhaps what we could expect through the balance of the year, and also factoring in where we see insurance pricing as well, which is generally more flattish than it is in the reinsurance base. We would expect an overall impact of about one point in our [ROE 00:02:05]. And that's essentially how we think about -- maybe that's the best way to answer the question that you've asked.
Sarah DeWitt: Okay, that's helpful. And then on the insurance reserves strengthening, why do you think we could turn the corner on that runoff business? And can you give us any color in terms of what's the duration of these claims, how much has been paid out? Anything that gives you comfort that we might be reaching inflection point on this would be helpful.
Dom Addesso: Well, let me first say that what I think is more important, and what I pay most attention to is our overall reserve adequacy of the entire group. Which I think personally has been improving over time. Part of the evidence of that is what I referenced earlier in response to Kai, in terms of how our accident year combined ratio or loss picks have developed. Right now your question is very focused on the insurance side, and understandably so, you never know in any of these lines of business. We have a couple of hundred different IBNR groups clearly summer -- in each year we have redundancies in some, and deficiencies in others. So this is a natural occurrence in the complete reserving process. So I can't emphasize enough that the overall reserve position is what we really stay focused on. As I said in my comments -- opening comments was that we're reasonably confident that our overall insurance position, again as a group, is sufficient. But with reserves, it's one of those things that you never know as it relates to any individual class within the segment. But as I said, I think our overall insurance portfolio is well reserved.
Craig Howie: Just to add to that, during the reserve process this year, when we went through the insurance segments, we did consider the severity of scenarios, as well as volatility assumptions in those calculations that were done during the reserve studies. And Management did elect to book a higher number than the actuarial indicated estimate for both of these books of reserves, both the Umbrella book and construction liability book.
Sarah DeWitt: Okay. And was that the major factor that changed versus last year, when you did the study at this time?
Craig Howie: One of the major factors that changed this year was we did a claim review for the Umbrella book. We had done a claim review earlier in the year. And we used -- utilized those results that came out of that claim review to take into account that impact and that was considered during the actuarial studies for that book of business. On the construction liability side, this relates to run-off landscapers program that we stopped writing back in 2008. The company no longer writes this book of business, but these are not indemnity type claims anymore, were considered an additional insured. Claimants have 10 years to file claims against the general contractor. So again, they are not indemnity claims at this point. They are mostly legal fees. So, it is a little bit more difficult to wrap your arms around this other than looking at not only frequency but also severity of those cases.
Sarah DeWitt: Thanks, it's helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you.
Dom Addesso: Thank you.
Operator: We'll now move to our final caller for today's Q&A. This is Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Josh Shanker: Hey, good morning everyone.
Dom Addesso: Good morning, Josh.
Josh Shanker: Good morning. I would guess that on average I ask question about the insurance business about once every three quarters. And Dom, you were named CFO in 2009, President in 2011, CEO in 2013, if Everest had chosen any of those times to dump the insurance business, would that have been a mistake?
Dom Addesso: Yes.
Josh Shanker: Why should we think that Everest in long term in a great position to be in insurance business?
Dom Addesso: And obviously with the premise of your question you are referencing the reserve outcomes.
Josh Shanker: I am also noticing that -- I am also like current accident years are running about 100% anyways.
Dom Addesso: No, they are not. We looked for the current accident year is running at 94 -- 94.3.
Josh Shanker: But this year -- I mean maybe that's the new trend I guess. I mean look at over a 10-year period I guess.
Dom Addesso: Well, look, we have significantly modified the method in which we are doing business in the insurance space. The historical insurance footprint of Everest was a program based book of business. Today, that book of business is dominated by direct brokerage book of business. One in which we are primarily driving the underwriting as opposed to an MGA driving the underwriting. That does not mean by the way that we don't have some favorable and significant MGA relationships that we still maintain. But predominantly the book has been driven by desk underwriters that are employed by Everest. That's the significant change. And I think we've been able to demonstrate over the last couple of years improvement in the accident year in calendar year -- or accident year combined ratio. But clearly, there's been a challenge with reserves that come up from books of business that have been terminated, as Craig pointed out, that have been terminated 2008 and earlier. There's nothing that current management can do about that except focus on building out a first class insurance organization, which we believe we are doing today.
Josh Shanker: And so, your view is over the next two or three years, you'll be surprised if the insurance industry is not a contributor to profits the way the reinsurance business has been?
Dom Addesso: Absolutely. Now, by definition in cat for year, the Reinsurance segments are going to produce a better combined ratio than the insurance space, but the insurance sector is much stable in that perspective, But I think the current year attritional ratios demonstrate that already.
John Doucette: Josh, it's John. Just to add a little more color, I think also in the context of one of things we've really been focused in the last several years, Dom and the executive management team, is expanding our opportunity set and trying to figure out how we can get profitable growth. That's why we've been hiring very talented teams of people or individuals that can hire teams of people and can access business on the insurance side. That's why we are getting into Lloyds. That's why we are setting up the alternative capital to give us more capacity to deploy in other areas. So around the globe whether it's insurance or reinsurance, whether it's in the U.S. or internationally, we are looking for ways to expand our opportunity set. I think that's my job, that's the senior leaders in insurance and insurance team to develop new products, new distribution, new opportunities. And that also is one of the reasons why -- as we develop that, one of the reasons why the combined ratio has stabilized and our goal is to hopefully improve even in this market condition.
Dom Addesso: And Josh, look, say the decision that -- thank you for your recollection of all my stints at Everest, but I -- had we made maybe the decision that you're suggesting to let's say dispose the insurance sector, these reserve developments that we've seen would not have gone away. All right, those are things that would have been there regardless of whether we have chosen to go forward on the insurance sector or not. And in fact, I think if anything the insurance sector based on the new strategy has been accretive to earnings regardless of the prior year development. That prior year development is -- was baked. There is nothing that we could have done about that.
Josh Shanker: Good luck. I hope it ceases in the future and we'll see what happens.
Dom Addesso: We will see.
Josh Shanker: Thank you.
Dom Addesso: That was the last question…
Operator: That was the last question in the queue. So I would like to hand back to our speakers now for any additional or closing remarks.
Dom Addesso: Well, thank you every much. Again, we're very pleased to report record quarter and outstanding year particularly compared to generally what's going on in the overall market. We appreciate your questions and certainly understand even the tough ones. We think that we have demonstrated over the past couple of years that our strategies that we embarked on a couple of years ago are beginning to demonstrate that we can produce returns that are above market returns -- above the market. So again, thank you for your questions and your interest in Everest, and we will talk to you in the months ahead.
Operator: Thank you. That will now conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, ladies and gentlemen. You may now disconnect.

===== 2015 Q3  (2015-10-27 10:30:00) =====
Executives: Beth Farrell - VP of IR Dom Addesso - President and CEO John Doucette - Chief Underwriting Officer Craig Howie - CFO
Analysts: Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley Sarah DeWitt - JP Morgan Meyer Shields - KBW Ian Gutterman - Balyasny
Operator: Good day, everyone and welcome to the third quarter 2015 earnings call from Everest Re Group. Today's conference is being recorded.  At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Beth Farrell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma’am.
Beth Farrell: Thanks, Tony. Good morning and welcome to Everest Re Group's third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. On the call with me today are Dom Addesso, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer; John Doucette, our Chief Underwriting Officer and Craig Howie, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I note that statements made during today's call which are forward-looking in nature, such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations and the like, are subject to various risks. As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations. Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements. Now, let me turn the call over to Dom.
Dom Addesso: Thanks, Beth and good morning. We are pleased to report another favorable quarter despite industry losses in China and Chile. For us, these two events totaled $100 million gross and $79 million, net of tax and reinsurance. Nevertheless, we were still able to generate $200 million of operating income, producing an ROE for the quarter of 11%. Also impacting the quarter was lower investment income due to reduced limited partnership income. Investment returns continue to be an obvious challenge, which means an even greater result to produce adequate underwriting profits as evidenced by our year-to-date underwriting gain of $574 million and a year-to-date ROE of 14%. I expect both our quarter and year-to-date results to be better than overall industry performance, due to our well-diversified portfolio and expected advantage. The underwriting gain for the quarter was $155 million and absent the China loss, the attritional combined ratio stood at approximately 82%. While reinsurance segments drive the underwriting profit, the insurance operation has improved its attritional combined ratio year-over-year by almost 5 points for the nine months. This is a result of a number of quarters of improving rates as well as profitable growth of almost 30% during the nine months. Reinsurance, including Mt. Logan on the other hand, had a premium decline of approximately 6% on a year-to-date basis, but on a constant dollar basis, our reinsurance premium is down 3%. Several factors are attributing to this. The market environment is an important element of this where renewal rates are down which also causes us to non-renew certain programs or layers. Offsetting this somewhat is the ability to move our capacity to more profitable but different layers, typically at higher attachment points, and therefore less premium per dollar of limit. This portfolio optimization is done in concert with our various hedging strategies, which include use of cat bonds, IOWs and Mount Logan. Market conditions may flatten out as industry returns are subpar, capital growth is slowing and demand potential may be on the horizon. However, in the near term, we are not likely to see a market that would dramatically change our plans as price adequacy is mixed. This means we will continue to expect that most of our growth would come from our insurance units. The ongoing emphasis on adding superior talent and broadening our broker relationships will be key to our continued success there. In addition, broadening our insurance platform by developing our Lloyds Syndicate to the new Bermuda-based insurance platform will be immediately accretive.  There are many new and exciting initiatives taking play at Everest in both the reinsurance and the insurance businesses. The new products and the effective use of capital markets in the reinsurance portfolio to line of business and geographic expansion in our insurance segment. These are all efforts that enable us to continue to generate superior returns on our capital compared to the overall market. Thank you, and now I will turn it to Craig for the financial report.
Craig Howie: Thank you, Dom, and good morning everyone. Everest had another strong quarter of earnings with operating income of $200 million or $4.53 per diluted common share. This compares to operating income of $280 million or $6.12 per share for the third quarter of 2014. On a year-to-date basis, operating income was $755 million or $16.92 per share compared to $812 million or $17.46 per share in 2014. The 2015 result represents an annualized return on equity of 14%. These results reflected a slight increase in the overall current year-to-date attritional combined ratio of 84.2% up from 81.9% for the same period last year. This attritional measure includes a $60 million gross loss estimate for the explosions at the Chinese Port of Tianjin. The estimate was based on a $3.25 billion industry loss estimate for this event. Net income year-to-date was $621 million or $13.92 per share compared to $859 million $18.47 per share in 2014. Net income included $134 million of net after-tax realized capital losses compared to $47 million of capital gains last year or a difference of about $4 per share year-over-year. The 2015 capital losses were primarily attributable to fair value adjustments on the equity portfolio and impairments on the fixed income portfolio. The impairments mainly relate to credit write-downs on energy investments. Since the end of September, the majority of the fair value adjustments on the equity portfolio have already recovered. On a year-to-date basis the overall results reflected gross catastrophe losses of $70 million in 2015 compared to $75 million in 2014. The third quarter of 2015 reflected $40 million of gross current year catastrophe losses related to the earthquake in Chile. This compares to $30 million of cats during the third quarter of 2014. Our reported combined ratio was 85.8% for the first nine months of 2015 compared to 83.7% in 2014. The higher 2015 ratio includes Tianjin loss as well as numerous weather related losses during the year that did not meet our $10 million catastrophe threshold. The year-to-date commission ratio of 21.8% was slightly up from 21.5% in 2014, primarily due to higher contingent commissions. Our expense ratio remains low at 4.8% on a year-to-date basis. Expense dollars are up from 2014, due to new hires and build out of our insurance platform. For investments, pre-tax investment income was $116 million for the quarter and $363 million year to date on our $17.6 billion investment portfolio. Investment income year-to-date declined $33 million from one-year ago. This decrease was primarily driven by the low interest rate environment and by the decline in limited partnership [Technical Difficulty].  This is Craig Howie; I know we were cut off, so I'm sorry if I repeat it, if I’m repeating anything that I’ve previously mentioned but I’m going to start again with taxes. So on income taxes, the overall year-to-date 2015 tax expense $67 million lower than 2014. Mainly due to the 2015 capital losses which reduced income. Operating income does not include capital gains or losses. The 14.8% annualized effective tax rate on operating income is primarily driven by lower than planned catastrophe losses resulting in higher than expected taxable income for the year. A 14% to 16% effective tax rate on operating income for the year is in line with our expectations given our planned cat losses for the remainder of the year. Strong cash flow continues with operating cash flow of $988 million for the first nine months of 2015 compared to $926 million in 2014.  Shareholders’ equity at the end of the quarter was $7.5 billion, essentially flat compared to year-end 2014. This is after taking into account capital returned through $325 million of share buybacks and $126 million of dividends paid in the first nine months of 2015, representing a total return of capital through shareholders of over $450 million so far this year. Book value per share increased over 4% to $173.76 from $166.75 at year-end 2014. Our continued strong capital balance positions us well for potential business opportunities as well as continuing stock repurchases. Thank you. And now John Doucette will provide the operations review.
John Doucette: Thank you Craig. Good morning. As Dom, highlighted, we had a very solid underwriting results into the third quarter of 2015 despite the industry’s macro challenges. Our Group gross written premium for Q3 was $1.7 billion, up over $50 million from Q3 last year, with diverging trends in reinsurance and insurance. Quarter-over-quarter, our reinsurance book declined modestly, driven in part by foreign exchange, while insurance growth accelerated meaningfully due to our many growth initiatives. I will provide more details shortly.  Our Group net written premium for Q3 was $1.6 billion, which was up 3% compared to Q3 last year. Year-to-date, our Group net written premium of $4 billion is up about 1% year-over-year and generated Group underwriting profits of $574 million. For our reinsurance segment, all reinsurance gross written premium, including Logan was $1.2 billion for the quarter, down 5% from Q3 last year, but on a constant dollar basis, premium was down only 2%.  As discussed last quarter, we have been declining, reducing and non-renewing unattractively priced business. In addition, as previously discussed, we restructured deal for a significant client that continues to impact the topline. However, the expected profits are essentially unchanged.  Our reinsurance book including Mt. Logan generated $142 million of underwriting profit in Q3, a $77 million decrease compared to last Q3, driven predominantly by the $100 million of losses related to the explosion at the Chinese port of Tianjin, and also the Chile earthquake. The Tianjin loss, while not a natural catastrophe, one of the largest insurer industrial loss in Asia and also one of the most complex losses in recent history making the outcome uncertain. But as Craig reported, we have conservatively estimated our loss by assuming industry losses at the high-end of the range.  Year-to-date, our reinsurance segments including Mt. Logan generated $574 million of underwriting profit. We are pleased with these underwriting results, particularly in light of this quarter’s loss event and the [Technical Difficulty] Logan is core to our hedging strategy. Supplemented by cap bond, IOWs, traditional reinsurance and retrocessional protection, we successfully enhanced our capital efficiency while delivering meaningful capacity to support our underwriting strategies.  Turning to the insurance operations, we are progressing with the strategic build out of our platform while focusing on improving the bottom line results. This has been accomplished through the investment in key leadership hires, which in turn have brought significant underwriting talent and stronger direction toward achieving our strategic goals.  Through nine months, premium in this segment is up 29% to $1.2 billion. This growth is highly diversified, coming from many areas, including several newly launched lines of business as well as product and geographic expansion in existing lines of business. We are building a world-class insurance platform, capable of offering products across lines and geographies, complementing our leading global reinsurance franchise.  Year-to-date, we are up 35% in gross written premium on our direct brokerage business, which is underwritten internally by Everest underwriters. Our program business is up 10% year-to-date. This split growth trend is consistent with last quarter and our expectations, as we continue building out our retail books. Insurance rates remind mixed with some lines seeing modest rate improvement and others coming under pressure. For the year, our rate monitoring systems indicate relatively flat risk-adjusted pricing across all lines, which we are pleased with in this rating environment. Bottom line, our quarterly insurance results for Q3 included an underwriting profit of $12 million with a 96.5% combined ratio, over 10 points better than our Q3 combined ratio last year.  The underlying accident year results remain profitable and we're driving improvement in our loss and expense ratio through our rebalancing of the portfolio by risk, by product and by geography, as we gain economies of scale. As previously announced, we've received approval and principal from Lloyds to launch our syndicate, number 2786. We expect to obtain final approval to start business on January 1, 2016. Our Lloyds syndicate will provide Everest access to additional international business and new product opportunities, enabling us to further diversify and broaden our insurance portfolio in 2016 and beyond. Now, some further detail on what we are seeing in each insurance markets. For California workers comp, gross written premium is up 13% to $75 million for Q3 compared to Q3 last year. With a mid-90s combined ratio, the rates are under pressure with increased competition. Professional liability premium dominated by our financial institutions book was $40 million for the quarter, flat compared to last Q3 and we continue to see rate pressure driven by excess capacity.  Other casualty business is relatively flat quarter-over-quarter, but the combined ratio has been improving as our new initiatives gain traction and enhance diversification. In the short tail business, including property, DIC, non-stand auto and contingency business, written premium was $80 million for the quarter, an increase of over 38% from last Q3 as we have deployed more property insurance capacity and geographically diversified the book. Despite rate pressure in property, our opportunity to deploy capital at attractive returns remains, with the book running at high-80s combined ratio. Similarly, our contingency business continues to grow at a nice rate with attractive opportunities and new strategic relationships, while running at a mid-90s combined ratio. Accident and health premium was up over 40% in Q3 compared to last Q3 to approximately $30 million, as several new initiatives gain traction and is running at a low-90s combined ratio.  Crop conditions remain favorable and commodity prices are stable. Our crop insurance premium is up and more geographically diversified. We're running at a slight underwriting profit for the quarter, a meaningful improvement over last Q3. The outlook is favorable for profitable 2015 results. In summary, given our new growth initiatives, particularly on the insurance side, as well as our ability to deploy capital effectively on the reinsurance side, due to our core strengths and sustainable competitive advantages, we continue to achieve bottom line results that are among the best in the industry.  Thank you and now back to Beth for Q&A.
Beth Farrell: Yes, Tony, we are ready for questions. But first I'd like to apologize for the connection issue which seems to be coming from our end. If we have a future connection issue, please stay on the line and we will call back in. Thank you. Tony?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Amit Kumar with Macquarie Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Amit Kumar: Thanks, and good morning and congrats on the quarter. Maybe two quick questions. Number one is the discussion on the underlying AOI LR in the insurance segment. Can you talk about, I know you talked about 10 point improvement, if you adjusted for the agriculture book, what would that number be for ex-ag for the insurance book on an underlying basis, on an apples-to-apples basis?
Dom Addesso: Give us one second. It’s 96% for the quarter, Amit. As far as our attritional combined ratio without crop, it’s 96% compared to 95% last year – sorry 96% for the quarter, 94% year-to-date. 
Amit Kumar: Got it. Okay, that's helpful. Thanks. The other question I had was the discussion obviously on growth versus capital versus not talking about the Lloyd's which has a stamp capacity of I guess 151 million. Now the buyback this quarter was a bit higher than I guess what we were expecting and trying to sort of think about that, was it higher because of some sort of catch up because on the Q2 call you had said that it was running a bit lower, is that simply the fact or is this sort of a new normal, how should we think about the repurchase this quarter? Thanks.
Dom Addesso: I think, Amit, you should think about perhaps a little bit of catch up. We were lighter than we certainly anticipated in the second quarter as the price target ran away from us a little bit in the second quarter and we just continued to have steady progress towards repurchasing shares. And we continued that into the third quarter particularly as we grew going through the quarter, it seemed as if it was going to going light cat quarter.
Amit Kumar: Got it. And then can you just upon the Lloyd's, when does that fully ramp up, the 151 million stamp capacity?
Dom Addesso: We expect to go live with Lloyd’s in -- for the year subject to final approval by the franchise board or business plan et cetera, but we are on track to do that effective 1/1.
Amit Kumar: Got it. Okay, that’s all I have. Thanks for the answers.
Dom Addesso: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Next we'll move to Joshua Shanker with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open. 
Joshua Shanker: Yeah, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Dom, whether you like it or not everyone looks at you as all bad things happening in Latin America must be happening to Everest Re. And so in the largest recorded hurricane in history is bearing down on Puerto Vallarta. How should we think about the pricing in the Mexican market, how should we think of agri risks that Everest is taking? Why or why not our investor is conspicuously concerned about Everest to benefit or to their detriment?
Dom Addesso: Well, I can’t speak to why investors are conspicuously concerned or not concerned. All I can speak to is what we try to do. We manage our accumulations by each of our zone and of course as you and others know, our largest zone is in the Southeast US and of course we manage that down from there. Relative to what was happening in Mexico as an example or in Latin America for that matter. The industry was quite lucky of course that that event did not hit some of the more occupied regions in the resort areas. Interestingly enough, in the more recent times, we actually downsized of our participations in Mexico due to pricing trends and conditions. And as we continue to emphasize in each of these calls, we will look for fairly priced transactions and if we cannot need our hurdle rates, we will terminate or look to change our participations in some ways that matches our re-adjusted return targets that we have. So we continue to manage our P&Ls consistent with the balance sheet and we believe that what we’re doing in terms of managing our risk through cat bonds, IOWs, and Mt. Logan, in fact, we write sizes that risk relative to our balance sheet. So, I think we benefit frankly from the diversification that we have across the globe as opposed to thinking about a particular event in some region of the world. As you’ve probably have noted our [indiscernible] was probably slightly below what others have reported. And again, I think it's a result of those actions that I’ve just described where we actually got of some deals and actually our exposure turned out to be less. In Chile, we were at much less proportion of business than we did previously and of course that event again hitting offshore, the insured loss was not as great as maybe was originally feared. So I think on balance, again, the portfolio is diversified across the globe, which frankly we believe benefits us from a return perspective in using our balance sheet most effectively because I don’t -- I hope that answers your question.
Joshua Shanker: It did to some extent; it did to the open end of the question. The other question as you mentioned in the previous questioner that the stock price got a little bit away from you in 2Q. The stock prices are between 180 and 185 in the second quarter, are you trying where possible to buy stock at book value and not above. Is 180, 185 when you have a $175 in book value a significant premium to where you want buy?
Operator: Pardon the interruption Mr. Shanker, it looks like we did unfortunately lose our speakers once again, if you could please hold your question, we’ll get them re-established as soon as possible. And we've been rejoined by our speakers and Joshua ifyou wanted to ask your last question again.
Joshua Shanker: Must be that industry low expense ratio coming through here guys, I don’t know.
Dom Addesso: But I don’t think we were going to make the same comment but –
Joshua Shanker: Actually my associate is who pointed that out by the way. So, the question was, you mentioned on the previous question that the stock kind of got away from your repurchased desires in the second quarter, it was all bobbing between 180 and 185, are you trying to buy at book and not above?
Dom Addesso: Not necessarily, we do look at over 6 to 12 month period but we just had a price target for that particular period and the stock just kept moving ahead of that. It's nothing more complicated than that. And we can think over the long-term, we have been repurchasing stocks and we look to do at not a specific target but I’ll -- that we care to get share in a public [Technical Difficulty] to any levels repurchases, particularly our [indiscernible]. 
Joshua Shanker: But let me just put it in another way.
Dom Addesso: You can try. 
Joshua Shanker: Do you have sufficient capital right now on the books to write in your business or do you need to build up some more capital? 
Craig Howie: We do have sufficient capital, we do like to maintain some bid of excess capital. But as I’ve mentioned in previous calls, the rating agencies have increased, particularly S&P has increased their capital requirements, so that excess position has shrunk a bit just based on rating agency actions. 
Joshua Shanker: Sure, fair enough. And then on the growth on the primary insurance side, that appears that some of the growth came from short-tail lines, I think that was up 40% this quarter and also the accident and health, and also you’re planning to go on to Lloyds. Help us understand the risk management that’s in place for that. This line seem to be I think under some pressure now. So help us understand what risk management put in place for that?
Dom Addesso: Well, we do have – first of all, we have our risk management committee that reports regularly to the Board, so I will point that out. And we monitor, if your question is about accumulations –
Joshua Shanker: Well, I said, Dom, sort of more in the sense of – people in the industry are saying pricing has weakened these lines and we are seeing that – I mean, using growth right now from Everest, so just curious where you’re finding --.
Dom Addesso: Let me just add to that, because pricing is, I would say, it’s weaker. It does not mean necessarily that it’s not adequate. So for example, as John Doucette highlighted in his comments, we talked about casualty being flat year-over-year, so that’s kind of a reflection of what’s going on in the market, perhaps what we feel are adequate returns relative to what we have seen. In the property space, we are still seeing many opportunities. A&H is a specialty segment, which experienced nice growth as well as some new product opportunities. Our contingency business/sports and entertainment book is again a specialty business that’s not necessarily subject to some of the pricing pressures that you mentioned. In addition, we have done some things in Canada, which have given us some growth. California DIC, while things have flattened out there, it’s still – from a returns – just on return perspective, it’s still very good business. So all of these pockets, we do monitor rates each and every month and quarter in all of our classes of business on the insurance side. 
John Doucette: And it’s John. I just want to add a couple more things. You mentioned property specifically. We’ve talked about this before, but I think it’s worth repeating. We have one global catastrophe property and catastrophe pricing and accumulation system, which every underwriter around globe, well, insurance, facultative, treaty, IOWs, selling, buying, retro, and products we have talked about before, purple, whether it’s from individual building or it’s a territory, multiple territories or worldwide capacity and we have a view of risk built up by a lot of analytics and a lot – a dedicated cat team that is central and we can look at the relative pricing and the absolute pricing over time and across product irrespective of where it is, what form, what territory and we can allocate capital [Technical Difficulty] .
Operator: And pardon me, interruption, it appears that we are still experiencing some technical difficulties, please remain on the line, and we will get our speakers reconnected as soon as possible. Thank you for your patience.  Once again, we appreciate your patience as we reconnect our speakers for today’s conference. Please continue to stand by. Once again, we appreciate your patience as we reconnect our speakers for today’s conference call. Please continue to stand by. Once again, we appreciate your patience as we reconnect our speakers for today’s conference call. Please continue to stand by. And we’ve been reconnected with our speakers.
Dom Addesso: Again, we apologize. We are going to a different room and a different phone. Let’s see if this works better. So I think John was responding to the question we got cut off, is it correct?
Operator: Yes.
John Doucette: So, just to finish the thought and again, I apologize if I’m repeating myself. We have one system for globally by product irrespective of the product, every underwriter on their desk has that, it rolls up for real time accumulations, real time pricing, whether it’s insurance, fac, treaty, retro or any other products that we sell. We have a new Chief Underwriting Officer as part of the building out the insurance leadership team, whose job is responsible to make sure we’re getting paid adequately for the risk that we’re taking on a risk adjusted basis. And we continue to have the advantage of the various capital markets, convergence vehicles and structures that allow us to have capital efficiencies for the products that we sell and help the group get the most capital efficiency and the best risk adjusted return.
Joshua Shanker : Sure. That’s helpful. And are you seeing pricing on the primary side better than on the reinsurance for property?
John Doucette: It varies, it doesn’t boil down necessarily to one answer, but directionally, there are certainly cases of that, yeah.
Joshua Shanker: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Kai Pan: Thank you. Alright. So I would start with your take on the upcoming B court changes, what potentially impacts for the reinsurance demand?
Dom Addesso: I can’t comment specifically, because I’m not sure that we know all the details of those changes at this point, other than to know that we do expect that we’ll have some impact for certain clients and that is, I did mention in my comments that we would expect some increase in demand and frankly that would be one of the reasons that I would expect some increase in demand, but I really can’t give you any specific on what that might be for the industry as a whole.
Kai Pan: Okay. And then more broadly for the sort of upcoming renewal in Jan 1, it seems like you’re more confident at this time that the rate will become more stabilized than the past renewal season. So what could go wrong from here?
Dom Addesso: Well, I suppose what could go wrong is that rates are down another 5 to 10 that would be wrong. And that would cause us to continue to make major modification to our portfolio but coming back from the two major industry events, they are certainly mixed thoughts on that subject. But given where we see the industry, where we see the returns, what we see from capital markets perspective, it doesn't look to me as if it should be a market that is continuing to slide dramatically.
Kai Pan: Okay, that's great. Then just a pick number question. Do you have a breakdown of the $6 million Tianjin losses by segments and also on Volkswagen what’s your view on the industry exposure as Everest Re’s exposure on that event?
Dom Addesso: The Tianjin loss by segment -- when you say segment, meaning our segments?
Kai Pan: Yes, reported segments.
Dom Addesso: I'll ask Craig to.
Craig Howie: The majority of it is in international, our international second. So essentially from our Singapore office but also from our Bermuda operation as well.
Dom Addesso: I'm sorry, what was the second question Kai?
Kai Pan: On the Volkswagen potential industry exposure there?
Dom Addesso: There I think we have something like $12 million of limits exposed to Volkswagen and we have not heard anything on that.
Kai Pan: Okay, that's great. Well, last question you might may. The insurance growth and margin looks like you’re growing pretty fast, especially in short-tail and accident and health which has lower combined ratio -- underlying combined ratio than the group. So shall we expect mid-90s combined ratio continue to improve given the high growth like coming from those lower combined ratio business and also if you’re stepping back, last year you have higher growth in the primary line of business was in early 2000 and which eventually doesn't help the Company. So I just wonder what give you confidence that what you're doing now that's different and your confidence by profitability going forward. Thanks.
Dom Addesso: There's a lot to that question. First of all, yes, that’s certainly our plan to continue to have the insurance combined ratio to continue to trend down and we have every expectation that would happen over time. Relative to the early 2000s, well part of that growth was California comp, which actually over the very long time periods of 13 to 15 years that we’re talking about was hugely profitable, yes there were periods were the comp turned into a loss for a period there but if you look at the body of work over that entire cycle, it’s been extremely profitable, probably close to $1 billion of profit in total. The other parts of growth from the insurance base that emanated from the time period that you're referencing was a lot of program business and is decided we’re deemphasizing the growth, our growth is primary coming from the brokerage space, the retail space, where we are underwriting risk by risk and not relying or dependent as much upon growth in the program space. Doesn't mean that we won't continue to do business with great partners in that space, it just means that we’re a lot more selective than we have other way in which to grow the insurance portfolio and by that I mean direct brokerage space, we control the account and you control the underwriting at the desk level.
Kai Pan: That's great, thank you so much for all of the answers.
Operator: Thank you. Next we will move to Sarah DeWitt with JP Morgan. Please go ahead your line is open.
Sarah DeWitt: Hi, good morning. As you look out a bit longer term how'd you see the business mix evolving between insurance versus reinsurance?
Dom Addesso: Well as I mentioned in my comments, I certainly expect in the short term given what we expect out of the reinsurance space that is like to be that insurance will become a bigger part of the pie. If you look out over the very long term, I would expect that to be the case as well as we look to rebalance our portfolio. But we don’t have any -- put out any procrastination [ph] about what percentage may or may not be. We frankly take advantage of what the marketplace is giving us in each part of the cycle whether that – and so if pricing is more adequate and very hard market in the reinsurance base and you are likely to see strong growth spurt there. It doesn’t mean that it would necessarily be change our appetite in the insurance side, it’s just a matter of which segment is growing faster than the next due to pricing adequacy.
Sarah DeWitt: Okay, thanks. And then I think historically you’ve targeted a 12% to 13% ROE assuming normalized catastrophe losses, is that still an achievable goal as we think about 2016 and I think that will probably be better than the industry as well? 
Dom Addesso: If you are asking including cat losses or ex-cat losses?
Sarah DeWitt: Including some level of normalized catastrophe losses.
Dom Addesso: I do think that’s potentially achievable. I don’t know given where pricing is today on the reinsurance side ex-cats whether 13 might be pushing it, but again we don’t forecast our results, but relative to what real rates are I think that’s still a great return, but I do think our target is low teens absolutely.
Sarah DeWitt: Okay, great. Thanks for the answers.
Operator: Thank you. Next we will move to Meyer Shields with KBW. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Meyer Shields: Great. Thanks so much. So two maybe big picture questions. One, is there any reason to expect the historical cycle in California workers’ comp to not play out with this year next year looking really, really good and then things getting worse?
Dom Addesso: I don’t know that on any line of business that I would fight any historical side. So there are cycles in every segment of our business and I don’t know why California comp would be any different than any other segment of the business.
Meyer Shields: Okay, me neither. Second, setting aside pricing trends in underwriting decision, is there any risk to the reinsurance book from the efforts you have in insurance in general or maybe opening a Lloyd’s platform from companies that you are not competing with more directly?
Dom Addesso: I think that risk is moderate at worst. I think as you look across the industry landscape most enterprises have both an insurance and a reinsurance footprint, even to the point where some more traditional insurance enterprises have started up reinsurance arms. So I don’t see that as much of a threat. And in particular, what we do in the insurance side is mostly specialty lines business. 
Meyer Shields: Right, understood. Is the run rate for expenses and insurance likely to rise as Lloyd’s goes live?
Dom Addesso: Well, we’ve already – in our numbers already this year to date we’ve expended some monies to get this project off the ground and certainly Lloyd’s does have slightly higher expense ratio, but given the amount of premium relative to our $5 billion of gross premium across the organization I am not sure that it would -- really make much of a difference.
Meyer Shields: That makes sense. Great, thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. And we will take our final question from Ian Gutterman with Balyasny. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Ian Gutterman: Great, thanks. I guess on the insurance business, is there any -- as the book is growing and changing, is there any seasonality to it? I guess the reason I ask is, normally Q3 has been a little higher than the first two quarters, but this year was much higher. Is there something seasonal about that or is that just the increased growth and this is -- think of this as sort of more of a normalized?
Dom Addesso: Well, the insurance side, remember, is influenced by crop which does have seasonality to it. To the extent that there is some seasonality that would come from property E&S book to the extent that we have some of that in south-eastern US. They haven't had any major events, so there hasn’t been losses coming from that and again property E&S to the extent that it’s growing and it has been growing in the north-east, could have some impact from winter storms, so yeah, there will be packets of seasonality across the portfolio. John wanted to add something.
Ian Gutterman: Okay. Got it. Okay.
John Doucette: The second part of your question was the type of growth initiatives and we've been talking about growth initiatives and we've been putting in place a lot of different resources, we've been hiring talent, we've been building the infrastructure on the insurance side and that takes time. We've been talking about that for several quarters and it’s starting to kick in, including in this third quarter and we’re seeing the fruits of the plan and the resources and the labor that we've committed to growing the insurance book. So it's that combined with the seasonality Dom alluded to.
Ian Gutterman: Got it. And I clearly realized both, I just don’t know if I should just kind of a little bit of the magnitude of the increase this quarter, I was always trying to get at, but okay and then moving on I guess just a follow-up on the Lloyds question, can you talk more about specific business plan, I mean I don't know if, what stack capacity you've been approved for, what sort of lines of business you are targeting initially, is it going to be prop type stuff or might be just try to do like holders or even some casualties, what's the focus going to be?
John Doucette: It's -- a significant portion of it is professional liability, D&O, E&O commercial D&O and E&O. We also are -- we will have some reinsurance business that will flow through the syndicate, particularly as our China and perhaps our Australian business because of expense advantages of running it through the platform relative to keeping in on the reinsurance company paper, because particularly changes in China from a regulatory perspective, we won’t have to bricks and mortar in China, that’s one example. We will be granting cover holder status to a number of underwriting units around the globe to utilize the syndicate that will be some sports and entertainment business for example and contingency business that would come into the syndicate generally.
Dom Addesso: And the stamp capacity is $150 million roughly.
Ian Gutterman: Got it, great. Thank you. And then on Tianjin, this feels to me, I guess, I'm asking for your opinion and maybe some detail as well. It feels to me like this is one of those losses maybe like a deep water or a costa where it is just so hard to, it seems the primaries themselves don't really have any great insight into what the losses and it seems to me when we get these events, they tend to creep over time. Does this feel like one of those where you’re worried about creep and if so as you are looking at how much put up this quarter and how did you account for that?
John Doucette: Well, I'm not sure that it is really like costa, custom because with that, it was a salvage situation and that really is what was driving up the cost tremendously. Here, you have frankly complete destruction, my understanding is that the area has been completely levelled and I don't know that because there are discrete values, I think that that would be less of an issue as contrasting with costa. I guess the other question would be maybe the more uncertainly would revolve around any kind of BI, contingent BI claims that might be coming out of it, but again we reserved it at the high end of the range based on the estimates. As I mentioned before in answer to another question, our participation in the region is actually reduced. So we’re feeling comfortable with our pick, but I'm not sure that any movement around that pick is necessarily all that material.
Ian Gutterman: Perfect. And then just lastly, just a follow-up on the B court question from earlier, what about as far as your handwriting appetite, does anything potentially change there and I think one of the more key topics on that is the changes in the tail factor on cat, does that have to change how you would look at tail beyond 250 or maybe how you look at aggregate covers, occurrence covers things like that, especially your appetite to write them. 
John Doucette: So we have always looked at in terms of pricing and accumulation, all points on the curve to one in ten thousand and beyond, we look at AO, we look at annual occurrence, we look at aggregate, we look at multiple events, we look at things that happen whether it was 2005 or Katrina, Rita, William – Wilma or 2011 with multiple events around the world. So we think about that as we create, manage our book and try to get the best risk adjusted return. In general, [indiscernible] which we think it will increase demand and therefore increase limit that’s going to be purchased potentially by our customers and therefore upward pressure on pricing, that’s a good thing. And we have the capital to support that and – including both our own equity capital and the various hedges that we’ve been talking about for many quarters now that we have put in place. So we think that’s going to put upward pressure and upward demand and we like that. 
Ian Gutterman : Great, thanks so much. Good luck guys. 
Dom Addesso: Now, I understand from the moderator that that was the last question, but because of our interruptions, if there are other questions, we certainly would stand a few minutes. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And it appears, we have no further questions at this time. 
Dom Addesso: Okay, that’s fine, just [indiscernible].
Beth Farrell: Thank you, and as always, we’ll see you next quarter. 
John Doucette: Thank you.
Dom Addesso: Thank you very much. And gain, apologies for the connection issues we have had. We appreciate the interest. Again, we think we’ve had an excellent. We’ve had some events, but I think what you’ve seen the way Everest has performed with the scale and diversification of our book, despite those industry losses, we are still able to produce very, very good returns, and I think it’s just a reflection of how we manage our book of business. Thanks again for your interest. 
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today’s conference. You may disconnect any time and have a great day.

===== 2015 Q2  (2015-07-28 10:30:00) =====
Executives: Beth Farrell - VP, IR Dom Addesso - President and CEO Craig Howie - EVP and CFO John Doucette - EVP and CUO
Analysts: Sarah DeWitt - JPMorgan Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank  Brian Meredith - UBS
Operator: Good day everyone. Welcome to the Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Call of Everest Re Group. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Beth Farrell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Beth Farrell: Thank you Stephanie. Good morning and welcome to Everest Re Group's Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. On the call with me today are Dom Addesso, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer; John Doucette, our Chief Underwriting Officer and Craig Howie, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I note that statements made during today's call which are forward-looking in nature, such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations and the like, are subject to various risks. As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations. Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements. Now let me turn the call over to Dom.
Dom Addesso: Thanks, Beth and good morning. We were pleased to report that operating earnings for the quarter were $225 million, which was primarily driven by pre-tax underwriting income of $183 million, and net investment income of $125 million. The tax rate in the quarter jumped to 16.6%, causing some distortion relative to our first quarter numbers. Other factors affecting the first quarter comparison include a $50 million difference in foreign currency adjustments, $30 million of catastrophes, other weather related losses not recorded as Cats per say, and finally a marine loss from the Connex [ph] oil platform. Adjusting for these items, clearly puts our results in line with last year on a quarter and a year to date basis. And while the returns are still quite favorable improvement year-over-year is affected by market conditions. We believe than in an absolute sense we are well above our cost of capital and are near the top of industry performers. I expect that industry results will bear that out. We achieved above market returns with strong expense controls, innovative and dynamic portfolio management and new products. In these last six months we have continued our expansion of capital market tools to leverage our capital and achieve a net return in access of the growth. Mount Logan is growing to $830 million of assets under management and our purchase of IOWs has increased this year versus last year of this time. These tactics allows increased market capacity on attractive business without increasing net exposure, while maintaining an above average return. Premiums were down for the quarter and flat for the year with strong growth in the insurance segment, offset by a reduction in our reinsurance premiums. The factors affecting reinsurance were less quota share premium, the impact of foreign currency translation, shift of excess capacity to higher layers, increased corporate sessions to hedge accumulations, market pricing and non-renewed deal due to terms and conditions. Offsetting these trends have been initiatives on the new product side. We continue to modestly grow our credit and financial assurance business and agricultural lines in the reinsurance segments. In the insurance segment, the growth has been strong, at 20 plus percent as we continue to see momentum in professional lines, excess casualty, contingency, crop and property E&S. The insurance operation is on an excellent trajectory with an attritional combined ratio of 93% excluding crop. We continue to aggressively build out our insurance platform with the addition of underwriting talent. Market dislocation has made this a bit easier these days and a determined build is our preferred course of action here. Despite what we all we see swirling around today in the M&A space, we are generally not inclined to take on significant dilution and then still face the generally enormous integration, cultural and legacy challenges, unless of course if it quarterly accretive in some reasonable timeframe. We have the capital, patience and discipline to build a top tier insurance operation, consistent with our pricing and risk appetite. None of this, whether it's reinsurance or insurance will be easy. Market conditions in the reinsurance sector are challenging, but we appear to be closer to a turning point. Capital market seems to be hitting a floor, but the traditional markets results will be a more important factor. The reality is that there is not much margin for even the small events, let alone larger inevitable catastrophes.  Based on unexpected second quarter industry results for reinsurers, we’re likely to see that a few small cats and a large risk loss will produce returns on capital below 9%. Along with declining bond values, this begins to feel as if a market turn must happen. Of course markets are not always rational and a quick snapback would be atypical. We are not waiting however as we continue to leverage our strengths to manage our portfolio smartly and outperform. An element of managing our portfolio will be an emphasis on insurance growth. Furthermore, we will manage capital accordingly. In this quarter our share repurchases were $50 million. This was below our typical pace for a number of factors. Among them were longer-term capital needs, driven by our insurance growth objectives. However, we have demonstrated over the long-term we are committed to returning excess capital when market conditions warrant. As I sum up the first half of the year, despite some previously mentioned cautions, I'm quite optimistic. We finished the first six months at $554 million of operating income, up from $532 million in the prior quarter and with a 50% ROE; excellent results in such tough times, especially when compared to the industry. We continue to be able to navigate through a difficult reinsurance market while managing risk, staying opportunistic with new products and maintaining our pricing and expense discipline.  I'm most optimistic about the trajectory of our insurance operations. Excluding crop, our year-to-date growth was 26% or $130 million and continues to produce profitable accident year underwriting results and my expectation is that this will improve over time.  Thank you. And now I will turn it over to Craig for the financial report. 
Craig Howie: Thank you Dom and good morning everyone. Everest had another solid quarter of earnings, with net income up $209 million or $4.68 per diluted common share. This compares to net income of $290 million or $6.26 per share for the second quarter of 2014. Net income includes realized capital gains and losses. On a year-to-date basis net income was $532 million or $11.88 per share, compared to $584 million or $12.46 per share in 2014. The 2015 result represents an annualized return on equity of over 14%.  Operating income year-to-date was $554 million or $12.38 per share. This represents a 9% increase over operating income of $11.35 per share last year. These overall results were driven by a solid underwriting result and sizable foreign exchange gains compared to the first half of 2014. The results reflect an overall current year attritional combined ratio of 83.0% on a year-to-date basis, up from 82.0% at year-end 2014. The attritional measure includes higher than expected current year losses in the U.S. reinsurance market, including estimated losses for the marine energy market and numerous other related losses that did not meet our $10 million catastrophe threshold. All reinsurance segments reported underwriting games for the quarter and for the first half of 2015. Total reinsurance reported an underwriting gain of $177 million for the quarter compared to $181 million underwriting gain last year. For the first half of 2015, total reinsurance reported an underwriting gain of $382 million compared to a $396 million gain last year. The Mount Logan Re segment reported a $28 million underwriting gain for the quarter, compared to a $9 million underwriting gain for the second quarter of 2014. On a year to date basis, Mount Logan reported an underwriting gain of $50 million, compared to a $19 million gain for the first half of 2014. Everest retains $7 million of this income and $43 million was attributable to the non-controlling interest of this entity. The insurance segment reported an underwriting loss of $23 million for the quarter, compared to a gain of $4 million last year. On a year to date basis, the insurance segment reported an underwriting loss of $12 million, compared to a gain of $8 million in 2014. The insurance segment loss primarily related to a claim review of Umbrella claims on a run off program that was discontinued by the Company several years ago. As a result of the review, we booked an additional $31 million of prior year losses rather than waiting for the reserve study that will be completed in the fourth quarter. The insurance segment current year attritional combine ratio was 93.4% on a year to date basis excluding crop. This ratio has included compared to 93.9% one year ago. The overall underwriting gain for the group was $183 million for the quarter, compared to an underwriting gain of $195 million for the same period last year. On a year to date basis, the underwriting gain was $420 million compared to a gain of $423 million in 2014. These overall results reflect $40 million of current year catastrophe losses in the first half of 2015 all recorded in the second quarter. Of the total, $20 million related to losses from slums in Australia and $20 million came from flooding in Chile. The 2015 cat losses were partially offset by $10 million of favorable development on prior year cat losses, primarily from the 2013 U.S storms. This compares with $45 million of catastrophes during the first half of 2014. Our reported combined ratio was 84.1% for the first half of 2015, compared to 82.5% in 2014. Year to date commission ratio of 22.1% was slightly up from 21.9% in 2014, primarily due to higher contingent commissions. Our overall expense ratio remains low at 4.7%. This includes our industry leading expense ratio of 2.8% for our total reinsurance segment. As for loss reserves, in June we released our fifth annual global loss development triangles for 2014. There were no major changes since the 2013 release. Our overall quarterly internal reserving metrics continue to be favorable. For investments, pre-tax investment income was $125 million for the quarter and $248 million year to date on our $18 billion investment portfolio. Investment income for the first six months declined only $7 million from one year ago. The pre-tax yield on the overall portfolio was 2.9% with a duration of three years. The first six months reflected $22 million of net after tax realized capital losses compared to $52 million of realized capital gains last year. These losses were mainly attributable to impairments on the fixed income portfolio in 2015.  Other income and expense included $44 million of foreign exchange gains in the first six months of 2015 compared to $15 million of foreign exchange losses in the first half of 2014. On income taxes, the annualized effective tax rate is primarily driven by lower than planned catastrophe losses resulting in higher than expected taxable income for the year. The 13.9% effective tax rate on operating income is in line with our expected rate for the year, given our planned cap losses for the remainder of the year. This rate is consistent with the 14.4% tax rate at the same time last year. Strong cash flow continues with operating cash flows of $683 million for the first half of 2015 compared to $590 million in 2014. Shareholders equity at the end of the quarter was $7.7 billion, up $276 million or 4% over year-end 2014. This is after taking into account over $200 million of capital returned through $125 million of share buybacks and $84 million of dividends paid in the first half of 2015. Book value per share increased 5% to $174.84 from $166.75 at year-end 2014. Our strong capital balance positions us well for potential business opportunities as well as continuing stock repurchases.  Thank you. And now John Doucette will provide our operations review. 
John Doucette: Thank you Craig. Good morning. As Dom, highlighted we continued our solid underwriting results into the second quarter of 2015. Our Group gross written premium for Q2 was $1.3 billion, down $157 million from Q2 last year, with decreases coming from each of our reinsurance segments which I will get into shortly. Our U.S. insurance operation gross written premium is up meaningfully in Q2 compared to Q2 last year with growth coming from almost every insurance profit center.  Our Group net written premium for Q2 was $1.2 billion, which was down 4% compared to Q2 last year. Year-to-date our Group gross and net written premium are both essentially flat year-over-year. Year-to-date 2015 underwriting profits for the Group are $420 million, virtually in line with 2014. For our reinsurance segment, total reinsurance gross written premium including Logan was $900 million for the quarter, down 17% from Q2 last year. This decrease in gross premium for the quarter was driven by several items. First, exchange rate. The strong U.S. dollar had a meaningful impact on our international operations and our Bermuda operations. On a like-for-like exchange rate, our overall reinsurance segments would have been closer to 13% down compared to second quarter last year. Second, declining, reducing or non-renewing business that had pricing we could not support. These occurred across all reinsurance segments of the Group. Third, in the international segment, a major deal for a strategic relationship was restructured with essentially the same economics and net premiums, but the top-line is down significantly on a gross basis.  Reinsurance net written premium including Logan was $870 million down 7% compared to Q2 last year. On a constant exchange ratio basis, our net written premium would be down roughly 4% due to increased retrocessional protections, including ILW purchases and other hedges to help us manage our peak zone PMLs. Our reinsurance book including Mt. Logan generated $206 million of underwriting profit in Q2, an 8% increase over last Q2.  These strong underwriting results despite both in increasingly tougher market and the loss events mentioned by Craig confirm our reinsurance strategy; leveraging our core strengths, expanding our product offering and increasing our opportunity set to achieve profitable growth. In addition, our utilization of alternative capital structures allows us to conservatively manage our net risk position while generating fee income and lowering our cost of capital. Under this strategy we have and will continue to effectively deploy our capital towards achieving some of the best risk adjusted returns in the industry.  At July 1st Mount Logan celebrated its two-year anniversary. We continue to see strong investor interest with inflows of approximately $80 million of new third-party investments this quarter, raising total funds in Logan to about $830 million. Logan remains core to our overall capital markets conversion strategy to hedge and manage risk across our overall portfolio and earned fees. To compliment this, we also secured more IOW protection heading into this hurricane season, mostly for Southeast USA and Florida Wind. With Mount Logan our cap bonds and IOWs, we maintained our conservative risk position with peak zone PMLs at 71, close to flat compared to 11 PML as a percentage of GAAP equity on a net after tax basis. Here is some color on June 01 and July 01 reinsurance renewals. Group-wide, our inforce property pro rata GWP is slightly down as we non renewed some treaties and some clients brought less pro rata or inverted their treaties to access of loss. Our worldwide property cat excess of loss gross written premium went up compared to prior periods, but there was more churn compared to other renewals. We cut capacity on non-renewed underpriced business, but we also added meaningful capacity on deals we like, particularly for long standing key clients. Our average dollar attachment on property treaties went up, as we deployed less capacity lower down and more capacity in higher layers, both in Florida and internationally. This typically consumes more capital, but has better margins. The end result of the mid-year renewals was our expected combined ratio is essentially flat compare to our expiring portfolio’s combined ratio. On a risk adjusted basis property pricing moderated and was off mid-single digits, although there were several regions around the globe that remained extremely competitive, including China, Australia, some parts of Latin America and U.S pack [ph] business. Other regions however provided opportunity due to a meaningful increase in demand. We therefore continue to build an attractive portfolio overall. On a dollar basis the expected dollar margin in the overall property book increased slightly compared to the expiring portfolio. Turning to our global casualty and longer tail reinsurance books, reinsurance terms continue to be under pressure for commodity type treaties and seeding commissions on casualty pro rata treaties remains high. Therefore, we deploy capacity to new products and new opportunities, to current and new distribution sources. We continue to receive preferential signing on attractive deal across both long tail and short tail business, and across geographies including the U.S, Latin America, Canada, London, Europe, Singapore and Bermuda markets. Due to our lead market position, financial strength, ratings and longstanding trading relationships with clients and brokers. Moving to our insurance operations our premium was $344 million in Q2, up 9% from Q2 last year. However, excluding Heartland, which was impacted by changes that delayed timing on premium recognition for 2015, insurance gross written premium is up approximately 20% for the second quarter and up 26% on a year to date basis. This growth is very diversified originating from over 10 separate insurance profit centers including newly launched product line resulting in a very balanced portfolio of both short and long tail lines. Year to date we are up 41% on what we describe as direct brokerage business which is underwritten internally by Everest underwriters. Program business is up 9% year to date. We expect these trends to continue as we focus on building out our retail books. Also noteworthy, the direct brokerage business has run to about 8 or 9 combined ratio points better than the program business over the last three years.  As Dom indicated, and you’ve seen from our recent press releases, we have been hiring key leaders in our insurance operations to build out this platform. We are also in the process of establishing a Lloyd syndicate. If approved by the Lloyd's franchise board, we will target an early 2016 launch. Lloyd's will provide access to international business and new products, diversifying our insurance portfolio. We expect that growth in our domestic and international insurance operations will accelerate over the next several quarters, as our new initiatives gain traction. Insurance rates are mixed with most long tail lines of business up expect financial institutions and management liability due to increased capacity and competition, and similar to reinsurance property rates are down in several segments. Bottom line our overall calendar quarter insurance results were disappointing in Q2, with a loss of $23 million driven by prior year development on the terminated Umbrella program mentioned by Craig. However, the underlying accident year results of our insurance book are profitable and improving both for the quarter and year to date, compared to the same period last year. Now with some detail on what we are seeing in each insurance market. For California workers comp, the gross written premium was about $80 million in Q2, relatively flat to last year with a mid-90s combined ratio and still getting positive rate. But that has slowed down with increased competition from a few players. Professional liability premium with financial institution is largest contributor was $55 million for Q2, up 23% compared to last Q2 with some attractive new opportunities. However, we see excess capacity and rate pressure here. Other cash related business is up approximately 22% driven by new initiatives. In the short tail business, including property, DIC, non-standard auto and contingency business, written premium was $84 million for the quarter, an increase over 26% from last Q2, as we've deployed more property insurance capacity. We remain bullish on the property facility in contingency businesses, but we see increased competition in the DIC book with lower rates and looser terms.  Accident and health premium was up over 35% in Q2, compared to last Q2 to approximately $30 million, benefiting from several new initiatives. Regarding Heartland, crop conditions are favorable and commodity prices are stable. To date it is running at a slight underwriting loss, partly due to the delayed recognition of earned premium. However, we anticipate positive results for the year if prices and weather hold.  In summary, we believe that our market position, core strengths, and sustainable competitive advantages, coupled with the new growth initiatives for the insurance book will propel bottom-line returns that are superior to most in our industry. We continue to execute successfully in this environment for both reinsurance and insurance. Thank you. And now back to Beth for Q&A. 
Beth Farrell: Jess, we’re open for questions at this time. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. It looks like we’ll take our first question from Sarah DeWitt from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. 
Sarah DeWitt : On the M&A that we've seen in the industry, could you just talk about what the implications are for Everest Re from a competitive standpoint as well as on the primary side, does that mean that insurers could perhaps purchase less reinsurance and what that would mean?
Dom Addesso: Sarah this is Dom. We answer that question basically in two sectors. First of on the reinsurance side, we don't necessarily see any major impacts from the M&A activity that are occurring today in that space due to us. As I’ve mentioned in previous call, we certainly feel we’re of sufficient scale and size to maintain a relevance in the market and with approximately $8 billion of capital we feel we’re operating in this market with $10 billion of capital and we managed to get the signings and operate with our clients in the areas that we would prefer to sale. So no meaningful impact that we can see from that.  On the primary side, the trend of acquisitions there and what that means to the reinsurance purchase, I think that’s just a continuing trend of as capital grows, the larger players in the marketplace have purchased less reinsurance over time. But frankly there are many participants in the market that certainly need reinsurance. And in addition to that, as these entities get larger, they generally look to larger partners and base partners I mean reinsurance partners. They will still continue to buy reinsurance but they’re more likely to look to partner up with larger and stable and meaningful companies. So that’s how we feel the impact of that. Does that answer your question?
Sarah DeWitt : And then if you were to look at acquisitions, what lines of businesses or geographies would you be interested in? Would it be more on the insurance side or in Lloyd’s to accelerate your growth strategy there? 
Dom Addesso: The only thing that we tend to pay more attention to in the M&A space when presented with a variety of opportunities tends to be on the insurance side. But again as I've mentioned in my comments, our natural preference is to build our own organization, that matches our risk appetite, avoiding the cultural and any legacy issues that could from an acquisition. We don't ignore them. But frankly given some of the premiums that are involved in some of these transactions relative to building our own platform, we don't see the value in the acquisition at this point. Doesn't mean it won't exist in the future but currently that’s not our focus. And we can't rely on that strategy. We can't rely on an acquisition strategy to further our insurance objective, or strategic objective in that space I should say. 
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. 
Kai Pan : Just first wanted to follow-up on Sarah's question on the industry consolidation. You sort of like Greenfield in the [indiscernible] and there is some news there is a large syndicate waiting to open to merger partners. Just can you talk little bit more about build versus acquire, and if you build out, would we expect at least initially higher expense as the teams run up?
Dom Addesso: Well, certainly there would be higher expense, but even in an acquisition with any amortizations of intangibles that you’d have to bare, we tend to feel that the expenses frankly would be more economical to build. And as we build and as we’ve been adding resources, we have been growing the top-line as well. So I don’t think you will see any meaningful degradation in our expense ratio. That’s really where we’re going.
Kai Pan : Okay. Would you just follow up or would you be interested in large scale acquisition in Lloyd’s syndicates or you prefer that goes through like a…
Dom Addesso: No, not at some of the prices that certainly have been bantered around in the press, no.
Kai Pan : Okay. That’s great. Then on the sort of large non-cat losses, could you quantify what is the impact for this quarter?
Craig Howie: Overall, Kai, this is Craig Howie. The overall losses are coming through our attritional loss pick and what we’ve had were losses that took place in April, May and June through Texas and the Mid-West. Also that’s coming through for the first half of the year are winter storms that took place in the North East. None of those storms rose to our $10 million Cat threshold but we have totaled those numbers to be almost $90 million to $100 million of losses.
Kai Pan : Is that including the Panamax or the offshore energy losses as well?
Craig Howie: That’s correct.
Kai Pan : Okay. That’s great. And lastly if I may ask on the capital management, it looks like the pace of buyback have been very slow compared with the earning stream. Your total payout ratio is less than 50%. Given that reinsurance space is slowing down in terms of capital needs, I just wonder, are you saving by capital for potential acquisitions or is it over the long run we’re expecting like a 50% like payout ratio.
Craig Howie: No, Kai as you know we don’t give guidance on our share repurchase program. I think what we tend to do is look this over the very long term, and we have returned a substantive amount of capital over the last 10 years to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We’d look at certainly the long-term objectives in terms of growth, and over the long-term we think clearly insurance and frankly for that matter reinsurance again over the very long term we feel that we can succeed in this space  So we have to balance that up against our objectives in terms of what we’d like to bring stock in at, and this is a long-term gain. So this past quarter based on what we saw as our future growth objectives balanced up against what the opportunities were to bring additional shares in, we opted to give $50 million this quarter and clearly over the long-term we remain committed to buying shares, consistent with whatever growth objectives that we might have.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Michael Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Michael Nannizzi : Quick question on just the reinsurance premiums, maybe [indiscernible], just the stuff that’s purely on your balance sheet. Do you have the constant dollar year-over-year change in net written premiums there?
Craig Howie: Just give us a second.
Michael Nannizzi : Sure, no problem.
Craig Howie: Year-to-date right, is you’re asking?
Michael Nannizzi : Just in the second quarter, if that okay.
John Doucette: Michael, its John. It’s a 5% decrease quarter-over-quarter. 
Michael Nannizzi : Great. Thank you. And then I guess first quarter I think we were sort of looking for a little bit more growth. Should we be thinking about this sort of as the level and just given the sort of challenges that you outlined in reinsurance, is there still an opportunity to grow your sort of piece of the pie here, or would you expect to continue to see areas where you will cut as a result of not meeting your profitability standards or the like. Just trying to get an idea of how we should be thinking about premium production on the reinsurance side here.
John Doucette: Yes, to all of it. And it’s interesting, because some are looking for growth, others are not looking for growth. Some are critical of growth. Some are critical of lack of growth. So it’s an interesting dynamic. And as each of us kind of mentioned in our prepared comments, there’s a number of things going on. So you’ve got FX, you’ve got less proportional business that met our pricing guidelines, you’ve got us moving up an attachment point, which lowers rate online. You’ve got more retrocessional protection that we purchased, which is up significantly year-over-year, all of that kind of leading to a lower net written premium growth. Interestingly on XOL basis we actually did have some growth in our portfolio, gross exit well premium. But again that was offset by some of the retrocessional protections we broker, all with an eye towards improving our net returns on capital as compared with our gross returns on capital. So we believe that we continue to make headway in being a larger presence in the marketplace and winning and gaining share from other market participants. But that doesn’t mean that we're also not paying attention to things that don’t need our return over hurdles. And I think I mentioned in last quarter's call that there are some things in Florida that will be backed away from, some writings, where others have put down large lines. It doesn’t mean that they are right and they’re wrong and we’re right. It just means that they didn’t quite meet our pricing objectives. So again we still continue to make headway in terms of growing our book, our margin. Our net margin is up year-over-year. It doesn’t mean there aren’t some headwinds in the marketplace, but we think we're doing quite well and we will continue to manage that way going forward, and at some point we certainly believe that there will be a turn in this market and we'll be well positioned to even take greater revenge of that than we are right now. 
Michael Nannizzi : Craig, you mentioned about nine points of underlying losses. So if I take that into consideration, does that mean that the sort of true underline actually improved year-over-year? So profitability is improving in reinsurance? The 90 million of non-cat large losses.
Craig Howie: On an overall basis I would say on a net basis we think that it's improving and that is the reason if you back out those $90 million to $100 million of losses yes.
John Doucette: Essentially our operating income on a year to date basis year-over-year is up. Yes, this quarter we had a number of things happen, some of which frankly were losses that we weren’t aware of that were winter losses for example that came from the first quarter that got reported to us in the second quarter. So to look at reinsurers results just on quarter by quarter sometimes could be a little bit misleading and so on a year to date basis we are up year-over-year. We think it's a quite a solid year to date so far. 
Michael Nannizzi : I guess one question would be, the great results, is there a need then for the market to change it all? Because it seems like at these profitability levels, that I don’t know how the conversations happen between insurers and reinsurers but it seems like these levels of profitability are pretty attractive.
Dom Addesso: Well, remember that it depends on scale, it depends on your expense ratio, and we've argued for a long, long time that we have a distinct advantage in the marketplace, given our not only our size and the signing that we can obtain, but also our expense ratio advantage, and our global diversified platform. So compared to many other market participants that don’t enjoy some of those advantages, you’ve seen already I believe and will probably continue to see some return drifting below as I mentioned again my comments below 9%. That doesn’t sound like a completely terribly robust market. And at the same time you see a few losses that come through hit the industry here in this quarter take a pretty good bite out of the apple. So it suggests that there isn’t much margin to handle the larger catastrophe. But notwithstanding all of that, we think we clearly have unique advantages which enable us to continue to expand our offerings. 
Michael Nannizzi : And then just one numbers question, the negative seeded premium in the international, I'm just trying to think about, should we be looking like the net written line as sort of a good base or starting point? Should we be looking at the gross written line and then assume like normal sessions occur from here. Just trying to sort of square that maybe if just there is some context in terms of what drove that negative number. And thank you all for all your answers.
John Doucette: That was really driven by one large strategic deal that we had done. It's better to look at the net written premium on the international book for that reason. That deal was restructured. So going forward it's at the same margin but the premium will be booked differently going forward. So more appropriate to look at the net written premium.
Dom Addesso: The growth though is still important in the sense of how we're utilizing the capital market opportunity. We have Tampa, Mount Logan, IOW. So again gross is you can't ignore it because that’s also indicating what our reach is into the marketplace. It just that this particular quarter given the adjustments made in some of those transactions that we talked about earlier, that distorted that historical relationship for just this quarter.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Amit Kumar from Macquarie. Please go ahead.
Amit Kumar : Two quick follow up questions on the discussion on capital. Number one, one question we were getting last night as it pretends to Everest Re is how does -- I guess the forthcoming changes or the upcoming changes to the ARR model, how does that impact your view on capital PMLs and how much of that is actually connected to the capital management pullback. 
Dom Addesso: None of that actually. We’re -- we don't expect any major change to the PMLs. No question there will be some change, there is ups and downs depending on the territories that you write in. And I’ll ask John if he has any additional thoughts but remember that our view of -- the risk positions that we talk about is essentially our view of risk. It is looking at all the markets, whether it's ARR RMS and frankly our own internal model. So to the extent that ARR is changing some of their calculations, it will have some impact but we do not expect it to be a meaningful impact. John, if there’s anything to add to that. 
John Doucette: Yes, just to follow-on that. So net, net we view this as a positive as this will be potentially an increase in demand, a push on demand for some of our clients and that would be good, but just following what Dom said, first we create our own view of risk. We've been spending a substantial amount of time and resources over the last six years or seven years building out Everest Re risk for all zones around the world, all perils, all return periods, and we use many, many things to input this and we’re continually enhancing our views of this and have it very smart capable team of people that are analyzing this around the group. And we think this is one of our core competitive advantages. And it allows us to take all the different inputs, not just the ARR but the other vendors as well as we've been trading for over 40 years in a lot of countries around the globe and so we look at our own results and look at the damageability against losses, we look at external, we look at academic studies that are done around the globe and all that rolls up to our view of risk.  So our view of risk is we’ll try to enhance it all the time, whether it's tied to ARR changing its results or somebody else or internal studies that we do and we’re always looking to enhance that, but net, net, we think this is a positive for us and positive upward on rating going forward. 
Amit Kumar : The other question for Dom, and this is sort of a follow-up to Sarah's and Kai's question. It seems that the market is more forgiving in terms of doing dilutive tangible book value deals and I'm curious, looking at that, has that changed your view in terms of how you might look at things going forward or not?
Dom Addesso: Not a bit. Market is more forgiving today. We’ll see would that turns out to be two years from now.
Amit Kumar : Got it. And final question…
Dom Addesso: We have to pay attention to here is how we feel we can best an economically and also given our strategies are, how we can best out our insurance platform. It doesn't mean that we’re -- we turned a blind eye to any kind of a transaction that might be presented to us. It’s just to date, as we look at the alternatives, our alternative looks a little better. 
Amit Kumar : The final question is on reserve adjustment. I think it was $31 million in run off book. Can you maybe give us a bit more color? How should we view the $31 versus against the size of that book? Can you put some ranges around it which give us comfort that there is not going to be possibly more noise or maybe just talk a bit more about this?
Craig Howie: This is Craig. This is was a claim review that was done on a run off program book of business for Umbrella. The company discontinued this book several years ago but the program has been running hot if you will. We've had reserve adjustments over the last two reserve study cycles. There were over 300 open claims reviewed. About 195 claims had adjustments. Some of them were down, most of them were up, obviously with respect to add any additional $31 million of prior year losses. We took into account some things like other cases and local and state labor laws when we were going through these claims. But relatively speaking this is $31 million. What we wanted to do was take this charge. The company reacts very quickly to unfavorable type development like this. But keep in mind this is $31 million on a $10 billion book of reserves. So it's a very small number. The rest of our reserves I'm very comfortable with the overall book and that continues around very favorably against our internal reserving monitoring metrics?
Dom Addesso: I would ask that everyone consider, as Craig emphasized it as part of $10 billion of reserves, and look at our track record of calendar year results or reserve development, it's quite strong. And again, as I said many times before, we have some 200 different reserve groups that we analyzed. This half we want subset of one of those and we’re going to get blips in any one of those different reserve groups from time-to-time. What’s most important is the integrity of the balance sheet, and I think we’ve demonstrated that our reserve position is quite strong. Our reserve triangles have been out. We’ve obviously released those over the couple of years. All the analysis on that indicates that it’s very positive and clearly our own internal metric suggests that as well. So I recognize that you certainly want to understand each segment of our business to properly project but I also ask that you consider the overall. 
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Josh Shanker of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Josh Shanker : Could we talk a little bit about fronting arrangements and changes in those and how we should think about seeding commissions going forward? Or I should say commission ratios?
Dom Addesso: Sure. Let’s talk about it, what is -- 
Josh Shanker : I see a big drop off in international premium and the uptick in acquisition expense ratio. I’m wondering if that’s one time in nature, how should we think about that going forward?
Dom Addesso: I’ll let Craig take that one.
Craig Howie: In the international book, as we’ve mentioned a couple of times, what’s driving that this quarter Josh is one strategic deal that we have done that changed this quarter for the year and going forward. So while the margin is the same, the premium has been booked differently on a gross basis. So therefore it’s probably more appropriate to look at it on a net basis for this quarter anyway. That will give you a better indication of how that is driving the current result.
Josh Shanker : And so if I think about going forward for the remainder of the year, is year-over-year the expense ratio higher it was a year ago.
Craig Howie: I don’t think the expense ratio will be significantly higher for acquisition costs even on an international book.
Josh Shanker : Okay. And so and thinking about 2Q, ’16, not that I’m asking for guidance or anything, but more interested in this deal, just one time in nature how it was booked this year and we think about next year we’ll be doing that again or have you discontinued the relationship or how does that all play in?
Craig Howie: We have not discontinued the relationship. There have been some law changes in Latin America with respect to how to treat these transactions going forward. So over the next five years we would expect these transactions to decline going forward but that will be over a longer period of time, over five years. 
Josh Shanker : And just next question, very subjective. You can answer it anyway you want. It’s about the industry. If you were prohibited from writing cat business for some reason just hypothetically, what do you think the combined ratio is in the reinsurance market for non-cat business today?
Craig Howie: Was an option there not to answer your question? 
Josh Shanker : Whatever you want? I trying to tease out, still you had a higher loss ratio, still very attractive in a non-cat quarter always hard to deduce what the real numbers are?
Dom Addesso: It’s -- I’m going to take a guess at it more than anything at this point, because part of the answer to that question, if that were the case, the whole marketplace will be within the different dynamic. So a transaction that you might do with clients might be done on a different basis but I think the answer to that question would be somewhere in the low 90s kind of a guess. Obviously you’ve got casualty business, you’ve got all of our facultative writings. You’ve got property per risk, you’ve got professional launch treaties, it’s a multitude of things. But the whole mix of the business would change, but I think what you’re really asking is what’s the rest of the portfolio kind of running at.
John Doucette : Josh, this is John. Just to add some more color to Dom’s answer, it very much would depend on book of business that we have and one of things that Everest has built very intentionally over the last 40 plus years is a very, very diversified book of business and we’re not a one trick pony type of property cat. We keep talking about these 200 plus IVNR [ph] deals. That means we had 200 different segments of business around the group, different lines of business and different geographies. So we’re always looking for profitable business and based on a combined ratio, ROE and other metrics that we look at. So I think it very much depends on what the opportunity set is. We feel very good about our opportunity set and we have for many, many years been a reinsurer in the Casualty market and we are capable to deploy as much capacity there as market conditions dictate place and we desire to given the market condition. We can flip from reinsurance to insurance. We have a lot of dials that we’ve talked about to the earnings call. But we trade in many, many different classes of business that there is margin and not just in the property cat space.
Josh Shanker : Well thank you for all the answers and let’s hope for quiet hurricane season. Take care.
Dom Addesso: I think we’re probably going go to go over a little bit because I think we do have time for at least for one more anyway.
Operator: We'll take our last question from Brian Meredith of UBS. Please go ahead.
Brian Meredith : Two questions here. First one, Craig, can you give us a sense of where new money yields are right now versus your current portfolio in new fixed income. We’re getting close to a bottom with respect to book yields.
Craig Howie: I would love to say that we are – but our new money is just over 2%. We don’t see a bottoming out until probably mid-2016.
Brian Meredith: And then the last question, on the Lloyd’s starts up here, a couple of Lloyd's -- guys in Lloyd's have kind of commented that the price competition at Lloyd's right now is equivalent to where we were back in 1999. So pretty darn competitive. I’m curious, why from a timing perspective now going into Lloyd given the competition.
Craig Howie: First of all, I think some of those comments were related to some very, very specific classes. And that’s number one. Those are not classes that we necessarily have on our radar screen, at least not in the near term. So -- and frankly, just like in our reinsurance lines, if the market is not giving us return, it meets our pricing metrics, then we won't write the business. We don’t necessarily will have the choice is to when we start these projects literally months and at least a year in advance, you have to kind of start thinking about how to get these things running. So you don’t have a choice in terms of timing sometimes. But you do have a choice in terms of what kind of business you put on the books and we will continue to maintain our underwriting discipline and underwriting culture, which will dictate the kind of business we write. And frankly the business plan that we have put forth we believe can generate a very nice underwriting margin for us. 
Operator: I will now turn it back over to the speakers for any closing remarks.
Dom Addesso: I will close it out just to say thanks for your interest. We went a little over today, but my apologies for that and thank you for your interest. Clearly within the industry there is certainly lots of headwinds. We think Everest has demonstrated that we have the scale and the talent to manage through that as I mentioned before, a positive underwriting result, positive operating results for the first half of the year and it’s really – it’s a long term business and we think we have to look at it on a six-month basis. And we think we've performed very, very well with a 15% return on capital. So thank you for your interest and we look forward to talking with you in the weeks and months ahead. 
Operator: And this does conclude your teleconference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.

Operator: Welcome to the First Quarter 2015 Earnings Call of Everest Re Group, Ltd. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Beth Farrell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Beth Farrell: Thanks, Ken. Good morning and welcome to Everest Re Group's First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. On the call with me today are Dom Addesso, the company's President and Chief Executive Officer; John Doucette, our Chief Underwriting Officer and Craig Howie, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I note that statements made during today's call which are forward-looking in nature, such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations and the like, are subject to various risks. As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations. Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements. Now let me turn the call over to Dom.
Dom Addesso: Thanks, Beth and good morning to all. We're pleased to report another excellent quarter; in fact, a record quarter in operating earnings as a result of a strong underwriting result. All segments of our business contributed positive margin in the underwriting account. Quarter-over-quarter, underwriting income was up slightly, even though the combined ratio slipped to 81.9% from 80%. This was a result of higher earned premium in this year's first quarter compared to last. The increase in the combined ratio was solely in the reinsurance segments, where competitive conditions are continuing to push rates lower and commissions higher. Nevertheless, we have maintained our margins with our strategies of first, moving our capacity to better price layers; two, diversifying our exposure; three, expanding capabilities in new lines of business; four, using capital markets outlets; and finally, maintaining an extremely competitive expense structure. Offsetting the increase in the reinsurance combined ratio was an improvement of over 2 points in the insurance combined ratio. This is due, in part, to a primary rate environment, while stable overall is increasing in certain classes. A more significant factor in this improvement has been the success of efforts over the last couple of years to wind down portions of the portfolio and reshape the insurance operation. The build out of new classes of business, along with expanding certain others, is beginning to pay dividends as growth quarter-over-quarter was 48%, reaching $340 million in 2015. We still have much more to do in this segment and we have bolstered our management and underwriting ranks so that we may continue the progress. In addition, we have embarked on a process to begin to build out our international insurance presence. Overall, while operating income was positively impacted by underwriting results, there were other factors contributing to the record results for the quarter. Foreign exchange negatively impacted our premiums written, but it had a positive impact on earnings as our foreign currency-denominated liabilities or loss reserves were converted to the stronger U.S. dollar. Also as Craig will explain, income taxes quarter-over-quarter were lower by $12 million. Investment income quarter-over-quarter was flat, but given where current yields are, we believe that to be a reasonable result and certainly not unexpected. Looking forward, the market will remain challenging as competitive pressures persist. Market movements are difficult to predict and therefore, we rely on our flexibility to respond accordingly and modify our tactics as appropriate. These include as I mentioned previously, nimbly shifting our capacity, seeking new business opportunities, using third party capital, buying in stock and staying expense-conscious. As a result, we have been able to maintain a strong ROE which, at 18%, is at a meaningful spread to the market. Consequently, we're uniquely well-positioned to manage through market weakness and therefore maintain returns above our cost of capital, while others may not. A market turn would seem inevitable, should it drift down to this level. Until then, we will maintain our competitive position and continue to be identified by clients, brokers and analysts as a core lead market reinsurer and meaningful trading partner. In fact, one rating agency recently cited Everest as one of four reinsurers best positioned to succeed despite the prevailing market conditions. This attribute is one that has been earned over the last several years as we have evolved our culture and the portfolio. New capital and operating income as a result of intelligent underwriting by our teams, has built our capital base to a size where we can deploy meaningful capacity. At the same time, while building towards $7.7 billion of equity plus third party capital of $1.7 billion, we have returned $3.5 billion of capital to shareholders since 2006. This is a record we're proud of and one that deserves the market's attention. Thank you and now to Craig for the financial report.
Craig Howie: Thank you, Dom and good morning, everyone. Everest had another strong quarter of earnings with after-tax operating income of $330 million or $7.34 per diluted common share for the first quarter of 2015. This compares to operating income of $281 million or $5.93 per share for the first quarter of 2014. Net income for the first quarter was $323 million or $7.19 per diluted share compared to $294 million or $6.21 per share in 2014. Net income includes realized capital gains or losses and represents an annualized return on equity of 18%. Solid underwriting results, sizeable foreign exchange gains and a lower income tax rate relative to the first quarter of 2014 contributed to these strong results. All segments reported underwriting gains for the quarter. Neither this year nor last year included any catastrophe losses in the first quarter. Total Reinsurance reported an underwriting gain of $205 million for the quarter compared to a $215 million underwriting gain last year. The Insurance segment reported an underwriting gain of $11 million for the quarter compared to an underwriting gain of $4 million last year. Each year reflected an underwriting loss for crop insurance in the first quarter, due to the seasonality of crop premium against a full quarter of expenses. The Mt. Logan Re segment reported a $21 million underwriting gain compared to a $10 million underwriting gain in the first quarter of 2014. Everest retained $5 million of income and $16 million was attributable to the non-controlling interests of this entity in 2015. The overall underwriting gain for the group was $237 million for the quarter compared to an underwriting gain of $228 million in the same period last year. Our reported combined ratio was 81.9% for the quarter compared to 80% in 2014. The overall current year attritional combined ratio of 82% was up from 80.4% at the first quarter of 2014 but equal to the 82% at year-end 2014. This measure excludes the impact of catastrophes, reinstatement premiums and prior period loss development. The first quarter commission ratio of 22% was slightly up from 21.5% in the first quarter of 2014, but remains stable compared to year-end 2014. Our low expense ratio of 4.6% continues to be a major competitive advantage for Everest. On reserves, our overall quarterly internal reserving metrics remained favorable. For investments, pretax investment income was $123 million for the quarter on our $17.8 billion investment portfolio. The investment income was essentially flat compared to one year ago. Despite the declining rates, our investment portfolio continues to perform well. The pretax yield on the overall portfolio was 2.9% with a duration of just under three years. The quarter reflected $7 million of net after-tax realized capital losses compared to $13 million of capital gains last year. These losses were mainly attributable to impairments on the fixed income portfolio in 2015. Foreign exchange is reported in other income. For the first quarter of 2015, foreign exchange gains were $47 million compared to $2 million of foreign exchange losses in the first quarter of 2014. This reflects the strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to other world currencies and equates to about $1 per share this quarter. There were $200,000 of derivative losses during the first quarter compared to $2 million of derivative losses last year. This is related to our equity put options and is mostly a function of the change in interest rates during the first quarter. On income taxes, the 12% effective tax rate on operating income is on the lower end of our expected range for the year. The low rate is primarily related to foreign exchange, the geographic region where the income was earned and higher foreign tax credits. Stable cash flow continues with operating cash flows of $455 million for the quarter compared to $367 million in the first quarter of 2014. Shareholders' equity for the group was $7.7 billion at the end of the first quarter, up $216 million from year-end of 2014. This is after taking into account capital return through $75 million of share buybacks and the $42 million of dividends paid in the first quarter of 2015. Book value per share increased 4% to $172.63 from $166.75 at year-end 2014. Our strong capital position leaves us with capacity to maximize our business opportunities as well as continue share repurchases. Thank you. Now John Doucette will provide the operations review.
John Doucette: Thank you, Craig. Good morning. As Dom highlighted, we have continued our trend with another favorable quarterly underwriting result starting off 2015 on a very strong footing. Our group gross written premium for Q1 2015 was $1.4 billion, up 12% from Q1 2014 with growth coming from segments within both our U.S. and international operations and from virtually every insurance profit center. This 12% growth would be 14% on a constant foreign exchange rate basis. Our group net written premium was $1.3 billion or $56 million -- up $56 million or 5% over Q1 2014. Starting with our reinsurance segment, I will cover underwriting results during the quarter, then provide color on major renewals, predominantly [indiscernible] including a discussion of the market and insights on ways we're navigating these challenging times. For our global reinsurance segments, including both total reinsurance and Logan, gross premium was $1.1 billion, up 4% or up 7% on a constant foreign exchange rate basis. Net reinsurance premium was $980 million, down 4% with increased sessions on our catastrophe business consistent with our retrocessional strategy. Our reinsurance book, including Mt. Logan, generated $226 million of underwriting profit in Q1 2015, a slight increase over Q1 2014. These strong underwriting results validate our reinsurance strategy which we have articulated for the last several quarters, leveraging our core sustainable strength, including global reach and comprehensive product offerings, expanding our opportunity set to capture profitable growth and utilizing additional capital structures to match risk with the most efficient form of capital while generating fee income. April 1 renewals represent approximately 10% of our reinsurance treaty premium. April 1 is a key renewal date for Japanese and other Asian business and for some Latin American and U.S. regional property business. The reinsurance market remains challenging with average market rates off between 5% and 15%, depending on the line of business, product type and territory. However, globally, large fires in Japan, Australia and other regions are consolidating their panels of reinsurers, focusing on a few core trading partners, including Everest. These sophisticated buyers are not focused strictly on price, but are also seeking stable, long-term relationships that can provide both meaningful capacity and comprehensive risk solutions. This benefits Everest as we gain preferential signings and in some cases, better than market pricing or terms, allowing us to sustain attractive risk adjusted returns. Conversely, regional clients around the globe are increasingly placing business locally, rather than just in global reinsurance hubs, especially in the current softening market. Everest's centralized view of risk with a decentralized distribution enables us to capture local market business. Individually, these deals are not always that large, but in the aggregate, this is sizeable premium for us and is more insulated from global competition. Our strong ratings, longstanding client and broker relationships, broadly diversified portfolio, efficient expense ratio, underwriting expertise and capital flexibility are critical elements for achieving better than market results. We continually optimize our portfolios which allows nimble deployment of capital to where risk-adjusted returns are best. At the same time, we're scaling back or declining deals that do not meet our return hurdle. Where accretive, we use alternative capital support. This flexible underwriting strategy has mitigated the impact of rate pressures. Mt. Logan continues to attract strong investor appetite with $60 million of new inflows from external investors at 4/1, bringing third party capital and Everest funds in Logan to about $750 million. Logan is one of the fastest growing convergence vehicles, highlighting Everest's ability to access and deploy third party capital and improve Everest's internal returns. Now, turning to our insurance operations. We wrote $340 million of insurance premium in Q1 2015, up 48% from last Q1, partially due to prior period negative premium adjustments in Heartland last Q1. Removing this, our insurance operations gross written premium for Q1 is up 32% quarter-over-quarter. Important to note, this growth is diversified and originating from 10 separate insurance profit centers in a deliberately constructed portfolio of short tail lines, long tail lines, regional and state-specific insurance portfolios. Now, some detail on the business composition and what we're seeing in each market. California workers comp, one of our largest segments of the insurance book, was almost $100 million in Q1, up over 20% compared to the prior Q1 and had a 94.3% combined ratio. Our renewal retention rate stayed relatively steady and pricing remains favorable with moderating rate. We continue to selectively add underwriting talent to support growth efforts throughout the state with recent additions to our Northern California team. Professional liability premium, largely financial institutions, was $45 million for Q1 2015, up 43% over the last Q1. The FI market is stabilizing after a year price decline and we captured several new opportunities while maintaining a high renewal retention rate and grew with selective expansion to other lines for FI; however, we remain cautious for commercial D&O as rate pressures are evident. Other casualty business, including our environmental and casualty facilities, was up 25% to approximately $40 million. Our direct facilities are ramping up with new agency appointments and increased staffing, resulting in increased submission and quote activity and driving new business growth. Renewal retention rates are about 80%. We're bullish on our opportunities in longer tail insurance line. Turning to short tail, including property, DIC and contingency business, written premium was $65 million, an increase over 60% from last Q1. Focused growth initiatives have been successful. We added offices and underwriters in Atlanta and Chicago to strategically grow and geographically diversify our property insurance book and we plan to further expand geographically. Specialty insurance group, our contingency business, has also expanded offices, hired underwriters and forged several new strategic partnerships. SIG products are highly complementary to other insurance product offerings, providing synergies across lines. DIC premium is flat as competition has lowered rates and relaxed terms; however, we will continue to adhere to our pricing targets and leverage our significant capacity to maintain our position. Non-standard auto grew over 25% to $26 million with rate increases over 5%. Our strategic partner, Arrowhead, is providing select geographic expansion opportunity. We're currently implementing predictive analytics to further enhance this portfolio. Accident and health premium was up in Q1 with submission and quote activity very high. Our future deal pipeline for A&H is strong and we anticipate continued growth throughout 2015. Regarding crop, we compare favorably to last year, due to prior period negative premium adjustments in 2014. While it is still too early to predict our final full year crop rating, we made several strategic hires and are seeing favorable year-over-year volatility factors. We also could benefit from disruption within several transitioning crop companies. Overall, the insurance segment ran to a 95.9% combined ratio for Q1, a 2.3% improvement over last year, with meaningful diverse top line growth. This demonstrates the success of the strategies to drive profitable growth that we have been communicating over the last several quarters. We continue to build on our strengthening insurance franchise through selective hires, both in the U.S. and international. We're bringing additional products to market, opening new distribution channels and enhancing existing ones. We're diversifying geographically as we bolster our relevance to our insurance customers and key distribution partners and provide meaningful solutions for their evolving need. In summary, we have made significant strides over the last couple of years to reposition our insurance operation as evidenced by the noted improvement in results. We're poised to take our insurance operations to the next level with our strong and dynamic insurance team. Reinsurance has long been Everest's tradition, but over the next several years, we will build an insurance operation that will complement our reinsurance franchise and strengthen and diversify the overall organization. Thank you and now back to Beth for Q & A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley.
Kai Pan: First question is on the recent catastrophe losses. Do you have any potential exposure in the Nepal earthquake, the terrible earthquake that happened and also any potential exposure from the riot at Baltimore?
Dom Addesso: In terms of Nepal, no. We have no material exposure, if any, there. In terms of Baltimore, I don't have an answer for that at this point. Certainly, there might be some risk exposure, individual risk exposure there, but I would not expect that to be material.
Kai Pan: And then on your insurance side, it looks like you're making tremendous progress out there. I just wonder is the 96%-ish combined ratio you have said in the past few years, basically ex some items, the underlying is really, ex-crop, has really run 95%-96%. Is that kind of still the target combined ratio for the insurance segment going forward?
Dom Addesso: The target combined ratio for the insurance segment would be lower than that and I would anticipate that we could continue to drive that combined ratio lower from here.
Kai Pan: Okay. My last question is on your capital management, it looks like you have record earnings for the quarter. The payout ratio is in the 30%s. And also if you look at first quarter last year, you had much larger buyback. I just wonder, given the market condition, do you think that the payout should be higher than you currently are paying out or are you looking for growth opportunities incurring both organic in the primary insurance area or potential acquisitions?
Dom Addesso: Yes to a couple of those questions. First of all, I think our share repurchase program, we look at our capital position over a very long time horizon. Certainly, we look to grow the business where we can profitably and I think, just as an example as we've mentioned in the prepared comments, we've returned almost $4 billion of capital to shareholders since 2006. Almost 40% of that, in terms of share repurchase, 40% of our shares have been repurchased since 2006, but it's over a long time horizon. During that time period, all of us, including yourselves, might recall that we have had certainly significant pressure to buy in more stock, certainly from the street. But what we have been able to do is balance that out between profitable growth and maintaining sufficient capital to expand the business profitably. I think we've demonstrated that we've been able to produce a quite respectable and superior return on equity by moving in that direction. To your question about going forward, given where the market is today, certainly if the market continues to slip further from here, we would be less optimistic about premium growth and perhaps push a little bit more in the share repurchase, but that is something that, again, we look at over the very long term. Our purchases of stock in the first quarter, frankly, we were in the market and really the stock just kept moving ahead of our price targets in the first quarter; otherwise, we likely would have purchased a little bit more. Again, we don't have any specific targets that we've communicated to the street nor do we intend to. Again, it's always looking at a balance between profitable growth and maintaining the right level of capital and those things will always be moving in tandem as we move forward in time. I hope that answers your question, Kai.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.
Michael Nannizzi: Just maybe follow-up a bit on the insurance book, just trying to -- as far as the growth that came from crop versus your other lines, I think, John, you kind of outlined some of the specific items, but I know the seasonality of crop is a little bit different. Just trying to think about how we should be looking at premiums for the rest of the year on an earned basis? Any context would be really helpful there, thanks.
Craig Howie: For the overall growth, Michael, the position that has come forth is from a whole bunch of different areas within that area and it's across the page. I don't have those numbers, specifically, in front of me.
Michael Nannizzi: Okay.
Dom Addesso: Michael, let's first recognize that the growth year-over-year, we had a premium adjustment last year that's kind of amplifying the percentage growth that we're seeing in that crop number. We won't know the actual premium number, but I wouldn't expect any huge increase year-over-year as we finish the year because a couple things are going on. We certainly do expect to expand. We have expanded our distribution. We're writing more business and geographically spreading with more agent and more territories, so that's a positive. Offsetting that, of course, will be the effects of pricing or the expected effect on premiums from commodity price declines, so that's a negative to the premium account. And then a positive will be as John mentioned in his comments, it was the volatility factor which could help premiums go up. So all that being said, we're not providing a prediction on the premium, but that gives you some flavor of the factors that will affect the premium.
Michael Nannizzi: I guess just trying to understand a little bit more in some of those target areas. Is it because Everest is able to be more tactical in finding opportunities that you're able to grow and grow at attractive levels of profitability? Just because some of our other companies are more focused on optimizing retained books and we just haven't seen elevated growth. So I'm just trying to understand or maybe you can give me an example of, if possible, opportunities where you're able to kind of pick off new business in this sort of low to mid 90s range, if weather conditions or there's some displacement in those target areas? Thanks.
Dom Addesso: Is that a question on the insurance operation or reinsurance operation?
Michael Nannizzi: Mostly on the insurance, just because we had the big growth and the underlying was a couple points better than we had, for example.
Dom Addesso: Well first of all, excluding the impact of crop, I think the number would be insurance premium growth probably in the low 30s.
Craig Howie:  Yes, 32.
Dom Addesso: So let's recognize that first of all. Second, there are markets that others aren't in. So California comp is one example where we continue to grow and that's not something that the rest of the industry is, more broadly speaking, has been a factor in. We've got a very good position in that marketplace, so we're able to grow that. Same thing would apply with respect to California DIC. Again, given our appetite predominantly as a reinsurer, that's a risk that we feel nicely fits into our balance sheet where, with many primary companies, it may not. The same thing would apply to our property E&S operation which is certainly very strong up and down the Northeast Coast or in the East, I should say, up and down the entire Eastern seaboard. So a lot of companies and distribution partners look to place their property exposure with A+ carriers, so that's is certainly a reason why we're growing. Same thing would apply in the excess casualty area. Remember that these are not, today, huge businesses but again, distribution partners looking for A+, large balance sheet partners, that's very helpful. Then finally, in the contingency space, the hiring of a new team in a specialty niche, again, something that we have built up some unique expertise in and not everybody is in it. Same thing could apply to A&H. You could go down each business that we're involved in as John mentioned and you could look to a unique offering that we've made to the marketplace, a unique appetite that others may not have and a strong balance sheet. These are all things that are attractive to distribution partners.
Michael Nannizzi: I see. So in some of these insurance lines, so your rating and your sort of unique appetite, those are differentiators that allow you to see business and buying business that may be better than peer profitability?
Dom Addesso: That's correct.
Michael Nannizzi: Okay and then one question, Craig, if I could, one more here on the FX impact on the revaluation reserves. I was just trying to understand, should we be thinking about that relative to premiums or thinking about that relative to asset marks that run through AOCI, because I was just looking at that. We had a bigger markdown on assets in the fourth quarter and then we had a smaller revaluation reserve and then no real impact on AOCI this quarter relative to last, but then we had the FX impact on reserves. I was trying to get an idea, should I be thinking about those two next to each other or should I be thinking about more of the reserves relative to the impact of FX on premiums? Thanks.
Craig Howie: Michael, it is more relative to the reserves, but overall, I think we've mentioned this before, but we try to maintain an economic neutral position with respect to foreign exchange; so essentially matching those assets within the local jurisdiction to the same currency in each jurisdiction.  What you have is a mark-to-market type adjustment here at a point in the balance sheet which is causing what's flowing through the income statement. That's the $47 million gain that you see in other income, other expense lines. Offsetting that are foreign exchange losses that you just mentioned coming through OCI. So on an overall basis, it's almost completely neutral from a book value standpoint for the quarter.
Michael Nannizzi: Okay, so the AOCI that we see on the balance sheet, that includes the investment marks and FX and then, but the investment marks were more than the FX headwind, so that obscured that $46 million we would have seen on the asset side?
Craig Howie: That's correct Michael.
Dom Addesso: That means, Michael, in reverse, to the extent the currency reversed in course, then you'd get the opposite effect, right? Craig has highlighted, it's economic, neutral to book value essentially.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.
Josh Shanker: My first question regards to Kilimanjaro and trying to understand the structure. In the event of a loss that triggers Kilimanjaro, does Mt. Logan also receive protection under the Kilimanjaro umbrella or is it just the Everest Re book?
John Doucette: It would just be Everest Re that gets the protection under Kilimanjaro.
Josh Shanker: That also does not include your equity participation -- your equity participation in Mt. Logan is under their terms as well?
John Doucette: If I understand your question correctly, Everest's participation as an investment in Mt. Logan stands pari passu with the investors in Mt. Logan.
Josh Shanker: And so now we're through April 1 renewals, obviously into the big Atlantic CAT wind renewal, but the -- I was sort of wondering, when you think about the investors' appetite for third part capital, now that's a big renewal, is there more room for Mt. Logan or a similar vehicle to grow in this environment?
John Doucette: Josh, we really can't comment on other vehicles.
Josh Shanker: I'm saying Everest, does Everest's possible third party participation stand to grow I guess? Is the appetite for the market broadly out there for more third party capital participation at current prices?
John Doucette: Well, we can answer the question tied to Mt. Logan and Everest and the answer is yes. We have investors, we've been building our investor base in terms of number of investors. We have investors that have been looking at it for a long time and a lot of them it's a slow process in terms of getting comfortable with the underwriting, the team, the analytics, the portfolio, the construction, the value proposition that we put forth. But ultimately, we feel bullish that will continue as we feel we have built a meaningful and significant and differentiating proposition for third party capital. So yes, we expect to continue to have increased appetite into Mount Logan.
Josh Shanker: And does it -- equally in the sort of 15% kind of return characteristic business and the 6% type of return in characteristic or is the demand more so in one area of the market than the other?
John Doucette: It very much depends on the investor and what their risk profile is, what their return mandates or targets are and what their overall investment philosophy is. So it really depends on which investor and which type of investor invests and wants to put money to work in Mt. Logan.
Josh Shanker: Sorry about all of the Logan questions, I'm always learning. Do you need both kinds of investors for Mt. Logan to be really successful? Do you need someone to take the severity risk and someone to take the frequency risk or can you grow one pool without growing another?
John Doucette: What we've been doing -- Mt. Logan is a core strategic part of Everest capital management and property catastrophe management and we will have this for many years to come, but it also is not the only thing we do. You mentioned Kilimanjaro cat bonds, so we balance across the cat bonds, traditional reinsurance protection, traditional retrocessional protections, ILWs and Mt. Logan and the combination of those suite of hedges and cat management structures gets Everest to what we're comfortable with in terms of a net catastrophe PML position.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Meyer Shields with KBW.
Meyer Shields: Two quick reserve questions, if I can, first, Gallagher was discussing the TPA business and they noted close to 5% existing client claim increases year-over-year. Are you seeing that sort of trend in California workers comp where there's a slight in claims frequency?
Dom Addesso: Was that a frequency trend that they saw or a severity trend?
Meyer Shields: That was frequency.
Dom Addesso: I can't say that we have seen that, no. Not that kind of trend.
Meyer Shields: Is there anything going on in the severity side?
Dom Addesso: That has not been what we've seen over the last couple of years. It's been relatively, I don't want to say benign, but it's consistently emerging in the manner that we predicted it would in our loss reserve and process.
Meyer Shields: Broadly speaking, when you look internationally and your writing business outside the United States and you've got these currencies weakening against the United States, does that translate into a higher required loss trend? In other words, do you have to have higher inflation in those other regions?
Dom Addesso: Not per se. certainly, a lot of what we do overseas is first party cover, cat exposed cover, so it's less casualty-focused and more property-focused. If you think about global demand, U.S. obviously being the most casualty intensive place in the globe and of course, second behind that would be Europe, but no, not particularly noticing any. We're not fearful of any particularly troublesome inflationary trend, no.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Brian Meredith with UBS.
Brian Meredith: A couple questions here for you guys. The first one, Craig, was there any FX impact on the investment income or the fixed income investment income in the quarter or is this decline solely related to the lower yields?
Craig Howie: So in the investment piece, would actually come through OCI, Brian.
Brian Meredith: Okay.
Craig Howie: So that's reflected in the number down below the line.
Brian Meredith: So nothing would come by? So that's purely just lower investment yields in the quarter, the 6% decline in the fixed income. Okay. Second question, just on the cat losses, once again, there was a couple of European windstorms kind of at the end of the quarter that fell into the second quarter. Was there any exposure there and can you tell us if those were booked, if you had any exposure in the first quarter?
Dom Addesso: We don't anticipate anything at this point. We're not anticipating any losses getting into our cat, what we could consider a catastrophe. And we classify a catastrophe as above $10 million. It doesn't mean we won't have losses, but at this point, it's looking as if that would -- any of those events would be below $10 million.
Brian Meredith: Got you. So they're going to be relatively modest, got you. Dom, have you seen any impact or seen any business yet from this kind of M&A wave going on right now in the reinsurance industry or if you're going to see it, when do you expect you might see that, some of the spillover?
Dom Addesso: Well, you see it in a few pockets. I mean, I would not say that it's, at this point, it's a huge impact. You do see it in terms of human capital as well, though. There's certainly more chatter in the marketplace about that and that -- it would take many months for it to have any material impact, for sure.
Brian Meredith: So that's what we should be looking for is like teams of people leaving and that could indicate the movement of business?
Dom Addesso: That would be one factor. It doesn't mean, necessarily, that we or anyone else, frankly, would be picking up teams because we think we have, certainly, the resources to underwrite that business. I'm just saying that could be a factor, maybe not for us, but certainly it could be for others.
Brian Meredith: And then just lastly, any kind of early thoughts on what you think the Florida renewals are going to look like?
Dom Addesso: Well certainly, there will be pressure on the Florida renewals. There was some pressure on what we thought was the appropriate premium base for the cat fund. In fact, we put out a fairly big line on the cat fund and we ended up not, our rate was not accepted and as a consequence, we took a very tiny line. So if that's any indication, it's possible that the market could start to fall below what our pricing metrics would be. And by the way, just to give some context to all of that, for us, even though we're obviously listed as one of the largest writers in Florida, a lot of that is pro rata premium. Our excess of plus loss premium for the Florida only companies now which would represent the June and July renewals, because we do have other Florida exposure coming from nationals and other sources that have different ex-dates, but our XOL business in Florida is approximately $150 million. So any rate movement that you think about needs to be thought about in the context of that premium base.
John Doucette: And just to add a little more color, we're not sure what's going to happen as we head into June 1 and July renewals, but we do feel very comfortable that we're positioned well to execute our plan how it happens, where it happens. Again, moving as we've talked about to go back the last couple of years, we've moved between pro rata and cat very easily. Risk, we moved from Florida-specific to nationwide covers and super regional covers, in terms of deploying more or less relative capacity as we look at those. We write property insurance in Florida. We write reinsurance. We write retrocessional protections, we write purple. So we have the act to access Florida exposure in many different ways and we take advantage of that. We also have the ability to hedge and manage the net PML in many different ways as 
Dom Addesso: That's a great point that John makes. One offsetting factor to what I've described as potential rate pressures, at least with obviously, the first client that's come to market, large client, is that there is also some evidence that there will be increased demand coming from the market. So that could dampen any of the rate pressures that we're all fearful of. But we will see as the market evolves, but as John described, we have many different levers to pull and many ways to access profitable business.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Amit Kumar with Macquarie.
Amit Kumar: Just maybe two quick follow-up questions, the first question maybe goes back to Meyer's question. Is the California comp book still running at an AOI LR of the mid-90s or has there been any shift in that?
Craig Howie: Yes, that book is still running in the mid-90s. Amit, this is Craig. We feel as though we're seeing exactly what we expected to come out from a reserving perspective. Those metrics are still running well as well, so that book continues to perform as we would expect.
Amit Kumar: Got it. I guess just going back to Brian's question, in your opening remarks, you were talking about I guess how insurance will complement reinsurance and you're talking about the franchise. You talked about the other opportunity, but how does M&A factor in into this picture or are you more on the sidelines right now?
Dom Addesso: When you say how does this factor into what picture, Amit?
Amit Kumar: In terms of a strategy and if you look at the list of companies out there who might be looking for a buyer?
Dom Addesso: Well, Amit, first of all, we'd look at many things and we've looked at many things over the last couple of years. So it's not that M&A is not something that we don't consider but clearly as we've looked at many different things over the last couple of years, we've ultimately determined that the path that we're on relative to what the other opportunities have been was the best path, meaning to build our own platform, continue to build out our talent, build it one brick at a time, so you know what you have. It doesn't preclude looking at properties that might be a better fit or allow you to get to a place faster than you otherwise would, but of course, that's all relative to pricing as well. So none of those things are off the table but clearly, we have as we've gone through the strategy time and time again, we've opted to continue to grow by building it one brick at a time. If something comes along that's a terrific fit, then we will consider that for sure. But right now, we think been able to build the right platform on our own.
Operator: And we'll take a follow-up question from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.
Michael Nannizzi: Just a couple quick ones here, if I could. One thing I had a question was the tax rate, Craig. I thought normally like when the cats were lower, the tax rate would be higher, just because you had more profitability maybe in the U.S.. Was there something else inside that tax rate and how should we be thinking about that part?
Craig Howie: Michael, the way that the tax is calculated is based on a full year annualized tax rate. It's an effective tax rate for the year, so in essence, we still have catastrophes planned for the remainder of the year in our plan so that's what goes into calculating the tax. If in fact, we didn't have catastrophes like we've had in past years, that tax rate will inch up because you'll have higher taxable income and have to pay higher taxes. But at this point in the year, it's on the lower end of our range because of the fact that we still have three quarters of catastrophes planned for the remainder of the year.
Michael Nannizzi: And then on the international reinsurance segment, you mentioned some fires, I think in the prepared comments. How much -- could we quantify how much the one-timer-type stuff impacted the underlying there or was it significant? Maybe it wasn't, I don't know?
Craig Howie: For this year, those numbers are not significant from the standpoint of reaching the level of a catastrophe loss. In other words, it was several fires or several losses that fell below that $10 million threshold that we have for catastrophe losses. But the number, the amount of those fires added up to about $40 million so far this year. Last year, that number was substantially higher which is the reason that we increased our loss estimate selection for the international segment back in the third quarter of 2014. We continue to keep that loss selection a little bit higher as we go through the year, just because of these types of losses.
Michael Nannizzi: And then just last one if I could, just thinking about the cats being a little bit lower, we get a little benefit tailwind from taxes, the FX item. How do you think about the current ROE relative to your own cost of capital, just given your own historical context and how you're thinking about results at this point? Thanks.
Dom Addesso: Well, clearly at an 18% ROE, we're well above our cost of capital, so I don't know that's necessarily a pressing issue. Even though this may not be answering your question directly, Michael and if it's not please follow-up, but we have as I said, an 18% ROE. We benefit of course, from light cat years, but certainly, so does the rest of the market. If you take our expected cat load which we think about as like 12 points, combined ratio points, that's about 6 points of ROE. And even at that level, we're well above our cost of capital and clearly, we're outperforming the market. Frankly, even after that cat load, I would almost argue that we're outperforming the market even if you put that number in, comparing to the rest of the market with no cats. So we're not bumping into or getting close to, even at those levels, to our cost of capital. The point I made in my opening comments was that it seems to me that as an industry, we're getting pretty close to that, but we're not there yet and not even there. But so that should have some, you would think, it would have some impact on pricing.
Dom Addesso: Okay. So I think we're done with the questions. I don't think there is anyone left there with a question, so let me just thank everybody. In closing, I would like to emphasize our underlying core results are strong, both in the reinsurance and in our insurance segments. As I said clearly, we benefit from light cat years, but again even with an expected cat load, we're still very much outperforming the market. And this frankly is a result of portfolio diversification and an effective use of capital both internal and external as we've kind of highlighted on this call and frankly in conversations we've had with many of you, previously. So I would like to thank you all for your participation on the call and look forward to speaking with many of you in the weeks ahead. Have a great day. Thank you.
Operator: And that does conclude today's conference call. We appreciate your participation.

===== 2014 Q4  (2015-02-05 10:30:00) =====
Executives: Beth Farrell - Vice President, Investor Relations Dom Addesso - President and Chief Executive Officer John Doucette - Executive Vice President and Chief Underwriting Officer Craig Howie - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Analysts: Amit Kumar - Macquarie Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Vinay Misquith - Evercore Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank
Operator: Good day, everyone, welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2014 earnings call of Everest Re Group Limited. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over Ms. Beth Farrell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Beth Farrell: Thank you, Kelly. Good morning, and welcome to Everest Re Group's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2014 Earnings Conference Call. On the call with me today are Dom Addesso, the company's President and Chief Executive Officer; John Doucette, our Chief Underwriting Officer; and Craig Howie, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I note that statements made during today's call, which are forward-looking in nature, such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations and alike are subject to various risks. As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations. Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements. Now, let me turn the call over to Dom.
Dom Addesso: Thanks, Beth. Good morning. We are very pleased to report record operating earnings for the year and quarter. Net income was slightly below that in 2013 due mainly to less realized gains on investments. However, as a result of share buybacks net income on an earnings per share basis was higher year-over-year at just under $26 per share. Most of our areas of our operations had excellent results which contributed to the overall result. The reinsurance segments continue to be the main engine and another good year was posted with the absence of many cats. The underwriting result was flatting year-over-year and while the combined ratio slipped two points, the portfolio was still generating above average returns. This slippage and combined ratio points will be discussed in great detail by Craig and John but a couple of general factors accounted for this increase. These would include the business mix shift and in our international operations a higher attritional loss ratio due to shock losses and storm losses not classified as cats. Declining rates overall are also a factor but we have muted much of that by moving attachment points to more attractively priced layers and buying external reinsurance in the capital markets and from traditional providers. The flexibility and adaptability to the market has been one of our point, in fact in many cases due to our capital structure which effectively includes Mount Logan and our sponsored [indiscernible]. We have the ability to put out more capacity with the same or less net peak zone P&L exposure and better risk-adjusted returns. Overall, the net returns on the cap portfolio in 2-14 were higher than the gross returns due to efficient capital management with the purchase of third-party reinsurance. As a result, the absolute margins on our property portfolio on an expected basis were up despite an annual expected loss from tax of approximately 12 points on our underwriting combined ratio. This resulted in an increase in the ROE in this business as we deployed our aggregate across the more diversified portfolio rather than expanding net exposures in any of our peak zones. One of the few challenges in the portfolio last year was our crop book which suffered $64 million on loss, primarily due to a severe commodity price decline, which accounted for $36 million. But the remainder coming mostly from crop hail losses. Over the past couple of years, the industry has suffered a bit in this class but over the longer term it has been a good business. The crop division caused our insurance operations to incur an underwriting loss for the year. However, the improvement in the balance of the book has been notable. Excluding crop, the insurance operation produced an underwriting profit of $15 million. On an [indiscernible] basis that portfolio was now running around at 95% combined ratio. This has been a good turnaround story. Worker’s comp continues to benefit from rate increases in our growth initiatives and property and casualty ENS lines and speciality lines are all contributing to premium growth and profit.  Among other notable items in the quarter was the adjustment in our various reserve positions. Overall, the impact from reserves was minimal but yet favorable. We did add approximately $140 million to our [indiscernible] reserve enabling us to increase our survival ratio to its historical levels. It had recently dropped due to an increased level of payment activity during year. This area is difficult to estimate but we felt that prudent to increase the reserves to be a more conservative position. Other reserve adjustments were in the insurance segment for run-off lines. These various charges, however, had no meaningful net impact on results due to redundancies in other areas. Overall, a very sound reserve position with a track record of favorable access New Year development in each of the last ten plus years.  Investment income continues to trend downward due to low rates in the fixed-income markets. However the fourth quarter was a bit stronger than earlier quarters due to limited partnership income in our alternative asset category. We have no immediate plans to make significant shifts in our allocations so with these interest-rate levels, we should expect the downward trend in book yield to continue into 2016. The impact on net investment income of declining yield will be somewhat offset by any increase in investable assets. The rate of premium growth into 2015 will likely slow the decline reinsurance price environment and are increasing selectivity. However, we continue with new products in the reinsurance segments and our insurance segment will continue to be an area of great [indiscernible]. Of note is that more than half of our expected underwriting profit after consideration for normalized catastrophe losses is derived from non-cat expose business These other lines of business have therefore been an important area to focus as mitigated rate pressures as well as providing for a more diversified portfolio. Share buybacks continued in the fourth quarter, as well as an increase in our dividend. Capital return to shareholders totaled almost $650 million in 2014. Nevertheless, equity capital increased $500 million dollars during the year which gives us capacity for growth opportunities during 2015 and beyond. Given the market conditions ahead, we would expect to continue share repurchases in 2015. Since 2006, we have repurchased 36% of outstanding shares and returned $3.4 billion of capital and at the same time through equity of 46% from $5 billion to $7 billion. The level of share purchases in the future will of course be dependent on business opportunities. We remain committed to finding profitable growth through new initiatives and increasing our returns from capital alternatives. Our responsive, flexible and adaptive style will no doubt continue to create opportunities in the year ahead. Thank you and now to Craig for the financial report.
Craig Howie: Thank you, Dom and good morning, everyone. Everest start another strong quarter earning with net income of $340 million or $7.47 per diluted common share. This compares to net income of $365 million dollars or $7.54 per share for the fourth quarter of 2014. Net income includes realized capital gains and losses. For the year, Everest had net income of $1.2 billion dollars or $25.91 per share compared to $1.3 billion or $25.44 per share in 2013. The 2014 result represents a return on equity of 17%. Operating income for the year was $1.1 billion or $24.71 per share. This represents a 15% increase over operating income of $21.47 per share last year. These record operating results were driven by a strong underwriting result, foreign exchange gains and lower income taxes compared to 2013. The increase in underwriting income was partially offset by a lower derivative result and lower net investment income compared to 2013. The results reflect a slight increase in the overall current year attritional combined ratio of 82%, up from 81% last year. This measure excludes the impact of catastrophes, reinstatement premiums and prior-period loss developments. All reinsurance segments reported underwriting gains for the quarter and for the year. Total reinsurance reported in underwriting gain of $275 million for the quarter compared to $390 million dollars underwriting gain last year. For the year, total reinsurance reported in underwriting gain of $862 million compared to an $877 million gain last year. The insurance segment reported an underwriting loss of $36 million for the quarter compared to a loss of $156 [ph] million last year. For the year, the insurance segment reported an underwriting loss of $49 million compared to a loss of $147 million in 2013. The 2014 results reflected a crop loss of $64 million for the year, comparable to last year, but lower prior period loss reserve development in the insurance segment. The Mt. Logan Re segment reported a $26 million dollars underwriting gain from the quarter compared to $4 million underwriting gain for the same period last year. For the year, Mt. Logan reported an underwriting gain of $73 million compared to a $9 million gain in 2013. Everest retained $14 million of the underwriting income and $59 million was attributable to the non-controlling interests of this entity in 2014. The overall underwriting gain for the group was $265 million for the quarter compared to an underwriting gain of $238 million for the same period last year. For 2014, the underwriting gain was $887 million compared to a gain of $739 million in 2013. These results reflect $15 dollars of current catastrophe losses in the fourth quarter of 2014, related to the Brisbane, Australia hail storms. This compares to $30 million of cats during the fourth quarter of 2013. The fourth quarter of 2014 also included favorable development on prior year cap losses, primarily from Sandy losses in 2012. For the year catastrophe losses were $62 million in 2014 compared to $195 million in 2013. Our reported combined ratio was 82.8% for the year 2014 compared to 84.5% in 2013. The 2014 commission ratio of 22.0 was slightly up from 20.6% in 2013 primarily due to higher contingent commissions on several years of profitable results. Our expense ratio remains low at 4.6% for the year compared to 5.0% in 2013. Everest has one of the lowest internal expense ratios in the industry. We believe each point of lower expense ratio translates to about a half point of hire ROE. This is truly a strategic competitive advantage for Everest. On reserves, we completed our annual loss reserve studies. The results of the studies indicated that the overall reserves remain adequate. In the fourth quarter, we booked prior year development in the insurance segment and for asbestos which was more than offset by favorable development in the reinsurance segment. The $20 million dollars of prior year reserve development in the insurance segment during the quarter was largely related to construction liability and umbrella business. These run-off programs were discontinued by the company several years ago. The $30 million of favorable prior-year development in the reinsurance segments reflects $167 million of favorable development. This was offset by $137 million increase in asbestos reserves. The asbestos charge can be split into two components. First, the reserves associated with the company’s assumed reinsurance business were strengthened by $100 million after completing our normal exposure analysis. In part to bring the survival ratio more in line with our historical trend. Second, the asbestos reserves related to Mt. McKinley's direct insurance business were increased by $37 million. Everest has entered into a letter of intent to transfer the Mt. McKinley asbestos reserves to another company. The proposed transaction indicated $37 million dollars of funding would be required for the other company to assume the liabilities, so no additional increase will be needed should the transfer be completed. The $167 million of reinsurance favorable development, mostly related to treat the casualty and treaty property business both in the United States and internationally. These redundancies have developed over time but we don't react until the position becomes more mature. We continue to hold our estimates for the more recent years. For investments, pre-tax investment income was $134 million for the quarter and $531 million for the year, a $17.4 billion investment at total. Investment income was below last year as anticipated. This result was primarily driven by the low-interest environment and the decline in limited partnership income. Also, the cash flow used for share buybacks and the redemption of debt contributed to this lower income. The pre-tax yield on the overall portfolio was 3.2% as compared to 3.5% in 2013. Limited partnership income was down $6 million year-over-year. However, our diversified investment strategy enabled us to exceed our planned investment income for the year. The increased allocation to equities was also a benefit to net income, as the year reflected $55 million of net after-tax realized capital gains compared to $197 million last year. These gains are mainly attributable to the fair value adjustments on the equity portfolio. A derivative loss of $60 [ph] million was recorded in the fourth quarter reflecting a change in the estimated valuation of our equity index put option contracts to include a better estimate for expected future dividends. This change resulted in cumulative catch up loss adjustments over the seven open option contracts. On income taxes, the 2014 operating income effective tax rate was 12.2%. This 12.2% effective tax rate for the year was in line with our expectations for a year with much lower than planned cap losses and the addition of foreign tax credits utilized.  Strong cash flow continues with operating cash flows of $1.3 billion for the year compared to $1.1 billion in 2013. This is primarily due to our premium growth and lower catastrophe lost payments Shareholder’s equity for the group was $7.5 billion at the end of 2014, up 7% compared to the $7 billion balance at year-end 2013. This is after taking into account capital return for $500 million of share buybacks and $146 million of dividends paid in 2014. The company announced the 27% increase to its regular quarterly dividend and paid $0.95 per share in the fourth quarter. Additionally, we repurchased another $36 million of stock after the year end close. These purchases will be reflected in the first quarter 2015 financial statements. Book value per share increased 14% to $166.75 from $146.57 at year-end 2013. Our strong capital balance positions us well for potential business opportunities as well as continue share repurchases. Thank you. And now John Doucette will provide the operations review.
John Doucette: Thank you, Greg. Good morning. As Dom highlighted we had a strong Q4 finishing a very successfully year. Our group gross written premium for Q4 was 1.4 billion up 7% from Q4 in 2013 with the growth coming from all reinsurance segments. Our group net written premium was $1.3 billion which was up $40 million or 3% over Q4 2013. For the full year, our group wide 2014 premium was 5.75 billion up 530 million of 10% from 2013. Our group net written premium was 5.26 billion up 250 million or 5%. Let me start with our reinsurance segment. I will focus more on the full year results for 2014 then turned to our January first renewals to give you some color on what we are seeing in the market and some themes as to how we are navigating it. For our global reinsurance segments including both Total Reinsurance and Logan, gross premium was $4.5 billion up 15% with growth coming predominantly from our U.S. and international reinsurance segments. Net premiums were $4.2 billion up 7% as we continue to pursue our retrocession strategy to lay off some of our catastrophe exposure and lower our cost of capital. Our reinsurance book including Mt. Logan generated $935 million of underwriting profit, a 5% improvement compared to 2013. These results highlight the success of the initiatives we have put in place over the last couple of years to achieve profitable, reinsurance growth, including the introduction of several new reinsurance products such as Purple Everest Color Product. Deploying increased capacity to pro-rata deal where we saw attractive original pricing terms and conditions. Pursuing new credit related opportunities to various territory, developing new strategic relationships across the globe with several key reinsurance clients, increasing line capacity on several attractively priced property catastrophe treaties aided by Mt. Logan Logan. Developing increased penetration and breath of our international faculty of book, growing our regional footprint and leveraging our competitive strength to become reinsurer on various treaties in multiple countries allowing us to drive terms and conditions. These initiatives have broadened and enhanced both our broker and client relationships which in turn has provided new opportunities to expand our writings, whether it is on new program or layers or larger shares of existing treaties with our long-standing clients and despite a challenging rate environment, we achieved profitable growth as evidenced by the results of 2014. So what are we say in for 2015? Certainly it continues to be a challenging market with rate offs between 5% and 15% depending on the line of business and territory but having said that we were able to achieve better than market results, given our rating, long-standing client and broker relationships, broadly diversified portfolio and our underwriting diligent and flexibility. We take an objective view of each deal at renewal and will scale back or non-renew deals we do not like and redeploy capacity to deal in layers which we find to be better priced. This mitigated the downward impact on our portfolio. Let me provide you a bit more color on January first reinsurance renewals in which we wrote about $2.1 billion of treaty premium which represents approximately 45% of our annual reinsurance treaty premiums. Catastrophe excess of loss business represented roughly 25% of this renewal. This is an important point that you have all heard market participants expound on the double-digit rate decline in this sector while we are not immune to these pressures, 75% of our renewal was in line outside of property cat excess of loss which speaks to the diversity of our portfolio and a mitigate to just following the general market down. We also have Mt. Logan which provides efficient capacity to support this line. We continue to see robust, ongoing investor appetite for the Everest Logan value proposition highlighted by Logan's best in class, risk-adjusted returns to investors. As of 01/01/2015 we raised approximately $270 million of additional funds and Logan now stand at about $690 million dollars of assets under management and 100% of Logan’s capacity was fully deployed at the 1/1 renewal. During 2014, Logan generated approximately twenty eight million dollars of earnings for Everest, including fees. Property related and short tail business outside of catastrophe excess of loss represented another 50% of the renewal writings and while much of this has a cat component, it is balanced by risk premium. Putting up larger capacity on short-tail deals we like, and in general moving up attachments on property excess of loss players soften the impact of some of the rate reduction. Our 1:1 [ph] cat-expose premium saw a couple of points of deterioration in the combined ratio but both are expected cat premium and dollar cap margins are approximately flat compared to last year, USA rates held up pretty well but we saw more competition this renewal in Latin America, Canada, and China. Rates in Europe were also under pressure. For Purple, we saw some undisciplined competition in that space so we redeployed some capacity away from purple to some of our long-standing [indiscernible] clients. Overall, we did see three point drop in our expected ROE at this 1:1, one a worldwide property actual book as the deal that many of the clients are now buying are more capital intensive. We believe this highlight and validates our property retrocessional strategy with the increased use of Logan, Kilimanjaro issuing $950 million of cap on and other non-traditional and traditional sessions to manage our net cat PMLs and lower our cost to capital. As a result of these strategies, our net ROE continues to be greater than our gross ROE on our worldwide property cat book. Casually remains challenging, especially pro-rata due to demands for expanded terms and conditions. As a result, we continue to withdraw from some contracts, move from quota share excess loss and deploy capacity at higher layers on others. We saw a new opportunity that at 1:1, outside of the mainstream that meaningfully added to our top line. This includes a large motor, quota share in Europe, a large international professional liability quote share, increased lines for some of our global client that were only offered to Everest and surplus relief deals that were not widely marketed too many reinsurers. These new deal offset some of the premium from the quota share deal and excess of loss deals which we non-renewed at 1:1 2015. Four themes helped us this 1:1. Number one, we have one of the lowest internal expense ratios in the industry with our total reinsurance segment carrying only a 2.9% expense ratio. Therefore, we get more dollars of margin and a higher ROE on the same premium than others do. Number two: we are more diversified than most of our competitors, we use our capital across more zone and perils and that naturally lowers our internal cost of capital. Number three: the retrocessional strategy of Logan, Kilimanjaro Cat on, IOWs and other traditional and non-traditional sessions lowers our cost of capital further. And number four: our reinsurance operational structure is another sustainable competitive advantage. Everett has one view of risk around the globe but we deploy capacity to our clients by senior lead market experienced underwriting team in a decentralized fashion and empower those teams to make decisions. This allows us to know our customers very well and move quicker and in scale better and faster than our competitors who write only few lines of business or who right out of one, only one or two offices. Across all classes on a constant foreign exchange basis, our gross reinsurance premium at 01/01/2015 was approximately flat compared to last 01/01. Our net reinsurance premium declined by about 2% this one 01/01 as we reassured more of our book with the growth in Mt. Logan at UM and the capacity provided by the Kilimanjaro caps on. In addition to increase use of other traditional reinsurance to effectively protect our net position. We are to be the outcome of our 1:1 renewal despite market condition and expect 2015 to be another, strong year for our reinsurance book. Being innovative and providing ideas and solutions to our clients as well as our ability to execute quickly and incise it is now more important than ever. Our focus on new business opportunities, new products, new distribution sources and leveraging our competitive strength remains key to our underwriting success. With our balance sheet, ratings and ability to nimbly deploy both rated capacity and unrated capacity inside the support our business, we have more tools in our toolkit to compete and win against non-traditional capacity as well as other traditional reinsurers. Now turning to our insurance operations, we wrote $300 million of insurance premium in the fourth quarter and wrote $1.2 billion for the year for both the quarter and the full year that is down about 5% compared to the same period last year but removing crop insurance both the quarter and the full year are up approximately 10% in premium with growth coming from each large insurance units. The insurance growth initiatives that we have put in place over the last couple of years have been providing benefits to the top and bottom line, these include staffing up underwriting operation and expanding both the relationship, both property and casualty, increasing our property insurance geographic footprint, driving international insurance expansion, including growing our existing Canadian platform and building out new product distribution and strategic relationships within our specialty insurance operation both in the U.S. and internationally. The insurance calendar year results [indiscernible] lost due to our crop results which is consistent with what we've been discussing on prior earnings calls. Excluding crop, our insurance operation ran to a $50 million underwriting profit. This was almost a 100 million dollar improvement in underwriting results year-over-year. Our crop insurance book had an underwriting loss of $22 million in Q4 resulting in a calendar year underwriting loss of $64 million in 2014. These results were driven by four issues: lower commodity prices during 2014 particularly for corn, below average result in Minnesota, our largest state and typically are most profitable, significant losses and crop hail due to an unusual number of hailstorms throughout the Midwest, higher expenses associated with new technology and IT initiatives. We anticipate improved underwriting results in our crop book in 2015 with a larger, more diverse book of business and increased operating efficiencies derived from an updated systems infrastructure. In other lines of business in terms of rates, we continue to see rate increases in her California workers comp book of about 7% but the rate increases have slowed as more competition is coming to that space. General liability was up about 7% for the quarter. Professional liability rates were down about 5% and property insurance rates were also down about 5%. As before we continue to roll out many new insurance and reinsurance products in 2015, we are hopeful for meaningful growth in our insurance operations as we capitalized on opportunistic expansion both geographically and cross product lines. Thank you and now back to Beth for Q&A.
Beth Farrell: Yes Kelly, we are open now for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] we have our first question from Amit Kumar from Macquarie. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Amit Kumar: Congrats on the quarter. Just a few clarification type of questions. Number one, just going back to the discussion on Mount McKinley. How much -- what's the size of the reserve status being shipped off from that?
Dom Addesso: Now McKinley is about $150 million in reserves that would be transfer.
Amit Kumar: And that’s in Q1?
Dom Addesso: Well, we don't know when the transaction will close. We have to go through all the regulatory approvals and things like that but I would suggest that it probably would be the beginning of Q2.
Amit Kumar: Okay, that's helpful. The other question I had was on, this goes back to the discussion on renewals, and thank you for the expanded commentary this quarter. In terms of some of the new opportunities which you talk but I think you mentioned a motor quota share and a large international account, do you have some sense of, why was it shifted to you and how did it perform previously. I am just trying to get a sense why it was non-renewed by the previous reinsurer.
Dom Addesso: I am not sure Amit that we can really get into that level of detail relative to prior are reinsurance, in some cases it might not be into the transaction that it had been in the market. A number of these deals that John has went through, are surplus driven or financially driven transactions and probably they do have transferring them of course but it's capital relief type products in some cases and in another cases it is helpful companies as they have managed their capital at various subsidiaries around the world. So they are all different. Why is Everest the company of choice? Some of things that John mentioned, I think are important to us. I think in community at large, I think we hope that we're viewed as an innovative market and the market that is quick to respond, flat organizational structure so that any significant transaction can quickly get to John's desk or my desk if it needs that level of approval and strong writing and the global footprint. Now those are all reasons that we have been emphasizing and that's what we found as why are a market of choice in many of these unique transactions.
Amit Kumar: I guess what I was trying to figure out is and I am just a bit surprised that you have had these opportunities for few quarters. And I'm just trying to figure out if it's a size issue why some of your peer companies have not been able to capitalize and find similar opportunities.
Dom Addesso: It's hard to generalize. I do think in parts, it’s the size issue, it could be a ratings issue, it could be the fact that these are not the types of transactions that this company has shown an interest and had a risk appetite for. It's hard for me to explain what the reason might be.
Amit Kumar: Okay. And just finally, any change in the buyback philosophy versus as it relates to your discussion on premiums, should we anticipate that to be any different versus what we've seen in the past. Thank you. 
Dom Addesso: I think what I've tried to emphasize in my comments was that we bought back a significant return to significant amount of capital in the several years. I would anticipate that we continue to do that given the current market conditions but obviously if the market changes, then change direction on how much capital would it return. So I don’t anticipate any major change at this point. This is what I think be the short answer to your question.
Amit Kumar: Got it, thanks for the answer and good luck for the future.
Dom Addesso: Thank you, Amit.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open please go ahead.
Michael Nannizzi: Thanks, just a couple of here if I could. The expense ratio in international reinsurance in Bermuda in particular lifted in the fourth quarter. Was there something that happened that was kind of fourth quarter-specific in particular in Bermuda, or maybe there was some other driver. Thanks.
Craig Howie: In the fourth quarter, we typically had compensation related accruals at year-end and I hope you recall. Again, we had a record quarter of results in the fourth quarter as well. 
Michael Nannizzi: Okay but even with the year-over-year comps and the fourth quarter of the last year was pretty good too. So that's all just incremental comp that we should be thinking about, and it's just specifically in Bermuda?
Craig Howie: No, the majority of it is, where you are seeing it may be even in total segments, compared to third quarter into fourth quarter.
Dom Addesso: Michael I wouldn’t look too much into individual segments because each of those are subject to individual accruals and year-end adjustments. I think the main topic is the overall group and the difference in the fourth quarter was what Craig specified which was predominantly compensation adjustments as relates to putting them on with our year-end results. So the individual segments can be, [indiscernible] of factors that are local.
Michael Nannizzi: Okay, great. Thanks. And then, Dom, you mentioned the net ROE versus the, I am sorry John mentioned the net versus gross ROE. Just trying to understand, I imagine that includes the difference is in part Mt. Logan because you seed some business to Mt. Logan. So just trying to understand the relationship over the ROE at Mt. Logan versus the ROE at Everest
John Doucette: Good morning, Michael this is John. We have talking about this for several quarters that there is difference by having rated and unrated capacity, there is different constraints to different capital requirements and it is not just cost to capital but it is also that there is different ROE for a rated company is impacted by how rating agency think of the capital that you need to hold to support the businesses and so it gives us the ability to find right fit for business but dealing across the portfolio, Logan is very critical for that but it is also part of a broader strategy than involved the cap on and other traditional sessions that we have and it allows us to kind of and also within Mt. Logan we have different investor appetites, low-risk, medium risk, high risk that results and lower return, medium return and high return and having that combination gives us a lot more flexibility to be able to deliver the most value for our client and have the best in that position for Everest.
Michael Nannizzi: Okay and then Dom, I think you had mentioned, in your opening remarks that cat business represents about half of the underlying profit or of the profit on a run-rate basis, I guess, when you adjust for model cats. Can you share what was that percentage in 2014 on an actual basis? Do we have that?
Dom Addesso: The number is probably somewhere between $300 million and $400 million of underwriting profit, non-cat.
Michael Nannizzi: Okay, got it. Great. Thanks. And then last one if I could sneak one more in. I think John, you mentioned last quarter that you were seeing some 20% return opportunities in, I think, somewhere more on the financial side in terms of those types of transactions. Just would love an update on that, is there still an opportunity to generate that level of return in that part of the portfolio? And thanks so much for all the answers.
John Doucette: The short answer is yes. We continue to see you and again we have been talking about this for a while, not just do we have a large balance sheet and high rating but we also a have a lot of underwriting expertise bringing, underwriting, accounting tax, legal contract wording and an actuarial and brining that all to the mix and solving client’s client need and creating some run-off structures and we continue to look for those and I think in general we think the more, it's less commodity with plain vanilla that seems to be under more pricing pressure to having the ability to execute kind of multijurisdictional insurance, reinsurance combination deal give us the ability to really solve client’s problems and use a lot of the different competitive advantage that we have and we continue to think that there's a lot of our runway for that.
Michael Nannizzi: Great. Thank you so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vinay Misquith from Evercore. Your line is open, please go ahead.
Vinay Misquith: Good morning, the first question is on the increase of the combined ratio for next year, that's 2015. You talked about, I think, a couple of points increasing the combined ratio from the cat business. So was just curious as to -- so when you shake it all together for the other lines of business because pricing is down. Where do you see it sort of coming out to?
Dom Addesso: What was the last part of that...
Vinay Misquith: So for the cat business, I believe you said that the combined ratio would increase maybe about a couple of points for the cat business. I was wondering also for the non-cat business. So if we shake it all together for the Company as a whole on the reinsurance side, how many points of an increase on the combined ratio do you think you got of the January 1 renewals?
Dom Addesso: you are really leaning us more towards giving earnings areas guidance which we really try not to do. I think, we expect, let me say this way, we expect our insurance operations combined ratio to improve, I am not really going to give any guidance on what that expected combined ratios would be in the insurance portfolio. On the reinsurance portfolio, a lot of that is dependent upon the types of transactions that we see. Certainly we will strive to maintain the combined ratio targets that we have been accustom to. And that will likely mean that some of the transactions that we were on in ’14 will probably not renew and they will look for other types of transactions. As John mentioned, we are doing some new product -- expanded our capabilities into the credit area and a lot of that reinsurance we expect to run it better combined ratios than are traditional reinsurance book. So part of it is dependent upon the mix of and that's the best answer that I can give you at this point.
Vinay Misquith: Sure. Fair enough. And on the cat business, you said that it's going to be about a couple of points higher, but pricing seems to be a lot lower. I was just wondering what the difference is -- the difference, the retro that you guys are buying. 
John Doucette: No the retro really is the capital issue. The combined ratio on a gross – those were gross basis comments and what it did, a lot of that again and we keep trying to articulate as to the ability to move between product between layers, between clients to redeploy capacity from one product segment to another as we try to utilize the cat capacity that we are willing to deploy at any renewal and really be able to move seamlessly between that and one example is within our treaty property department. it's the same team that writes so lot of risk, cat and retro and that having the ability to dynamically allocate capacity to help where the client needs are and where we think the best pricing is as well as moving up and down attachment points within the layer and ask again, we think because of our market position we have the ability to get more defining in the layers want and that really helps drive what you're seeing.
Vinay Misquith: Sure. So it's a mix issue besides the pricing...
Dom Addesso: The mix influences the combined ratio of them.
Vinay Misquith: Sure, sure. Fair enough. Then just the 50,000-foot view, we've seen a lot of M&A in the industry. You guys are about an $8 billion market cap Company. Curious about your thoughts on M&A.
Dom Addesso: What thoughts and what regard?
Vinay Misquith: Are you interested in combining with others, do you think your size is large enough that you don't need to and also, do you think you're going to get some more opportunities if you guys don't combine and the others do. Do you see some more opportunities within the industry for your premiums?
Dom Addesso: I think we have emphasizing our scale and diversity for some time. So obviously I think it has been communicating that we think we have sufficient scale, so we don’t really see that necessity, urgency for combinations. Others, others may view it differently but I think in essence what you're seeing in the marketplace in that regard somewhat validates one what would be have been the adverse advantage. So that's what I will say about that. In terms of the combinations and what it needs to the marketplace in general, it all depends on execution. Many times these combinations can be disruptive. Maybe they won't be. We will see, they can affect market, they can affect shares of programs with the teams of people. There's always some churn that will occur as the result of any kind of merger in any industry so time will tell and we will see how that will evolve over the months ahead. Perhaps it creates opportunities, perhaps not. But I will say is that in some regards, this could be good for the industry in the sense that perhaps some of the capital does come out of the business and creates further discipline. So that could be a good outcome, some of these combinations.
Vinay Misquith: Fair enough. And then just really on Mt. Logan Re, so it appears you guys have increased capital by maybe 60% because you raised about $270 million more. Correct? So would it be fair to assume that the premiums also would be up a similar amount because you've already deployed all the capital as of 1/1?
John Doucette: Yes, we would expect there to be a some increase in the [indiscernible] to Logan. 
Vinay Misquith: Okay, alright. Thank you.
Dom Addesso: Vinay, one more thought relative to your side question. Keep in mind as you mentioned $8 million market cap company, we are also adding the Logan piece and the sponsor cat also we have, so essentially you can almost argue that they were operating more like $10 billion capitalized company.
Vinay Misquith: Fair enough, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank 
Josh Shanker: Good morning, everyone. I think you made a very compelling case about your expense advantage compared to your competitors on this call this morning. I don't know if that translates necessarily to the insurance business, though. Why is Everest better in the insurance businesses than their peers? And we've seen some variable results from different reporters of crop insurance. Why have your results been weak this year while some others haven't seen such weakness? 
Dom Addesso: I will let John talk about the crop piece because I think he include some of those points in his prepared remarks but let me just perhaps admit that I don't know that we are better than the industry on the insurance side. Our comment about the expense ratio was a reinsurance company and why were they getting superior returns, there.
John Doucette: Okay, go ahead Dom and then we will come back.
Dom Addesso: So in terms of crop insurance, we have a great team at Heartland but we know that we need to grow that book, we need to diversify the book. A lot of it is fixed expenses, those high fixed expenses and if infrastructure and systems. And so we know that—so in all a lot of things we are talking about what were going on. The reinsurance side. We are trying to do that with various books including the Heartland Corp Book. And we would expect that with the better geographic footprint than we have a bigger and better geographic footprint will give us more diversification, more better risk-adjusted returns, that allows to economics to scale and I think some of the competitors may buy quota shares, we do not and bipolar shares as then they get an override from the reinsurers and that may be impacting their expense ratio as well.
John Doucette: We have some work to do there but again to remind you that significant portion of the crop lost from Crop Hill and they are not just NPCI.
Josh Shanker: That's a great answer. And then coming back, if you are not necessarily better than your peers in the insurance business, does it make sense to you to continue in that business? I'm not telling you have to sell it or anything. But when you think longer-term, might it be worth more to somebody else than it is to you?
Dom Addesso: Right now, we think it is a good diversifier for a platform, you have the ability to deliver we think again because of the diversification fact, he greater ROE is also a source of business and for us into any capital markets that we talked about earlier as well, so we do hear again when we talk about our net ROE being the gross ROE. There is an opportunity to leverage that as well. So for the time being we think that the diversification and access to risk being able to build out that platform is important to the future of the Everest.
John Doucette: We spent a lot of time looking at the trends and we know buy each other business units that we have in the trends available. We've been growing up footprint whether it’s A&H operation, the safe operation, our property facilities around the group, the workers comp, BFI and professional teams the casual and environmental teams. The trends have been favorable and we are going to continue to extract to keep those teams support and capacity and help them grow their footprint and help them get an economy as the scale. Additional we can commonly use the scale and leverage again, the financial strength rating and an ability to execute that Everest pride itself there.
Dom Addesso: The enforced portfolio, is a little bit great results for us now we recognize what have had over the last couple of years and drag from discontinued books of business and obviously as you can tell from this year been, that has been greatly diminished and so we think it’s a bright future there.
Josh Shanker: Well, congratulations. Certainly a great year overall.
Dom Addesso: Thank you, Josh.
Operator: At this time I would like to turn the call back over to Mrs. Beth Farrell for closing remarks. I will turn the call over to Dom Addesso for closing remarks.
Dom Addesso: Thank you and thank you from participating in today’s call. Now we talk, today we continue to emphasize about our competitive advantages which have yielded above market returns. These are a competitive manager of global franchise and scale, diversified portfolio, we have talented staff and as we mentioned very competitive expense ratio. Market conditions are difficult to trend is difficult but we have proven our ability to deliver superior results. They are certainly many areas to be cautious about but also there is lot more to do. And we thank you for your continued interest. Have a good day.
Operator: This conclude your teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2014 Q3  (2014-10-23 10:30:00) =====
Executives: Elizabeth Farrell - Vice President, Investor Relations Dominic Addesso - President and Chief Executive Officer John Doucette - Executive Vice President and Chief Underwriting Officer Craig Howie - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Analysts: Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Amit Kumar - Macquarie Jay Gelb - Barclays Vinay Misquith - Evercore Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley Meyer Shields - KBW
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the third quarter 2014 earnings call of Everest Re Group Limited. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over Ms. Beth Farrell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Elizabeth Farrell: Thank you, Kim. Good morning, and welcome to Everest Re Group's third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. On the call with me today are Dom Addesso, the company's President and Chief Executive Officer; John Doucette, our Chief Underwriting Officer; and Craig Howie, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I note that statements made during today's call, which are forward-looking in nature, such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations and alike are subject to various risks. As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations. Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements. Now, let me turn the call over to Dom.
Dominic Addesso: Thanks, Beth. Good morning. We are pleased to report another very strong quarter. Operating earnings per share of $6.12 is 46% above the prior year's third quarter. And on a year-to-date basis the $17.46 of operating earnings is 15% above the prior year pace. These operating results produced an operating ROE of 16%. The lower level of cat losses versus last year in both the quarter and the year-to-date numbers was undoubtedly a contributor. However, it is important to highlight the fact that the attritional results remain quite strong. The underwriting income on a year-to-date basis excluding cats has risen to $697 million from $665 million in the prior year. This is a result of portfolio management, which includes diversification both by product and geography; shifts between pro rata and excessive loss; new products; changing attachment points to focus on the best priced layers; and finally, use of outside reinsurance to various capital market platforms, including our own, to achieve better risk adjusted returns. Another factor, but not in consequential, is a disciplined expense culture. Our expense ratio amongst the lowest in the industry improve year-over-year. Maintaining a firm grip on expenses will enable us to withstand the impact of any market softening, but more importantly enables us to entertain business opportunities at levels which are still accretive to or perhaps not to others. One other contributing factor to the results for the quarter was an increase in investment income over previous quarters, due to timing on some of our limited partnership investments. Nevertheless, as maybe obvious, investment income will continue to drift lower, as older investment years mature and funds get invested at today's interest rate levels. We have deployed a number of alternative asset strategies to blunt this. And while they have worked well, we are getting close to our asset risk appetite, as defined by our capital position. Regarding operational highlights, our best performing and largest segment continues to be our U.S. Reinsurance operation, with a reported combined ratio of 72.6% this year. Our International Reinsurance segment, while typically an excellent performer and still quite profitable, is down relative to last year. Most of the cats and other smaller events, now classified as cats, have been occurring in regions outside the U.S. These will include events like the Chile earthquake that occurred in the second quarter and Hurricane Odile in Mexico this quarter among others. Nevertheless, the combined ratio on a year-to-date basis still stands at an 88 for this segment. Our insurance operation had an underwriting loss for the quarter, due solely to our U.S. crop business, which again is having a difficult year because of commodity prices and hailstorm events. Excluding this portfolio, the remainder continues to improve in profitability and growth, with 5 points of underwriting margin and 12% growth in the topline. This growth is a combination of rate increases as well as success in our business expansion efforts in E&S lines and specialty classes of business. John will give further details on the operations, but we are well-positioned in each of our units to achieve return superior to the industry. While it is still uncertain what pricing will be at the next upcoming renewal season, we have thought through the various scenarios and will adapt, depending on conditions at that time. Each of these strategies is with an eye towards maintaining the return levels we have been accustomed to through the cycle. These strategies include reducing business in certain areas, introducing new products, utilizing capital markets, expense control and managing capital levels through share repurchases. Our strong and sizable capital position along with our underwriting talent, allows us the flexibility and market presence to be a significant factor in the marketplace. For this position of strength, we can continue to find the best opportunities and provide above average risk adjusted returns, despite what many see as market challenges. Thank you. And now, Craig will give you the financial report.
Craig Howie: Thank you, Dom, and good morning, everyone. Everest had another very strong quarter of earnings with net income of $275 million or $6 per diluted common share. This compares to net income of $235 million or $4.81 per share for the third quarter of 2013. Net income includes realized capital gains and losses. On a year-to-date basis, net income was $859 million or $18.47 per share compared to $895 million or $17.94 per share in 2013. The 2014 result represents an annualized return on equity of 17%. Operating income year-to-date was $812 million or $17.46 per share. This represents a 15% increase over operating income of $15.22 per share last year. These operating results were driven by a strong underwriting result and lower income taxes compared to the first nine months of 2013. The results reflect a slight increase in the overall current year attritional combined ratio of 81.9%, up from 81.1% for the same period last year. This measure excludes the impact of catastrophes, reinstatement premiums and prior-period loss developments. Gross written premiums of $4.3 billion on a year-to-date basis were up 11% compared to the same period last year. All Reinsurance segments reported underwriting gains for the quarter and on a year-to-date basis. Total reinsurance reported an underwriting gain of $588 million for the first nine months of 2014 compared to a $487 million gain last year, an increase of 21%. The Insurance segment reported an underwriting loss of $13 million on year-to-date basis compared to a gain of $9 million in 2013. The 2014 results reflected a crop loss $42 million for the year, which included estimates to reflect the decline in corn commodity prices and losses related to hailstorms this quarter. The Mt. Logan Re segment reported an underwriting gain of $28 million for the quarter and a $47 million gain year-to-date. Everest retained $5 million of this income and $42 million was attributable to the non-controlling interest of this entity. This compares to $1 million that Everest retained year-to-date last year. The overall underwriting gain for the group was $622 million on a year-to-date basis compared to a gain of $500 million for the same period last year, an increase of 24%. These overall results reflect $30 million of current year catastrophe losses in the third quarter of 2014 compared to $75 million of cats during the third quarter of 2013. On a year-to-date basis, catastrophe losses were $75 million in 2014 compared to $165 million in 2013. Of the $30 million total for the quarter, $20 million related to Hurricane Odile on the Baja peninsula, and we included an additional $10 million for the second quarter earthquake in Chile, now a total of $25 million for that event. Our reported combined ratio was 83.7% for the first nine months of 2014 compared to 85.6% in 2013. The year-to-date commission ratio of 21.5% was slightly up from 20.9% in 2013, primarily due to higher contingent commissions. Our expense ratio remains low at 4.6% on a year-to-date basis. For investments, pre-tax investment income was $142 million for the quarter and $397 million year-to-date on our $17.6 billion investment portfolio. Investment income year-to-date declined $26 million from one-year ago. This decrease is primarily driven by the decline in limited partnership income and by the low interest rate environment. Also, the capital used for share buybacks and redemption of debt contributed. Limited partnership income is down $16 million year-over-year. The pre-tax yield on the overall portfolio was 3.2% as compared to 3.6% last year. Duration has moved from 3.2 years to 3 years. The first nine months reflected $47 million of net after-tax realized capital gains compared to $136 million of gains last year. These gains are mainly attributable to the fair value adjustments on the equity portfolio. There were $4 million of derivative gains during the first nine months of 2014 compared to $33 million of gains in 2013. This is related to our equity put options and is a function of the change in interest rates and indices this year. On income taxes, the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by additional foreign tax credits utilized in the quarter, relating to both the 2013 and 2014 tax years. The year-to-date operating income effective tax rate decreased from 14.4% in the second quarter to 12.3%. A 12% to 14% effective tax rate for the year is in line with our expectations, given our planned cat losses for the remainder of the year. Strong cash flow continues with operating cash flows of $926 million for the first nine months of 2014 compared to $825 million in 2013. This is primarily due to lower catastrophe loss payments. Shareholders equity at the end of the quarter was $7.4 billion, up $414 million or 6% over yearend 2013. This is after taking into account capital return through $400 million of share buybacks and $103 million of dividends paid in the first nine months of 2014, representing a total return of capital to our shareholders of over $500 million so far this year. Book value per share increased 11% to $163.14 from $146.57 at yearend 2013. Our continued strong capital balance positions us well for potential business opportunities as well as continuing stock repurchases. Thank you. And now, John Doucette will provide the operations review.
John Doucette: Thank you, Craig. Good morning. As Dom highlighted, we are pleased with our continuing strong results in the third quarter of 2014. Our group gross written premium was $1.67 billion, up $200 million or 14% from Q3 of last year, with growth coming predominantly from the U.S. and International Reinsurance segment. Our net written premium was $1.52 billion, which was up $128 million or 9% over Q3 last year. For our global reinsurance segments, including both total reinsurance and Logan, gross written premium was $1.3 billion for the quarter, up 19.5% from Q3 last year. Our growth in the third quarter was driven by new business opportunities both in the U.S. and internationally, in both cat and non-cat risk related deals. We wrote several new U.S.A. property pro rata deals. We took over as the lead reinsurer on one major international treaty, which was significant new business and new premium to us. And we also wrote several new specialty deals. In addition, during the quarter, we closed several significant reinsurance deals, many of which have not yet been recognized in our earned premium, but will flow through in the next several quarters. Examples of these include: a new large non-cat exposed risk deal for an international client; the extension of several strategic deals with global clients; a new large reinsurance treaty covering a highly diversified international professional liability book of business; and new alternative risk reinsurance deals that provide a variety of risk coverages. As we've been highlighting for the last several quarters, we believe that we are successfully navigating this choppy market. This is despite market headwinds for several classes of business, including a declining rate environment in many lines, higher client retentions and new and different types of competitors in this space. We have and will continue to grow the franchise profitably, make meaningful underwriting profits and build long-term shareholder value. Our competitive strength enable us to achieve these goals. We have the size, geographic scope and breadth, and the longstanding broker and client relationships over the last 50 years to be one of the few top reinsurers of choice. We have then and will continue to exploit this sustainable competitive advantage, by providing to our partners a highly-rated lead reinsurer with very seasoned lead market underwriting teams that can respond quickly and creatively, to deploy meaningful capacity in any class of P&C business around the world. We continue to build strategic relationships with our clients and to enter distribution relationships with key brokers, and find new sources of distribution and revenue from both new clients and new products. We are seeing underwriting successes in many different areas of our book, driven in part by our investments in several underwriting initiatives over the last several years, including Mt. Logan, our capital markets facility, to position ourselves for future, long-term, growth and profitability. Mt. Logan continues to help us execute our longer-term strategic goals. As we are now managers of third-party capital, we have more tools in our underwriting arsenal to help us achieve our objective of being the go-to broker reinsurer for all brokers and clients around the world. The additional capacity provided by Logan and other hedges has enabled Everest to grow the topline, without materially increasing the risk to our balance sheet. And at the same time has allowed us to generate fees. In turn, Logan's investors have enjoyed superior returns relative to similar vehicles in this space. In fact, Logan exceeded its return targets to investors in its first full year of operation. This was driven in part by a relatively benign catastrophe loss season. But more importantly, it was a function of the broadly diversified portfolios that Logan, in partnership with Everest, can create for its investors. We continue to have significant interest from new investors for Logan, and expect to grow Logan in both dollars of assets under management as well as the number of new Logan investors throughout 2015. With Logan, the Kilimanjaro cat bonds, ILW purchases and other traditional and retrocessional protections and hedges, we are succeeding in lowering the cost of capital required to support our property catastrophe book, creating fee income for Everest to enhance our underwriting income and building a very attractive risk adjusted portfolio for our shareholders. And that helps us find more business that is accretive to earnings on our current level of capital. To highlight this, for our overall property catastrophe book around the globe, our net ROE is up compared to our gross ROE. Turning to insurance operations. Insurance premium was $364 million in Q3, down slightly from Q3 last year. As mentioned previously, this is due to a decrease in crop premium in Heartland from lower commodity prices. Stripping out Heartland in both periods, our Q3 insurance gross written premium is up 15% this year compared to Q3 last year, with growth coming form virtually all segments within our insurance operations. Rates are mixed within the insurance operation, with casualty, environmental and non-standard auto rates up. While rates are also up in workers comp, we saw additional capacity come into that market, and thus saw lower rate increases than in prior quarters. Property insurance rates were slightly down or slightly up, depending on the type of risk and territory. And new capacity in the professional liability space in U.S. continues to be aggressive in capacity and price, so we remain cautious there. As discussed in previous quarters, we continue to see profitable growth opportunities in our insurance book, and we will continue to develop these areas, including casualty, contingency and event cancellation, non-program, workers comp, property E&S and DIC, and accident and health. In addition, we have been expanding distribution relationships to rollout new accident, health and specialty and contingency insurance products. Bottomline, insurance results had an underwriting loss for both the quarter and year-to-date, but this was due to our crop insurance book. The insurance book had a loss of $21 million for the quarter with a $31 million loss in the crop book. This crop loss was caused by reduction in commodity prices, particularly corn, which was down approximately 30% from the base rate in February. A loss in our largest crop state, Minnesota, due to a cold wet start to the planting there, which resulted in some preventive planting claims, and therefore yields that were not able to offset the commodity price decline as well as crop hail losses stemming from significant Midwest hailstorms in the quarter. We continue to look to grow the Heartland operation to build economies of scale and diversify its geographic spread of business, and rollout enhanced IT systems to improve operating efficiencies and to make it easier for our agents to do business with us. Excluding the crop results, the insurance segment continues to see improvement with an attritional combined ratio of 95.6% for the quarter and 94.5% for the year. We remain pleased with the underlying trends in our insurance book, with noted improvements in both loss ratios and expense ratios in many segments, due to our insurance profitability initiatives over the last several years. We expect these trends to continue with both topline and bottomline growth in our insurance book, as we continue to focus on expanding distribution, rolling out new products and enhancing our platform capabilities, to deliver a wide range of insurance products to our customers on both an admitted and non-admitted basis. Our disciplined opportunistic culture is focused on achieving the best risk adjusted returns across all of our business segments. And our strong underwriting bench, high ratings and strong balance sheet, along with our efficient distribution platform and competitive expense ratio continues to enable Everest to generate double-digit returns for our shareholders. Thank you. And now, back to Beth for Q&A.
Elizabeth Farrell: Kim, we are ready to open up the floor for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) And we'll take our first question from Michael Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs: Just a question on the U.S. reinsurance book and the Bermuda book. In U.S. reinsurance, just trying to understand what is the profile of the business that you're writing more of? And is it a sort of different profile than your legacy book? And how do the modeled returns on that new business compare?
Craig Howie: I mean the book, we write off classes of business within the U.S. We write pro rata, risk, cat, retro, and we have a product called PURPle. And we will deploy different amounts of capacity to each of those depending on where we see the best returns. And the returns, while down, are still north of a 20% ROE.
Dominic Addesso: Michael, the book has not changed considerably over the years, typically as it relates to some of the peak zone areas. The reality is that we've actually diversified the book a bit more. Our casualty book, for example, is a little larger than it was a couple of years ago, but still not at the heights that it was at in 2002, 2003 timeframe. We've also have written a number of pretty good growth in our regional client sector, as well as a little bit growth in our facultative book as well. But it's not a significant change. Most recently, in the last year, as John pointed out in his talking points, we did write some new property pro rata quota share deals. Many of those were in non-cat exposed areas. And there are shifts from time-to-time in the portfolio, depending on where the opportunities are. I don't know if you have a follow-up to that.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs: I guess the question is how much of your sub-70 underlying combined growing -- you grew the book almost 20%. How much is, for example, just the fact that weather has been light, how much of that has driven that result? Just trying to understand, I mean is this where you're sort of modeled returns, where you expect returns to be or how much sort of help did you get from light weather?
Dominic Addesso: Well, the results of ourselves, as well as the rest of the market are always helpful when catastrophes are low. Particularly in the U.S., while there wasn't any major cat event. We also benefited this particular year in the U.S. due to a lower level of attritional cats. And we define that as any event to us that's less than $10 million. So that you see a year-over-year improvement in the U.S. book in part due to that. On the other hand, we have a higher level of attritional cats in our Latin American book. And then in our Bermuda book, that was a little worse than a prior year due to purchase of ILWs. But you're going to have that impact in any one particular segment from time to time, I think the point is that the overall book is well-diversified, and that's the point of it, right. Better diversified than we have been, ever in our history, I would say.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs: And to the extent that Mt. Logan also is growing, does your appetite or has your appetite for business changed now that Mt. Logan is online and sort of scaling up or do you still seek the same type of profile business that you would have without the presence of a Mt. Logan?
Dominic Addesso: As you may or may not know, our participation in Mt. Logan is proportional to our own book. In other words, the risk that we put into Mt. Logan is also partly retained within our portfolio. So our interests are aligned. So that means that our appetite, for our portfolio, Logan does not change our appetite. What Mt. Logan allows us to do is actually, for lines of business or class of the business or territory, that we think are attractive it allows us to expand our capacity in those areas. So that's the appetite part of it. But it doesn't change our return appetite.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs: So the return threshold for Mt. Logan is the same as Everest?
Dominic Addesso: Correct.
Operator: We'll move on to our next question from Amit Kumar of Macquarie.
Amit Kumar - Macquarie: Just a quick follow-up, I guess on the last question, if I heard you correctly, you mentioned north of 20% return number. Is that sort of the average number you were talking about in terms of the new business that you have written or is there a range around that north of 20% number?
Dominic Addesso: As John will follow-up as well on this, but just to clarify that, and it's excess of 20%, and that's on allocated capital based on our modeling. Of course, we carried more capital than what the models would imply. And we have different appetites or different return objectives by classes of business for sure. John, do you want to?
John Doucette: I think the short answer is absolutely, there is going to be every class of business, not just property, not just cat; casualty, reinsurance, insurance, there's going to be wide range of returns, combined ratios and return on equity in every class, and we build books of business. And there is different attachment points, different ways we play different products that all have different returns that crystallizes into that total we are talking about.
Amit Kumar - Macquarie: I guess a follow-up to that would be why would someone be walking away from that business, which Everest is able to capture? Is there more to it or is that what you said that you were the lead, and hence, you're just seeing more opportunities? I guess, what I'm trying to figure out, it's a tough market out there, others are shrinking and yet you have found these specific opportunities and I'm trying to figure out is it more Everest-specific or is there an industry issue, which is helping Everest more than its peers?
Dominic Addesso: We've said on many quarters, and I think you're seeing it in the numbers, we continue -- I mean, one of the example is some of the bigger clients, they want to do more business with fewer people, and that means that there is some diversification away from the big directs. And then there is also a consolidation of the P&L. We have been a direct beneficiary of that. We can't really comment on other peoples view. We have our capital model. It's been the same capital model we've had for many years. But we think that we have enhanced opportunities with some of the consolidation that's going on, and that certainly would drive part of what you're seeing. Certainly, we can't comment on what other market participants are seeing necessarily, but some of the decrease that occurs in some of the other markets is not just under-priced business, it's also, as John pointed out, in some of the larger programs, lines that are lost. And so that's certainly a factor. And don't miss understand, I mean there are lines of business that we shrink and pullback from as well. It's not that we're seeing every class of business, every attachment point, every layer being appropriately priced. So there are places in our portfolio that are contracting and there are other places, which have expanded.
John Doucette: And one other point I'd like to add is, and we've said this before, but you can't underestimate the importance. We write a lot, unlike a lot of our competitors, we write for a lead market property, reinsurer and write that book of business from the U.S. and that gives us better access to clients, better ability to visit with them, meet with them, negotiate with them onshore, and that is very helpful. And sometimes business gets done domestically and then doesn't go to other jurisdictions to get completed.
Operator: And we'll move on to our next question from Jay Gelb with Barclays.
Jay Gelb - Barclays: For the crop insurance book, you highlighted the impact in 3Q. What's your expected impact in 4Q?
Craig Howie: We do expect to see some change, because the commodity prices have changed from our estimate, from where we booked these numbers for the third quarter. However, we still would expect a loss in the fourth quarter. We'll still have expenses coming through, and again, expect the loss in that quarter as well.
Dominic Addesso: It will be modest, though.
Jay Gelb - Barclays: And there was $31 million loss in crop in 3Q?
Craig Howie: That's correct, for the quarter; and $42 million year-to-date. Now, that's for both MPCI Crop as well as Crop-Hail. There were several storms, hailstorms, that happened during the quarter and we took a fairly large loss, which represents about half of the loss for the quarter, Jay.
Jay Gelb - Barclays: And then separately, on Mt. Logan, given the sharp improvement in profit in 3Q, is there a way we could better project what the outlook for that is? I know there's some lumpiness, but my sense is it's tied to some extent to the amount of capacity that's provided. So is there any straightforward way, for us, as outside observers, to be able to project that?
Dominic Addesso: You're talking gross or net?
Jay Gelb - Barclays: I would say probably gross, and then also on the underwriting gain?
Dominic Addesso: It's partly reflective of the marks that go to Mt. Logan portfolio. But I'll ask John to comment on that.
John Doucette: I mean, clearly there is seasonality component to it, in terms of where we are, so it's very much cat dependent. I mean that book is, that the business that we currently have in Mt. Logan is 100% property catastrophe reinsurance. So it's going to be very much a focus, it's very much a function of what is the cat business that's happened.
Dominic Addesso: And from an underwriting gain perspective, on a net basis, in other words after non-controlling interest, it's not that significant. For the nine months, it was $5 million, I think.
John Doucette: Correct.
Dominic Addesso: So I wouldn't expect a material change from that into the fourth quarter. To me that's really the best way to look at it. Of course, we've got the underwriting fee income for managing that portfolio that comes in as well. In terms of what sticks to us, I don't know if it's material enough that we can give you a better answer than that.
Operator: And we'll go next to Vinay Misquith of Evercore.
Vinay Misquith - Evercore: The first question is on the accident, your combined x cats and the reinsurance segment, that's ticked up this quarter. Was curious if it was sort of by choice that management has written a lot more diversifying business and so it's more of a business mix issue or is it more of the pricing issue?
Dominic Addesso: Vinay, as I mentioned perhaps before, but just to clarify, what's happening in the overall reinsurance book is, and particularly this quarter is the Latin American attritional cats, so we had tickup in that. That probably was the biggest driver. And then in Bermuda, we had purchase of ILWs. There is some mix issues going on as we wrote some more U.S. proportional business, non-cat exposed, so that does have an impact. But overall the biggest change is due to the Latin America attritional cats in the reinsurance.
Vinay Misquith - Evercore: So would you say that this quarter was slightly higher than average and what you would expect for the future?
Dominic Addesso: Yes. As far as its attritional number, absolutely.
Vinay Misquith - Evercore: And just looking at where pricing is going, we're hearing that ceding commissions are increasing for every non-cat business. How much should we expect the combined ratios to go up next year, for more than a couple of points, or a couple of points would be reasonable?
John Doucette: We don't really forecast combined ratios. We don't disclose that. Frankly, we are still closing out our planning process for next year anyway, but clearly that would be pretty close, giving you an earnings number. And we don't disclose that. But let me just make a comment about that, generally. Certainly, the market is difficult. There are many areas where it's very competitive. What we have managed to do is buy different products in the property cat space in particular, which is probably where your question is coming from, in part we have moved the different layers, changed attachment points, gone outside, as John pointed out, purchased retrocessional protection, diversified our book further, all with an eye towards trying to maintain the same return levels. And it's certainly, entirely possible that if some of this business doesn't meet our return objectives that we will begin to withdraw with certain capacity. And if that means that we manage our capital more aggressively, then we'll do that. So there's lots of levers that we can pull into this marketplace. With respect to ceding commissions, a lot of that frankly ends up in the casualty, treaty area. That would be the largest impact to us, the impact of increased ceding commissions. And in many cases where ceding commissions have reached extraordinary levels, we have actually even non-renewed or not participated in those offerings. So that does put some pressure on the treaty casualty writings, for sure into next year, if that continues, and we will see.
Vinay Misquith - Evercore: And just a simple numbers question, the corporate expenses, I think, doubled this quarter. Were they some one-time items or is this the level for the future?
Craig Howie: Corporate expenses doubling this quarter; I am not sure that I see that on an overall basis.
Vinay Misquith - Evercore: Sorry. The corporate expenses were $10 million this quarter. Was it about $5 million in the year ago order? So just curious, if there were some one time items in there?
John Doucette: In which segment?
Craig Howie: Overall.
Vinay Misquith - Evercore: They're overall corporate expenses, it's a small line item, just a $10 million number
Craig Howie: It's just normal fluctuations. I don't expect any -- there is no continuing trend there that we can point to. I would look at that number on more of an annualized basis as opposed to a quarter number.
Operator: And we'll move on to our next question from Joshua Shanker of Deutsche Bank.
Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank: Everyone's going to be always confused by the writing of all these premiums, there's nothing we can do about it. But I did think to myself that driving in the past, you guys have talked about the proportional treaties onshore, which you mentioned a little bit on the conference call. I would think that will be driving your tax rate up over the long run. You had some foreign tax credits come in this quarter that came as a surprise to me. I mean, can we talk a little about the tax situation and whether I'm wrong to think they're going up over time. And how one-time in nature these foreign tax credits were and how I should think about that?
Craig Howie: So the nature of the foreign tax credits is this. First, in order to take foreign tax credits you need to be a tax payer. We just filed our 2013 tax return in September and became a tax payer, again, utilizing all of our loss carry forwards on a tax return basis. So that's the first thing you need is to become a tax payer. The next thing you need is foreign-source income and we have an earning income where our branch locations are outside the U.S. mainly Canada and other places like that, so we have an earning income. So now we get to take those foreign tax credits against the actual tax on the tax return. So that's number one. We got to take those for both 2013 as well as the 2014 year this quarter. What I would expect to see going forward is about $10 million per year of foreign tax credits. So I'm not at big number, but it is an ongoing number.
Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank: And then as it relates to the higher amount of onshore pro rata risk, is that driving the attritional tax rate up over time?
Craig Howie: What would drive that attritional rate up traditionally for us that we've mentioned in the past is more catastrophes. So in other words the less catastrophes we have here located in the U.S. and taxed in the U.S., the more taxable income we would have, therefore the higher the tax rate. Right now, the tax rate has been relatively high, if you will, 14.4% last quarter, because of the lack of cats in the U.S.
Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank: One just quick question, something I've been looking at, have you guys pointed the independent director or independent directors to Mt. Logan yet?
Dominic Addesso: We are in the past was doing that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley: My first question is on the crop side. Just wondering if you have any commodity hedging? And if you do have, is that part of your loss ratio or operating numbers? Then on crop, if you think about longer-term, a normalized weather year, what's your sort of like normalized or expected combined ratio for that line of business? And next year, if the commodity price staying the same as it is right now, do we expect a big drop in terms of the premium you will be able to collect?
Dominic Addesso: First of all, on the crop side, we have no commodity hedges in place, unless that addresses that. From a expected loss ratio on an expected basis for crop, around 80%, double high-70s would be what we would expect. The price levels stay where they're at. What would happen to the premium? I don't know that there would be any material change in premium.
John Doucette: No. We would expect, assuming that we kept the same policy count we would expect the premiums to stay the same. We are and have talked about trying to grow the policy count with additions of staff in different areas that will help us do that.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley: So just to clarify that, so premium will stay the same even though the commodity price, like the next several will be like 30% lower than earlier this year?
Dominic Addesso: Well, there is a lot of moving parts including the volatility factor that's been lower in the last couple of years. So we don't know where that will end up being for next year.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley: Then on a different topic, on the sort of east we saw, alternative capital, the basic supply going, now they're talking about some of the primary company may see less into the open market. Sp from your perspective, just wanted to hear your thoughts about, one, in the near-term where you see the genuine pricing going? Are we bottoming out on that? And then longer-term, how do you think the industry will evolve and how is Everest repositioned for that?
Dominic Addesso: Well, that's a very heavy question and a big topic for sure. First of all, relative to what's going on in the alternative capital space, what you're asking is, less ceded premium into the marketplace. A lot of that premium, if you're speaking about hedge fund type structures, typically the premium going into those types of vehicles will be more casualty focused business, which frankly for us right now has not been a growth area for us. So we would not anticipate any major impact from some of those early movers into that space. It's still early days with respect to hedge fund capital coming in. My early view on it is that it's very difficult to raise capital into these structures, and that doesn't mean that they won't exist. But it's not clear to me at this point that it will be a huge part of our business, at least at this point. If in fact that evolves to be something different, and it's likely that will be more attractive to investors to invest into that space, Everest would certainly be prepared to consider that as one of its platforms, not unlike what we've done with Mt. Logan. Mt. Logan for us is where we see more immediate term growth in the alternative capital space. As John pointed out, we still would expect there to be increased assets under management there. And for us that is a strategic play, where we're actually as I mentioned before able to deploy more capacity through the use of that facility. So we see it as a tool, not a threat. And it's just another form of capital, and allows us to manage our own capital more efficiently. That'd be the case. In terms of pricing, certainly on the capital market side, there seems to be some evidence that we're certainly trading near our bottom, particularly as you look at cat bond pricing, and even some of the things that we see going on in our capital markets facility Mt. Logan, where investors are hitting some floors with respect to the returns that they expect. Hard to say what impact that might have on traditional pricing or any pricing at one-one. As you probably know, next week is PCI, but more recently coming from -- had some folks at Baden-Baden, but before that in the CIAB and before that in Monte Carlo, there seem to be less talk about price decline and more talk frankly from any of our ceding company clients about maintaining traditional panel, maintaining relationships, and making sure that their panels where highly rated. So all that conversation to me suggest that we are floating somewhere around the bottom at this point, but we will see in the next 60 days.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley: And if I may ask one last question on the buybacks, it looks like slowdown a bit in third quarter and why your earnings have been great. So are we expecting a tick up in the fourth quarter that still targeting probably return 100% to show payout ratio in 2014?
Dominic Addesso: As you know, we don't give guidance on our share repurchases. But I will point out that we historically in the third quarter, given that's our highest cat exposed season that we have typically lightened up on share repurchase. And this past third quarter was no different than what we've done in others. And so we would certainly look favorably on increasing that in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter market conditions, both pricing of our stock as well as market conditions on the pricing side. If those are all favorable, then we would look to increase our share repurchases. But we do not forecast or give a number on what that might be. We do it week at a time.
Operator: And we'll move on to our next question from Meyer Shields of KBW
Meyer Shields - KBW: Dominic, the trend of panel consolidation that you're seeing, is that sort of a one-time issue that's going to wash through or do you see sort of incrementally benefiting companies of your size in the next few years?
Dominic Addesso: I think it's likely to continue. I don't know about the next few years. It's difficult time horizon too on that, but I would see that accelerating or continuing on some level for sure. Unless there is some consolidation in the industry, so that there are larger capital providers, then I would expect that trend to continue. And I think that's probably why you see some exacts predicting or suggesting there should be greater consolidation within our space.
Meyer Shields - KBW: The slowing rate increases in workers compensation that you mentioned, are they still running ahead or in line with loss trend?
Dominic Addesso: Yes. I think it was around 8% or 9%, or 7%. 8% for the first nine months of the year.
Meyer Shields - KBW: And lastly, I guess this is probably for, Craig, when I look at Mt. Logan and sort of compare the reported underwriting profit to the net loss attributable to non-controlling interests, it looks like a higher percentage of the underwriting profits went to the investors than in past quarters. Is there a good way of modeling that going forward?
Craig Howie: Well, I think as Dom mentioned before, it's not necessarily a material number to us yet, but it is seasonal, because of the property cat losses. So we would expect after we get through the season that you may see some additional results flow into Everest, profit commissions things like that, that would flow-through. But right now, it's more seasonal.
Dominic Addesso: It also is due to us, the initial investment that Everest put in, and then growth of third-party money. So the share of Mt. Logan is higher to external investors.
Meyer Shields - KBW: Where is it right now?
Craig Howie: We were 9 of 50.
Dominic Addesso: And remember, we were a higher percentage of that in the early days. And of course, as we attracted more funds, that gets diluted obviously, the percentage gets diluted.
Craig Howie: Initially, we were 50 of 250, and now we're 50 of over 400.
Operator: And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.
Elizabeth Farrell: We would like to thank everybody for participating in the call. And if for some reason, we are not able to get your question answered, please feel free to give us a call. Thanks.
Dominic Addesso: Thank you all very much.
Operator: And that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day, everyone and welcome to the Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Call for Everest Re Group. Today’s conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference to Ms. Beth Farrell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Elizabeth B. Farrell: Thank you, Jessica. Good morning, and welcome to Everest Re Group’s second quarter 2014 earnings call. On the call with me today are Dom Addesso, the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer; John Doucette, our Chief Underwriting Officer; and Craig Howie, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I note that statements made during today’s call, which are forward-looking in nature, such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations and the like are subject to various risks. As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations. Our SEC filings have full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements. Now, let me turn the call over to Dom.
Dominic J. Addesso: Thanks, Beth and good morning. We are pleased to report on favorable second quarter results this morning. Our operating income per share has improved for both the quarter and the year over the comparable prior year period. Net income per share for the quarter was up over the prior year, but the six month number is lower for 2014 due to lower realized gains on investments in 2014. The improvements in operating results are clearly driven by continuing and growing underwriting gains, offset of course, by declining investment income results. The underwriting results did benefit from lower cats this year, but do reflect $45 million of losses in the second quarter, half of that reported last year. Nevertheless, our underwriting gain in the first half remain strong at $423 million, which was up slightly over the prior year due to growth in premium earned. The growth in premium was achieved while maintaining margins, which is a reflection of our ability to navigate through this market. Yes, rates are down in many of the cat exposed regions, however, by changing attachment points and reallocating capacity to different product types and new products we have been able to secure additional business at rates that meet or exceed our hurdle rates. In addition, our Mt. Logan facility and other similar arrangements permit us to present more meaningful capacity to clients, which enable us to secure placements at terms that are acceptable. This trend will continue into the third quarter as we have secured capacity from the Cat Bond placement we sponsored as well as some purchases of ILW capacity. We are a significant market with over $7 billion of capital, and these strategies allow us to lever that up even further. Combined with our A Plus rating and team of innovative and responsive underwriters we are increasingly becoming a market of choice. Nevertheless, we must continue our disciplined approach. And in some segments you will note that we were forced to retreat due to pricing. John will cover this further in his report, but of particular note is the fact that essentially all of out net premium growth was in our U.S. reinsurance segment. The insurance operation continues to perform well, with an underwriting profit in both the first and second quarters of this year. Growth has been constrained due to the crop book, which has actually declined year-over-year by $75 million due to lower commodity prices. That means, of course, that all of our other targeted growth areas are doing well. Primary pricing is still increasing although at lower rates, and as such, our insurance result excluding crop is running in the mid-90s, which is an improvement over the prior. The crop portfolio was expected to improve but will lag the other lines this year as we are making significant technology investments there this year. We were active this first quarter on capital management, and Craig will get into the details. Given the financial flexibility gained from our sponsored Cat Bond, the Mt. Logan facility, IOW purchases and our new debt offering we continue to have the ability to maintain share repurchases within our earnings stream while at the same time expanding the franchise. All in all we feel that with an increase in shareholder value per share of over 10% in the first half, we have done an excellent job in a challenging underwriting and investment market. We have the talent, resources, capital and most importantly discipline to continue that through the cycle. Thank you. And now, I will turn it over to Craig for the financial highlights.
Craig W. Howie: Thank you, Dom and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report that Everest had another strong quarter of earnings with net income of $290 million or $6.26 per diluted common share, this compares to net income of $276 million or $5.56 per share for the second quarter of 2013. Net income includes realized capital gains and losses. On a year-to-date basis net income was $584 million or $12.46 per share, compared to $660 million or $13.09 per share in 2013. The 2014 result represents an annualized return on equity of 17%. Operating income year-to-date was $532 million or a $11.35 per share. This represents a 3% increase over operating income of $10.99 per share last year. These overall results were driven by a solid underwriting result offset by lower net investment income, compared to the first half of 2013. The results reflect a stable overall current year attritional combined ratio of 80.9% on a year-to-date basis down from 81.0% at year end 2013. This measure excludes the impact of catastrophes, restatement premiums and prior period loss development. All segments reported underwriting gains for the quarter and for the first half of 2014. Total reinsurance reported an underwriting gain of $181 million for the quarter compared to $134 million underwriting gain last year. For the first half of 2014, total reinsurance reported an underwriting gain of $396 million, compared to a $344 million gain last year. The insurance segment reported an underwriting gain of $4 million for the quarter, compared to a gain of $9 million last year. And on a year-to-date basis the insurance segment reported an underwriting gain of $8 million, compared to a gain of $9 million in 2013. Each year reflected a $2 million underwriting loss for crop insurance during the second quarter primarily due to the seasonality of crop premiums. Mt. Logan Re’s financial position and operating results were consolidated into Everest beginning July 1, 2013. These results are shown in a separate segment and reflected a $9 million underwriting gain for the quarter and a $19 million underwriting gain year-to-date. Everest retained $3 million of this income and $16 million was attributable to the non-controlling interests of this entity. The overall underwriting gain for the group was $195 million for the quarter compared to an underwriting gain of $143 million for the same period last year. On a year-to-date basis, the underwriting gain was $423 million compared to a gain of $353 million in 2013. These overall results reflect $45 million of current year catastrophe losses in the first half of 2014 all recorded in the second quarter. Of the total, $30 million related to late reported loss from the snowstorms in Japan, and $15 million related to the earthquake in Chile. This compares with $90 million of catastrophes during the first half of 201. Our reported combined ration was 82.5% for the first half of 2014, compared to 84.2% in 2013. The year-to-date commission ratio of 21.9% was slightly up from 21.2% in 2013, primarily due to higher contingent commissions. Our low expense ratio of 4.5% continues to be a competitive advantage. As for loss reserves, in June we fourth annual global loss development triangles for 2013. There were no major changes since the 2012 release. Our overall quarterly internal reserving metrics continue to be favorable. For investments, pre-tax investment income was $131 million for the quarter $254 million year-to-date on our $17.6 billion investment portfolio. Investment income for the first six months declined $40 million from one year ago. This decrease was primarily driven by the decline in limited partnership income for the year, although low reinvestment rates and capital used to redeem stock and debt also contributed. Limited partnership investments resulted in a gain of $6 million for the quarter, compared to a gain of $20 million last year. On a year-to-date basis, the gain was $4 million, compared to a gain of $37 million in 2013. Our existing limited partnership portfolio is fairly mature, and as result, we have seen a decline in current gains coming from these investments. Despite the declining rates, our investment portfolio continues to perform well. The pre-tax yield on the overall portfolio was 3.1% with a duration of three years. The first six months reflected $52 million of net after-tax realized capital gains compared to $106 million last year. These gains are mainly attributable to fair value adjustments on the equity portfolio. There were $2 million of derivative gains during the first half of 2014 compared to $27 million of gains last year. This is related to our equity put options and is a function of the change interest rates and indices this year. Other income and expense included $50 million of foreign exchange losses in the first six months of 2014. This was mostly offset by foreign exchange gains on bonds reflected in other comprehensive. On income taxes, the increase in effective rate is primarily driven by lower than planned catastrophe losses resulting in higher than expected taxable income for the year. 14.4% effective tax rate on operating income is inline with our expected rate for year given our planned cat losses for the remainder of the year. Strong cash flow continues with operating cash flows of $590 million for the first half of 2014 compared to $439 million in 2013. Turning to capital management. We issued $400 million of 4.868% 30-year senior notes in June to replace our 5.4% senior notes that will mature in October. Shareholders equity at the end of the quarter was $7.3 billion up $355 million or 5% over year-end 2013. This is after taking into account almost $400 million of capital return to $325 million of share buybacks and $69 million of dividends paid in the first half of 2014. Additionally, we repurchased another $10 million of stock after the quarter closed; these purchases will be reflected in the third quarter financial statements. Book value per share increased 9% to $160.27 from $146.57 at year-end 2013. Our continued strong capital balance positions us well for potential business opportunities as well continuing stock repurchases. Thank you. And now John Doucette will provide the operations with you.
John P. Doucette: Thank you, Craig. Good morning. As Dom highlighted, we continued our strong results into the second quarter of 2014. Our group gross written premium was 1.42 billion up $155 million from Q2 of last year with growth coming from each of our reinsurance segment. Net written premium was $1.22 billion, which was closer to flat given the various hedges. For our reinsurance segments, total reinsurance GWP including Logan was $1.1 billion for the quarter, up 16% from Q2 last year. We remain optimistic on our reinsurance operation despite several market headwinds. We are successfully navigating this market and growing profitable by utilizing our competitive advantages, including our leading global market position, franchise and representation; our strong ratings and well capitalize balance sheet; our expense ratio advantage over our competitors and our culture of bottom line execution; our best-in-class analytics which allows us to make informed and accretive portfolio management decisions; our state-of-the-art enterprise risk management framework, which recently got upgraded to strong by S&P; our utilization of the capital markets convergence both offensively and defensively across a variety of strategies to maximize efficiencies for our clients and maximize value to our shareholders; and our long-term trading relationships with our clients as one of the longest standing and largest reinsures. These are all advantages that provide Everest with the edge in this competitive space.
 : We believe this strategic initiative has been successful for all involved, and our unique Logan structure was validated by new investors again coming into Logan at 7/1, resulting in increased AUM even after paying out profits to our investors. We continue to believe that the Logan structure adds value to both our clients and our shareholders. Our clients and brokers benefit from Everest being able to deploy more capacity on deals and layers which are attractively priced. Having access to both rated and unrated balance sheets allows us to deploy capacity to our clients in a more efficient manner than either one by itself. And our shareholders benefit from Everest’s ability to deepen client relationships better manage our overall capital and our PMLs, while achieving higher risk adjusted returns and improving our cost of capital. As we mentioned last quarter, in addition to Logan we have initiated other PML and capital management strategies. We recently obtained fully collateralized reinsurance coverage funded by the Kilimanjaro Re cat bond and we were active buyers in ILW space. Executing these strategies helped us trend some of our peak PMLs. Currently the price of risk around the world has decreased in many areas. But with our core advantages and deployment of several capital market strategies we can compete, win, grow and build significant shareholder value in any market condition. Here is some color on June 1 and July 1 reinsurance renewals. For our overall global property reinsurance book at June 1 and July 1, we continued to grow our gross written premium aided by the additional capacity provided by Mt. Logan. While the expected combined ratio up about one to two points year-over- year, the gross and the net dollar margin continue to expand in the overall book compared to the same period last year. This demonstrates the significant benefit of our long-standing diversified global portfolio across many clients, products and territories. Across our book Florida cats XOL rates were down approximately 10% to 15% compared to last year. Despite that we were pleased with our 6/1 renewal by growing our gross and net premiums as well as our gross dollar margin and our net dollar margin across the Florida book. This was achieved by deploying meaningful capacity on cat XOL deals which we liked with key strategic clients, while reducing shares or declining deals which we did not find attractive, and in some cases moving up attachments on our programs where we found rates were more attractive. In Florida and other USA regions there were some quota share treaties on which we were unable to come to mutually acceptable terms, so we came off. However, we also built new pro rata relationship as well as increased some existing quota share relationships where we like the clients, the pricing, terms and conditions. We are continuously rebalancing both our cat XOL and pro rata books in Florida and elsewhere around the global as we seek the optimal position on the programs, which we believe provides us with the best risk adjusted returns while maintaining our relationships with longstanding clients. Our overall, net, net Florida PMLs are flat from 1/1 as a percentage of GAAP equity against increased dollar margins given our portfolio management and hedging. Internationally we found renewals a mix bag with some areas under rate pressure particularly China and Australia and correspondingly premiums were down in those areas. But in those and other areas we had better than market results due to our lead market position and the strength our relationships with long-term clients and brokers. Turning to our overall casualty and longer tail reinsurance book globally primary terms and conditions remain attractive, but reinsurance terms continue to be under pressure for commodity type treaties and seeding commissions on casualty quota share treaties are generally moving up. Therefore we continue to execute new products and new opportunities and we saw some nice growth overall in our long-tail book. These one off highly customized solutions more than offset the GWP on the traditional casualty treaties which we declined due to pricing. Total reinsurance including Logan bottom line, we continued the strong underwriting results with underwriting profits in the second quarter of $190 million, up 42% compared to Q2 last year underwriting profits. Now with respect to our insurance operations. Our premium was $316 million in Q2 essentially flat from Q2 last year. As mentioned, this is due to a decrease in crop premium at Heartland from lower commodity prices. Stripping out Heartland premium our Q2 insurance GWP is up 12% this year compared to Q2 last year. Rates are generally up in the insurance operation, including casualty and workers’ comp. Property insurance rates were mixed depending on the type of risk and the territory. We continue to see profitable growth opportunities in many areas in our insurance book, including areas that we have targeted such as non-program workers’ comp, casualty, specialty and contingency lines, property E&S and DIC, accident and health and our Canadian insurance operations. However, we remain cautious in the professional lines with more capacity coming into that space. Bottom line our insurance results with profitable year-to-date and for the quarter. With the year-to-date results coming in at a 98.1% attritional combined ration and a 93.9% attritional combined ratio excluding crop, which is better than the same result last year. We continued to be pleased with the underlying trends in our insurance book we are seeing encouraging results of our insurance growth initiatives over the last several years with noted improvements in both loss rations and expense rations. As well as premium growth in all areas of our insurance book expect for Heartland this year. We expect these trends to continue with both top line and bottom line growth in our insurance book. In summary, the world of insurance and reinsurance is a rapidly change in world and while there may ultimately be a structural shift in the market, we are as well positioned as anyone to benefit from these changes. We remain confident in our ability to achieve profitable growth for our shareholders, and we remain bullish on our future. Thank you, and now back to Beth for Q&A.
Elizabeth B. Farrell: Jessica, we are open for questions now.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) And we will go first to Amit Kumar with Macquarie.
Amit J. Kumar – Macquarie Research Equities:  Thanks, and good morning. Just two quick questions. The first question relates to your underlying loss ratio ex-cats for reinsurance. I am looking at the numbers, and I am wondering, you are talking about pricing declines, why wouldn't that number go up? Is that more a business mix shift issue or is there more to it?
Dominic J. Addesso:  Amit this is Dom.
Amit J. Kumar – Macquarie Research Equities: Hey.
Dominic J. Addesso: There are a number of factors. One is mix of business, another would be some of it is pro rata and to the extent that primary pricing is increasing that impacts it. And I think your question was just related to the reinsurance book.
Amit J. Kumar – Macquarie Research Equities: Yes.
Dominic J. Addesso: And then new products in particular is what would be driving that and different lines of business that we are getting into.
Amit J. Kumar – Macquarie Research Equities: So that is nearly offsetting the double-digit declines in pricing?
Dominic J. Addesso: Correct.
Amit J. Kumar – Macquarie Research Equities: Got it. The other question I had is just going back to your discussion on the crop, how should we think about the future with the prices being down but the yields being up? How do you feel, how does this play out? I know it is a bit early, but would just love to get your thoughts for the future on the crop.
Dominic J. Addesso: We’ve already given part of my answer which is – it is bit early and you know for now weather is looking favorable. So we are anticipating decent yields certainly commodity prices are down for now, but there are still a lot of room to go on where that market settles out. So and then you’ve got the issue of retentions by the – or deductibles that the clients have retaining portion of a risk. So we are anticipating at this point that the downward turn in commodity prices would be a factor. But there is still plenty of room to go here.
Amit J. Kumar – Macquarie Research Equities: What percent of your – I am sorry…
Dominic J. Addesso: Did you have follow up?
Amit J. Kumar – Macquarie Research Equities: Yes, what percent of your book is revenue based?
John P. Doucette: Amit this is John.
Amit J. Kumar – Macquarie Research Equities: Hey.
John P. Doucette: Most of it. A vast majority of it is revenue based.
Amit J. Kumar – Macquarie Research Equities: Got it. I'll stop here and re-queue. Thanks for all the answers.
Dominic J. Addesso: Amit, I want to go back also to your first question which is the declining property cat pricing, you also have to remember that property cat premium only represents about 25% of our total premium. So you can have a decline in pricing there, but other new products and other things can – it's highly levered, the impact of that is highly levered.
Amit J. Kumar – Macquarie Research Equities: Got it. Fair enough.
Dominic J. Addesso: Okay.
Operator: We’ll go next to Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.
Joshua D. Shanker – Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.:  Hi, good morning everyone.
Dominic J. Addesso: Good morning, Josh.
Joshua D. Shanker – Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.: Good morning. I wanted to talk a little about the premium seed in the international segment as it relates to pricing and as it relates to Mt. Logan's participation?
Dominic J. Addesso: Well, some of the premium in the international is a result of some strategic relationship that we have with some large global clients, so that is dominating that. It is heavily reinsured as well. So that’s dominating the session there and the of course, you do have the Mt. Logan impact as well.
Joshua D. Shanker – Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.: So the Mt. Logan portion of that would be the minority of the seed?
Dominic J. Addesso: That’s correct.
John P. Doucette: Correct, yes.
Joshua D. Shanker – Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.: And these relationships I guess you did not have them one year ago?
Dominic J. Addesso: That’s correct. Excuse me. Let me just clarify that. These were clients we had one year ago but these particular transactions were not in place one year ago.
John P. Doucette: Yes.
Joshua D. Shanker – Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.: And just what lines of business is this, and in order to get it you have to have a -- it is a fairly high seed, so I am just sort of interested in like what lines or I don't know what you are willing to say about it?
Dominic J. Addesso: It is across the whole lines of business. Its multi line approach quota share.
Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.: Okay, but I mean and you are willing to say as much as you want to say about it I guess. That was my only question.
Dominic J. Addesso: Well, I mean it is essentially the ability for these clients that need Everest in that marketplace with our rating and our capital and it enables them to increase their participation in the markets that they operate in by patterning up with Everest on these particular transactions.
Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.: Okay. So these are reinsurance companies who probably couldn't get the business on their own?
Dominic J. Addesso: No, no, no. They are primary companies, they are primary companies.
Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.: And So I guess you are retro ceding back to the client? I don't understand why there is a high seed I guess.
John P. Doucette: That is correct.
Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.: Okay. Okay, very good. Thank you.
Operator: We’ll go next to Jay Gelb with Barclays.
Jay H. Gelb – Barclays Capital Inc.: Thank you. On the international reinsurance segment with the retention the net to gross going down to 70%, do you feel that is something we should just see this quarter or will that affect the sessions going forward which is typical much closer to a – where the net to gross is typically much closer to 100% in international reinsurance.
Craig W. Howie: Jay, this is Craig. I think this is something that we would expect to see going forward as well.
John P. Doucette: This is John. We would also as Longan – as we continue to seed business from all the segments we would see an impact of that at least somewhat within the international segment as well.
Jay H. Gelb – Barclays Capital Inc.: Okay. Have you said before what portion of Everest Re's business is seeded to Logan?
John P. Doucette: You can see that in the segment report in terms of what the gross written premiums that are seeded to Logan in the Logan segment at the back of the analyst report.
Jay H. Gelb – Barclays Capital Inc.: Okay. So that is just direct from the Everest Re book.
Craig W. Howie: Correct, you are right.
John P. Doucette: Correct.
Jay H. Gelb – Barclays Capital Inc.: Okay. And then on share buybacks the pace slowed in 2Q relative to 1Q, why was that?
Craig W. Howie: Basically the price of the stock kept going up and exceeding our target in terms of what we gave, instructions that we gave to our broker and we just couldn’t keep pace with it.
Jay H. Gelb – Barclays Capital Inc.: All right. I guess that is a good problem to have. Thank you very much.
Craig W. Howie: Thank you.
Operator: We’ll go next to
Kai Pan – Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning. Thank you for taking my call. The first question is just follow-up on Josh’s question on the retro buying. If you step back and think about strategically do you think it is a defensive move that you want to retain, maintain and grow the relationship or it could be arbitrage that actually can enhance your margin offensively?
John P. Doucette: This is John. Good morning. Lots of times around the world we have opportunities to partner and build the strategic relationships with clients and there is a variety of reasons why they do that and sometimes its to get access to their business or our business or as Dom said earlier, to give them an opportunity to enhance their writings and as we've been saying from many quarters now, we've been building strategic relationships with this which gives us access to what we believe is profitable business and it helps strengthen relationships with some of our long-standing clients around the globe.
Kai Pan – Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then you mentioned on sort of your global reinsurance book raise of pricing decline and [indiscernible] renewals expected combined ratio to deteriorate about one to two point, but that seems – could you give more color on that? That Seems more comparable with some of your pricing commentary you had said about the pricing decline especially in Florida pretty big, but it looks like the combined ratio deterioration relatively moderate so anything behind that?
Craig W. Howie: Well impart with what I mentioned before and I will ask John to comment as well, but again recollect that the cat premium particularly the cat XOL premium, are total cat premium is 25% of our total premium volume. So if that pricing is down 10% to 15% it’s not going to be dollar-for-dollar impact of the combined ration across the entire book. So there is that leverage impact.
John P. Doucette: Right and the 10% to 15% was a comment on Florida rates. We also talked about how we move up in programs where the rates weren't – we move within programs so that the impact to us may not be 10% to 15%, but then the comment on the one to two combined ratio point that was on our global property book and I think that just highlights the kind of the strength of a diversified portfolio trading in 80 countries around the world where we write property reinsurance with clients that we've been trading with for a very long time and it helps insulate our portfolio and we look to grow areas around the globe where we think we are getting paid to take the risk and that helps to insulate our portfolio for various rates decreases that are happening in different areas.
Craig W. Howie: And remember in the first quarter, you might remember in the first quarter that we referenced some areas of the world rates were going up in particular Canada. So that’s something that helps offset declines that we see in other territories.
Kai Pan – Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Last question maybe for Craig. I saw that you mentioned the tax rate is going to be 14% or run rate or am I miss that?
Craig W. Howie: That’s correct Kai. So let me just explain a little bit. Taxes – operating tax specifically operating tax was based on the geographic region where the income is earned, right and then its also based on the tax rate in that country. What we had is an annualized rate of 14.4% that’s higher than where we were after the first quarter at 13.8%; it’s primarily due to the fact that we had lower than planned cat losses. So with a full cat load for the year we would expect our tax rate to be somewhere between 13% and 14% and with the remaining cat load for the rest of this year, we expect it to be at about 14.5%. If we look at this with no more cats for the rest of the year, I would expect that rate to even rise further to about a 15% to 16% rate. So it’s really based on – currently it’s primarily based on the amount of catastrophes that we have or don’t have during the year.
Kai Pan – Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you so much for all the answers.
John P. Doucette: Thank you.
Operator: We’ll go next to Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.
Michael S. Nannizzi – Goldman Sachs & Company, Inc.: Thanks. Dom, I just have a question on I think it was to an answer to a mix question about mix change. What lines of business are you growing in or are you mixing towards where margins are kind of similar or better than the cat business?
Dominic J. Addesso: Most of it would be in the credit space. John.
John P. Doucette: Definitely, we are seeing some. We've talked about that the last several quarters, we also are you know one-off highly customized products that we think have better, its not commodity, they are not just a plain vanilla product that everybody can do. Again, some of these are very complicated products that we have the underwriting talent, the actuary, the contract wording, tax, et cetera to bring to bear. And we are seeing a lot of traction in that.
Michael S. Nannizzi – Goldman Sachs & Company, Inc.: Got it. And from a capital intensive perspective how do those products sort of compare to the cat business?
John P. Doucette: Well, the way we think of capital is you know capital where we are full – areas where we were full attract – either fullness or volatility attract more capital. So in a lot of cases we are not that full and a lot of these products have more structure to them, so they don’t have the volatility that cat books have. So in general they attract less capital.
Michael S. Nannizzi – Goldman Sachs & Company, Inc.: Got it. So this is an area, it sounds like, that you will continue to move towards. Good margins, you are getting paid for technical expertise that others can't replicate, so that seems like an area that you will look to continue to grow?
John P. Doucette: That’s our job, to find areas like that and others.
Michael S. Nannizzi – Goldman Sachs & Company, Inc.: Got it.
Dominic J. Addesso: And it not just technical expertise, its also size, capital base rating these are all things that give us an unique advantage.
Michael S. Nannizzi – Goldman Sachs & Company, Inc.: Got it. Okay. Can you give an example, is this like in the mortgage guarantee space or is this something different?
John P. Doucette:  I mean, there is a whole array of deals. But as Dom said, we have done a lot of different things in the credit space, some in the mortgage space too.
Michael S. Nannizzi – Goldman Sachs & Company, Inc.:  Got it. Okay. And then one question about Mt. Logan, so the cat load there was higher than the legacy business. So is that what you would expect that Mt. Logan will run at higher cat load than the sort of on balance sheet business or was that somewhat anomalistic as we are trying to figure out how the relationship between that and your on balance sheet business moves.
John P. Doucette: This is John. If I understand your question correctly, it is what is the embedded cat load as percentage of premium. Mt. Logan is taking all and only property catastrophe excess the loss business, where Everest on the reinsurance book and the cat load as a percentage of premium is applied to all lines of business. So you would see…
Michael S. Nannizzi – Goldman Sachs & Company, Inc.: A more concentrated. Okay, that makes sense.
John P. Doucette: Yeah.
Michael S. Nannizzi – Goldman Sachs & Company, Inc.: Okay. And then just last question, Dom, I think a number of questions you mentioned 25% cat as a percentage of premiums. Do you have any – what is that in terms of as a percentage of underlying or underwriting profitability? Just trying to right size those two.
Dominic J. Addesso:  Well, our expected underwriting profit on a cat book would be running to a 50% to 60% combined ratio, that would be kind of what we would expect, somewhere in there. It depends on territory, it depends on attachment point, a lot of variable there. But that would be kind of the expected outcome of the – from the catastrophe book. Does that answer your question?
Michael S. Nannizzi – Goldman Sachs & Company, Inc.: Maybe I didn't phrase it right. But I guess if cat premiums are 25% of total premiums is there an equivalent percentage or can we know what the equivalent percentage is of just profitability of total kind of Everest profitability represented by your cat business?
Dominic J. Addesso:  Well, it is a significant portion, no question. Because – but you got the cats that you earn the premium. And you have got commission in brokerage that gets charged against that, so it is a significant percentage of profits, no question. 
Craig W. Howie:  I mean, given the volatility we would certainly expect it run to a higher percentage underwriting profits for us to assume the volatility tied to the capital. And we would – likewise we would assume it to run to lower combined ratio.
Michael S. Nannizzi – Goldman Sachs & Company, Inc.: Right, got it. Okay. Thank you.
Operator:  We will go next to Meyer Shields of KBW.
Meyer Shields – Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc.:  Thanks, good morning, everyone. John, one quick question. I guess I was a little surprised that you said you are moving up in attachment points in Florida because my understanding was that the higher the attachment points the more competitive things were. Am I misreading the situation?
John P. Doucette:  I think the situation is dynamic and I was trying to give a couple of examples and there's other examples that would be counter to that. But one thing that I think we saw was some of the Florida companies moved up partially because of not having had cats over the last couple of years had moved up their retention. And again our view of risk may be different than other people's view of risk, but there were definitely cases where we thought the pressure on rates was less higher up in people's programs than otherwise. 
Meyer Shields – Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc.:  Okay. That’s helpful. Two quick numbers questions if I can, I guess for Craig. One, the tax rate specifically on net investment income also went up in the quarter is that likely to persist?
Craig W. Howie:  That’s really based on where that investment income is, and so when you say likely to persist, if it is in the U.S. it is taxed at a 35% rate, that is really what it comes down to. 
Meyer Shields – Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc.: Right. Is the mix shifting away or towards the U.S.?
Craig W. Howie: For the gains that happened this period yes.
Meyer Shields – Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc.: Okay. And we talked about higher commission expense on contingent commissions. Is that both U.S. reinsurance and the insurance segment?
Dominic J. Addesso: It is mostly the reinsurance segment. On the insurance side most of our contingence arrangements would have been with MGAs, and, of course, as you know, we have been shrinking our participation in that segment of the market. So while we still have some reserves out there for profit sharing, contingent payouts the impact of that is much smaller. It is mostly the reinsurance book.
Meyer Shields – Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc.: Okay, fantastic. Thanks very much.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS.
Brian R. Meredith – UBS Securities LLC:  Good morning. A couple of just quick questions here for you. First one with respect to some of the quarter share – the business you got off of in the quarter, did that impact the second quarter results or are we going to see that hit the third quarter because I know in the past you have had some ups and downs in your North American business because of some big quota shares you have gotten off of?
Craig W. Howie: There was an impact to the book this period. Again it is based on the amount of premium that was leaving and being returned, but small impact to the book this period.
Brian R. Meredith – UBS Securities LLC:  So it wasn't big under going out, okay.
Dominic J. Addesso: You right, but over time our mix between pro rata and XOL really have not changed that dramatically. And, in fact the reference quota share that we are now off of in particular in Florida we have replaced with some other Florida quota shares, as well as some quota shares in the Northeast. So again the book is constantly – it is fluid.
Brian R. Meredith – UBS Securities LLC:  Got you.
Dominic J. Addesso:  We would not expect any significant impact when the complete year unfolds the year-over-year numbers will not be that dramatically different.
Brian R. Meredith – UBS Securities LLC:  Great, thanks. And then second question I am just curious, Dom and John, can you chat a little bit about what you are seeing with respect to demand for casualty reinsurance out there right now? Has it increased at all?
Dominic J. Addesso: If you are willing to pay a high seed, yes the demand is going up. And in our particular case we are not playing in many of those high seeding commission transactions. John, if you have anything further to add?
John P. Doucette:  Yeah, there certainly have been some cases of people coming into the market, that haven’t been in the past. But, I think there has been a long-term trend of kind of tepid demand on casualty business, and again that's more – it varies a lot around the globe.
Brian R. Meredith – UBS Securities LLC:  Okay. So you haven't really seen a change necessarily this quarter where primaries are trying to buy more casualty?
Dominic J. Addesso: Not in any strong trend that we could identify at this point, Brian.
Brian R. Meredith – UBS Securities LLC:  Great. Thank you.
Dominic J. Addesso:  Thank you. 
John P. Doucette: Thank you.
Operator:  And we will go next to Vinay Misquith with Evercore.
Vinay Misquith – Evercore Partners Inc.:  Hi, good morning. Just to follow-up on the international retro that was purchased, I believe you said that that should continue in the future. But this quarter we saw  about a 30% increase in gross written premiums, so should that continue into the future so higher gross written premiums and higher retro in the future?
Dominic J. Addesso:  Let's maybe clarify something, it is retro sessional absolutely in the way it is booked or what it is called, but it is not really retro in the way you are implying. These are transactions that where we are participating with some global clients on deals where we are taking a premium in the front end and they are participating to a significant degree as a reinsurer of that in coming portfolio. So don't think of it in the terms of we are out there buying retro in the retro market. It is not that. We do – we have increased our quote on quote retro buying just from the mere fact, we have the Mt. Logan facility and various ILWs that we are buying, but it is dwarfed by the strategic transactions that we have been talking about earlier. So that percentage that you see, that you saw in terms of sessions is likely to persist but it is not necessarily going to grow dramatically from here unless we find other strategic relationships and transactions to enter into with clients. So that is the best I can do about telling you what is out there in the future with respect to that number
Vinay Misquith – Evercore Partners Inc.:  Sure. But it says on the gross written premium line says you are also taking more on the front end and then giving it out sort of on the back, correct? I mean that is the way to look at it.
Dominic J. Addesso: Right, right. But it is part of a complete transaction that – of a few clients.
Vinay Misquith – Evercore Partners Inc.: Sure. That is helpful. The second is with respect to the primary insurance I see the expense ratios are going up. Was this a one time [indiscernible] in that?
Dominic J. Addesso: Just that was really more of a function of the fact that our Heartland the crop premium was down dramatically this year as I mentioned because of commodity prices and the commission ratio in the crop book is less than our standard the other primary lines of business.
Vinay Misquith – Evercore Partners Inc.: Sure fair enough. And then the last one the share repurchases I think you answered that question. But if I heard you correctly, you said you can sort of give back all the capital from earnings despite growing your business. I just wanted to understand that correctly. Can you buyback…
Dominic J. Addesso: I don't know that I quite said it that way. I basically said that we certainly look – our share repurchase program looks to be contained within earnings, that does not necessary mean that we are saying or predicting that we would buy-in up to our actual earnings. It all depends on the price of the stock. It depends on what opportunities we see out in front of us and what our needs for capital are, but certainly we got a little bit behind our targets in the second quarter again due to price movement in the stock.
Vinay Misquith – Evercore Partners Inc.: Okay, that’s helpful. Thank you.
Dominic J. Addesso: Thank you.
Operator:  And our last question comes from Ian Gutterman with Balyasny.
Ian Gutterman – Balyasny Asset Management LP:  Hi, good morning, guys.
Dominic J. Addesso: Good morning.
Craig W. Howie:  Good morning.
Ian Gutterman – Balyasny Asset Management LP: I guess my first question is sort of big picture. I guess, Dom, I am sort of puzzled why we are not shrinking the reinsurance book? And what I mean by that is if we had this conversation a year ago or even in January frankly, it seemed like the pressure was mostly on cap. When you talk to people, you made the reference and others have to casualty seeding commissions it seems like the Loyd's guy is trying to cause trouble in the other non cap property lines. I mean why aren't we shrinking the book instead of growing the book?
Dominic J. Addesso: Because our margins are expanding and in many cases the premium or the transactions that we are seeing exceed and I don't mean by a slight margin, exceed our hurdle rates for business. So if we are able to put additional business on the books and still generate double digit returns on equity to our shareholders we are going to continue to do that.  Also remember that we have increased as we mentioned we have had our sponsored cat bond, we have had IOW purchases. Our net return on capital on transactions is higher than the gross cost. So in other words, we are improving our ROE by bringing on business and then using – taking advantage of the capital markets to lay off significant portion of that risk if not in some cases all of it. So that is the reason why.
Ian Gutterman – Balyasny Asset Management LP: So when there – I guess the reason I ask is there are other reinsurance executives saying we are starting to have behavior that is starting to I guess maybe no be the late 90s, maybe rhymes with the late 90s. You don't agree with that statement then?
Dominic J. Addesso: Well, because we have got other forms of capital we can hedge the exposure.
Ian Gutterman – Balyasny Asset Management LP: Okay.
Dominic J. Addesso: So if – that we didn't have in the late 90s. So if we are able to utilize the capital markets and improve our ROEs while at the same time maintaining, and John mentioned this but it is worth reemphasizing, our net PMLs from the beginning of the year have not really changed materially as a percentage of capital. So we are expanding margins with basically the same PML exposure.
John P. Doucette:  I would like to add a different dimension response to your question. We also are seeing opportunities. There has been a lot of talk about the haves and the havenots in the reinsurance world. And so I can't respond specifically to you say, other reinsurance executors are saying these things. But our opportunity set is not the same as the opportunity set in front of a lot of other reinsurance companies. We see deals around the globe that are shown to three or four reinsurance companies. We are creating new distribution sources through these new products we have been talking about now for several quarters. So we have significant clients that we have global clients that want to do more business with companies like Everest and less business with other people. So, there is a lot of other dimensions to the landscape and we think we are navigating it pretty well.
Ian Gutterman – Balyasny Asset Management LP: That is a very, very good point. Just to follow-up, I normally wouldn't ask about a specific contract but I think it is in the public domain who Citizens reinsures with. You guys took a very large line I believe on that new Citizens program. I don't think you were on it much or at all the year before. Can you just maybe talk a little bit about why that was a good place to put capacity?
John P. Doucette:  Yes, we did take a larger line this year. We liked it. We liked where it attached, and frankly there were some improvements in the contract wording is one of the reasons we didn't put up a bigger line last year. So we were happy with that, and it met our returns and so therefore as we look and headed into our June renewals we thought it was accretive to the portfolio that we are trying to build and it made sense particularly – it fit well, and given the way we managed our net PMLs we thought it was the right thing to do.
Ian Gutterman – Balyasny Asset Management LP: Got it. So if looked – obviously you had a big up there, a big down on universal. Outside of those two would you say your cap book grew in the quarter or was it really just those were the two big swings and the rest was maybe flat to down?
John P. Doucette: It grew in the quarter.
Dominic J. Addesso:  Gross. Remember what I was saying earlier.
Ian Gutterman – Balyasny Asset Management LP: Right. But I am saying ex-citizen growth. What I'm trying to get is it was citizen all of the growth or was there other growth even if you didn't do that?
John P. Doucette:  There was lots – one way I would describe this renewal was very volatile.
Ian Gutterman – Balyasny Asset Management LP: Got it.
John P. Doucette:  There were lots of new structures, we played at different levels of attachments, our line sizes moved up and down more than it had in the past.
Ian Gutterman – Balyasny Asset Management LP: Got it, got it. And then just lastly a number questions, in the U.S. reinsurance segment the acquisition expense ratio historically it has bee around maybe a 22 and went up to 25 this quarter. Was that mixing, was that higher seeding commissions, any color on that?
Dominic J. Addesso: That is the higher contingent commissions in the commission ratio. 
Ian Gutterman – Balyasny Asset Management LP: Okay. But it is more contingents than the base seeding commission going up? 
Dominic J. Addesso: That is correct. Right. 
Ian Gutterman – Balyasny Asset Management LP: Got it, perfect. Thank you.
Dominic J. Addesso: You got it.
Operator:  And at this time I would like to turn the conference back to Dom Addesso for closing remarks.
Dominic J. Addesso: Well, thanks for all your questions this morning. In summary, I would like to just reemphasize that despite the many challenges that are out there in the market place that we have discussed this morning, we remain optimistic about continuing to deliver double digit ROEs due to our size and ability to navigate through this market. So again thank you for participating on the call this morning.
Operator:  This does conclude today’s conference. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2014 Q1  (2014-04-24 10:30:00) =====
Executives: Beth Farrell - Vice President, Investor Relations Dom Addesso - President and Chief Executive Officer John Doucette - Chief Underwriting Officer Craig Howie - Chief Financial Officer
Analysts: Jay Gelb - Barclays Vinay Misquith - Evercore Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Amit Kumar - Macquarie Meyer Shields - KBW Brian Meredith - UBS Ian Gutterman - BAM Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley
Operator: Good day, everyone and welcome to the Everest Re Group Limited First Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. Today’s conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference to Ms. Beth Farrell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma’am.
Beth Farrell - Vice President, Investor Relations: Thank you, Augusta. Good morning, and welcome to Everest Re Group’s first quarter 2014 earnings conference call. On the call with me today are Dom Addesso, the company’s President and Chief Executive Officer; John Doucette, our Chief Underwriting Officer; and Craig Howie, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I note that statements made during today’s call, which are forward-looking in nature, such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations and the like are subject to various risks. As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations. Our SEC filings have full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements. Now, let me turn the call over to Dom.
Dom Addesso - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Beth and good morning to all. We are pleased to report another excellent quarter, which continues to improve on the trend from last year. The attritional combined ratio for the first quarter improved to 80.4% from 81% for the full year of 2013. Premium volume continues to grow rising 7% over last year. Despite softening in the property cat market, there are still sufficient opportunities for profitable growth for Everest given our scale and financial strength. John will get into further detail in his report, but is evidenced by the improving combined ratio. The growth has come with improving margins, which is partly the result of new products, particularly in the credit and specialty line space. In the property reinsurance lines, where there have been rate reductions would continue to modify our portfolio to achieve the best risk-adjusted return. So, for example, in Canada, where rates were going up for property catastrophe exposed lines, we committed more capacity. Likewise in other territories, we reduced our move to different layers, our move to pro rata from excess, or we rode different types of product. Of course, we did renew accounts at reduced rates, but only when they met our return hurdles. And in most regions, there is still business at attractive rates. I must emphasize that the ability to diversify and remain flexible is the key to improving margins. An additional tool that has enabled us to improve our net position is our capital markets platform, Mt. Logan. This has enabled us to increase our share across many programs and bring new product to market. While at the same time earned fees and profit share on the business sourced. A key value of our global franchise is being able to marry the risk appetite of the capital markets, with a global, well-diversified source of business, constructed by best-in-class underwriting and analytical skills. There are not many that can duplicate this value proposition. You also no doubt saw that we recently came to market for cap-on placement. This is another capital market vehicle allowing us to leverage our underwriting ability and marketing reach across a larger capital base. This transformation of our business at least for now is about capital management. Capital is now available in many forms. And while this can cause us to reshape our capital structure, one thing is constant, developing business, underwriting that business, producing contracts and paying claims. These additional forms of capital provide more options for managing our equity base and funding growth. We are flexible and adaptive to change that can add value to customers and shareholders. You have also heard us speak about our insurance operations as another source of business that can be a diversifying risk. For these reasons we have continued to increase our emphasis in building this business out further while remaining focused on improving results. In the first quarter results we are clearly seeing the early signs of this progress with a 98.2% combined ratio. Same time, we have already expanded into new products and territories. And excluding crop insurance which was down in the quarter, our insurance book grew 10% in the first quarter. Craig will explain the adjustment in crop premiums (first) quarter. Our crop business remains an important part of our strategy, but we will face some downward pressure on the premium side in part because of the decline in commodity prices from last year. Nevertheless, our plan is to grow our footprint as diversification is key to developing and managing a profitable book in this sector. As we move forward, the significance of emphasizing underwriting profitability in all segments takes on even greater importance as investment income continues to come under pressure. In the low rate environment and in a business where asset allocation is closely followed by rating agencies, there are limited options. We were an – early adopters of different asset allocation strategies which has kept our returns amongst the best in the sector. However, given constraints, we are not expecting dramatic changes from here. Nevertheless, we will continue to be active but prudent in terms of allocation. Despite these headwinds, whether it is a tough rate environment, third party capital, with declining investment income, we have another terrific quarter with net income of almost $300 million and return on capital of 17%. And we would expect this to continue through the remainder of the year absent any significant events. With these results and our focus on managing capital we are pleased to be able to return to shareholders $285 million in the first quarter through share repurchase and dividends. This is a record for us in any one quarter. And we are committed to returning capital consistent with the needs of the business. Thank you and now to Craig for the financial highlights.
Craig Howie - Chief Financial Officer: Thank you, Dom and good morning everyone. We are pleased to report that Everest had another strong quarter of earnings with after-tax operating income of $281 million or $5.93 per diluted common share for the first quarter of 2014, this compares to operating income of $301 million or $5.88 per share for the first quarter of 2013. Net income for the first quarter was $294 million or $6.21 per diluted share, compared to $384 million or $7.50 per share in 2013. Net income includes realized capital gains and represents an annualized return on equity of over 17%. These results were driven by a solid underwriting result offset by lower net investment income compared to the first quarter of 2013. The results reflect the continued improvement in the overall current year attritional combined ratio of 80.4%, down from 80.7% at the first quarter of 2013 and down from 81.0% at year end 2013. This measure excludes the impact of catastrophes reinstatement premiums and prior period loss development. The total reinsurance attritional combined ratio was 77.3% compared to 76.8% in the prior year first quarter. The slight increase in this ratio for the reinsurance portfolio was anticipated after the January 1 renewals and with the additional pro rata business written. The insurance segment attritional combined ratio was 97.2% compared to 98.5% in the prior year. However, eliminating the effects of the primary crop book, this ratio would have been 92.8% compared to 95.9% in the prior year. All segments reported underwriting gains for the quarter. Neither this year, nor last year included any catastrophe losses in the first quarter. Total reinsurance reported an underwriting gain of $215 million for the quarter compared to $210 million underwriting gain last year. The insurance segment reported an underwriting gain of $4 million for the quarter compared to an underwriting gain of $193,000 last year. Each year reflected an underwriting loss for crop insurance in the first quarter due to the seasonality of crop premium. Earned premium for crop insurance declined at $17 million in the first quarter of 2014 compared to last year. The estimated premium was adjusted to reflect the lower-than-expected premium for the winter crop season due to the re-underwriting of the book and commodity price reductions year-over-year. Based on current prices, we expect the crop premium to decline for the full year of 2014 as well compared to 2013. Mt. Logan Re’s financial position and operating results were consolidated into Everest beginning July 1, 2013. These results were included in a separate segment and reflected a $10 million underwriting gain in the first quarter of 2014. Everest retained $2 million of income and $8 million was attributable to the non-controlling interests of this entity. The overall underwriting gain for the group was $228 million for the quarter compared to an underwriting gain of $210 million in the same period last year. Our reported combined ratio was 80.0% for the quarter compared to 80.7% in 2013. Our low expense ratio of 4.4% continues to be a major competitive advantage. On reserves, our overall quarterly internal reserving metrics remained favorable. For investments, pre-tax investment income was $123 million for the quarter on our $16.8 billion investment portfolio. Investment income declined $23 million from one year ago. This decrease was primarily driven by the decline in the limited partnership result for the quarter, although low reinvestment rates and capital used to redeem stock and debt also contributed. Limited partnership investments resulted in a loss of $2 million for the quarter compared to a $17 million gain in the first quarter of 2013. Our existing limited partnership portfolio was fairly mature and we are starting to see a decline in current gains coming from these investments. Despite the declining rates, our investment portfolio continues to perform well. The pre-tax yield on the overall portfolio was 3.1% with the duration of just over three years. The quarter reflected $13 million of net after-tax realized capital gains compared to $83 million last year. These gains are mainly attributable to fair value adjustments on the equity portfolio. There were $2 million of derivative losses during the first quarter compared to $15 million of derivative gains last year. This is related to our equity put options and is a function of the change in interest rates during the fourth quarter. On income taxes, the 13.8% effective tax rate on operating income is in line with our expected tax rate for the year. Stable cash flow continues with operating cash flows of $367 million for the quarter compared to $259 million in 2013. This is despite the high level of catastrophe loss payments over the past few years. Shareholders’ equity for the group was $7 billion at the end of the first quarter, up $69 million from year end 2013. This is after taking into account capital return through the $250 million share buybacks and the $35 million dividends paid in the first quarter of 2014. Book value per share increased 4% to $152.80 from $146.57 at year end 2013. Our strong capital position leaves us with capacity to maximize our business opportunities as well as continue share repurchases. Thank you. And now John Doucette, our Chief Underwriting Officer will provide the operations review.
John Doucette - Chief Underwriting Officer: Thank you, Craig. Good morning. As Dom highlighted we had a strong start to the 2014 year. Our group first quarter 2014 gross written premium was $1.3 billion, up $90 million from Q1 of last year with growth coming predominantly from U.S. reinsurance and international reinsurance. For our reinsurance segments total reinsurance gross written premium including Logan was $1.04 billion for the quarter, up 12% from Q1 last year. As mentioned on the last earnings call, we continued to benefit from flight-to-quality, rolling out new products, expanding our relationships with some larger clients and writing U.S. property exposures domestically as we leverage the competitive advantage of our high ratings and significant capacity. We have continued to make progress in our multi-line initiative in the USA developing new relationships and broadening existing relationships with multi-line clients as our underwriters relationships with those clients go back for many years sometimes decades. In Q1 we deployed capacity to fund several short tailed quota share treaties at terms we found attractive. Expanded our purple lightings and continued to deploy capacity this quarter in credit related opportunities. Total reinsurance including Logan bottom line we had a very solid quarter with underwriting profits of $225 million, up 7% compared to last year Q1 underwriting profits. Now, some color on April 1 reinsurance renewals. For our overall reinsurance book, we grew our global property gross written premium and continued to see dollar margin expansion in the overall book at 41 compared to last year. With the combined ratio and the expected risk adjusted returns remaining flat from the prior period. This demonstrates the strength and the diversification of our business. That said, specifically for Japan our premium dollars in Japan were down from last year due to the following reasons. The continued consolidation trend among of longstanding clients result in an emerged reinsurance treaties and in some cases less pro rata premium. Japanese exchange rates caused the decrease in gross written premium in U.S. dollars. And rate decreases on Japanese excess of loss treaties of 10% to 15%. Turning to our overall casualty reinsurance book globally, while primary rates remain attractive seeding commissions on casualty quota share treaties are still under pressure. Therefore we remain cautious of deploying capacity on risks, which appear to have heavy competition. Nonetheless, we continue to find new insurance and reinsurance products and new deals where we can and deploy our capacity at attractive risk adjusted rates. Through the first quarter and at 41 we continued to rollout and utilize Mt. Logan Re and saw these benefits at each renewal as it allowed us to deploy larger lines on attractively priced treaties and provide more capacity to targeted clients, while containing our PMLs. We are pleased to report that with additional capital raised at 41, Logan is now in excess of $400 million in AUM. And again 100% of the Logan capacity is fully deployed. This success continues to highlight the significant value proposition we bring to our capital market investor partners in Logan while being completely seamless to our clients who continued to deal with the same core reinsurance trading partner Everest as they have for many years. This smooth flexible deployment of capacity to our clients has helped us secure better signings on many non-cat exposed classes as more of our clients look to have broader and deeper relationships with pure high-quality re-insurers. In addition to Logan, we have initiated other PML and capital management strategies. As Dom mentioned, we recently obtained $450 million of fully collateralized catastrophe reinsurance coverage funded in the cap-on market. This coverage was purchased through Kilimanjaro Re across two layers. One layer is in a current space deal providing tail protection for Southeastern USA wind risk and the other layer is an aggregate cover for providing tail protection for all natural perils in the U.S. and Puerto Rico as well as British Columbia earthquake risk in Canada. The combination of Logan cap-ons and other reinsurance and retrocessional protections from both traditional and alternative markets allows us to match our portfolio of risks to the best capital structure. This in turn allows us to broaden our product offerings and our value proposition both to our clients and to our shareholders. With this flexibility on how and where we deploy our underwriting capacity combined with flexibility of the form of our capital structure to mange those same risks, we believe we can and will continue to improve our risk adjusted returns and improve our cost of capital. In the end, we are pleased with our Q1 reinsurance results and continue to nimbly identify, execute, and deploy capital to profitable opportunities across the global reinsurance market. Turning to our insurance operations, our premium was $230 million in Q1, down from last year’s Q1 gross written premium of $250 million. However, this decrease is primarily driven by premium adjustments for Heartland’s crop book for the reasons, which Greg mentioned. Stripping out Heartland premium, our insurance operations GWP is up 10% year-over-year for Q1 with most other insurance segments showing growth reflecting the impact of the initiatives we have put in place over the last couple of years. We continue to see profitable growth opportunities in many areas and we have been successful growing in those areas that we have targeted, including non-program workers’ comp, casualty, specialty lines, property, E&S and DIC, non-standard auto and accident and health. We continue to see primary rate improvements in almost all insurance segments. However, we have seen some weakening in some of the professional insurance lines, where we remain cautious in our deployment of capacity. Our California Workers’ Comp book saw an average of 8% rate increases in the first quarter continuing the significant rate increases for the last several years providing a compound rate increase in excess of 60% over the last five years. We continue to see profitable growth and positive rate increases in our property E&S and DIC books and see that expanding throughout the rest of 2014 as primary rates have been holding across this book. Bottom line, our reported insurance results were positive with a 98% combined ratio for the first quarter. And after eliminating the effects of Heartland, the combined ratio was 94%, down 2 points when viewing Q1 2013 on a comparable basis. We are pleased with the underlying trends in our insurance book as we begin to see the positive results of our initiatives over the last several years with noted improvements in both loss ratios and expense ratios. In summary, around the globe, we have viewed not only as a lead re-insurer in all P&C lines of business, but also as a creative problem solver and we continue to be given the opportunity with our broker partners to structure new deals, new products, and alternative solutions for many of our corporate and insurance clients. Thus, we remain very bullish on our future. Thank you and now back to Beth for Q&A.
Beth Farrell - Vice President, Investor Relations: Yes. Augusta, we are open for questions now.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from Jay Gelb of Barclays.
Jay Gelb - Barclays: Thank you. On the insurance segment with the 94 combined ratio excluding Heartland in the first quarter, would you anticipate is that sort of the right run rate we should anticipate for the rest of the year barring any usual items?
Dom Addesso: Jay, this is Dom. That certainly would be a reasonable assumption. It could improve from there, but due to continued improvement in California comp, but that’s a reasonable assumption.
Jay Gelb - Barclays: Including the crop book would be a couple of points higher all-in?
Dom Addesso: The crop book actually for the year we are still anticipating at this point mid 90s combined, so low 90s combined depending on the outcome of winter wheat, but generally we are expecting the overall number to gravitate towards the mid 90s on an accident year basis.
Jay Gelb - Barclays: The next issue is on partnership income, Craig, I think you mentioned that were – that part of the decline was reflecting the book seasoning. So just trying to get a perspective on for the remaining quarters, maybe what we should be penciling in, in terms of partnership return?
Craig Howie: Well, as I said, we are starting to see a slight decline, because they are become fairly mature, but as you noticed even over the last several quarters, it has started to come down. This quarter we happen to have one partnership that threw off a loss of over $5 million, which is what was driving the $2 million loss in the quarter, but it has been coming down over the last several quarters.
Jay Gelb - Barclays: Right. So in the back half of last year when it was running in that kind of $5 million…
Craig Howie: $5 million for quarter.
Jay Gelb - Barclays: Yes.
Craig Howie: I think that’s probably a better estimate, Jay.
Jay Gelb - Barclays: Okay, that’s helpful. And then Dom, do you have any thoughts or commentary on the recent movement we have seen in Bermuda between Endurance and Aspen, has that changed your view at all on M&A in Bermuda or anticipating any sort of increased consolidation beyond that transaction?
Dom Addesso: Well, I didn’t expect that question right out of the gate. I think first of all let me say, it certainly would be inappropriate for me to comment on the transaction per se and I know that’s not what you are asking about, but clearly I think that as we have been discussing in some of our opening comments, we have benefited by, for example, by our scale and our strength in the marketplace and our capital position. And I think in part if this transaction or transactions like this are in fact an attempt to achieve a different level of scale in the marketplace. So, it doesn’t surprise me, not particularly this transaction, but that we would see transactions like this bubble up in the marketplace for that reason. The other reasons I really wouldn’t be in a position to comment on, but I do think that’s in part what’s driving this particular idea and perhaps ideas like this in the future.
Jay Gelb - Barclays: I appreciate that. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from the Vinay Misquith of Evercore.
Vinay Misquith - Evercore: Hi, good morning. So, first just the numbers questions, curious how much was the crop insurance negative adjustment, I believe you mentioned $17 million, so was that for the earned premiums, so was the adjustment $17 million or what the premiums down $17 million?
Dom Addesso: The earned premium was down $17 million. The net premium that was written is down $30 million for the quarter.
Vinay Misquith – Evercore: Sorry. And what was the impact of – just the adjustment for the entire $40 million, sorry?
Dom Addesso: Down $15 million.
Vinay Misquith – Evercore: Okay. So down $15 million, okay, fine. That’s the adjustment, okay. Second is we have seen that citizens has upsized take at bond significantly, what do you think is going to happen on the June 1 renewals for Florida?
Dom Addesso: Well, certainly there is downward pressure in the overall property cat space depending on the territory. And given how well that market is still priced, we certainly would expect that pressure to carryover into Florida. In terms of our prediction as to how much, well, we will just have to wait and see. We are not prognosticating at this point. No, for us, we write on an XOL basis about $130 million in Florida and then the remainder of our exposure is on a pro rata basis. And as we said again in our opening comments, if rates are down, but still meet our return hurdles, yes, we may do some continuing XOL, but it more likely be that perhaps we would ship some of our capacity to quota share. And again it depends on what the market is willing to give us from this June.
Vinay Misquith - Evercore: Okay, that’s helpful. And just one last numbers question I believe the tax rate 13.8% that I hear correctly that you expect, yes, and I believe you mentioned that you expect that for the entire year. Historically, I thought it was between 12% and 13%, so curious why you expect a higher tax rate for this year? Thanks.
Dom Addesso: 13.8% is an effective tax rate that we would expect for the year that rate could even go up from there as we have talked about in the past specifically on the last quarter call that if there are no catastrophes for the year that rate could even go up. That’s with an expected amount of catastrophes for the year.
Vinay Misquith - Evercore: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question is …
Dom Addesso: Excuse me, one other point, keep in mind that, that in your assumptions that rate does have to move with cat losses, so you can take the rate up without taking expected cat losses down, correct.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll go next to Michael Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs: Thanks. Wouldn’t just I know we – it sounds like we got some pieces per crop, but would it be possible just to get the 1Q premium for crop and then the combined ratio for crop for the first quarter?
Dom Addesso: 1Q premium for crop was minus 15% for gross written premium.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs: Okay.
Dom Addesso: And I’m sorry your second question was…
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs: The earn premium, I mean, I guess the earned premium that rolled into revenues?
Dom Addesso: The earned premium that you would see in the first quarter for crop is only about $2 million.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs: Okay, got it. Great, thanks. And then the question about the California comp book, can you talk about the rate you took in remind us what the rate you took in 2013 and where loss churn was there and where you are booking comps today on an action in here on an initial pick basis?
Dom Addesso: I’ll let Craig give you the last year information, but right now for California comp on an accident year basis, we are in the mid 90s.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs: Accident year combined?
Dom Addesso: Yes.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs: Okay, got it. Great.
Dom Addesso: I don’t know if Craig is looking for some of the information…
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs: Okay, great. And then if I can just ask one more. So in Bermuda, is it possible to know and I realize it to blended book and probably there is some – there is some composition change to it, but is it possible to get an idea of what the year-over-year change in pricing or rate was in that book?
Dom Addesso: You are talking about….
Michael Nannizzi – Goldman Sachs: Roughly.
Dom Addesso: What property cat, because Bermuda is a mixture of property and casualty, so it’s a little tough to answer that question.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs: Well, let me get to the base of my question. So the part I am trying to understand is the attritional loss ratio was flattish year-over-year and it’s been down on a year-over-year basis for the last few quarters. And I am just trying to understand just given generally that there has been some pressure in reinsurance pricing how does that factoring, because if it were just typical primary insurance or something very simple, you have reductions in pricing that would cause your combined ratio to rise, but it seems like we have absorbed is the market some declines in pricing, but that attritional ratio has been flat. I am guessing there is some mix change in there or something I am just trying to reconcile that?
Dom Addesso: It’s exactly that. It’s the mix change. They can move in and out of retro business depending on what we do, out of London and some of those transactions, it’s essentially mix change which is driving that.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs: Right. So, I mean – so, is it fair to assume that if all else equal if you have this environment and you have mix change, which it allows you to keep your attritional flat, does that mean that you are taking more risk per unit of premium that you are collecting?
Dom Addesso: Well, first of all, keep in mind that on a gross written premium basis, Bermuda was down year-over-year.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs: Yes.
Dom Addesso: And I think it’s a reflection of when we say a mix change, it’s kind of we would like to emphasize over and over is that we have the capacity, the willingness and the ability to actually change our mix and move from one class of business to another, one layer to another always trying to achieve the best risk-adjusted return. So that’s really what we are striving to do and in times you will see a segment like Bermuda, for example, perhaps slip in premium, because we are backing away from certain class of business that aren’t giving us the right return.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs: Right. I mean, if we are in an environment where if there continues to be challenges in the reinsurance market, is it possible to just keep that attritional loss ratio flat even with pressure just, are there some limitations of mix that will cause at some point that attritional loss ratio to start to rise?
Dom Addesso: There is always that potential. And it all depends on how fast and how far rate decreases are and what we back away from in terms of business that doesn’t meet our return hurdle. So, yes, if you would want to continue to write the same book of business, year-in and year-out, yes, attritionals will rise. On the other hand, if you move into different new products, different geographies change attachment point, use the capital markets potentially. I mean, there is lots of ways in which we can maintain our profitability throughout difficult, which you are describing as a difficult market.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs: Great, thank you very much for answering those questions. I appreciate it.
Operator: We will go next to Amit Kumar of Macquarie.
Amit Kumar - Macquarie: Thanks and good morning. Just a few quick follow-up questions. First of all, going back to the Florida piece, you mentioned that your XOL piece is $130 million, is the remainder $70 million or so or am I thinking of the total Florida book wrongly?
Dom Addesso: Our Florida pro rata is approximately it would be another couple of $100 million or in total – sorry, in total it would be $280 million roughly, that’s XOL and pro rata.
Amit Kumar - Macquarie: Got it. That’s helpful. The follow-up to that point is I think last year you had talked about getting preferential signings, you talked about private players, multi-year deals are you seeing that phenomenon for at least this year too or is it much different?
Dom Addesso: I will let John answer that.
John Doucette: Yes, this is John, Amit. Yes, we are seeing that opportunity in some cases private layers, in some cases clearly at 11 and 41 preferential signings, but also new products, new layers, new products with existing clients and new clients. And that answers the prior question about attritional losses as well. It’s our job to figure out how to make money, no matter what market we face. And yes we are seeing the opportunities where we are one of the biggest broker markets in the world and we are getting better and better signings from brokers and clients working with the brokers.
Amit Kumar - Macquarie: And then when you mentioned new clients are the smaller I guess new de-pop entities who exactly are these…?
Dom Addesso: We are not talking just Florida here. We are talking across the entire portfolio globally. So its new clients globally, it’s an with existing clients across the world. Specifically in Florida I mean we have relationships with almost 40 companies and we see how deal that comes into the market and we have been trading with many of those clients for many, many years. And we do have relationships that are not broadly marketed.
Amit Kumar - Macquarie: Got it. That’s quite helpful. The other question I think is a follow-up to Mike’s question on maybe California comp. Did you see any changes in loss cost trends over the past quarter. There has been obviously a lot of debate. A lot of reports have come out on the impact of SB-863. And it seems that impacted very strong the companies presence in the marketplace do you see any changes in your book or has it been sort of a steady state from 2013?
Dom Addesso: We have not yet seen any changes I am not saying we are not out there. But we have maintained – actually we didn’t answer much question earlier about loss cost trends. We have build loss cost trends into projection and that’s typically depending on massive business in the mid to high single digit range so that’s built into our reserve assumptions. And so far that has been sufficient clearly in the most recent accident years. The reserve development we saw in the fourth quarter of last year is primarily older years.
John Doucette: And the answer to Mike’s question was the rate increase for 2013 was 13%. And we were running in the 96 range last year on an accident basis.
Amit Kumar - Macquarie: Got it. The final question?
Dom Addesso: So just to follow-up on that you can see that we – while the combined ratio has not improved to the level of rate increases which means that we are taking some of that obviously into loss cost trend and probably more than as necessary at this point but (indiscernible).
Amit Kumar - Macquarie: That’s good. The final question is probably a follow-up to Jade initial question as you look at your growth prospects your purple on Logan you have talked about different new products I am curious as you sort of look out how do you look at organic growth versus outside opportunities to add to the portfolio?
Dom Addesso: What’s the distinction that you are making between organic growth and outside opportunities.
Amit Kumar - Macquarie: What I am trying to ask is based on all the changes we are seeing recently is it fair to say that probably you don’t need to look at other entities at this juncture?
Dom Addesso: Okay, I am sorry. So right now we do not need to do that and in fact growth strategy at least for us will never be built on an acquisition. It doesn’t mean that we don’t look at many things because as you can well imagine everyone calls us when there is a potential deal out there. But we do not build our growth strategy off of an acquisition. We prefer frankly to build from within so you don’t have to deal with legacy issues, integration issues and nine times out of ten there is limited strategic value to many of the opportunities that we see.
Amit Kumar - Macquarie: Got it. That did answer my question. Thanks. Thanks for the answers and good luck for the future.
Dom Addesso: Thank you.
Craig Howie: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question will come from Meyer Shields with KBW.
Meyer Shields - KBW: Thanks. Dom you talked earlier about the tendency of seeding commissions to go up now, is that trend varying by the size of the seeding, is that different now than it was five or ten years ago?
Dom Addesso: That was John that spoke to that and I don’t know that we are necessarily seeing it differently by size customer. Certainly, it can be influenced by the size of the transaction given that there might be some that are hungrier for premium. That would maybe – could be the only comment I would make about that.
John Doucette: And obviously, this is John, and obviously it is also reflective of the clients’ individual experience. So, lot of cases, whether it’s whatever class of business they are in, if they are spending that results, we see seeding commissions going down. If there has been catastrophes that have hit, there are covers, including pro rata deals, seeding commissions go down. So, really it’s both the macro and the micro situation that drives these.
Meyer Shields - KBW: Okay, that’s helpful. Thank you. And very briefly is there a good proxy we can use of limited partnerships?
Dom Addesso: Well in the past, we have guided people to just the general equity markets. And I think we probably still would say that, that is as good a proxy as you can get and I think it points to what Craig mentioned earlier that in response to another question that our limited partnerships were quite strong last year, but that’s kind of in line with the general equity markets were strong last year. And conversely, the equity markets in the first quarter this year were not quite as strong or flattish. And I think that’s consistent with our limited partnership experience, except for the one. I mean, in our particular case, there was this one LP, which was distorting I think what we would otherwise normally have expected for the quarter. And that we would not expect that going forward. So, I would say that the best proxy you can use is the general equity market – public equity market.
Meyer Shields - KBW: Okay, fantastic. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question will come from Brian Meredith of UBS.
Brian Meredith - UBS: Yes. Couple of quick questions. The first one and my apologies if I missed this, but in the insurance segment, operating expenses were down about 13% year-over-year, was there something unusual that happened there?
Dom Addesso: Just good stewards on the expense side, in part it’s premium growth and frankly that’s most of it and maybe some internal allocations, but nothing dramatic other than premium growth.
Brian Meredith - UBS: Premium right, but actual expenses were down 13% year-over-year.
Dom Addesso: That would be driven by allocation, you include commissions in that.
Brian Meredith - UBS: No.
Dom Addesso: That would just be allocations then.
Brian Meredith - UBS: Okay, thanks. And then Dom and John, I wonder if you could just update or not update or just remind us kind of what’s your thoughts are on Watford Re and then there is a bunch of other companies that are kind of looking into these types of potential facilities, what interest level would an Everest have of potentially doing something like that and what do you think the potential impact is on the casualty markets, reinsurance markets?
Dom Addesso: Well, yes, one of your questions was that we are looking at that as I think probably most of our peer companies are doing. And we haven’t yet determined where we are going with or we have not yet concluded on that analysis yet. And generally it would certainly cause one to think that it could soften the casualty reinsurance market further from where it is now. On the other hand of the types of transactions that are likely to go into these types – into these facilities are not generally – generally already tend to be lower margin type business, lower volatility associated with the class of the business that fit these structures. And so it may not have as dramatic an impact as has been prognosticated by many on the overall capital market. That remains to be seen. I am not sure that any of us really know for sure where that all ends up, but it is something we are looking at. And in fact it can create interesting opportunities for seeding companies frankly that to help them with their cost to capital on transactions and they in fact create opportunities into the reinsurance market space that don’t exist today. We are the casualty space frankly where a lot of companies are holding on seeding less business, increasing mix. Some of these ideas can in fact create transactions that can help their P&L or balance sheet and perhaps a reinsurer can add value and see premium go up in the space. There are a lot of possibilities that can come out of these structures, but we are examining that very closely.
Brian Meredith – UBS: Great. Thanks for answers.
Operator: We will go next to Ian Gutterman of BAM.
Ian Gutterman - BAM: Hi, good morning. I guess a few different questions on different parts of your cap book, just to follow up on the Florida question from earlier, obviously we speculate pressure on extra well which is mentioned, you talked about your book, can you talk about I assume there will be upward pressure on seed-in commissions in quarter two is out there and can you give us the sense of how you think about that?
Dom Addesso: Again there is many, many moving parts to it. There is a current submits to seed-in commissions to the extent and we saw this phenomenon last year to the extent that there was a – to the extent that the reinsurance spanning goes down from some of our clients resulted in more attractive combined ratios including seed-in commission to the reinsurer. So we – as we talked about it on the last couple of calls, we wrote more pro rata business last June. We also wrote more pro rata business at one -one. We wrote another $50 million - $55 million of property pro rata at one-one. And again we crossed our book the combined ratio globally improved.
John Doucette: I wouldn’t expect that the same dynamics that we are expecting be extra well of our market from the introduction of third party capital to have as to no matter can impact on the pro rata market that I think is really what you are getting in.
Ian Gutterman - BAM: Yes, exactly. Okay, great and then as a follow up to that on the extra well side given the talk on how much rates will fall this year, do you feel like we are approaching a bottom or are we near people’s walk away price or if there is another no last year and there is still abundant capacity next year can flow the rate go down another double digits or are we getting closer to walk away point.
Dom Addesso: I don’t know we answered that question certainly if we were to go down to your question, 10 this year and 10 next year, we certainly would be getting very, very close to all walk away point.
Ian Gutterman - BAM: Okay.
Dom Addesso: On a full basis, but again remember that it doesn’t mean that we don’t participate in that market through our platform. If capital markets are willing to come down to those levels then we have the capacity that we can deploy in that fashion or move again to more pro rata. And as we can still stay very, very active in the marketplace and move to other products, move to different attachments points. Perhaps write the business and use the capital markets as a reinsurer, so there are many ways in which this can play out to our benefit frankly going forward.
Ian Gutterman - BAM: Got it. And then that actually leads to the next question on the cap on, I was just confused and maybe this was just nomenclature or something that I don’t quite follow, but is your for US vendors I think $1.2 billion at the 1 and 100 and the cap on, on the index that was referenced had $1.4 billion to $2.1 billion index loss that equated to 1 and 34 to 1 and close to 100, so on the current one you are obviously talking so that I can be comparable, I was curious why index loss at the 1 and 100 is $2.1 billion when your PML 1 and 100 is $1.2 billion are they not comparable for some reason?
John Doucette: Yes, this is John. Basically that’s the (indiscernible) cap-on the mechanics of that really reflect, it’s basically is taking for the current one it’s Southeast states and it basically is taking industry loss events because it’s a PCS trigger. It’s taking industry loss event and then there is effectively market shares by each of those states. And so it’s taking a very big loss and then scaling it down or range of big losses and then scaling it down to the market share. So those are – the short answer is those are two different things, our PMLs and how the mechanics of the bond responds.
Ian Gutterman - BAM: Okay, that does that. I can maybe follow up more from that. That’s what I was trying to get at. And then just….
Dom Addesso: I think, Ian, just bottom line is that purchase of that bond did reduce our PMLs, our 1-in-100.
Ian Gutterman - BAM: Basically the $2.1 billion equates to your $1.2 billion, is that the right way to think about it?
Dom Addesso: It’s not – the $1.2 billion is one point in the curve. The reinsurance we purchased is a special purpose vehicle, Kilimanjaro, that finishes that cap-on is not one point on the curve, it’s across the distribution.
Ian Gutterman - BAM: Okay, got it. Okay. And then just real quick on Mt. Logan, the $36 million in gross premium just knowing the capital deployed is a little over 10% rate online, if my math is correct, is that right?
Dom Addesso: Yes, but remember the $400 million be careful though, the $400 million that we cited as now assets under management that’s a recent number.
Ian Gutterman - BAM: Right, using I think it was 320 million earlier in the year maybe?
Dom Addesso: There is also a accounting recognition of the premium. Over 2014, we would expect it to be higher and more seeded premium in each of the quarters going forward against that capital base.
Ian Gutterman - BAM: Okay. Well, what I was getting at is just I thought normally for fleet collateralizing indeed closer to a 20% rate online to sort of make the math work, is that generally accurate?
Dom Addesso: I think we are trying to build the mousetrap that is maybe different and better than what is out there. And I think the fact that we have been able to go from zero to $400 million in the relatively short of time highlights that we may have a better mousetrap than others that are out there.
Craig Howie: But I do think though that the simple arithmetic that you were trying to do is probably a bit low.
Ian Gutterman - BAM: Got it, okay. I will follow up on that one offline to you. Thanks.
Operator: We will go next to Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley: Good morning. Thank you for taking my call. And I have two questions. One is on the capital structure, another on reserves on the capital structure you have the one of sort of the least levered balance sheet debt to capital ratio less than 7%. And now you have a third-party capital Mt. Logan and cap-ons and what do you think about your equity base of $7 billion. Could you sort of buyback more than you earned like you did this quarter that actually actively reducing your shareholder base?
Dom Addesso: Well, we tend to want to think about share repurchases within the context of earnings. That’s generally has been our approach. And what we are trying to do with our capital in Mt. Logan and the use of cap-ons and other types of third-party capital structures is grow the business. Alright, this is a growth strategy not one in which we are trying to shrink the business. As we have mentioned earlier, we think that our size capital position rating, global franchise and the ability to grow is what perpetuates the good earnings we have been able to produce and good ROEs we have been able to produce. So in all of that context, it really means that it’s to our advantage in the marketplace to the extent that opportunities present themselves to grow our capital base. And when I say grow our capital base that means in all vehicles that we have mentioned meaning our own equity capital, Mt. Logan, use of cap-on structures and other vehicles. But in the context of our equity capital, it is important to us to be the size that we are at. So we think about share repurchases in the context of earnings.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley: So would 100% payout ratio a fair assumption?
Dom Addesso: That depends on the price of our stock. It depends on what opportunities present themselves. It depends on a lot of things. And we don’t give prognostications about what level of shares we are going to be repurchasing, but as you saw we did obviously have $250 million this quarter was a pretty good number for us.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley: Okay. In terms of my second question on reserves and your reserve development has been minimal throughout the past two years and each quarter actually, but if you look underneath, you have some large reserve charges and the insurance operation why you have large reserve releases from your reinsurance operation, then they tend to coincide like in the fourth quarter, I just wonder are those just coincidental that you do big reserves like study at year end? And then following on that is that going forward as you see the past reserve issues in your insurance book gradually well hopefully were diminishing and you said Dom, since you joined Everest you have been focusing on the reserve side setting probably more prudent like setting more cushions in your reserve that is possible we will see sort of these efforts actually playing out in formal favorable development in the future?
Dom Addesso: Yes, hopefully the reserve practices that we have been adopting over the last couple of years I think will hold us in good stead, but we point out that our reserves even prior to we getting here in many years developed favorably, probably less than 9 years come in positive relative to the initial pick. The we do our reserve studies meanly around the year end we do some of the smaller classes of business throughout the year, but the larger material lines, we focus on that in the fourth quarter, certainly if we see anything coming out of the smaller lines of business during the years we can pick some action certainly like we did here in the first quarter with the insurance from the medical amounts side and but insurance has been more of an issue than reinsurance because many of the business we were in were lines of business and those typically many of the business tend to be more problematic than in the ongoing book. And also our insurance lines of business tend to be on overall basis tend to be in the longer tail areas in the reinsurance side. So those are some of the more challenges related to insurance, but we clearly think that we have got control.
Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley: Thank you very much.
Operator: And it appears that’s all the time we have for questions today. And I would like to turn it back to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks.
Dom Addesso - President and Chief Executive Officer: We thank you very much and thanks for your questions. We would like to just say in summary that clearly we think we had a great quarter what some will describe as a challenging environment. We happened to think that the challenges create opportunities for a company like Everest and we have the ability to do different things and respond quickly and appropriately to market conditions that are at our feet today and they certainly won’t be the same tomorrow or two years from now. We appreciate your questions and your support and look forward to seeing everybody in the interim. Thank you.
Operator: That does conclude today’s conference. Thank you all for your participation.

===== 2013 Q4  (2014-02-06 10:30:00) =====
Executives: Beth Farrell - Vice President, Investor Relations Dom Addesso - President and Chief Executive Officer John Doucette - Chief Underwriting Officer Craig Howie - Chief Financial Officer
Analysts: Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Amit Kumar - Macquarie Capital Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank Vinay Misquith - Evercore Greg Locraft - Morgan Stanley Meyer Shields - KBW
Operator: Good day, everyone. Welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2013 Earnings Call of Everest Re Group Limited. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to Beth Farrell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Beth Farrell: Good morning, and welcome to Everest Re Group's fourth quarter and full year 2013 earnings conference call. On the call with me today are Dom Addesso, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer; John Doucette, our Chief Underwriting Officer; and Craig Howie, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I note that statements made during today's call, which are forward-looking in nature, such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations and the like are subject to various risks. As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations. Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements. Now let me turn the call over to Dom.
Dom Addesso: Thanks, Beth. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us this morning. We're very pleased to report record earnings for the fourth quarter and the year. There were many elements of our portfolio that performed very well and others less so. However, with over $1.3 billion in earnings and a 20% ROE, it is a great result overall. Certainly a factor was the absence of any major catastrophe, but it is worth noting that the year was not without losses. In fact, there were $195 million or $170 million net of cap losses during the year. Growth by diversification of 21% or $900 million growth in premium during 2013 enabled the company to draw the reasonable level of loss events, while still expanding margins. New products and growth in many of our traditional lines have all contributed to margin expansion. Growth in our core businesses was noted in treaty casualty, treaty property, facultative and specialty insurance line. In particular, our property strategy continues to be fluid, meaning that we allocate our capacity to those products offering the best return profile. This translates into more primary insurance and some additional pro rata in US reinsurance segment. As cat XOL rates were trending down, we have been shifting to a different product mix. We're moving capacity to the better price layers. The ability to adapt and react quickly to changing market conditions remain the core competency of the Everest team. The continued management of our portfolio mix resulted in a 4 point improvement in the combined ratio to 81%. All of this improvement came in the reinsurance portfolio. On the other hand, our insurance business underperformed relative to our expectation. Crop losses and prior period development overshadowed many underlying improvements in this business. Excluding crop, the underlying accident year combined ratio improved to 94.6% in 2013. John and Craig will go into further details, but in summary, the crop losses were primarily due to a significant decline in the price of corn. Our estimate at the end of the third quarter did not sufficiently take into account yield factors, which were unknown at that time in our larger states. The loss development we continued to see was in lines of business that are some of the most difficult to assess, as can be observed generally in the industry. In fact, much of the development we saw emerged on business we had terminated several years ago. The good news was that our overall reserve position was redundant. And therefore, the specific development had no impact on overall earnings. We continue to feel confident about our overall reserve position, but recognize that any one of our numerous reserve buckets could prove inadequate, while at the same time many others will result in savings. That is the nature of the estimation process within our portfolio of reserves, key to the overall adequacy. Let me finish it up with some commentary on the overall market. As many observers point out, there're many challenges that we face. Nothing new of course to those of us who have been around awhile. Today's headline topics are declining rates and capital markets invasion, but on top of that, a low investment yield environment, and you have a recipe for lower overall returns to the industry. The key is of course not to get your company stuck in the averages. Our performance has been anything, but.  Yes, US cat XOL rates were down in 2013 and at 1/1/, they were down in the 10% to 15% range. However, this view of the market and how it applies to us is too binary or one-dimensional. These factors are just a slice of the market. In other parts of the world, particularly in the loss affected areas, rates were up, and in many other regions, rates were flat. In addition, primary pricing is still holding and we access this business through our direct insurance platform, facultative operations, and through pro rata deals in the reinsurance portfolio. Other examples include new products. As I mentioned previously, we have and will continue to deploy capacity to those areas and others, including new products that provide the best risk-adjusted returns. Yes, the capital market is a factor, but frankly, we see it as a tool, not a threat. John will speak to that when he discusses our facility, which for us is another form of capital that can be used to deliver well underwritten products. Nevertheless, capital market is not a perfect fit for all risks, and this is where company capital can be deployed to new products and risks not well suited to the capital market structure. The world is changing as it always has. It's how one adapts that determines if you can beat the averages. Our business plan and strategy anticipate that we can continue to replicate similar returns to what you have seen over the last two years. Thank you. And now Craig will cover the financial results followed by John Doucette, our Chief Underwriting Officer for the operations review. Craig?
Craig Howie: Thank you, Dom, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report that Everest had a record quarter of earnings, with net income up $365 million or $7.54 per diluted common share. This compares to net income of $59 million or $1.13 per share for the fourth quarter of 2012. Net income includes realized capital gains and losses. For the year, Everest had record net income of $1.3 billion or $25.44 per share compared to $829 million or $15.79 per share in 2012. The 2013 result represents a return on equity of 19.5%. Operating income for the year was $1.1 billion or $21.47 per share. This represents a 58% increase over operating income of $13.62 per share last year. These results were driven by a $480 million increase in underwriting income, representing a 185% increase year-over-year. As you will hear from John Doucette, there're a number of strategic initiatives that are driving these improved results. This increase in underwriting income was partially offset by higher income taxes and lower net investment income compared to 2012. The results continue to reflect the improvement in the overall current-year attritional combined ratio, which has declined a full 4 points from 85.0% to 81.0% for the year. This measure excludes the impact of catastrophes, reinstatement premiums, and prior period loss development. The total reinsurance attritional combined ratio was 75.5% for the year compared to $80.9% in the prior year. The insurance segment attritional combined ratio was 101.4% for the year compared to 100.9% in the prior year. However, removing the crop results, which show a 94.6% attritional combined ratio for the insurance segment compared to 97.2% in 2012. All segments reported increases in premium volume for the year and all reinsurance segments reported underwriting gains for the year. Total reinsurance reported an underwriting gain of $390 million for the quarter compared to $48 million underwriting loss last year. For the year, total reinsurance reported an underwriting gain of $877 million compared to $327 million gain last year. The insurance segment reported an underwriting loss of $156 million for the quarter compared to a loss of $46 million last year. For the year, the insurance segment reported an underwriting loss of $147 million compared to a loss of $68 million in 2012. The 2013 results reflected prior period reserve development and the crop loss for the year. John will discuss the crop insurance results in more detail. Mt. Logan Re's financial position and operating results were consolidated into Everest beginning July 1, 2013. These results were included in a separate segment and reflected a $9 million underwriting gain for 2013. Everest retained $3 million of the income and $6 million was attributable to the non-controlling interest of this entity. The overall underwriting gain for the group was $238 million for the quarter compared to an underwriting loss of $94 million in the same period last year. For 2013, the underwriting gain was $739 million compared to a gain of $259 million in 2012. These results reflect $30 million of current year catastrophe losses in the fourth quarter of 2013 related to Typhoon Fitow compared with $325 million of cats in the fourth quarter of 2012 related to Sandy. For the year, catastrophe losses were $195 million in 2013 compared to $410 million in 2012. Our reported combined ratio was 84.5% for the year 2013 compared to 93.8% in 2012. On reserves, we completed our annual loss reserve studies. The results of the studies indicated that overall reserves remained adequate. In the fourth quarter, we booked the prior year development in the insurance segment, which was more than offset by favorable development in the reinsurance segment. The $125 million of prior year reserve development in the insurance segment is largely related to workers' compensation, construction liability and umbrella business. The construction liability and umbrella were programs the company discontinued several years ago. The $142 million of favorable prior-year development in the reinsurance segments mostly related to treaty casualty and treaty property business both in the United States and internationally. These redundancies have developed over time, but we don't react until the position becomes more mature. We continue to hold our estimates for the more recent years. Our investments pre-tax investment income was $126 million for the quarter and $549 million for the year on our $16.6 billion investment portfolio. Both the quarter and the year investment income amounts were below last year, as anticipated. This result was primarily driven by the low interest rate environment, the decline in limited partnership income and the amount of cash flow used for share buybacks and the redemption of debt. However, for our investment strategy that diversify into high yield bonds and dividend paying stocks enabled us to exceed our planned investment income for the year. The increased allocation to equities was also a benefit to net income, as the year reflected $197 million of net after-tax realized capital gains compared to $140 million last year. These gains are mainly attributable to fair value adjustments on the equity portfolio. On income taxes, the effective tax rate is primarily driven by lower than planned catastrophe losses in the year, resulting in higher than expected taxable income for the year. For 2013, operating income effective tax rate was 14.9%. This 14.9% effective tax rate for the year is in line with our expectations and yield with much lower than planned cat losses, as mentioned last quarter. Total cash flow continues with operating cash flows of $1.1 billion for the year compared to $695 million in 2012. This is primarily due to our premium growth and lower catastrophe loss payment. As you previously hear, Mt. Logan Re successfully completed its initial capital raise and now has over $360 million of assets under management. This serves to validate Mt. Logan's business model, as investors recognize the value proposition of partnering up with a leading global reinsurer. Shareholders' equity for the group was $7 billion at the end of 2013, up 3.5% compared to $6.7 billion balance at year-end 2012. This is after taking into account capital return for $622 million for share buybacks and $107 billion of dividends paid in 2013. The company announced a 56% increase in its regular quarterly dividend and paid $0.75 per share in the fourth quarter. Additionally, we repurchased another $28 million of stock after the year-end close. These purchases will be effected in the first quarter 2014 financial systems. Book value per share increased 12% to $146.57 from $130.96 at year-end 2012. Our strong capital position leaves us with capacity to maximize our potential business opportunities as well as continued share repurchases. Thank you. And now John Doucette will provide the operations review.
John Doucette: Thank you, Craig, and good morning. As Dom highlighted, we had a solid Q4, finishing a successful year. Our group 2013 gross written premium was $5.2 billion, up $908 million from 2012, with growth coming from all segments of the reinsurance and insurance. For our reinsurance segments, total reinsurance gross written premium was up 21% in 2013, with new opportunities globally, and all reinsurance segments had increasing gross written premium led by our US reinsurance segment up 38%. We benefited both from a continued [ph] credit quality and Everest being one of the leading US domestic property reinsurers. With over 50% of the global property cat premium emanating from the US, this is an important sustainable competitive advantage for Everest. We write US cat business from the US with the ability to seamlessly provide capacity in any form, excess or loss, pro rata, pro risk, all underwritten by the same underwriting team. We grew topline on several attractively priced treaties with clients seeking capacity exclusively from domestic traditional reinsurers. In particular, we wrote several large multi-line treaties with US regional companies, a targeted market for us. Total reinsurance bottomline had a $549 million improvement in underwriting profits for the year to $877 million, benefiting from the successful rollout of new product initiatives such as Purple, Everest's pillared product; increased capacity to property pro rata deals where we saw improvement in original pricing, terms and conditions; and new credit related opportunities in multiple places. Globally, we saw the benefit of Mt. Logan Re in 2013, as we chose to deploy larger lines on deals and increased our cat capacity for key clients. Logan allowed us to manage our net P&L, while growing our topline and having additional flexible capital management such as Logan gives us more flexibility to manage our P&L before winter season. As Dom said, we view capital markets more as a tool than a true competitor. In several cases, providing clients with more property capacity resulted in securing better signings on deals we wanted in other classes. As a leading multi-class reinsurer, we have the ability and expertise to underwrite all lines of P&C business. This is important to note as less than 25% of our overall business is property catastrophe related. We wrote several new prop reinsurance and weather deals globally and these performed well in 2013. We continue to develop capabilities here and view weather and agriculture as long-term strategic core competencies. In 2013, we also wrote some large quote shares both internationally and in the US across various lines. These were strategic transactions with some large global clients. The premium on these deals has not yet been fully reflected in earnings. We continue to execute on several large one-off transactions from new and existing clients, which require significant reinsurance structuring capabilities, the ability to combine underwriting skill sets across multiple lines of business, manuscript policy awarding expertise, and global capabilities with multiple jurisdictional expertise and paper. We can bring all of this to bear and our ability to execute nimbly and in size with a highly rated balance sheet has been a key differentiator in this competitive market. Globally, we deployed more fac capacity, increasing shares on well rated program and enhancing our product offering to our fac and treaty clients. To summarize, we are a leading global multi-line reinsurer and we have the culture and organizational structure to react quickly to changing market dynamics and identify strategic opportunities that can enhance the long-term franchise of the group. Now turning to insurance operation, our premium grew by $195 million in 2013, primarily driven by crop, workers' comp, non-standard auto, property E&S and casualty. However, insurance calendar year results underperformed, as Craig indicated, driven by prior year loss development and a difficult US crop season. The result was an underwriting loss of $147 million. Our crop insurance had an underwriting loss of $57 million in Q4, resulting in an underwriting loss of $68 million in 2013. This was driven by fall in commodity prices, particularly corn, as well as final crop yields that were lower than we originally expected and even what we expected a quarter ago. We saw crop yields fall below average in some areas, where we have a large footprint such as Southern Minnesota due to excess moisture, and in Texas due to abnormally dry conditions in the areas we write in. We anticipate improved underwriting results in our crop book in 2014 as we continue to build out a more diversified geographic footprint, increased operating efficiencies and roll out new systems. As I stated earlier, ag and weather are long-term strategic focuses for us and the crop business we write through this platform complements that well. We have a great team at Heartland. We believe that under more normalized circumstances, our crop insurance book will achieve profitable growth along with our ag and weather reinsurance products. Our California workers' comp book saw a 13% rate increases in 2013, continuing the double-digit rate increases for the last several years, providing a compound rate change of over 60% since 2009. Workers' comp writings increased $50 million, mostly from rate increases. Our current accident year workers' comp combined ratio is in the mid-90%s. Our non-standard auto book grew nicely, given broader geographic mix and economies of scale. And our property E&S book continued to see rate increases, growing over $30 million in 2013 with additional geographic diversification. Our financial institution book remains profitable, but growth was flat as we remain cautious in light of increased competition. Our casualty and environmental facilities achieved rate increases throughout 2013 and we grew these books. Other recent insurance initiatives, including our primary A&H, Canadian insurance and contingency business, all continued to enhance the capabilities with new hires, new products and new distribution channels and are poised for profitable growth in 2014 and beyond. Finally, some color on January 1st reinsurance renewals, which represents approximately 45% of our annual reinsurance premiums. Some key themes we saw at one-one. First, it has become a stratified reinsurance market of haves and have-nots. Everest is solidly in haves and we have found new business opportunities, had strong signings on existing treaties and in some cases differential pricing. Second, there has been a globalization and consolidation of treaties by several global insurers seeking to both narrow their reinsurance panel to improve security, but also diversify their credit exposure with a broader panel of high-quality reinsurers. This has generally been positive for companies such as Everest with strong ratings and high quality balance sheet. Third, we are successfully competing with and winning against non-traditional capacity everywhere. In many instances, Everest won placements despite offering higher prices due to our ratings and diversified 40-year-plus franchise, the breadth of our trading relationships with clients globally and our ability to tailor solutions to meet clients' needs and to design products that benefit from structural advantages we have over competitors, which have all proven to be significant competitive advantages. Furthermore, unlike the non-traditional markets, Everest's promises to pay does not expire, nor do we force a collateral release mechanism into products earlier than the natural expiry of the liabilities being reinsured. Specifically, on one-one renewals, casualty was challenging, especially pro rata, due to demand for expanded terms and conditions. As a result, we did withdraw from some contracts and deployed capacity at higher layers on others. On the other hand, despite headlines on property conditions, we had a successful renewal of our property portfolio globally. Net written premiums for property grew by $150 million this January 1. Over all territories and all products, our property book combined ratio increased by a couple of points at one-one, but we still saw margin expansion across the whole book at this renewal, as we continue to grow at what we consider to still be attractive returns. Across all classes, we grew reinsurance premium by $300 million or 18% on our one-one reinsurance removal block. And our net reinsurance premium grew by 6%. We accomplished this growth by expanding shares with existing clients on desirable treaty layers, plugging new call to shares at attractive terms and conditions and increasing our marketing of new product and deploying capacity to them. For example, our Purple premium was up significantly at one-one 2014, as our long-term clients clearly preferred to buy this product from Everest's highly rated traditional balance sheet. The ability to flexibly move between products has been critical to our one-one success. We trade with our clients in many different products in every P&C line of business around the world. We are not beholding to excess of loss or pro rata, nor to reinsurance, retro or insurance. And we will dynamically reallocate capacity to where the best risk-adjusted returns exist. We are not restricted to any product class, premium size. And we continue to roll out many new insurance and reinsurance products in 2014. Thank you and now back to Beth for Q&A.
Beth Farrell: We are open to questions now.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) We will move to our first question from Michael Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs: In the insurance segment, I am just wondering if we could talk about what book specifically, what year that related to, and can you tell us in the case of the affected books, what is total case in IB&R that you are currently holding? Thanks.
Dom Addesso:  Michael, the first part of your question kind of cut out. Could you just again --?
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs:   The reserve development in your insurance segment, you mentioned work comp, construction, and umbrella, so could you give us some color on what accident year is that related to? And just from a magnitude perspective, what's the total case in IB&R that you're currently holding after development for those books?
Dom Addesso: In the insurance segment, we had about approximately $45 million of development in work comp, a little over $40 million in construction liability, and $17 million in umbrella. The construction liability and the umbrella, those are programs that we discontinued several years ago, so that should not be something that we see in our future results. In the workers' comp, part of the development related back to some earlier years, the early part of the 2000 period when we first got into the program, and it's just a matter of some severity in a handful of clients that we saw from the early part of the decade. We also though did see some increase of frequency of some smaller claims in the later years, primarily in '09, '10, and '11, I believe. And in that particular case, what we've seen in that increased frequency has been contemplated in the more recent accident years, so our more recent accident years do reflect that increased frequency, and I might point out those most recent accident years are profitable.
John Doucette: Mike, I just wanted to add that the majority of the workers' compensation adverse development came from years before our rate increases started to kick in four years ago. We've been getting double-digit rate increases since then as well.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs: Has that been related to case reserves or do you still hold IB&R for those older years?
Dom Addesso: We still hold IB&R for those, yes. I don't know that we have our disposal right this minute, but it is a split between case and IB&R, so --.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs: And then have you had any adverse development, you mentioned, Dom, recent years, was that comp or I'm just curious, because we've heard some commentary about recent professional liability years. Have you seen any adverse development either in recent comp or recent professional liability years specifically?
Dom Addesso: No, we have not seen any development in recent years for professional liability in particular. As I mentioned, the comp where we saw the development on the insurance side was really in the more recent years, was '09, '10, and '11.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs: On the renewal comment, this is for John, you seem pretty optimistic about opportunities in property cat. I'm just curious, how are you thinking about opportunities heading into mid-year renewals? I mean do you think that your structure, your market position, or some other differentiator is allowing you to achieve terms in pricing that are materially better than the market? Thanks.
John Doucette: Michael, as we talked about, I think each of us talked about it in a different way on our crafted response, we do believe that we have given our balance sheet, given our market position, given how we access US catastrophe business and the ability to dynamically move between different structures around the globe that we do have an opportunity to get better than market results. As you may recall, we increased our quota share writings in June and July, and we also increased quota share writings at 1/1, as well as moving -- repositioning the book to better lines that we like that more attractive prices.
Dom Addesso: Mike, let me add to that. In many cases, we're not necessarily going to get different terms and conditions in market pricing, but there are unique circumstances where with certain clients, we have longstanding relationships, the terms that we do get may be different than the market. So I wouldn't say that it's universally in every particular offering that we get terms different than the market. But as John is pointing out, were those terms come to us and it doesn't hit our pricing targets, then we begin to allocate our capacity into other places, whether that be pro rata, facultative, or into the primary space. So even if terms and conditions are at the market, we still have the ability to not take those terms and conditions, and we can move our capacity into different lines or segments.
Operator: We'll move next to Amit Kumar with Macquarie Capital.
Amit Kumar - Macquarie Capital: I guess two quick follow-ups to the previous question. You had mentioned that some of that piece was from some of the run-off lines. Can you expand on that piece or is that also related to the comp piece?
Dom Addesso: It is not related to the comp piece. These are separate programs. As I mentioned, part of it was construction liability, in particular one program where it's a landscaper's program and because of the additionally insured endorsement that we had on many of those policies, what we are seeing is an increase in expense even though you wouldn't normally expect landscapers to be brought into a construction liability claim, but because of the additional insured endorsement, they are being brought into those matters and it is mostly an expense or defense issue. The umbrella program again is one that we cancelled a while ago. And again, that umbrella, as you probably know, is a very volatile class of business and we've got hit this year with several large claims, which caused us to increase our estimates in some of the older years.
Amit Kumar - Macquarie Capital: What should give us comfort that this might be hopefully this is the last time that this noise sort of surfaces? What will you say to that?
John Doucette: Well, I guess, Amit, I would say that it's not going to be noise at all. We had $10 billion of reserves. We actually reported an overall reserve redundancy coming through the numbers. And because I've mentioned on previous calls, we manage some 200 different reserve buckets. And there are pluses and minuses in all of those buckets each and every year. These estimates in these particularly are well within the actuarial ranges. It's not anything unusual to those of us that have been around the reserving process for a long, long time that I've been. But I think we're proud to point out that our overall reserve position as a group is positive and our accident year development, if you go back in time for the entity, has been a pretty stellar record relative to how each accident year has ultimately developed at the group level.
Dom Addesso: But here again, you're managing a portfolio and you have individual buckets or lines of business that sometimes develop poorly. And on the other hand, offsetting that would be lines of business that develop redundancy. That is the nature of the beast.
Amit Kumar - Macquarie Capital: The discussion on the increasing cat premiums growth on 18% and net 6%, do you have corresponding P&L numbers, which might have been update post-renewals?
Dom Addesso: Well, we could get into that detail later. Renewals are up about consistently with those premium increases we cited. It's in different regions. It doesn't mean that will end the year, as John pointed out in his opening comments. We have the ability to go into the market before winter season and change that if we so desire. But right now, given our capital position, we're quite comfortable with where our P&Ls are at. And as you probably have noted, through the years that what we carry is our net P&L for (inaudible) are pretty conservative relative to the industry.
Operator: We'll move next to Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.
Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank: Going back a little bit on the reserve issue, I just wanted to understand the process that you go through. Is there an annual reserve that comes in the fourth quarter and this is sort of how it came to be? What's the process right now at Everest Re?
Dom Addesso: We review reserves throughout the year. At the beginning of the year, though, the reserve buckets that we review tend to be the less material buckets. And then as we get into the fourth quarter, we're evaluating our largest lines of business or largest classes of business beginning for most recent data, meaning as of September timeframe. In other words, all the claims data up through September, is accumulated in order to do our year-end reserve review. And that's the process since I've been here in 2009. And if there is anything, for example, during the year that comes up with some of those smaller classes of businesses, we would certainly book that into our numbers. But generally, given the size of it, it's generally not an issue. And then of course, the larger, more material lines, as I mentioned, we wait until the fourth quarter to accumulate all those studies. Is that what you're asking about?
Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank: The charges that you took, are they more prone to changing hues on a frequency or severity?
Addesso: As I mentioned, we saw both, but not out of the accident periods. The more recent years, '09 and '10 and '11 was predominantly due to frequency of smaller claims. It's hard to tell maybe due to economic conditions, but nevertheless what we have done is we've factored in that increased frequency into our most recent accident year pick. So that influences the entire booking of all of our results. The severity that we encountered was due to business that has since been discontinued. So there really wasn't any need to make any dramatic adjustment for severity relative to our current book.
Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank: And finally, in speaking about the price kind of reinsurance, going forward, do you see an opportunity for Everest to buy more coverage in mid-year or even thinking about a long-term reinsurance protection plan for the company?
Dom Addesso: As I mentioned in the answer to the previous question, John even made some reference to it, we have the opportunity between now and winter season to look at various structures.
Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank: Part of the reason that we decided to start that and are very excited about that is it gives us a lot more flexibility in terms of how we position our footprint and how we manage our capital and our cat P&Ls. And with Mt. Logan Re and other capital market initiatives, whether it's traditional reinsurance or otherwise, we think we can grow the overall book very profitably and keep the P&L to a level that we're comfortable with. And it will be accretive to our shareholders.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Vinay Misquith with Evercore.
Vinay Misquith - Evercore: The first question is on the adverse development on the construction liability and umbrella. Curious as to what the liabilities are. So [ph] Rainwater's programs discontinued. So when we can see the end of these claims?
Dom Addesso: Well, on the construction liability, I believe that the seven-year period after which the policy was issued, I don't recollect the exact date, but it was the 2008 was the last policy that was issued. I think the claims can be made in a period of seven years after that date. Obviously our reserve addition was sufficient to answer your question about seeing the end of it. But as you know, again, reserves can always move around. But again, in the context of our overall reserve posture, we don't believe it's going to be a problem. Umbrella on the other hand, it doesn't have a fixed discovery period, if you will. So umbrella claims can come in for a long time, again a volatile class, but we feel as if what we book is reasonably conservative. And again in the context of our overall reserve position, we don't feel that either one of these classes or lines of business will present a problem for our future financial performance.
Vinay Misquith - Evercore: And when was the umbrella program discontinued?
Dom Addesso: Four years ago.
Vinay Misquith - Evercore: And then moving on to crop, you said $68 million of losses. I believe crop premiums was about $300 million-ish last year?
Dom Addesso: Yeah.
Vinay Misquith - Evercore: So just looking at the combined ratio, that seems to be about 122% combined ratio. Just curious why it would be that high on the crop?
Dom Addesso: Well, our technical ratio was about 112% and then the rest of it's just expenses. And we're a little higher than the industry, at least what's been reported to date, just because of some of the concentration we have in particular as John mentioned in Minnesota and Texas, being some of our largest states, which in fact relative to the industry helped us in better stead last year. Minnesota, for example, has a long history of being very, very profitable state.
Vinay Misquith - Evercore: And for '14, what's the targeted combined ratio for the primary insurance corporations, because I believe that on the workers' comp, you said it's mid-90%s. Are the rest of the book representing 94.6%. So looking at '14, what's your targeted combined ratio for the primary business?
Dom Addesso: We believe that the numbers in the low to mid-90s would still be achievable and perhaps better. But for now, I'll leave it at that.
Vinay Misquith - Evercore: I think you're changing your business mix, just a tad moving to pro rata versus excess of loss business. Should we see an uptick in the accident year a loss ratio ex-cats because of that business mix shift?
Dom Addesso: Not necessarily. There might be an uptick in certain lines of business due to rate movements, but also as we move the portfolio into other lines of business, particularly new products, that's actually having the impact of lower our attrition in combined ratio. So I'm not going to give you a number at this point, because we don't give guidance. It depends on what the final at the end of the year comes in at, but we're not anticipating an increase in that number. I'll leave it at that.
Operator: We'll move next to Greg Locraft with Morgan Stanley.
Greg Locraft - Morgan Stanley: I'm just looking at the profitability out of the insurance segment, and it hasn't been profitable on an underwriting side for many years. I certainly understand the reasons why this particular year, but how do we think about net investment income allocation of this segment? Is it just kind of pro rata with the premiums or is there more investment income being earned out of this book of business?
Dom Addesso: We don't really do a specific allocation if we could talk about it in this call, but I would think about more in the context of a premium allocation.
Greg Locraft - Morgan Stanley: For those of us that are looking, they're not making any money in underwriting, the reality is you're making, call it, $100 million-plus probably in investment income as well, if you would actually break it?
Dom Addesso: But our focus, quite, Greg, is on the underwriting account. That's where our attention is. And we don't rely on the investment income, because at today's yield, that's not really giving you the appropriate return. And as I mentioned, our current year attritions are very good positioned. And given the rate increases, we'll continue to get in California comp, what we're doing in the property in that space, our other strategic initiatives, reinsurance platform, we're quite bullish on it. So the profitability issues that you're seeing are things that relate to frankly a lot of which was discontinued four, five years ago.
Greg Locraft - Morgan Stanley: In crop as well, yeah.
Dom Addesso: The crop in particular, remember, when you look at that, not unlike we look at our reinsurance catastrophe business, right. And also, even though it's reported within the insurance segment, we have capabilities now globally, as John somewhat mentioned in his comments, we look at whether any crop in other jurisdictions kind of jointly have capabilities that we can look across the organization on how we're doing in crop, even though they're reported in two different segments.
Greg Locraft - Morgan Stanley: And then turning to capital management, on the one hand, you bought back 9% of the shares outstanding at the beginning of the year, so it was a robust buyback in a strong year. On the other hand, there's only 68% of capital returns via buybacks in dividends on a year. So in a way, you held back. Looks like you haven't done much in the month of January. You've done a little bit, but I'm sort of wondering, stock is below book value. What's keeping you from doing more on the buyback front?
Dom Addesso: We were in January as long as we could be in the month of January. Of course, as you know, at some point, during a month, we begin to know the numbers and we were basically restricted from being in the market. So that's really the only thing that held us back in the month of January. In the fourth quarter, we were buying stock even at above book value. But we couldn't get all of the stock that we wanted at the prices that we wanted it at. So we continue to be bullish on share repurchase, balance that up against what the market opportunities are. As we pointed, we've had a strong one-one and we'll consider that and the upcoming four-one as we evaluate and the price of the stock as we evaluate what our share repurchases will be in this quarter and the upcoming quarters. But I think it's fair to say that we're still very interested in share repurchases.
Operator: And we'll take our final question from Meyer Shields with KBW.
Meyer Shields - KBW: Is there any way of ballparking, given the growth that we had in one-one, how much more capital do you think you need this year compared to last year?
Dom Addesso: Well, I guess if you wanted a ballpark that you could relate to P&Ls is in the premium growth.
Meyer Shields - KBW: Was there any adjustment to the accident year '13 losses for workers' compensation in the quarter, given the adverse development on recent years?
Dom Addesso: No, there was none.
Meyer Shields - KBW: Are you confident with the level of pricing that you've been implementing over the last six months?
Dom Addesso: Well, our reserve numbers that we picked in more accident year is what I call bridge off of the previous accident years. So it's taking into account the experience of those years, plus they run top of that rate increases that we've had, and as John pointed out, over 60% cumulative rate increase since 2009, and then subtraction from that would be assumed loss cost trends. So our most recent accident years are a reflection of the development we've seen, plus pricing.
Meyer Shields - KBW: Right. But I guess the question is that you don't know pricing for a while, but the base seems like it would be higher.
Dom Addesso: I'm not sure I understand that question.
Craig Howie: I think what's happened here as well is that you're essentially picking a conservative number to begin with. And we have not let that number come down just because of the pricing.
Operator: And I'll now turn the call back to presenters for any additional or closing remarks.
Dom Addesso: Thank you all for participating on the call. As you've heard, we're quite bullish on our opportunities and trajectory going into 2014. We think we have the capital to take advantage of market conditions, while at the same time continuing our interest in share repurchases. So again, thank you for your interest.
Operator: That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2013 Q3  (2013-10-24 10:30:00) =====
Executives: Elizabeth Farrell - Vice President, Investor Relations Joseph Taranto - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Dominic Addesso - President Craig Howie - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Analysts: Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley Jay Gelb - Barclays Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Amit Kumar - Macquarie Capital Ian Gutterman - BAM Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Everest Re Group Limited third quarter 2013 earnings call. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to Beth Farrell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Elizabeth Farrell: Thank you, Evelyn. Good morning, and welcome to Everest Re Group's third quarter 2013 earnings conference call. On the call with me today are Joe Taranto, the company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Dom Addesso, our President; and Craig Howie, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I note that statements made during today's call, which are forward-looking in nature, such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations and alike are subject to various risks. As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations. Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements. Let me turn the call over to Joe.
Joseph Taranto: Thanks, Beth. Good morning. I am extremely pleased with our results for the first nine months. Our worldwide gross written premium has increased by 24%. Our worldwide reinsurance premium increased by 26% and our insurance premium increased by 18%. More important, we've been able to meaningfully increase our expected margins, lower our attritional combined by almost 5 points over 2012 and maintain excellent ROEs on the business written. This has been accomplished in a market, where industry capacity has been increasing, which highlights what a terrific job our team has done. Some of the reasons we've accomplished, what we have, include: first, being nimble. A good example of this was increasing our pro rata Florida business, as that sector continued to improve from higher insurance rates as well as lower excess of loss reinsurance costs. Second, offering new products. A good example of this is our Purple product in property catastrophe business as well as the formation of our specialty reinsurance products unit, which focuses on one of unique deals. Third, benefiting from significant insurance rate increases in workers compensation, general liability, Florida homeowners and other lines. Fourth, using the advantages provided by our established international platform, these advantages include great client relationships that have been cultivated over many years of trading, terrific financial ratings, a nimble culture and a very efficient expense structure. I want to thank our team, which I believe is the best team in the business for doing such a terrific job. Moving on to earnings, we have had $895 million of net income for the nine months for an annualized ROE of 19%. Our combined ratio was 85.6%, which includes 4.8 points of catastrophe losses. Our expense ratio remains one of the lowest in the business. Book value per share has grown to over a $140 per share. Through nine months, we have increased shareholder value by 8.2%, despite falling bond prices and catastrophes. Nine months earnings were very strong with underwriting income hitting us all-time high of $0.5 billion. And this was despite $153 million of catastrophe losses, net of reinstatement premiums and booking of business to a loss, which Dom will cover in his report. In fact, our underwriting income has been so profitable relative to our plan that we had to adjust our yearly expected tax rate in the third quarter. Craig will provide more color on this shortly. In the last nine months, we returned $620 million to shareholders between dividends and stock repurchases. Buying back $550 million of stock, which represents 8.3% of the beginning of the year outstanding shares, underscores our confidence in the future. We expect to continue to generate healthy profits, more than I can see putting to work on our business at this point. Accordingly, we expect to continue to get back to shareholders through buyback and dividends. In summary, I am very proud of our performance through the first nine months. We have a great deal of momentum at Everest that will continue to benefit us topline and bottomline into 2014. We have never been positioned better, never been stronger. Dom will now go through the operational review, and than Craig will take you through the financial highlights.
Dominic Addesso: Thank you, Joe, and good morning. As Joe highlighted, we had a terrific nine months. It was bolstered by another good quarter of underwriting results. The operating results were off the trend of recent quarters due to investment income and an income tax adjustment to the first and second quarters estimated taxes and cat losses year-to-date, essentially resulting in a cumulative adjustment, all hitting in the third quarter. Investment income was off due to lower income from limited partnerships and expect that to return to normal patterns over the future quarters. However, core underwriting results for the quarter remain strong with an underwriting gain of $222 million, excluding cats. This result is consistent with prior quarters this year and well above the prior year's quarterly results. Examining results by segment, you will note that in the reinsurance segments gross premiums written are up 25% for the year and 24% for the quarter. Premiums are up in each of the reinsurance segments, but the most dramatic growth was in the U.S. segment. This is a result of new product initiatives as well as new Florida quota shares and additional cat ratings outside our peak zones. The additional cat business is a strategy deployed globally and has provided growth in all segments. The diversification benefit to our portfolio provides from margin expansion without increased peak zone PMLs and only a modest 1.5 point rise in our annual expected cat load. On the product front, Joe has already referenced our pillar product, which is a part of the aforementioned deployment of additional cat aggregate. In addition, we have expanded our appetite in the credit space by supporting financial guarantors and mortgage portfolios. Although, relatively small, some interesting residual value opportunities are also areas that have provided growth. And finally, in terms of growth, our casualty lines are also benefiting from some new opportunity as well as some lift in rates. All-in-all, our reinsurance portfolio was better balanced, and our teams in each of all our locals are finding unique opportunities that are accretive to the bottomline. The marketplace is increasingly seeking to align with firms of our size and talent, and we are seeing the benefits of our financial strength and varied risk appetite. All of these efforts have produced a combined ratio for all reinsurance of 82.2% for the nine months compared with 84.6% last year, despite cat losses increasing to 6 points in 2013 versus 3.5 points in 2012. This highlights the benefits of increased ratings into a more diversified footprint, thereby providing the ability to absorb cat losses, while maintaining solid profitability. The cat losses in the quarter, included $20 million from Tornado floods and $20 million from German hail, both third quarter events. In addition, we experienced $35 million of development on the second quarter flood in Calgary. This event occurred very late in the second quarter. It was not until we were well into the third quarter, that industry loss estimate doubled and reports came in from clients that caused us to increase our estimates. The magnitude of these losses to these specific regions would suggest that rates there will likely improve. These events present opportunities for us to consider expanding our risk appetite, as we continually balance and broaden our portfolio. This might mean that as other markets get weaker, we contract. However, the addition of Mt. Logan will allow us to continue in the market and broaden our reach. While still relatively small, we are expecting our additional capital raise from Mt. Logan to meet or possibly even exceed our goal for the yearend. Turning to the insurance operations. The results for the nine months remain profitable at 98.8% combined ratio or 97.5% on attritional basis. This compares to 102.8% attritional combined ratio in the prior year. The results for the most recent quarter, although with a breakeven underwriting result, slipped a bit from the second quarter due in part to a more conservative loss estimate on the crop portfolio. In this book, approximately 39% is for the corn crop. Although, corn yields are expected to be very good, the current commodity price is 20-plus percent down from the base price. Depending on yields, this may or may not produce a loss on the corn crop. Other crops, mainly soy are profitable. We have elected to increase our loss pick to take into account the decline in the price of corn. As a result, the entire crop book had a slight loss for the quarter. The cumulative effect of this adjustment lowered the total result for the entire insurance segment to a breakeven for the quarter. Our other businesses within the insurance segment are doing well. California workers comp remains profitable and the non-standard auto book is now solidly in the black, with the increased scale provided by our new business venture there. Both of these classes of business were the main drivers behind the 18% increase in year-to-date premiums. California workers comp book continues to realize double-digit rate increases for the fourth straight year, well in excess of trend. The other classes, which include professional liability, accident and health stop loss, general casualty, environmental liability and property in excess and surplus lines are all profitable. Growth has been the strongest in casualty and the E&S Property, as rate increases in these sectors make this more appealing to grow. This insurance strategy provide balance to our overall results, when reinsurance rates are weakening, we can deploy capacity from our insurance platform. Overall, as you may have recognized over the past several quarters, we have a number of new initiatives and changes to our portfolio. The results of the past nine months are a consequence of many of those efforts. And going forward, as the growth in premium written flows into earned premium, future quarters should benefit from continued improvement in the attritional loss ratio. We will continue to adapt and move into the markets that present the greatest opportunities and withdraw from those that are weak. Our structure and culture allow us to execute in this way and you should continue to expect that from us. Thank you. And Craig will now provide some further detail on the financials.
Craig Howie: Thank you, Dom, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report that Everest had another very strong quarter of earnings, with net income of $235 million or $4.81 per diluted common share. This compares to net income of $251 million or $4.82 per share for the third quarter of 2012. Net income includes realized capital gains and losses. On a year-to-date basis, net income was $895 million or $17.94 per share compared to $770 million or $14.61 per share in 2012. The 2013 result represents an annualized return on equity of 19%. Operating income year-to-date was $759 million or $15.22 per share. This represents a 19% increase over operating income of $12.78 per share last year. These results were driven by $147 million increase in underwriting income, representing a 42% increase year-over-year. As you just heard from Joe and Dom, there are a number of strategic initiatives that are driving these improved results. This increase in underwriting income was partially offset by higher income taxes and lower net investment income compared to the first nine months of 2012. The results continue to reflect the improvement in the overall current year attritional combined ratio, which has declined almost 5 points from 86.0% to 81.1% on a year-to-date basis. This measure excludes the impact of catastrophes, reinstatement premiums and prior period loss development. The total reinsurance attritional combined ratio was 76.9% for the first nine months of 2013 compared to 81.8% in the prior year. The insurance segment attritional combined ratio was 97.5% year-to-date compared to 102.8% in the prior year. All segments reported increases in premium volume for the year and all segments reported underwriting gains on a year-to-date basis. Total reinsurance reported an underwriting gain of $142 million for the quarter compared to $157 million underwriting gain last year. For the first nine months of 2013, total reinsurance reported an underwriting gain of $487 million compared to $376 million gain last year. The insurance segment reported a slight underwriting loss of $208,000 for the quarter compared to a loss of $28 million last year. On a year-to-date basis, the insurance segment reported an underwriting gain of $9 million compared to a loss of $23 million in 2012. The 2013 results reflected a crop loss of $10 million for the year, primarily due to the seasonality of crop premiums, but also included estimates to reflected decline in the corn commodity prices. The overall underwriting gain for the Group was $147 million for the quarter compared to an underwriting gain of $129 million for the same period last year. On a year-to-date basis, the underwriting gain was $500 million compared to a gain of $353 million in 2012. These results reflect $75 million for current year catastrophe losses in the third quarter of 2013 compared to $25 million of cats during the third quarter of 2012. On year-to-date basis, catastrophe losses were $165 million in 2013 compared to $85 million in 2012. We added an additional segment to our financial supplement this quarter for the activity related to Mt. Logan Re. You also will notice the non-controlling interests in Mt. Logan Re's operating results and equity are presented as separate captions in the companies financial statements. Our reported combined ratio was 85.6% for the first nine months of 2013 compared to 88.4% in 2012. For investments, pre-tax investment income was $128 million for the quarter and $422 million year-to-date, on our $16 billion investment portfolio. Both the quarter and the year-to-date investment income amounts are below last year. This result is primarily driven by the low interest rate environment and the cash flow used for share buybacks and the redemption of debt. The redemption of our 6.2% debt, which occurred, earlier this year, reduced interest expense by over $5 million this quarter. The first nine months reflected $136 million of net after-tax realized capital gains compared to $97 million last year. These gains are mainly attributable to fair value adjustments on the equity portfolio. Over the past few years, we have shifted over $1 billion of our investment portfolio from fixed income to equity securities, affectively trading investment income for capital gains. Although, these gains are included in net income, they are not reflected in operating income. On income taxes, the increase in the effective tax rate is primarily driven by lower than planned catastrophe losses in the quarter, resulting in higher than expected taxable income for the year. The year-to-date operating income effective tax rate increased from 12.3% to 15%. This resulted in a 21.7% tax rate or $204 million adjustment for the quarter in order to catch up on a year-to-date basis. The 15% effective tax rates for the year is in line with our expectations in the year with lower than planned cat losses. Strong cash flow continues with operating cash flows of $776 million for the first nine months of 2013 compared to $479 million in 2012. This is primarily due to lower catastrophe loss payments. Shareholder's equity, at the end of the quarter was $6.7 billion, relatively flat compared to the balance at yearend 2012. This is after taking into account, capital return through $550 million of share buybacks and $71 million of dividends paid in the first nine months of 2013. It also reflects $348 million decline in the value of a bond portfolio, mainly due to the rise in interest rates this year. Book value per share increased 7% to $140.20 from $130.96 at yearend 2012. Our continued strong capital balance, positions us well for potential business opportunities. Thank you. And now I will turn it back to Beth for Q&A.
Elizabeth Farrell: Yes, Evelyn, we are now prepared to take questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) We'll take our first question from Gregory Locraft, Morgan Stanley.
Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley: To ask about the tax rate, Craig, I think you had mentioned, but just going forward from here, how should we model the corporation?
Craig Howie: Greg, that's a good question, because what happens is from an overall standpoint historically, we have planned the majority of our catastrophe losses in the third quarter. So from an accounting standpoint, you have to calculate your effective tax rate on an annualized basis. And given that you're calculating on an annualized basis, we still planned for a substantial amount of our catastrophes to happen in that third quarter. When they didn't happen, of course we had more income than was expected for the year, and therefore a higher tax rate. So on a normalized basis, when we plan for catastrophes, we would have expected a rate somewhere between 12% and 13%. That rate will be in this 15% range for lower than planned catastrophes for the year. If we have no cats in a given year that rate could go up from the 15% as well.
Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley: And effectively, the way you book it is first quarter, second quarter is, kind of a normal. You plan on normalized and then after you get through the third, you have a pretty good feel as to what the year is, and at that point like this quarter, you then will adjust accordingly?
Craig Howie: That's correct, right. But just to given you an idea, we still have planned catastrophes in the fourth quarter. And if those catastrophe do not happen in the fourth quarter, then tax rate could even be higher than the 15% that we have now.
Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley: And then shifting gears to Mt. Logan, just stepping back, what does Mt. Logan allow you to do as a corporation? How are you selling your traditional reinsurance product versus Mt. Logan in the marketplace? What does one offer that the other doesn't, and how do the two together work?
Dominic Addesso: We do not offer a separate product or a separate Mt. Logan product into the marketplace. What Mt. Logan does for us is it actually allows us to increase our capacity and in an essence Mt. Logan acts as a retrocessionaire to Everest. So the products that we're offering the marketplace continue to be the Everest brand and Mt. Logan is essentially invisible to the client. So the benefit of that of course is that clients are receiving increased capacity, increase lines from us with weighted paper, traditional paper, reinstatable cover, very much traditional product.
Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley: And then how is the more traditional offering competing vis-à-vis the alternative offerings, like a Mt. Logan in the marketplace? And I understand that that's at a different part of the stack. But what are you doing from an innovation perspective to help meet your clients' needs in a world of a lot of alternative capital?
Dominic Addesso: Well the traditional product offers something that the capital markets product is not. In one case, which is typically it's not reinstatable, typically we are offering on the traditional side a UNL product, which is not always the case or typically the case in a capital markets context. And that's not always appealing to clients. And then I guess third, there is always the issue of collectability and disputes over coverage, which is something that you typically would not get in a traditional product offering. So there are unique differences between the two products. And that's not to suggest that the capital markets' does not have a place in providing solutions to clients. It's just that there are unique differences that capital markets are not appealing to all buyers.
Joseph Taranto: Let me answer that that there is relationships that go back many years that give people a great deal of comfort. And even if there are losses, there will be a continued relationship that will meet and provide their needs.
Dominic Addesso: And that's also a great point. Also that the other point on the capital market side is that if there is a loss, there is always a question of collateral release, and so just to follow-on to what Joe is mentioning about continuity and being able to offer up renewal terms after a loss, sometimes in the capital markets context that's not always possible. So that's some of the differences.
Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley: And then one last one, just can you give us an early read on the January 1s? What are you seeing and hearing in the marketplace?
Joseph Taranto: Well, it's a little bit early. We're not working on those just yet and we really won't get into those until December. So what we hear in the marketplace is probably the same thing that you hear in the marketplace, mostly coming from brokers, which is the anticipation that there will be some more capital. And with this being a good year in terms of not that much in the way of losses, if that continues through January 1, then you probably will have programs that have been loss-free, looking to get a little bit of a haircut, which is understandable, that's normal in our marketplace. Meanwhile, those situations where there have been losses, we'll be looking to have some increases. So I think that's the dynamic, but we're not into doing the business just yet.
Operator: We'll next go to Jay Gelb, Barclays
Jay Gelb - Barclays: If I look at the third quarter result on an operating earnings basis, around $4.20, you add back the $0.50 tax impact. And of course, there is this spillover effect of a couple of Canadian catastrophes. And you mentioned the impact of lower corn pricing on the insurance result. We get to roughly $19 of annualized EPS. And then, Dom, you talked about improvement in the attritional loss ratio going forward. So I know you don't usually give guidance, but I am hoping maybe you can reflect on where you see that earnings power going forward relative to that $19, I just mentioned.
Joseph Taranto: Well, let me state that, I agree with essentially where you're coming from. We are very pleased with the underwriting income that we have generated; $0.50 billion through nine months. Our written premium has grown, which means that our earned premiums will continue to grow. Our attritional is probably stabilizing at a very good number, much lower than what it was a year ago. So if you start doing that multiplication, you come up with a much bigger underwriting gain before catastrophes. And that's just where we're headed at this particular point. Meanwhile, we continue to do well on the business. Have good expectations for January 1. Yes, tax was a bit of a one-off. Limited partnerships, we think came in a bit low this quarter and that will rebound. So yes, Jay, I kind of agree with what you're pointing to even though we don't give guidance that we see good days ahead.
Dominic Addesso: Well, I think the math I think gets you to a number, as you've described it, well in excess of the $19. So again, we're not about giving guidance, but I think what you were describing leads you to a higher number than what you suggested. The other thing that I'd mentioned is we're a little bit off in the quarter, again with the invested income. And again, limited partnerships' that comes back a little bit that helps us well. And also Craig mentioned in his opening remarks about some of the shift, if we ship to some of our equity exposure from limited partnerships where we've been taking that allocation down a little bit overtime. And we're focusing that more towards the straight equity markets, public equity markets. And that of course has been below the line, so to speak, or had not reflected in the operating income, but some times that's missed, and I think it shouldn't always be.
Jay Gelb - Barclays: Dom, what was the impact in the U.S. insurance segment from crop resulting in an overall breakeven underwriting result compared to what it probably would have normally been?
Dominic Addesso: Craig, you might know that. What was the adjustment we made for?
Craig Howie: Overall crop?
Dominic Addesso: Yes. So overall crop ended the quarter at just slightly a loss, Jay. It was about $500,000 of a loss for the period.
Dominic Addesso: I think his question is, what it would have been running at?
Jay Gelb - Barclays: Say, if you ran that at a 90 combined, how much impact is that in the quarter, dollar-wise?
Craig Howie: So we had about from an earned premium perspective $140 million, add another 10%.
Joseph Taranto: 10 points in $140 million.
Operator: We'll move on to our next question, Joshua Shanker, Deutsche Bank.
Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank: Can we talk a little bit about the Greg's question on the taxes? I guess, I don't understand, if you made extra profitability in property cat, which I assume a lot of those underwriting profits are domiciled in Bermuda, wouldn't tax rate go down or are these contracts with I guess that resided here in the States?
Craig Howie: They are both. And you're absolutely right, Josh. This is Craig. You have to look at the geographic region where it was earned and then the tax rate in that region. So we have a large book of business here that for property catastrophe that's writes in the U.S. That is profitable. And it's going to be taxed at U.S. tax rates.
Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank: And just a lesson in trying to understand, can that stuff be offshored or why the preferred location for that being in the U.S. as a domicile?
Craig Howie: Well, it's a good mix of business for us. We have global catastrophe writings. Some of them end up offshore some of them stay here in the U.S. We are U.S. writer, whereas a lot of our competitors are not writing as much in the U.S. But we do have a lot of U.S. property catastrophe business that remains here in the U.S. If there is a loss on that business that loss also remains here. So effectively you're getting a tax deduction for that loss. Again, if there is no loss, we are less than what we had planned for that's the reason for a higher tax rate.
Dominic Addesso: Let me just add to that. Take Canada, for example. There is an advantage to being able to offer up our product and our offering through domestic enterprise as well as here in the States, there is some advantage to that. And you have to be careful, you don't just look at the income tax impact, because of the extent that you're writing U.S. offshore, you have the excise tax that is the part of the cost as well. So let's not just focus on income tax.
Joseph Taranto: We like being able to distribute the business both in Bermuda and in the U.S. and Canada and elsewhere where we're close to the customer. But as Craig pointed out, when you do it in the U.S., we are cognizant of the accumulations including the after-tax accumulations. So the fact that it is subject to tax, it allows us frankly to write more aggregate. So we think it all works out to maximize that we continue to distribute our product both in Bermuda and in the U.S.
Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank: And can we get some greater granularity on quota share cat versus excessive loss cat by region, not thinking about, really not even, one-one, thinking about seven-one renewals and what you guys did and trying to understand a more granular view of pricing?
Joseph Taranto: Well, we continue to do quota share. And as you know, some of it is cat. Probably the biggest quota share cats come out of Florida. We were very pleased with what we put together this past June and July. As we noted, prices have been going up on the insurance products in Florida. And frankly, the quota share that we write tends to be subject to excess of loss protection where rates have come down. So that product has just gotten better for the underlying carriers and for ourselves. So we grew there quite nicely. And then that was more of our cat writings. Looking forward six months from now, we certainly would look to continue the quota shares as many of them in Florida, I think rates will still be very healthy. You might have more of a benefit from excess of loss rates being down. We have some very good relationships there. And I would add when it comes to writing the quota shares, frankly we have a whole lot less competition including the alternate capital world that just doesn't participate in that part of the marketplace. So we would look for that to too be a continued good part of what we do on a going forward basis.
Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank: And so if I look at the growth rate on reinsurance between growing rate versus growing units or exposure, can you give us any granularity along those lines?
Joseph Taranto: Let me start with the topline. We've grown 25% this year and in rig insurance more than that, so that's terrific. I'm not going to say that we'll continue that until next year, although I think we can continue to grow quite nicely. Probably the best way to look at it is the attritional combined ratio overall, which is five-points better than a year ago, but kind of stabilizing at this in point. So I kind of look at it like the margin is still increasing because the earned premium and written premium is increasing, but in terms of the attritional, I think that will stay just about where it's at for the months to come.
Dominic Addesso: A lot of the growth you're seeing, Josh, is exposure growth and deploying it away from our peak PMLs zones as I had mentioned in my opening remarks. And then rate is mix. It depends on the territory, it depends on the region, whether it's the loss affected, so it's hard to characterize that overall, but most of the growth is kind of spreading our aggregate, deeper into many other regions that we do business in. And that's both U.S. and international.
Operator: And moving on we'll hear from Michael Nannizzi, Goldman Sachs.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs: I think somebody asked this before, but I just wanted to try and dig a little further on the insurance business. If we back out crop, can we find out what the profitability in the quarter was and what the ex-crop premiums were?
Craig Howie: Michael, this is Craig, if you're backing out crop from the quarter?
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs: From insurance, right? So like the other insurance business, I just want to understand what was the underlying profile of the non-crop business within the insurance segment? 
Craig Howie: So as we had mentioned, I think Dom and I both mentioned, the attritional combined ratio for the period excluding crop was 96%. So overall profitable book as far as the amount of premiums earned for the quarter is about $600 million in premium earned, but again stripping out crop, a good solid book of business.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs: And then as far as Mt. Logan is concerned, is there a different return hurdle for business that gets placed into that structure versus the business that you kind of retained on your own?
Dominic Addesso: Basically we're required to retain a significant portion of any business that we see into Mt. Logan, so it's the same metrics.
Joseph Taranto: I'm going to say it's in a fair way, as Dom noted. Investors having said that do have a choice as to which portions of the business they want to be involved with, and sending their risk parameters, which kind of lead to different potential ROEs, so there are different ways to participate in Mt. Logan.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs: And then, Dom, you mentioned reinstatement as kind of sort of a differentiator between traditional and alternative capital. Do you think at some point that that is potentially solvable as far as alternative markets are concerned or is that always going to be a difference between the traditional and alternative markets?
Dominic Addesso: While, I think some of those features are already in the capital market products, so it's not that it's not a solvable problem, it's just that it's more difficult to accomplish given the risk appetite of investors. I mean that's all. The traditional product is a more seamless offering. That was really my only point.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Vinay Misquith, Evercore Partners.
Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners: The first question is on the property cat premium. I believe it is about $1.2 billion. Just wanted to get a sense for whether some proportion of that is pro rata, I mean as you said before, and then some proportion is just now an excessive loss? And the reason I ask is, let's assume that there is a 10% decline. And I'm not saying that there is, but let's say there is. During the detail on renewals, you guys may not be hit with the entire 10%, because some of your business is normal excessive loss and some of it is pro rata?
Dominic Addesso: The split on an earned premium basis right now is, as you mentioned, something closed to $1 billion to $2 billion. The overwhelming majority of that is excessive loss at say $950 million and then the balance is pro rata, on an earned premium basis. Now, that's going to change a little bit over time, as the Florida quota shares continue to earn into premium. But also keep in mind to the point you're making or trying to make is that, not all of the improvement that you see in the traditional and the attritional ratio is coming from renewal rate, right. A big portion of it is new business that we're writing. So you can get margin expansion by, as I mentioned before, increasing, spreading our aggregate away from some of our peak zones, which is frankly, in the peak zones is where you're getting most of the rate pressure.
Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners: The second question was on, if you X into your combined ratio ex-cats on the reinsurance segment that ticked up quarter-over-quarter. Just curious, if that's a business mix issue or is that because of pricing?
Joseph Taranto: It's a couple of things. One, we did have some currency adjustment from some of our international business that ticked up a little bit in the loss ratio and some of it is mix, as some of the pro rata earns in. But again, as we write some more XOL well going into the first of the year, we'll start to see that moderate again. I wouldn't look into that as any kind of long-term trend. And again, I know we've somewhat emphasized the year-to-date, but we think that's a more important metric to look at, whether you're looking at premium, because of variability that it can occur in any one particular quarter and looking at attritional combined ratios.
Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners: This is a follow-up to that. Would it be fair to assume that if pricing on property cat declined next year that that attritional should go up a little bit?
Dominic Addesso: Not necessarily, if we're deploying new cat ag into away from some of our peak zones.
Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners: That's interesting. And you mentioned that the cat load would be increasing 1.5 points. If you could just help us understand what the normalized cat load is for the year?
Dominic Addesso: This year 10 points. That will be rising modestly into next year.
Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners: And just one last question, if I may, just on the buyback. Since you've grown so much this year, should we expect lower buybacks in 100% of earnings?
Joseph Taranto: To be determined, we really don't forecast and so we'll be discussing that amongst ourselves and with the board, as we go forward. But as I know that I still see earnings coming in that we won't be able to use fully on business, unless something changes. And that being the case, we'll look to deploy that on buybacks and dividends.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Amit Kumar, Macquarie Capital.
Amit Kumar - Macquarie Capital: Just a quick follow-up on the crop, and I apologize for all these questions. What average price did you use for corn? I guess what I'm trying to figure out is, if prices keep on moving, could there be a potential impact on Q4 results or have you already accounted for that?
Dominic Addesso: Prices, right now, I think the price is somewhere of $4.40, $4.41 for corn, and it's the October average. So there is only a few days left. We're not really expecting that to move much from here or particularly since it is a 30-day average that's used. And also keep in mind that it's difficult to generalize what the result would be, because it's field-by-field. You'll have individual acreage, which more than likely be yielding in excess of a 100%. So can't paint the entire portfolio, every account, necessarily having a loss, just because commodity prices are down.
Joseph Taranto: It won't change much from what we've used per the contracts.
Amit Kumar - Macquarie Capital: And I guess all else being equal, could there be, I guess it could be. Would there be an additional impact on Q4 results too or have you accounted? Is there a buffer in Q3 numbers?
Dominic Addesso: It's difficult to predict what the result will be for corn. You think what we have booked in the third quarter, should be sufficient. But as things are presented that could change the number up or down. There's no way predict that at this point. We think it's a reasonable estimate for sure at this point.
Amit Kumar - Macquarie Capital: Two other quick follow-ups. First was on capital management on the previous question. I guess, in the pace of buyback, have you talked about what your thoughts are recently on a special dividend or is that off the table?
Joseph Taranto: I wouldn't say it's off the table. Everything is on the table. And the board will discuss this and decide what they think is best, whether it's regular dividend being changed or special dividend or buyback. And so far, as you know, we've kind of preferred buyback. But everything will be considered, nothing is off the table.
Amit Kumar - Macquarie Capital: And just going back on Mt. Logan, and I know there have been a few questions. Is there cyclicality to their premiums and losses or is it more sort of ratable through the year?
Dominic Addesso: Seasonality, you said to?
Amit Kumar - Macquarie Capital: Yes, I mean is it more of a Q3 and Q1 number or is there an impact every quarter? I guess when I look at the model.
Dominic Addesso: It could be for Mt. Logan, since they're writing piece of our portfolio, it would be similar to the patterns that would be evident in our portfolio. So it would be consistent with our own book.
Amit Kumar - Macquarie Capital: And then, just finally on the California comp, you mentioned somewhat the pricing discussion. Can you sort of expand on that and maybe also touch upon 863 and the recent 9.5% rate filing? I guess it's a vibrant market, so it doesn't change that much. But can you just talk about the recent developments and your outlook?
Dominic Addesso: We had another quarter in California comp of approximately 14%, it increased. And that's on a year-to-date basis, a very similar number. We are beginning to see some other companies begin to come back into the market, which would suggest that like we feel it it's reasonable profitable segment. So I really have no thoughts on some of the changes that you're referencing.
Joseph Taranto: But with regard to rate, we can charge what we want to charge.
Amit Kumar - Macquarie Capital: But I mean when you talk about competition, does that change your sort of outlook for the future?
Joseph Taranto: Well, we'll see where it does. I mean we have some of the competition coming in and some of it's smart companies that know what they're doing and are becoming more attracted to the market and want to grow. And we understand that, because rates are up more than exposure by good amount in last four years, so this is to be expected. We're still getting good rate increase. We still have a good persistency ratio, but it's something that we have to monitor. And it's not any great surprise with rates up probably 60% in the last four years that more people are looking to get into the game or expand.
Amit Kumar - Macquarie Capital: And anything on the loss cost trends, which has changed recently or no?
Joseph Taranto: No, nothing dramatic. We still believe that the rate increases that we're getting and have gotten for the last four years are well in excess of the loss cost trends.
Amit Kumar - Macquarie Capital: What would the delta be, when it's excess?
Joseph Taranto: Well, we've probably been getting, as I said, we probably have 60% in the last four years, maybe more in terms of compounded rate increases. I don't see the loss cost being more than half of that. I see it being less than half of that.
Operator: And we'll go to Ian Gutterman, BAM.
Ian Gutterman - BAM: I just wanted to follow-up on a couple of things. First, on that last question on the Cal comp, I believe the WCIRB showed that loss costs are starting to pick up a little bit again. Are you not seeing that in your book, then? And do you have any idea why they are seeing that?
Joseph Taranto: No, I don't Ian. And no, we aren't particularly seeing that. Just on legislation that's being proposed that I think may trend the future a little bit. But no, we haven't seen anything dramatic.
Ian Gutterman - BAM: And then to follow-up on Josh's question about your cat writings, can you give a split of, out of the $1.2 billion, how much is onshore versus offshore domiciled?
Dominic Addesso: Ian, I don't have that number easily available.
Joseph Taranto: We'll be happy to get back to you on that one, Ian.
Ian Gutterman - BAM: And then just for some color on it, the stuff that's written onshore, should I assume that's not the sort of large national carrier syndicated-type programs, that these are more maybe retaily type stuff? I was just kind of curious why you would choose onshore. I know you mentioned some of these just were onshore, but do they look different than what we think of as being Bermuda-type placements?
Dominic Addesso: No, I mean, it's similar play. These are program that will be placed in the U.S. and London and Bermuda, nothing different or unique about what we're writing in the U.S. versus what we were writing in Bermuda.
Ian Gutterman - BAM: So then why wouldn't you write offshore if you could, I guess? If your competitors are writing it offshore, why wouldn't you?
Joseph Taranto: Well, I think, again, some of it just gets into whether or not we want to be closer to the client and the broker that's really working on the deal. But as I know that, Ian, even if write it onshore, meaning U.S., we are cognizant to the fact that if something then happens, we're going to have a sort of go to the U.S. government in terms of reinsurance. And frankly, in our mind, the great equalizer was accumulations, there's only so much we can do and that dictates the total amount. So that means that we can do 50% more in the U.S. because of that reinsurance. So it's not so simple that just because you do it in Bermuda, it's a better place purely for tax reasons. So some of this gets down to the clients, some of it gets down to the broker. There is a whole variety of reasons, but as I said, I am happy that we get to see these things both in Bermuda, in London and New York, and decide what's best for us and the client at the end of the day.
Operator: We do have time for a brief follow-up question from Michael Nannizzi, Goldman Sachs.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs: Any changes in the crop book in terms of ceding? Like are you looking at ceding more business, less business or is that relationship? Do you expect that relationship to sort of hold steady?
Dominic Addesso: No, we don't expect any significant change in the percentage of what we cede. I mean that something we evaluate each and every year, as to what particular policies will go into the federal government program.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs: And do you use commodities to hedge corn or soybean prices through the year or you just kind of look at the reinsurance markets as a way to kind of provide you with some protection there?
Dominic Addesso: We do not use the financial markets for hedging.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs: And then, just last one on kind of looking at January 1, I think Joe you had mentioned you were pretty optimistic about January 1. Is that from a risk-adjusted return perspective or from an absolute kind of year-over-year pricing on your own book perspective?
Joseph Taranto: Well, I think where I was coming from is just all that we have cooking here at the company. I mean we've just made some very good strides in the last couple of years. As I said, there is a lot of momentum. Frankly, look at the numbers, 25% growth topline and look at the bottomline, we really have written more business at the regional level. As Tom noted, we're doing more business that's not really affecting the PML in the peak zones. You see what we've done in Florida. We have a new unit writing some unique deals and we're very pleased with what they've done on the books, which has taken us into some other products. I think where I was coming from is not getting so concerned about whether rates are going to change 4% on the cat side, January 1, but just looking overall with what we've put together, insurance, reinsurance, domestic and international, and saying, I like what's cooking, I like what's going on. And frankly, if you look at the number, you can see what's happened and I expect more good things to come.
Operator: That does conclude the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back to your Group for any additional or closing remarks.
Elizabeth Farrell: I'd just like to thank everybody for participating. And we'll speak with you again next quarter. Thank you.
Operator: And that does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for your participation.

===== 2013 Q2  (2013-07-24 10:30:00) =====
Executives:  Elizabeth B. Farrell – Vice President-Investor Relations Joseph V. Taranto – Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Dominic J. Addesso – President Craig W. Howie – Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer 
Analysts:  Amit J. Kumar – Macquarie Research Joshua Shanker – Deutsche Bank Michael S. Nannizzi – Goldman Sachs & Co. Gregory Locraft – Morgan Stanley Vinay Misquith – Evercore Partners Brian Meredith – UBS  
Operator: Good day everyone, and welcome to the second quarter 2013 earnings call of Everest Re Group. Today’s conference is being recorded. At this time for openings remarks and introductions, I’d like to turn the conference over to Ms. Beth Farrell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead ma’am.
Elizabeth B. Farrell:  Thank you Eric, and welcome to Everest Re Group’s second quarter 2013 earnings conference call. On the call with me today are Joe Taranto, the Company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Dom Addesso, our President; and Craig Howie, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard I note that statements made during today's call, which are forward-looking in nature, such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations and the like are subject to various risks. As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations. Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements. Now, let me turn the call over to Joe.
Joseph V. Taranto: Thanks, Beth, good morning. I’m extremely pleased with our results for the first six months of the year. Our net income was $660 million, producing an ROE of 21%. Our worldwide growth return premium has increased by 25% over 2012. Our worldwide reinsurance premium has increased by 26% and our insurance premiums have increased by 22%. The attritional combined ratio has improved by 6 points to 80.5%. Our attritional combined ratio for our insurance operation continues to improve and was 94.8% for the second quarter. Our investment income was strong through six months at $295 million, only modestly off last year’s $302 million despite the headwinds generated from today’s low interest rate environment. Through six months, we grew book value per share, adjusted for dividends, by 5% despite falling bond prices and catastrophes. During the quarter, we completed our April 1st Japanese reinsurance renewals, our June 1st Florida reinsurance renewals and our July 1st International reinsurance renewals. I was most pleased with our overall results, even though we experienced increased competition. In particularly in Florida, we increased up premiums, but more importantly we increased our expected margins and yet did not increase our 1-in-100 PML, as we bought some industry loss warranty cover, that contained this risk. Much of our increased margin came from writing pro rata reinsurance on homeowners business. Rate increases on homeowners business and other changes continued to improve the underlying insurance business making it more attractive. In addition, the fact that Cat XOL reinsurance was less costly for homeowners companies made for further improvement and the net after reinsurance expected results, as these saving inure to the benefit of our quarterly shares. As always we continued to optimize our portfolio and move towards the best opportunities. Our insurance operation continues to achieve meaningful rate increases in California workers’ comp and other areas. It’s too early to predict the crop results, but so far so good. The bulk of our crop premiums will be booked in the third quarter and fourth quarter, given the nature of this business. I am hopeful that we will continue to see quality improving results as the year progresses in this segment. I see the current overall reinsurance, insurance market place as offering reasonable opportunities and where companies that are focused, nimble and disciplined can do very well. Our client relationships, our long-term client relationships will diversify business platform, and great ratings continue to serve us well. Our focus, nimble culture has produced great opportunity for us. Everest by far has the lowest internal expense ratio in the market. Our studies indicate that we have a 3 to 7 point expense advantage over our competitors. This is an enormous advantage. Our flatter organization has benefited us greatly, as it allows us to react to changing market conditions more rapidly, offer new products and better meet client needs. During the quarter we saw a spike in the interest rates. We had expected rates to rise and continue to believe that they will rise further, although we do not try to predict when and by how much. We have positioned our bond portfolio to provide the balance between yields and duration that is most sensible. Our view on interest rate increases is that they’re a net positive for us. Of course they will initially decrease the market value of the bond portfolio. But since we tend to hold maturity, this will sometime undo itself, more important future earnings will rise. In short, given rating agency and regulatory requirements, we will always have the bulk of our assets and bonds and we would rather earn more interest on these bonds than less. In summary, the first six months have gone well and we are looking to continue our good performance. In those six months, we returned $0.5 billion to shareholders between dividends and stock repurchase, buying back $450 million of stock with represents 7% of the beginning of the year outstanding shares, underscores our confidence in our future. Dom will now go through the operational review and than Craig will take you through the financial highlights. Dom?
Dominic J. Addesso: Thanks Joe and good morning. The second quarter results were quite favorable despite storm activity in the period. After-tax operating income was $253 million, providing for an annualized operating return on equity of 16%. Strong and growing underwriting profitability and a stable base of investment income continue to provide for these favorable results. Over the last several quarters, we have talked about the strategies we have deployed enhance returns and our success is born out by these results. In that context, I’d like to outline our underwriting results and what actions, we have taken to reshape and improve in our portfolio. Compared to the prior year, underwriting income was $29 million higher at $143 million. Even after Cat losses of $90 million in this year’s second quarter versus $30 million one year ago. This year-over-year improvement continues to reflect an improvement in the underlying attritional combined ratio of more than 6 points. When adjusting for reinstatement premium, the attritional combined ratio was at 80.2%. I will touch on specifics in a moment, but generally the major improvements in the combined ratios were in U.S. reinsurance and Bermuda, followed by continued improvement in the insurance segment. The catastrophe losses of $90 million in the quarter, added 7 points to the combined ratio. So, overall, that ratio stood at a respectable 87.6%. There are multiple Cat events in the quarter. The details are as follows; U.S. tornadoes, $50 million; European floods, $20 million; Alberta floods, $20 million. The continuing improving fundamentals are due to a variety of factors. At its core, it is underwriting. Changes in the portfolio mix which emphasized excessive loss over pro rata was a factor as primary rates softened. But other important measures included broader geographical diversification, new product initiatives, terminating unprofitable relationships and finally a basic disciplined underwriting and pricing approach. Turning back to individual segments, I would like to provide some commentary about our U.S. reinsurance operations. As noted in our press release, premiums were up substantially in the quarter due to a Florida quota share transaction. The impact of this was material in the quarter due to an assumption of an incoming portfolio reflected in premiums return. Last year, we had terminated that deal, which resulted in an outgoing portfolio running through the premium account. When comparing year-over-year, this magnifies the percentage of premium growth. Premiums were up 16% in this segment without the impact of this transaction. As we continue to find opportunities for growth and as such are pleased with the current position of the portfolio. During the recent Florida renewals, we saw a mixed pricing environment. Cat excess rates were down, but underlying primary rates were up. We therefore wrote fewer Cat excess loss release and redeployed this capacity to riding substantially more quota share business, which in combination provided for increased overall margins on this book.
 : As Joe mentioned, we purchased an ILW retro on the Florida book, which reduced peak event PMLs, while at the same time, overall margins increased. Across the rest of the U.S. property book, we have been authorizing and binding larger lines. This has enhanced the geographic diversification of our portfolio and provided for overall margin improvement on the book. Our casualty operation has experienced growth from both new and renewal business. In addition, new business opportunities, in particular in credit reinsurance and structured solutions have further contributed to premium growth in the quarter. All these activities have reshaped the U.S. reinsurance portfolio and lead to a year-to-date attritional combined ratio of 72% versus 86.5% last year, a 14.5 point improvement. In our Bermuda operations, there was minimal change in premium year-over-year. However changes in the portfolio have resulted in a 7 point improvement in the year-to-date attritional combined ratio. The international operation also had minimal change to the top-line with continued growth in our Latin America book, offset by Asia, which was slightly down due to the continued shift on pro rata to excess. Nevertheless, we were successful in growing the excess book, were rates have been stable. Profit remained strong for this operation with a 77.2% year-to-date attritional combined ratio. Now, turning to the insurance operations, which is growing proportion of the total book. The improving trend that we noted in the first quarter continues to build. The premium growth of $61 million or 24% was driven by continued rate increases in California workers’ comp, a new non-standard auto initiative and to a lesser extent rate increases on casualty business and new business growth in general. This profitable growth along with the continued strength of our professional liability, accident and health results has produced the combined ratio for the quarter of 96.6%, continuing the improving profit trend for the insurance operation. The investment income picture for the quarter was also favorable in light of a declining yield environment. Income was down just slightly over the prior years, as new cash flows and income from limited partnerships have helped offset declining reinvestment rates. Capital remained strong although shareholders equity was down slightly at 1.6% from year-end, due to a significant level of share repurchases and a decline in the value of the bond portfolio. This capital position enables us to grow our writing as evidenced in the second quarter from geographic expansions and new products in both our reinsurance and insurance operations. As noted, this diversification which highlights the strength of our franchise has been benefiting our operational results. We have every expectation that this trend will continue. Thank you. And now I will ask Craig to cover the financial highlights.
Craig W. Howie: Thank you, Dom and good morning everyone. We’re pleased to report that Everest had another very strong quarter of earnings with net income of $275.6 million or $5.56 per diluted common share. This compares to net income of $214.6 million or $4.08 per share for the second quarter of 2012. Net income includes realized capital gains and losses. On a year-to-date basis, net income was $660.0 million or $13.09 per share compared to $519.3 million or $9.79 per share in 2012. The 2013 result represents an annualized return on equity of 21%. Operating income year-to-date was $554.2 million or $10.99 per share. This represents a 20% increase over operating income of $462.9 million last year. These results were driven by $129 million increase in underwriting income representing a 58% increase year-over-year. As you just heard from Dom, there are a number of strategic initiatives that are driving these improved results. This increase in underwriting income was partially offset by higher income taxes and slightly lower net investment income compared to the first half of 2012. These results reflect the continued improvement in the overall current year attritional combined ratio, which has declined more than six points from 86.6% to 88.5% on a year-to-date basis. This measure excludes the impact of catastrophes, reinstatement premiums and prior period loss development. The total reinsurance attritional combined ratio was 76.5% for the first half of 2013 compared to 83.7% in the prior year. The insurance segment attritional combined ratio was 96.4% year-to-date compared to 98.7% in the prior year. All segments reported increases in premium volume for the quarter and year-to-date and all segments reported underwriting gains for the quarter and for the first half of 2013. Total reinsurance reported in the underwriting gain of $134 million for the quarter, compared to a $107 million underwriting gain last year. For the first half of 2013, total reinsurance reported an underwriting gain of $344 million, compared to a $219 million gain last year. These results reflect $90 million of current year catastrophe losses in the first half of 2013. All reported in the second quarter. This compares with $60 million of cats during the first half of 2012. The Insurance segment reported an underwriting gain of $9 million for the quarter, compared to a gain of $7 million last year. On a year-to-date basis, the Insurance segment reported an underwriting gain of $9 million, compared to a gain of $5 million in 2012. The 2013 results reflect a crop loss of $10 million for the year, primarily due to the seasonality of crop premiums. But, also including a $4 million unfavorable true up from the 2012 crop year. The overall underwriting gain for the Group was $143 million for the quarter, compared to an underwriting gain of $114 million for the same period last year. On a year-to-date basis, the underwriting gain was $353 million, compared to a gain of $224 million in 2012. Our reported combined ratio was 84.2% for the first half of 2013, compared to 89.0% in 2012. The commission ratio of 21.2% for the first half of 2013 is down 3.5 points compared to the prior year. This lower ratio continues to reflect the shift in reinsurance from pro rata to excess loss contracts, which generally carry a lower commission. It also reflects the shift away from program business to direct business in the Insurance segment. As for loss reserves, in June, we released our third annual global loss development triangles for 2012. There were really no major changes since the 2011 release. Our overall quarterly internal reserving metrics continued to be favorable. For investments, pre-tax investment income was $149 million for the quarter and $295 million year-to-date, under our $16 billion investment portfolio. Our investment portfolio continues to perform well. The pre-tax yield on the overall portfolio was 3.8% with a duration of just over three years. The first six months reflected $106 million of net after-tax revised capital gains compared to $56 million last year. These gains are mainly attributable to fair value adjustments on the equity portfolio. On income taxes, the 12.3% effective tax rate on operating income is in line with our expected rate for the year. Also recall that the 2012 income tax expense benefited from favorable one-time adjustments. Strong cash flow continues, with operating cash flows of $396 million for the first half of 2013, compared to $305 million in 2012. This is despite the high level of loss payments over the last two years related to catastrophes. Earnings to capital management. We completed the redemption of our 6.2% junior subordinated debt in May as we announced on our last quarter call. We expect interest expense of approximately $8 million per quarter going forward. Shareholders’ equity at the end of the quarter was $6.6 billion compared to the $6.7 billion balance at year-end 2012. This is after taking into account $0.5 billion of capital return through $450 million of share buybacks, and $48 million of dividends paid in the first half of 2013. It also reflects $325 million decline in the value of the bond portfolio due to the rising interest rates this year. Book value per share increased to $136.31 from $130.96 at year-end 2012, a 5% increase after adjusting for dividends. Our continued strong capital balance positions us well for potential business opportunities as well as continuing share repurchases. Thank you and now I’ll turn it back to Beth for Q&A.
Elizabeth B. Farrell: Thank you, Craig. At this point, we are open for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) And will take our first question from Amit Kumar with Macquarie Capital.
Amit J. Kumar – Macquarie Research: Well, thanks and good morning. I guess two or three quick questions. First of all just going back on the discussion on the business mix and, I know we’ve talked about this in the past on the shift towards XOL. As you look forward what percentage would you be comfortable with in terms of the business mix?
Craig W. Howie: I’ll start with, Amit. I mean, what we try to do is optimize our portfolio and go to the best deals available certainly on the property side, when we’re fusing the P&L’s that were willing to write to. Now we had seen for the last year or to XOL especially as the rates were rising that we wanted to write more of that, and that was stacking up better relative to pro rata. I’d say on the worldwide basis most of the changes that we wanted to make, we’ve made in the last couple of years, but what we kind of added to the mix was this past June in Florida where we had a shift if you will, within the Florida book where we did more pro rata. I was still kind of guesstimate that where we are at mix wise today is pretty much where we’ll stay on a world-wide basis. But having said that, we will continue to change as the world changes. XOL rates changes, underlying insurance rates change, but I don’t expect the worldwide portfolio to undergo any significant changes I look out for the next year, like it has in the past couple of years.
Amit J. Kumar – Macquarie Research: Got it, that’s helpful. And then where does Mt. Logan I guess fit in and start flowing in the numbers. I guess that would be more so in Q3, just could you refresh us on that?
Dominic J. Addesso: Amit, it’s Dom.
Amit J. Kumar – Macquarie Research: Hi.
Dominic J. Addesso: We had initially targeted by the end of the year to raise approximately $250 million in outsized capital until. We are about half way there, so we have some capital already deployed at Mt. Logan which would be reflected in the third quarter. Craig can get into the details if you like on how that will run through our financials because perhaps they are may have to consolidate that operation but that’s yet to be determined. But that capital has already been committed to us and that will allow us to expand our writings within the reinsurance operations and then essentially quarter share, some business off to Mt. Logan, but it’s not as you can see it’s not necessarily a material amount.
Amit J. Kumar – Macquarie Research: Yeah.
Dominic J. Addesso: It’s a slow build.
Amit J. Kumar – Macquarie Research: Got it. I can take that offline and final question on capital management and you were talking about some of the numbers, I think buybacks were and dividends were 86% or something like that of net income, which is obviously running at a higher trend than what we have seen in the past. How do you think about that, I guess for the remainder of the year? Is that a good metric to use, the current level or do you sort of pullback in the win season, maybe comeback a bit or do you wait for one-one renewals and then sort of comeback in Q1?
Craig W. Howie: Well, we are keen to buy and that’s why we bought $450 million through the first six months. As I said, that kind of shows the confidence that we have in our portfolio, in our future. We probably will be a bit more cautious in the coming quarter, I mean we have historically through win season been a bit more cautious and I think we will probably take that same position. Now we never forecast and so don’t hold us because we reserve the right to change as conditions change, but probably later in the third quarter and if that all goes well, probably back to more in the fourth quarter, that would be kind of a guess at this point.
Amit J. Kumar – Macquarie Research: Okay. That actually is quite helpful. That’s all I have. Thanks.
Operator: We will take our next question from Joshua Shanker with Deutsche Bank.
Joshua Shanker – Deutsche Bank: Hi, I guess for Craig, start, on the bond portfolio, you said, I guess the mark to markets were $325 million, is that correct?
Craig W. Howie: That’s correct on a year-to-date basis Josh.
Joshua Shanker – Deutsche Bank: Year-to-date, okay. So I actually looking at the portfolio at about $6.5 billion, $16.5 billion that’s been fairly resilient, can we sort of get more granularity, it’s certainly better than the performance your peers have so far reported. To the rising interest rate environment and mark-to-market.
Craig W. Howie:  I recall that what we have been doing is been shorting the duration of our portfolio, so that helps dramatically. And then of course we’ve over the last couple of years, we’ve been reallocating some of our portfolio to a larger equity position, which has obviously helped as rates have been coming down, but obviously the stock market has been rising and that’s helped shield some of that results. As well as our yield floating bank debt, and other areas that have kind of protected the portfolio from the times that were most recently have gone through.
Joshua Shanker – Deutsche Bank:  And do you’ve taken some profits I guess on the equity markets.
Craig W. Howie:  We have our equity position has not in terms of what percentage of our asset base has not changed dramatically, but we do within our equity portfolios, we’ll take profits on certain securities and then reinvest in other opportunities that we think have a better upside. Those not been any material change in our allocation equities.
Joshua Shanker – Deutsche Bank: It looks like it shrink by about $100 million despite the rising equity markets, sorry I just thought that may you take some money off the table.
Craig W. Howie:  In some cases we are in particular positions but we continue to look for opportunity in that space. We are not directionally making a major change in our equity allocation.
Joshua Shanker – Deutsche Bank:  And can we talk about the size of the California workers’ comp business now compared to where it was prior to Berkshire’s 2007 moving that space. Are you larger than you were back then or as the proportion of the overall churns business, where does that stand?
Craig W. Howie: Now we were once close to $800 million or $900 million in the marketplace, we’re no longer close to that, but it’s growing we’ll probably better than $300 million in the marketplace this year. We continue to get some very good rate increase and I would expect we’ll probably do more business next year than this year.
Joshua Shanker – Deutsche Bank: So, if we go back to like ’06 almost all the business was workers’ comp and now it’s minority of the business?
Dominic J. Addesso: Well, that would still, it would represent close to 20% to 25%, but yes, we have gotten into crop, we’ve done A&H, professional liability, non-standard auto was now in mix, the California DIC, as well as our E&S operation. So we’ve got a well diversified insurance platform at this point, just in last couple of years, which is we’re quite proud of.
Joshua Shanker – Deutsche Bank:  Can we tease out of the strong growth, rate growth versus unit growth versus I guess expansion into newer markets?
Dominic J. Addesso: I’m sorry Josh. Can we…
Joshua Shanker – Deutsche Bank: I was looking at 36% growth in this quarter; over the last 12 months, probably 30% growth in the insurance book. Can we divide that into rate versus like exposures growth versus I guess newer markets and what not?
Dominic J. Addesso: Well, at a very, very rough estimate you can think about rate level increases particularly in comp and in our general liability classes in a 10% to 15% range. So, essentially that might help you think the 36% versus with that 10% to 15% number.
Joshua Shanker – Deutsche Bank: No, I’ll try and work that. Thank you very much.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.
Michael S. Nannizzi – Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Dom, would it be possible to give us a little bit more detail on this Florida program that you wrote? I was looking back and it looks like even if we compare to like Q2 2011, gross premiums were still quite a bit higher here. So just wondering if that difference is because this contractor program got a lot bigger or you took other exposures in the same area. And then just a quick follow-up on that. Thanks. 
Dominic J. Addesso: You’re saying that 2013 is higher than just this one transaction.
Michael S. Nannizzi – Goldman Sachs & Co.: Well, no. You said that – I thought you had said this was a program that you guys did not, that you had participated in historically and then you didn’t last year. So the delta between 2012 and 2011 or between 2012 and 2013 is really big. So I just figured maybe the better comparison would be 2011, when I would assume then that contractor was in place, comparing that to 2013.
Dominic J. Addesso: I don’t have the 2011 numbers at my fingertips, but let’s maybe just talk about 2012. So in 2012 for this one particular transaction we had almost $200 million of portfolio out. Right. In 2013, the portfolio winning was above $44 million and in addition we wrote some other quarter shares in 2013 that is also packed in these results. I don’t know if that gets to your question, but that’s about the most I can give you in terms of those transactions.
Michael S. Nannizzi – Goldman Sachs & Co.:  Okay. And then, in terms of thinking about this contract earnings through for the rest of the year, I assume that’s when the majority of the contracts are through. First of all, is that right? And second of all, how much is earned though already in the second quarter?
Dominic J. Addesso: No, it earns ratably. I mean there’s no unusual earnings pattern to. It’s just that homeowner business that (inaudible) had over a 12-month period of time.
Joseph V. Taranto: Starting June 1.
Dominic J. Addesso:  Yes. Yeah.
Michael S. Nannizzi – Goldman Sachs & Co.: As always starting June 1.
Joseph V. Taranto: You wouldn’t get too much earning in this quarter.
Michael S. Nannizzi – Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Okay. And then, just one question maybe for Craig. Looks like the revolver, you took some out on the revolver in the quarter. Was that just kind of timing or is that something that you’ll expect to do just to take advantage of still lower interest rates on the borrowing side?
Craig W. Howie:  That’s correct, Mike. It is just really timing, more so than anything else and you’re right. It is very low interest rates.
Michael S. Nannizzi – Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. And then, lastly I guess just thinking about capital deployment looking forward, does this program as large (inaudible) does this is in any way change your outlook in terms of how much you think or would like to deploy via buybacks relative to the how much you are earning over the foreseeable future or should we just consider that to be as it was?
Craig W. Howie: No, I think our outlook on buybacks is very much the same. It’s going to be clearly part of the mix. It’s been a big part of the mix for six months. I think it will continue to be a big part of the mix going forward. We told you despite not just this contract, but everything that was written in Florida we really didn’t increase the PML at the one in 100 and above. So we didn’t want that volatility, which frankly allows us to be more aggressive with regard to buyback. So it doesn’t really change out outlook on that item.
Michael S. Nannizzi – Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. And then just last one if I may. Can you just talk about the non-standard auto book? I’m just trying to understand like when we’re looking ahead in that insurance segment, how big is that, how big should that get into, just what sort of run rate are you thinking about in term or should we be thinking about in terms of profitability there? Thanks.
Joseph V. Taranto: Well, our non-standard auto book was running approximately $30 million a year for us and this year our expectation is that we would be somewhere around $30 million with the expansion hopes into the next year and beyond. That book of business we feel will have at least 10 points of margin in it. So that’s kind of where we expect it to run.
Michael S. Nannizzi – Goldman Sachs & Co.:  Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Greg Locraft with Morgan Stanley.
Gregory Locraft – Morgan Stanley:  Hi, good morning. Just wanted to talk a bit about the reserve triangles. This is the quarter in which you guys have released them. And it seems that there is a cushion that’s growing, and I guess that’s our opinion, based on what we can see. And the numbers are excellent that you are reporting, no doubt there and you’re doing it without reserve releases.  So can you comment a bit on how you feel in the reserves, maybe if you can cut across the different lines where you may feel relatively better or worse? And then, can you perhaps contrast it with the industry, which continues to release a lot, but their position seem to be slipping year-over-year.
Craig W. Howie: Greg, this is Craig. So as you’ve noticed, the decision that we’ve taken over time is to put up a prudent reserve position and over time we’ve developed some very strong process that we have in place to develop that on a conservative basis going forward. So as you see those growing and you’re seeing that across pretty much all lines in those triangles that we put out, but specifically on the reinsurance side we’re seeing some very favorable development in our internal metrics that we look at, for example, actual versus expected that we look out on a regular basis. But again, the multi-pronged approach that we’ve taken in the past over the last three years to setup this reserve position keeps supporting us in a better position over time.
Joseph V. Taranto: And Greg, to comment on any specific line or class of business at this point in time in the absence of a full reserve review is a little bit premature for us to get to in the second quarter. So what’s important for us is the overall reserve position. There are going to be ups and downs in any particular class of business, I mean, we monitor close to 200 different reserve buckets and those move up and down over time. But it’s fair to say that as the industry you always get a little more conservative with respect to the longer tail line. So, the longer tail lines require a little bit more conservative reserve position, but that doesn’t mean – so therefore, I guess, by definition, you can say that it there’s any particular classes of the business that you’d be less comfortable with it would be the longer tails, but we still feel that are causally comp and all those classes are well reserved.
Craig W. Howie: But I will add that, as you know, the results that we’ve put out, and we are proud of these results, do not include any releases if you will. They’re pure results based on this year and we’re very happy that we have such good results that don’t require the benefit of these releases. As far as the industry and how much more there’s left and what’s to come, we really won’t comment on that. I don’t think that we know any better than anybody else about that. We’ll just talk about ourselves.
Gregory Locraft – Morgan Stanley: Okay, great. Yes, the numbers are excellent. So congrats on another great quarter. Thanks.
Dominic J. Addesso:  Thank you.
Operator: We will go next to Vinay Misquith with Evercore Partners.
Vinay Misquith – Evercore Partners: Hi, good afternoon. The first question is on the property cat business. I believe you have about $1 billion of premiums in there. And we’ve heard various things about pricing, US versus the non-US, curious what portion of that business of yours is U.S. versus non-U.S. and how do you see the pricing outlook of that for the future?
Joseph V. Taranto: Well, it is about a $1 billion – it’s probably grown from $1 billion in terms of the pure Cat premiums that we have on a worldwide basis. And I would tell you that the portfolio that we have as of the present after the July 1 renewals is probably the best portfolio we’ve ever had in terms of total expected margin dollars going forward. And the ROE on the business that we’ve written, we think is excellent. Yes, we’ve seen more competition for the business recently, some of that in Florida and you’ve heard how we responded to some of that, and we did see somewhere beyond Florida in July. Clearly we have seen more capacity and in the market wise and I not – I don’t necessarily expect that to go away if there is no big losses. But really as I continue to look forward, I expect us to continue to do well. We’ve dealt with competitions for many years. We’ll continue to deal with that for many years to go. I think we have a lot of advantages in terms of our client relationships, the flexibility that we have in terms of the products that we can put together to meet clients needs, the ratings, the ability to move into pro rata or other options if that makes more sense. So yes, there’s been recently more competition and probably that will stay but we’re still putting together deals that we’re very pleased with.
Dominic J. Addesso: Currently our U.S. catastrophe book represents approximately 50% of the overall worldwide Cat. So not that can change as Joe was describing depending on where the opportunities are, plus or minus 5 points, 10 points, but as we think of it, it’s about approximately half.
Vinay Misquith – Evercore Partners: Okay, that's helpful. And just thinking about this philosophically, if pricing does come down next year, would we see a pullback from you guys or do you think you can manage to still maintain your market share? 
Joseph V. Taranto: Well, yes, to be determinative, the pricing change dramatically and we were less enthusiastic about, less than I would expect that we would do less. And probably buy a whole lot of stock more back. And of course we would look for other opportunities to deploy our capital in other lines of business and other business dealing, whether it’s acquisitions or something else. So sure as the world changes, we’ll change, that’s always the way it’s been, that’s always the way it will be.
Vinay Misquith – Evercore Partners: Sure, that's helpful. And then on the primary insurance, are we still on track for a low 90%’s combined ratio?
Joseph V. Taranto: Right now we’re in the mid-90%’s, and trending towards that number, yes.
Vinay Misquith – Evercore Partners: Fine, and then just the last question is on Cats. Your Cats in the Canadian flood seem to be very low, just about $20 million and I know you guys are big player there. Just wanted to understand your exposure there and how you had such low Cats there? Thanks.
Joseph V. Taranto: In Canada?
Vinay Misquith – Evercore Partners:  Yes, correct.
Joseph V. Taranto: We are a significant player in the Canadian market. We tend to figure ourselves as probably the second or third largest reinsurer there. A bigger proportion of our portfolio relative to maybe some of the others is perhaps more casualty. And also we have not been as strong in that region as some others. So we’ve not put down a lot of capacity in those regions where heavily prone – easily and more readily exposed to flood.
Dominic J. Addesso:  The property pro rata in Canada and the actual lead cut back in the last couple of years as we didn’t believe that business was rated as healthy as it should be. 
Vinay Misquith – Evercore Partners: Okay that's very helpful. Thank you. 
Operator: We will take our final question from Brian Meredith with UBS.
Brian Meredith – UBS: Yeah, good morning. A couple of questions here for you. The first one, can you tell us what the actual UEP transfer that came in on that Florida deal was?
Joseph V. Taranto: The portfolio end was $44 million.
Brian Meredith – UBS: $44 million? Great, thanks. And then just another quick question, on that deal how important was securing the ILW for you doing the deal and how much margin enhancement was that?
Joseph V. Taranto: That was not a factor in that transaction.
Dominic J. Addesso: The ILW deal wasn’t just us managing the overall portfolio. We liked all the deals that we did, very pleased to do them and increase our margin. But when we got done we had a PML at 1-in-100 and above that was over, what it was a year ago. And we decided we didn’t want that. And so we went to the ILW market, procured a deal that was very, very happy with at, took it back down.
Brian Meredith – UBS: Great. And then can you give us a quick update on what you are seeing as far as demand for casualty reinsurance out there? Is it still kind of declining? What is kind of the appetite out there for casualty reinsurance? And then also on that, have you seen any kind of change in terms and conditions, more multiyear deals, coverage’s, anything else going on?
Joseph V. Taranto: Well, demand on the casualty side is it is kind of what you’re implying in your question has been relatively weak. But that’s been certainly something we have seen for the last couple of years. Nevertheless, we actually have been writing some new accounts, less so on the larger national type of clients where in that particular case the trend would be for less purchases as they increase retentions and as pricing is going up maybe a bigger better appetite on their end.  But we have written some new business in the casualty space which is growing our portfolio, so it’s real difficult to say what’s happening with the market overall, but I don’t think there is any significant change from the year-ago in terms of buyers appetite. And again, we’re able to put some new business on the books, which were part of our franchises about building out the casualty operations well particularly into a market that where we are seeing some rate increase. In terms of other types of transactions we are only seeing new and different types of transactions, different structures all the time, whether it’s on the property or the casualty side and it’s I made some slight reference – remarks about structured solutions and we’re beginning to see opportunity there. And perhaps there is a slight pick up in where buyers are looking for in that space and we’re participating in that. 
Brian Meredith – UBS: Great. Thank you.
Operator: This does conclude today’s question-and-answer session. I’d like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing or additional remarks.
Elizabeth B. Farrell: I’d just like to thank everybody for joining us today.
Operator:  This does conclude today’s call. We thank you for your participation.

===== 2013 Q1  (2013-04-24 10:30:00) =====
Executives:  Elizabeth B. Farrell – Vice President, Investor Relations Joseph V. Taranto – Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Dominic J. Addesso – President Craig W. Howie – Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer 
Analysts:  Amit Kumar – Macquarie Research Equities Michael S. Nannizzi – Goldman Sachs & Co., Inc. Greg Locraft – Morgan Stanley Vinay Misquith – Evercore Partners, Inc. Brian R. Meredith – UBS Securities LLC  
Operator: Please standby we’re about to begin. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the First Quarter 2013 Earnings Call of Everest Re Group Limited. Today’s conference is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I’d like to turn the conference over to Ms. Beth Farrell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Elizabeth B. Farrell: Thank you, Tim. Good morning and welcome to Everest Re Group’s first quarter and 2013 earnings conference call. On the call with me today are Joe Taranto, the company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Dom Addesso, our President; and Craig Howie, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I note that statements made during today’s call which are forward-looking in nature, such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations, and the like are subject to various risks. As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations. Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements. Now, let me turn the call over to Joe.
Joseph V. Taranto: Thanks, Beth, good morning. In the first quarter we have 13% growth in premium, 25% growth in operating earnings, and an annualized net income return on equity of 25%. I’m extremely pleased with our underwriting portfolio was positioned and our investment portfolio was positioned. We are finding growth opportunities in both our reinsurance and insurance operations, and I expect strong top line growth to continue this year. Dom will provide more detail on this shortly. During the quarter we repurchased $239 million of our shares. After the quarter, we repurchased another $11 million of our shares for a grand total of $250 million. Even though we bought back a quarter of $1 billion worth of stock and paid $24 million in dividends, our earnings powered an increase in shareholders equity from $6.7 billion to $6.8 billion. Recently, we notified noteholders of our 6.2% junior subordinated debt securities that we will be calling the bonds. Accordingly, we expect to redeem $320 million of debt in late May. We are presently investing new money, it’s slightly over 2% in corporate bonds. So we expect to have roughly a 4% benefit of these funds on an annualized basis going forward. That means we expect to increase pre-tax earnings by approximately $13 million annualized going forward from June. Craig will later provide additional detail on this transaction. Repurchasing a quarter of a billion dollars of stock and redeeming $320 million of our bonds underscores the strength of our company and our confidence in our future.  Frankly, we’ve never been stronger and we’ve never been better positioned. I am very proud that Everest has increased shareholder value for over 17 years at a compounded rate of 13%. I am pleased that we beat our historical average last year including shareholder value at 18%, and I am pleased that we beat our historical average again in the first quarter of this year as we grew shareholder value at an annualized rate of 18%. We continue to see opportunities and are very excited about our future prospects. Dom?
Dominic J. Addesso: Thanks, Joe, and good morning. The first quarter reflects – results reflect an improving market in certain areas, lack of any major tax, and most importantly, a number of initiatives, which are beginning to yield benefits. Starting with reinsurance, the quarter produced a $210 million underwriting gain or 76.4% combined ration. Each of our major segments within reinsurance experienced combined ratios less than 80%. The quarterly trend in the attritional combined ratios has been improving as a result of the shift from pro rata to excess. This has not only had a dramatic impact on the loss ratio, but also the expense ratio. In addition, we have capitalized on favorable market condition in certain regions and introduced new product offerings in both existing and new classes of business, which have increased our writings and resulted in greater diversification both in product and geography. These factors were most evident in the U.S. Reinsurance segment, where premium growth was close to 18%. In addition to new business opportunities, this segment benefited from rate increases on existing business with noted improvements in the casualty classes as well as those accounts that were affected by Sandy losses. In the International and Bermuda segments, growth in total premiums were slightly in excess of 6%. Here, we also experienced some new business growth, which accounts for most of the increase. Rate activity varied depending on class and geography, which overall can be characterized as flattish in terms of its impact. Looking forward into the second quarter for all reinsurance segments, we expect casualty rates to continue to improve. This favorable trend in overall casualty rates is also a positive for our insurance operations as I will discuss shortly. Rate increases were also a factor for the marine book, which has grown in excess of 8% for the quarter, due to both rate and new business. Property continues to be mixed depending on geography. The loss affected accounts in the northeast U.S. have seen increases, while Asia and Europe have been relatively flat. Nevertheless, we continue to deploy new capacity in product and layers, which provide returns in excess of our hurdle rates. Our portfolio continues to be well positioned. Actions taken over the last few quarters have resulted in a well balanced and diversified book, which has steadily improved the profitability. This diversification also means that the portfolio is better positioned to absorb cat events. Turning to the Insurance segment also reveals an improved result with a combined ratio below 100%. However, this include a 136% combined ratio in the crop insurance book, which was due to the seasonality of the premium in that business and the impact on the expense ratio as well as adverse development from last year’s draught conditions. When looking at the Insurance segment without the crop business, it results in a 96% combined ratio. This highlights the underlying improvement expected as a result of continued double-digit rate increases and workers comp and general casualty in addition to the elimination of certain program businesses. These rate increases along with growth particularly in the specialty classes as a result of the new initiatives referenced last quarter should continue to move the insurance operations forward in a positive direction. In addition, the previously announced transition regarding our non-standard auto business will allow that business to grow with an improving margins. Primary medical stop loss product continues to yield over 12 points of margin and our U.S. professional liability book is at nine points of underwriting profit. In both cases pricing is generally flat, so near-term growth is expected to be purposefully slow. Primary property rates continue to show a sign of firming, so selective growth is expected. Finally, as we move into the remainder of the year, the crop writing will emerge. We had a successful renewal season as new territories were opened which will result in growth, in gross premiums year-over-year. In addition, the net account will become much more significant to the segment with the elimination of reported share in force last year. The combination of crop, A&H,, DIC, specialty casualty and property, professional liability, non-standard auto, and California workers’ comp, all with continuing or improving fundamentals to translate into a positive trend for the combined ratio below the previously mentioned 96% I’ll conclude by touching on investment income, the other major component of our operating results. For the quarter, investment income was as anticipated down over the prior year. While this was due to lower reinvestment rates, it was better than forecast due to the strategies deployed over the last several quarters. Diversification is the high yield bond and dividend paying stocks has helped to stall the decline. In addition, our limited partnerships continue to perform well. The increased allocation to equities has also been a benefit to net income this quarter as realized capital gains were $127 million. These investments and underwriting strategies that have been emerging over the last several quarters produce record earnings for the quarter. The headwinds of investment rates or reinsurance or insurance rates or whatever else the markets can throw at us always be a factor in varying degrees in a different times. Nevertheless, the acquisition to our resources and our portfolio to be able to respond effectively to the challenges and to take full advantage of the opportunities that the markets present to us. These are the benefits of a well diversified in global platform. Thank you. Now, I’ll turn it over Craig for further detail on the financials.
Craig W. Howie: Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report that Everest had a record quarter of earnings with after-tax operating income of $301.1 million, or $5.88 per diluted common share for the first quarter of 2013. This is a 25% increase over after-tax operating income of $239.9 million, or $4.48 per share for the first quarter of 2012. Net income for the first quarter was $384.3 million or $7.50 per diluted share, compared to $304.7 million or $5.68 per share in 2012. Net income includes realized capital gains and represents an annualized return on equity of 25%. These results were driven by $100 million increase in the underwriting result, offset by higher income taxes and slightly lower net investment income compared to the first quarter of 2012. The results reflect the continued improvement in the overall current year attritional combined ratio, which has declined more than 5 points from 86.4% to 80.7%. This measure excludes the impact of catastrophes, reinstatement premiums, and prior period loss development. The total reinsurance attritional combined ratio was 76.8% compared to 83.2% in the prior year. The Insurance segment attritional combined ratio was 98.5% compared to 101.2% in the prior year. However, eliminating the effects of the primary crop book, this ratio would have been 95.9% compared to 98.2% in the prior year. All segments reported underwriting gains for the quarter and all segments reported improved underwriting results compared to last year. Total reinsurance reported an underwriting gain of $210 million for the quarter, compared to $112 million underwriting gain last year. The first quarter of 2012 was impacted by $30 million of catastrophe losses. The Insurance segment reported an underwriting gain of $193,000 for the quarter, compared to an underwriting loss of $2 million last year. These results reflect a crop loss of $7 million for the quarter primarily due to the seasonality of crop premiums, but also including a $3 million true up from the 2012 crop year. The overall underwriting gain for the Group was $210 million for the quarter, compared to an underwriting gain of $110 million in the same period last year. Our reported combined ratio was 80.7% for the quarter, compared to 89.0% in 2012. The commission ratio of 21.4% for the quarter is down 2.4 points compared to the prior year. This lower ratio reflects the shift in reinsurance from pro rata to excess of loss contracts which generally carry a lower commission. It also reflects the shift away from program business to direct business in the Insurance segment. Our low expense ratio of 4.9% continues to be a major competitive advantage. Our recent industry analysis showed that we had the lowest overhead expense ratio in the industry for 2012, a full 2 point advantage. On reserves, our overall quarterly internal reserving metrics continue to be favorable. For investments, pre-tax investment income was $146 million for the quarter are now are $16.6 billion investment portfolio. Investment income declined $7 million from one year ago. This decrease was primarily driven by declining reinvestment rates, partially offset by higher limited partnership income for the quarter. Despite the decline in rates, our investment portfolio continues to perform well. The pre-tax yield on the overall portfolio was 3.7% with a duration of just over three years. The quarter reflected $83 million of net after-tax realized capital gains compared to $65 million last year. These gains are mainly attributable to fair value adjustments on the equity portfolio. On income taxes, the 12.3% effective tax rate on operating income is in line with our expected rate for the year. Also, recall the 2012 income tax expense benefited from favorable one-time adjustments. Strong cash flow continues, with operating cash flows of $226 million for the quarter compared to $166 million in 2012. This is despite the high-level of catastrophe loss payments over the last two years. Turning to capital management; as Joe mentioned, we have decided to call our 6.2% junior subordinated debt that was due in 2034. The noteholders have been notified and the redemption will occur on May 24. This will save about $20 million of annualized interest expense and we will use cash that would have been invested at about 2%, and net savings of about 4% will increase annualized earnings by approximately $13 million beginning in June. Shareholders equity increased to $6.8 billion this year, up $83 million from $6.7 billion at year end 2012. This is after taking into account capital returned for $239 million of stock repurchases and the $24 million of dividends paid in the first quarter of 2013. Book value per share increased 4% to $136.43 from $130.96 at year end 2012. Our strong capital position leaves us with the capacity to maximize our business opportunities, as well as continued share repurchases. Thank you. And now I’ll turn it back to Beth for Q&A.
Elizabeth B. Farrell: Tim, we are ready to take questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) And we’ll take our first question from Amit Kumar with Macquarie Capital.
Amit Kumar – Macquarie Research Equities: Thanks and good morning and congrats on a strong quarter. I guess two or three questions; my first question relates to the upcoming renewals. We’ve heard a lot about the third-party capital entering this marketplace and some other companies have alluded to a tough renewal at 71. I was curious, what’s your thoughts are on that, I guess in conjunction with Mt. Logan Re? Thanks.
Craig W. Howie: Let me start with at least the [6/1s] that are coming up, which I guess are more the Florida renewals.
Amit Kumar – Macquarie Research Equities: Yeah.
Craig W. Howie: First of all, looking to the Florida market, and I do expect more demand but as you noted, there probably will be more supply as well. I won’t predict how that collectively moves the entire market, but overall, I still expect it to be quite a good market. I anticipate, we will have a very good June 1 renewal and we will be renewing business in healthy rates. We concluded a few deals so far for the 6/1 season and we’re reasonably far along on a few others and what we’ve put to bed so far is at similar rates to last year. On top of that underlying homeowner rates continue to improve, which will make quota share opportunities healthier and commercial property rates continue to improve making for better environment for our insurance operation, our property insurance operation in Florida and have facultative reinsurance operation. I expect XOL reinsurance to be well rated as well. Going beyond that to 7/1, again, it gets even a little fussier if you get into some of the international renewals. What we saw recently in April in Japan is that was a relatively flattish renewal, so we’ll see what happens when we get to July and beyond. But I don’t expect the world to change all that dramatically for cat business for provisional reinsurers.
Amit Kumar – Macquarie Research Equities: Got it. The other question I had was on crop. Do you have the percentage breakdown of your crop book, I think in terms of what percent is corn, what percent is soybean, and what percent is winter wheat? That would be very helpful 
Craig W. Howie: Our portfolio was about 40% corn, 25% wheat, 17% soy and then remaining mixture between cotton and another grains and beans. Now the most of the wheat is fall crop, if that helps.
Amit Kumar – Macquarie Research Equities: Yeah, and I guess final question related to that, the corn planting is meaningfully behind, I guess, the long-term trend and it seems that the window is closing very quickly. I was curious if you had any thoughts on the corn planting and how that would play into the results going forward? Thanks.
Dominic J. Addesso: Well, I think last year my recollection was that the, was really a relatively early planting season and I think this year’s planting is along the expected calendar. So I am not sure of that we view at the same way as what you might be suggesting. Certainly, farmers need to get their crops on the ground before the middle of May and we still think that, there is plenty of opportunity to do that. There has been some floodings in certain areas of the Midwest that might delay some of the plantings, but much of the flooding does not affect farm lands and then to the extent that those areas that we designated as flood prone, we have the ability and have actually exceeded those risks through the assigned risk pool.
Craig W. Howie: Yeah, let me add to that. Really and it’s early days for the crop business, but at this point, we have no reason to expect anything other than a normal season. Time will tell, but we have no indication otherwise at this point.
Amit Kumar – Macquarie Research Equities: I was just looking at a USDA report, which shows that if you look at Illinois or Indiana, I mean, if planting was 50% last year, right now is at 1%. And so you are saying that it should still be fine even though the numbers telling another story, okay. That’s all I have. Thanks for all the answers.
Joseph V. Taranto: Thank you.
Operator:  And we’ll take our next question from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.
Michael S. Nannizzi – Goldman Sachs & Co., Inc.:  Thank you. Just one question on the – our investment portfolio. So are you pulling down duration kind of in an anticipation of the potential rise in interest or potential rise in interest rates or is that something that you are not really kind of positioning for at this point?
Dominic J. Addesso: We, as I made some reference to, the investment strategies really began with us several quarters, and we pulled down duration dramatically over the last several quarters. What we’ve done more recently has been relatively stable. Our duration is under 3 right now, and that hasn’t moved much last couple of quarters. So we’ve been stable in that regard. But we’ve done a lot of work in terms of moving that to where it is today over the last several quarters, which began as I mentioned a few quarters ago.
Michael S. Nannizzi – Goldman Sachs & Co., Inc.:  So I mean, I just…
Joseph V. Taranto: Some of the thinking is to be protected in the event there is a big rise in the interest rates.
Michael S. Nannizzi – Goldman Sachs & Co., Inc.: Okay. I guess, the question I would have is along those lines, and you mentioned calling some debt, I mean, you’ve got relatively high interest debt, I mean, you’ve got obviously low interest rates, I mean, what is the – how do you reconcile the decision to call those bonds instead of kind of replacing the leverage that you, very low leverage that you currently have?
Craig W. Howie: Michael, this is Craig, and there were many options that we evaluated when we went through this process and frankly all the options were good options for us. This was the most accretive to our earnings and especially since it’s a risk free return to us, our capital position is strong enough to absorb this transaction where we didn’t have to replace it with other debt. And it really should have no impact on our share repurchases for the year.
Michael S. Nannizzi – Goldman Sachs & Co., Inc.: Right. So the savings from, just want to make sure I understand, so calling the 6.2% debt would be more accretive to per share earnings than reissuing and repurchasing $300 million stock.
Craig W. Howie:  That’s correct.
Michael S. Nannizzi – Goldman Sachs & Co., Inc.: Okay, and then one question I had on the insurance, Craig, I feel I like I’m kind of going back, it seems like it’s a book that has been in some transition whether it’s the crop book, the quota share program, program book, the re-rating on the comp side. How should we think about this? I mean, I still kind of, I look at it, I am not really sure the crop versus the non- crop, how big is it. What’s the impact of this quota share program and how should we think about this books going forward? I mean, I appreciate the commentary about the combined ratio drifting downward, but I just – I don’t have a good feel for what’s in there and whether or not there are more potential changes to come other than opportunistic moves on the margin, is this book, is the corpus now mostly in place?
Craig W. Howie: Well, there are lots of moving pieces and you’ve got in excess of – will be in excess of $200 million of premium in crop for the year. Likewise, we’ll have well in excess of $200 million for the California comp, our primary medical stop-loss business is just under $100 million. We’ve got the non-standard auto business, it was at $30 million, expected to grow to $80 million and from there.
Michael S. Nannizzi – Goldman Sachs & Co., Inc.: Okay.
Dominic J. Addesso: So it’s pieces of that, our elements that we expect to grow, we’ve got an excess cash in the facility, we’ve got an environmental facility. We just formed this specialty insurance group which I’ve mentioned in previous, I think in the last quarter to focus on some unique classes of business and niche business. By the same token the program business is coming down, moving more to a direct broker model and all of those things are having the positive impact on our business. Also, our California DIC business has performed nicely and we have a property E& operation that could experience some growth in and strengthening property insurance market in particular.
Joseph V. Taranto: Adding a little bit more to that, I mean the crop business will probably be roughly speaking, 25% of our business. And as I said we’re expecting a normal year, normal year means a very reasonable profit. Workers’ comp is probably another 25% of our business and rates continue to go up there quite nicely. Frankly, in the course of the last four years, we’ve achieved compounded 60% of rate. So if you put those two together, which are trending nicely, and you are up to a half of the book.
Michael S. Nannizzi – Goldman Sachs & Co., Inc.:  Right.
Joseph V. Taranto:  After that as Dom noted, professional liability making a portion, which is running very well, medical staff loss making a portion, which is running very well. the non-standard auto portion, D&O and property rates are going up and that’s a portion. So, you can kind of, that helps quantify for you, but everything is moving in the right direction. and frankly, if you take out the blip from crop in this quarter, it’s 96 when you put it all together even this quarter. So …
Michael S. Nannizzi – Goldman Sachs & Co., Inc.: All right.
Joseph V. Taranto: That’s what we feel good about it.
Michael S. Nannizzi – Goldman Sachs & Co., Inc.: Got it. And so, you’ve got about 2.5 point of underlying combined ratio improvement ex crop in the segment year-over-year? So as we kind of look is you’ve got crop, which is anomalistic from rate environment, you’ve got workers comp where it sounds like you’re saying that rate is running at a healthy clip ahead a loss trend. And then, if we’re look at the other 50% of book, how should we think about the migration there in terms of where your – is there an amalgamated rate versus loss trend where you are aiming or targeting for that we can kind of think about as that book moves ahead? And thank you for all your answers.
Craig W. Howie: Well, let me talk about the other 50%.
Michael S. Nannizzi – Goldman Sachs & Co., Inc.: Okay.
Joseph V. Taranto: I already, I think I mentioned in my opening comments, the margins that we’re experiencing in our medical staff loss book of business and professional liability book. We’re obviously pleased with those margins, but as I said, rates appear to be flattish in that environment. So we’re not expecting huge amounts of growth, but we’re certainly – those two classes of business if you will are easily meeting our hurdle rates. As the casualty rates for us are going up double-digit and certainly, we would expect that trend to continue above, certainly above loss trend. And so we expect to see growth casualty space in the primary market.
Michael S. Nannizzi – Goldman Sachs & Co., Inc.: Great, Thank you so much.
Operator: And we’ll go next to Greg Locraft with Morgan Stanley.
Greg Locraft – Morgan Stanley: Great. Thanks, guys, and awesome quarter. I wanted to just follow-up on your commentary that mid-year or at least the last couple of deals were sort of renewing flat year-over-year. Can you be more specific in terms of what type of business is this, what layers, is this Florida, is it not Florida. Can you help us think about, because that’s actually a lot better than what I was thinking?
Dominic J. Addesso: What Joe was referencing in that comment was the 6.1s that we’ve already put to bed or about to put to bed in Florida.
Joseph V. Taranto: Yeah, we put to bed probably close to half of the premium that we’ve done on XOL business that we did last year, we put that to bed this year and pretty flat rate versus rate. So there is more to come and this will take a couple of months, but that’s what we’ve experienced so far.
Greg Locraft – Morgan Stanley: Okay, great. And maybe same topic just on the mid-years and specifically Florida, what are you seeing on the unit side, it seems like there is some favorable trends from a de-pop perspective that there might be materializing. Could you help us think about some of those?
Dominic J. Addesso:  Well, there are Greg, I mean, I think that’s one I was saying I expect demands to go up, because you are right since it’s de-popping and that seems to be going to some of the smaller companies more thinly capitalized that are more in need of a traditional reinsurance. So that’s why I kind of said demand is on the rise. But at the same time, I do believe there is some supply on the rise in the sense that reinsurers like ourselves, surplus is building and there is some alternate capital coming in. So I wasn’t going to get into predicting when you put all that together what it means in terms of rate for the industry, but I really already know that we’re going to have a – we’re going to have a good June first. I mean, I know enough information to see that will be the case.
Greg Locraft – Morgan Stanley:  Okay. Great. So demand is up, and then pricing is flat or maybe jumping back to my last question.
Dominic J. Addesso:  Well, what we’ve done so far is flat. More to come.
Greg Locraft – Morgan Stanley: Okay, and again, the flat you’re mentioning is price that’s not just premiums that are flat?
Dominic J. Addesso: No, rate relative to exposure, now…
Greg Locraft – Morgan Stanley: Perfect. Perfect.
Dominic J. Addesso: I am talking about the XOL business on that, meanwhile, underlying insurance rates, at least homeowner rates continue to go up, and that makes that business healthier. And remember we participated in some quota share as well, and so that business is getting better that we participate via quota share and commercial property rates continue to go up and we do have a commercial property insurance book in Florida, so that’s getting better and facultative book, which does some commercial business in Florida is now going to be dealing with insurers that have gotten better rate on their business. So there are various things going on, but when it all shapes out, at least, for us, I expect it to be quite good at June.
Greg Locraft – Morgan Stanley: Okay, that is great color, thanks. And then just jumping topics, on the buyback front, again, excellent quarter on that. You bought back half the – I’m sorry, 4% of the company. So that’s an excellent number. What I am sort of scratching my head on though is why don’t you do more, the buyback…
Unidentified Company Representative: These are billion or two nice quarter [Multiple Speakers]
Joseph V. Taranto: Keep in mind, we not only this quarter are effectively doing the buyback, we are also redeeming $320 million bond. But I think what all of that says as we’re feeling very strong in terms of the portfolio, the current earnings, the future earnings. And frankly, we’re also feeling it, agreeing with you that it’s a good time for us to be buying and to be buying in a very significant way. We look at $0.25 billion as if it was the significant in the first quarter, Greg? I don’t know how many others are going to be buying back 4% of their stock in this quarter.
Greg Locraft – Morgan Stanley: Yeah, no, I actually – what’s amazing is you actually earned even more, right? I mean, the payout ratio is still, so, yeah it’s great. So hopefully, we can do 4% every quarter for a while to come. Again, great start to the year. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it.
Dominic J. Addesso: Thank you.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Vinay Misquith with Evercore Partners.
Vinay Misquith – Evercore Partners, Inc.:  Hi, good morning. The first question is on Florida, again. So I hate to beat a dead horse, but just curious as to why your experience is different from sort of what the brokers are seeing on the Florida market?
Dominic J. Addesso: Well, I have to say to begin with, what the many of the brokers are predicting, we’ll see what happens, because they are predicting deals that are our future deals. But there was some uniqueness to the deals that we’ve done so far as to why we had some competitive advantages as to we were able to certainly maintain rates. But I would go beyond that for the deals that we will be seeing. We have no interest if there is some meaningful decline in rates, in participating in those portions of the business where there are meaningful declines. As I noted, there is pockets of the business were rates are getting better, starting with the primary insurance rates that are helpful with regard to quota shares. So we have a lot of options in terms of how we put down our aggregate in the market. We can put it on quota shares, we can put it on XOL, we can put it on facultative reinsurance, we can put it on commercial insurance and we’re going to go at it the best way whereas the healthiest rate and it makes most sense for us to put down. So I’m telling what our situation has been so far and I also tell you I think we have some very good options that will take us into 6/1 that will give us a good portfolio at the end of that. Perhaps when you do put the market at the end of June all together given what the broker said, you may see some decline that remains to be seen, but I’m very happy with our situation.
Vinay Misquith – Evercore Partners, Inc.: Okay, that’s helpful. Second point is on the lower commission expense ratio that was certainly a positive this quarter, how much of the transition from for – to XOL and the program business, the normal business have you done. So in other words, should we see this same level of expense ratio continuing for the next couple of quarters?
Dominic J. Addesso: Now I wouldn’t expect it to trend this way. I think what you’ve seen here is as a decline over time and this was fairly large impact here in the first quarter, but due to a number of reasons, as I mentioned, it’s both on the reinsurance side from the shipment business. But also on the insurance side, because we’ve moved to more direct rating in set of program business, so what you’re seeing is that benefit coming through. I would expect this to be closer to a normal run rate than we continue on track.
Vinay Misquith – Evercore Partners, Inc.: Okay, that’s helpful. And then the last point was on the buyback. this quarter, you bought back about 90% of earnings, so is that fairly a good run rate, sort of excluding the hurricane season that we should be thinking about, and you’ve mentioned before that the debt repurchase will not impact the buyback, correct?
Joseph V. Taranto: That’s correct. we look at that as capital; we didn’t look at that capital before we did, and so it doesn’t affect our mentality for buying going forward. Well, we had never given guidance on what we will buyback going forward. And we won’t at this stage. so I’m not going to give you some formula relative to earnings or anything else. But let us say that it’s clear and what we did in the first quarter that we think it is a very good way to improve results for shareholders going forward for us to continue to buyback a substantial amount of our stock.
Vinay Misquith – Evercore Partners, Inc.: Sure, fair enough. And just to clarify the top line growth this year has not add anymore capital requirements, correct?
Dominic J. Addesso: It’s correct.
Vinay Misquith – Evercore Partners, Inc.: Okay, that’s it. Thank you.
Operator: We have time for one more question. We will take our last question from Brian Meredith with UBS.
Brian R. Meredith – UBS Securities LLC: Yeah, thanks, good morning. Dom, just we talked a little bit of about the casualty reinsurance market and particularly, can you tell me you talked about how you’re seeing some rate in casualty. I assume you are talking more on the subject premium base rather than actually reinsurance and what are you seeing with terms and conditions on some of the casualty reinsurance and demand in that marketplace as well.
Dominic J. Addesso: The most of the increase, yes, it’s coming from the subject base. As primary rates, of course, are going up that’s having a positive impact on the subject base. That’s not to say that we don’t have some relationships or contract transactions where the reinsurance rate might be changing as well. So you could be getting it in both spots, but that’s very, very deal-specific. But clearly, the underlying primary trend is what’s driving the casualty market. I have to say that there is not really any overall dramatic change in terms and conditions relative to casualty deals. And relative to demand, I think demand again, other than the increasing subject base, we’re not necessarily seeing sessions from customers in this space going up dramatically. So it’s all basically, any growth there is basically being driven by rate, and some new business opportunities. We’re able to grow the portfolio, now that we see margins improving there to entertain plenty of new business opportunities being able to leverage. The relationships that we already have and I don’t mean that in a negative way, but we’re able to expand our casualty relationships, and we’ll be providing property capacity to clients, we see the market improving. we have a much bigger appetite for entertaining casualty business.
Brian R. Meredith – UBS Securities LLC: Great, thanks. And then just quickly, could you tell us about what you think the impact of alternative capacity was going to be on midyear renewals, kind of what’s your thought maybe even longer-term and how that potentially could impact traditional market?
Dominic J. Addesso:
 :
Dominic J. Addesso: I would answer that, that some of these alternative capital providers can’t really offer the same products that we offer where we can kind of tailor our products to the client’s needs. And also, we have relationships with many of our partners, business relationships that go back for many, many years; underwriting facilities around the world. So we have some competitive advantages over these – over this new capital if you will. But it’s a little bit complex in terms of how this is going to affect everything and further you look at, we’ll see.
Brian R. Meredith – UBS Securities LLC: Great, thank you.
Operator: And that concludes our Q&A session. I’ll turn it back over to our speakers for any closing remarks.
Dominic J. Addesso: I just want to thank everybody for joining us today
Joseph V. Taranto: Thank you.
Operator: That concludes today’s conference call. We appreciate your participation.

===== 2012 Q4  (2013-02-07 10:30:00) =====
Executives:  Beth Farrell – VP, IR Joe Taranto – Chairman and CEO Dom Addesso – President Craig Howie – CFO
Analysts:  Josh Shanker – Deutsche Bank Amit Kumar – Macquarie Mike Nannizzi – Goldman Sachs Vinay Misquith – Evercore Partners Brian Meredith – UBS Greg Locraft – Morgan Stanley 
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Everest Re Group Limited Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. Today’s conference is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I’d like to turn the conference over to Beth Farrell. Please go ahead.
Beth Farrell: Thanks, Tim. Good morning and welcome to Everest Re Group’s fourth quarter and full year 2012 earnings conference call. On the call with me today are Joe Taranto, the company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Dom Addesso, our President; and Craig Howie, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I note that statements made during today’s call which are forward-looking in nature, such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations, and the like are subject to various risks. As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations. Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements. Now let me turn the call over to Joe.
Joe Taranto: Thanks Beth. Good morning. I am pleased to report that in 2012 Everest increased shareholder value by 18% and had comprehensive income of $1 billion. These results were achieved despite losses from Sandy and the crop insurance industry having one of its worst years ever. Achieving these results despite these losses demonstrates the strength of our franchise. We were pleased with our January 1 renewals. On our reinsurance business, rates, terms and conditions were relatively the same as in 2012. We did add some new business. Accordingly, the expected margins remained quite good for 2013 and up from 2012. Dom will provide more detail on this momentarily. For our insurance operations, we continue to see double-digit increases in workers’ compensation and general liability and single-digit increases in D&O and property. We believe the workers’ comp business is positioned for profit and that continued rate increases will provide for growth. For our crop book, we are expecting a much better year. Further, our net crop premiums will increase meaningfully as we no longer purchase quota share reinsurance. Again, Dom will provide more detail. Our investments performed very well in 2012 and are off to a good start in 2013. Craig will provide more color on this. We bought back $40 million worth of stock in the fourth quarter and $38 million in the first quarter of 2013. We wanted to buy a great deal more, but Sandy kept us out of the market for much of the quarter. It is our plan to buy when our window reopens. We have achieved a 13% increase in shareholder value compounded over an 18-year period. In 2012, we did better than our historic average coming in at 18%. Given these returns, our current quality portfolio and solid balance sheet, our stock being below book makes no sense to us, meaning we are most happy to buy more and fully expect the price to book to correct. In summary, I’m bullish on 2013. Our franchise has never been stronger. Dom?
Dom Addesso: Thanks, Joe and good morning. The financial details regarding the quarter will be covered by Craig, but it is worth highlighting the areas that address how we have positioned the portfolio and what that means for current and future performance. The attritional combined ratio continues to improve in both the reinsurance segments and the insurance segments. For reinsurance, this primarily reflects the increasing proportion of excessive loss business versus pro rata, in particular for catastrophe exposure business, as well as increasing rates in 2012. The calendar year combined ratio for the reinsurance book, despite Superstorm Sandy and the other catastrophe losses earlier in the year, came in at 90.1%. This result reflects a 102.1% combined ratio in the U.S. book due to the losses incurred for Sandy, offset by a 75.4% and a 91.5% combined ratio in our international and Bermuda portfolios respectively. This overall outcome reflects our balanced and geographically diversified book of business. During 2012, there was a continued emphasis on excess-of-loss business, particularly in our non-peak zones. This allowed us to diversify or spread our aggregate exposure more broadly without any material impact on our average annual loss. Along with rate increases, this strategy helped grow our catastrophe premium by $150 million to approximately $1 billion. At this level of premium, we’re well positioned to absorb any infrequent, but significant industry event, such as Superstorm Sandy. This strategy has also been instrumental in expanding our customer base, thereby improving diversification both by client and by line of business. Broadening of the customer base has supported some growth in the treaty and facultative casualty lines, as rates are beginning to firm. Overall, we expect margins to improve in these areas, while rates in the treaty property area begin to moderate. Nevertheless, margins there are still favorable as evidenced by the results this past year. New products developed in 2012 should continue to push momentum in 2013. At January 1, we had already seen approximately $150 million of premium growth in property business as a result of these efforts. The development of our capital markets platform will continue to support this growth with the ability to bring more capacity to the marketplace. In the insurance segment, the improving current year attritional results with 100.9% combined ratio are due in part to continued double-digit rate increases in workers’ comp and select casualty classes. Also, growth in our shorter tail books including primary accident and health stop loss business and our property E&S operation have provided for improved results. These businesses, along with the professional liability book and the California DIC business have consistently produced underwriting profits. And when coupled with a rapid decline in our historical program oriented casualty book that resulted in an overall improvement in the attritional results. It should be noted that the drought conditions that adversely impacted crop results are included in the attritional results and 119.1% combined ratio, which had a 3.9 – 3.8 point impact on the overall insurance combined ratio. Excluding crop, the current year attritional combined ratio stood at 97.2%. Ongoing trend for workers comp and general casualty rate increases along with continued growth in accident and health and an expected improvement in crop insurance should reflect positively into 2013. The insurance operation is expected to expand this year on the back of a number of new initiatives. Our non-standard auto business will grow with the establishment of a new strategic relationship to be announced within the next month or so. Canadian platform will expand with the recent hire of a key executive there. And in the U.S., we’ve added an experienced underwriting and marketing team with a specialty focus. These initiatives, coupled with the growth in our existing portfolio due to rate increases, new business and a higher retention of the crop business with the elimination of the quota share arrangement will grow our top line premium. The insurance results were impacted by prior year development, mainly in California workers comp and construction liability. However, it should be emphasized that the contractors program has been in runoff for some time and in the case of workers comp the amounts are relatively benign considering that our profits from this line of business have approximated $1 billion since inception. This is a long-term business that is emerging profitably as rate increases, our earnings grew. Moving onto investments, we’ve continued to dynamically allocate our portfolio in order to maximize returns and minimize risk. Overall, we’ve maintained above average credit quality in the portfolio and have shortened the duration to reduce potential interest rate risk. Our allocations to equities and fixed income investments has resulted in pre-tax investment income and realized capital gains of $764 million in 2012 versus $627 million in 2011, a $137 million increase. Despite significant cat losses from Sandy, we achieved a 12% operating ROE and a 14% net income ROE. This was accomplished while still carrying a capital book, providing us with one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry. We prefer this because it provides a competitive advantage by allowing us the ability to respond aggressively into the market when the unexpected occurs. While some in our industry are accepting single-digit ROEs, because of the interest rate environment, our strategy is to position our underwriting portfolio to achieve improved returns, and mitigate the loss of investment income. As I’ve been discussing, we have been strategically shifting our portfolio towards shorter tail, higher ROE risks, but managing the potential volatility of this strategy by broadening our footprint and managing accumulations. Our benchmark is focused on total shareholder return. We seek to achieve returns that provide a mid-teens compound annual growth and book value per share adjusted for dividends. That has proven successful with a long term return of 13% to our shareholders despite catastrophe losses and other challenges that have confronted the industry. Over the last year, we have established a number of new initiatives including our newest Mt. Logan. I’m quite optimistic that these efforts will enable us to profitably expand our operation over the years to come and continue to provide our shareholders with double digit returns. Along with our talented employees, global footprint and financial strength, we remain one of the strongest franchises in the business. I’ll now turn it over to Craig for further details on the financials.
Craig Howie: Thank you, Dom and good morning everyone. We’re pleased to report that Everest had a very strong year with after-tax operating income of $715.2 million or $13.62 per diluted common share. This represents an operating return on equity of 12.2%. I won’t be comparing these results to last year given the record catastrophes experienced in 2011. Operating income for the fourth quarter was $41.7 million or $0.80 per diluted share. Net income for the fourth quarter was $58.8 million or $1.13 per diluted share. Net income includes realized capital gains. Net income for the year was $829 million or $15.79 per share. These results reflect the continued improvement in the overall current year attritional combined ratio which has decline a full three points from 88.0% to 85.0%. This measure excludes the impact of catastrophes, reinstatement premiums and prior period loss development. The total reinsurance attritional combined ratio was 80.9% compared to 83.5% in the prior year. The insurance segment attritional combined ratio was 100.9% compared to 105.8% in the prior year. However, eliminating the effects of the primary crop book, this ratio would have been 97.2% compared to 105.3% in the prior year. These improvements, both on the reinsurance book and the insurance book should continue as rate increases earn-in over time. Also providing better margins is the shift in our reinsurance portfolio from quota share to excess-of-loss. Gross written premiums of $1.15 billion for the quarter were up 4% compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. This increase was primarily related to the insurance segment. Gross written premiums for the year were $4.3 billion. This represents an increase of 2% after adjusting for reinstatement premiums and the effects of foreign currency movement. Earned premiums of $1.12 billion for the quarter were up 9% compared to the same quarter last year after adjusting for reinstatement premiums. Earned premiums for the year of $4.2 billion were also up 2% on the same basis. The reinsurance segments reported earned premiums of $3.3 billion for the year, up about 1% from 2011. Insurance segment earned premiums of $852 million, were up 4% year-over-year. This increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Heartland and the growth in primary accident and health staff loss business. The fourth quarter underwriting results were impacted by Superstorm Sandy. Total reinsurance reported an underwriting loss of $48 million for the quarter, but an underwriting gain of $327 million for the year. The insurance segment reported a $46 million underwriting loss for the quarter and a $68 million loss for the year. These results reflect a crop loss of $23 million for the year and loss reserve development which I’ll discuss in a moment. The overall underwriting loss for the group was $94 million for the quarter, but an underwriting gain of $259 million for the year. Our reported combined ratio was 108.4% for the quarter and 93.8% for the year. The commission ratio of 22.9% for the year is down 0.3 points compared to the prior year. However, after eliminating the effect of reinstatement premiums, contingent commissions, and several one-time adjustments, the commission ratio would have been 21.2%, compared to 22.7%, in the prior year, on a similar basis. This loss ratio reflects the shift from prorated excess loss contracts, which generally carry a lower commission. The expense ratio of 5% for the year is up 0.6 points compared to last year. This increase primarily relates to the increased accrual for personnel costs and incentive compensation. For the year, we reported $325 million of gross current year catastrophe losses for the quarter. These losses were related to Superstorm Sandy in U.S. this quarter. The pre-tax Sandy losses were $287 million after reinstatement premiums. This estimate has not changed since our preannouncement in December. Our gross cat losses totaled $410 million for the year or 9.8% of earned premiums. On reserves, we’ve completed our annual loss reserve studies. The results of the studies indicated that overall reserves remained adequate. In the fourth quarter, we booked some prior year development in the insurance segment, which was offset by favorable development in the reinsurance segments. The $48 million of prior year reserve development in the insurance segment related to construction liability and workers compensation. The construction liability relates to landscape of programs that the company no longer writes. The $51 million of favorable prior year development in the reinsurance segments mostly related to treaty casualty and treaty property business both in the U.S. and internationally. For investments, pre-tax investment income was $146 million for the quarter and $600 million for the year, on our $16.6 billion investment portfolio. Investment income for the year declined $20 million from one year ago. This decrease was primarily driven by declining reinvestment rates, partially offset by higher limited partnership income for the year. Despite the declining rates, our investment portfolio continues to perform well. It is conservative, well-diversified portfolio with high average credit quality. The pre-tax yield on the overall portfolio was 3.5% with a duration of three years. The quarter reflected $21 million of pre-tax realized capital gains and $17 million of gains after tax. For the year, we had $164 million of pre-tax revised capital gains and $114 million of gains after tax. These gains are mainly attributable to fair value adjustments. On income taxes, the 7.7% effective tax rate on operating income for the year reflects one-time adjustments during 2012 and the impact of the realized capital gains on the effective tax rate calculation. It is expected that the tax rate on operating income will normalize toward an overall effective rate of approximately 13% in 2013. This rate depends on the geographic region where the income is earned, the tax rate in that region and the impact of realized capital gains or losses. Strong cash flow continues, with operating cash flows of $664 million for the year compared to $660 million in 2011. This is despite the high-level catastrophe loss payments over the last two years. We’ve earned almost $1 billion of comprehensive income this year. This primarily reflects $829 million of net income for the year plus unrealized appreciation on securities of $154 million and foreign currency translation adjustments of $23 million. Turning to capital management, in addition to dividend payments to shareholders of $25 million, we repurchased 371,000 shares this quarter at a total cost of $40 million. For the year, we’ve repurchased 3 million shares at a total cost of $290 million. Additionally, we repurchased another $38 million of stock after the year-end close. These purchases will be reflected in the first quarter 2013 financial statements. Company has 4 million shares remaining after these January purchases under a share repurchase authorization from the board of directors. Shareholders’ equity increased to $6.7 billion this year, up 11% from $6.1 billion at year-end 2011. This is after taking into account the $290 million of stock repurchases and the $100 million of dividends paid in 2012. Book value per share increased 16% to $130.96 from $112.99 at year-end 2011. Our strong capital position leads us with capacity to maximize our business opportunities as well as continue share repurchases. Thank you. And now I’ll turn it back to Beth for Q&A.
Beth Farrell: Tim, we’re ready to take questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) And we’ll take our first question from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.
Josh Shanker – Deutsche Bank: Good morning. I realized your holding us a little bit in suspense about a partnership coming up, but can you explain a little bit about how partnerships overall are going to be able to transform the business and how transformational it can be?
Dom Addesso: Yeah, relates, Josh this is Dom, what I was referencing, I can’t get into the details because we have not concluded on the transaction, but essentially it’s going to leave us with the ability to take our non-standard auto book which is currently running at about $30 million of premium and it’s anticipated that that could grow to as much as $80 million in to 2013. This will give us much better scale in that business, which it is a business that needs scale. And as a consequence not only the ability to improve our underwriting account meaning by the loss ratio, but also gives us an expense advantage. So that – without getting into the details of the structure and the who, that’s the intended outcome.
Josh Shanker – Deutsche Bank: Understood. And you may have seen one of your former peers was railing against sidecars as potentially it raises a issue that will ultimately lower the profits for the industry. Where do you think the industry is five years from now and as you participate to some extent in that, what’s the right business mix over the long-term?
Joe Taranto: Well, I’ll start with that Josh. Clearly, we see more alternate capacity coming into the marketplace; some of it is sidecar, some of its pension fund and other ways. And we intend to participate in that market and frankly we intend to make some fees on that market. In the beginning, the fee part of our book is going to be quite small compared to the risk taking part that we’re currently on. But at the end of the day, given our ratings and our offices around the world, our people, the fact that we know clients for many, many years, we see a lot more business especially on the cat side than we can accommodate or want to accommodate given the fact that we want to keep PMLs to a certain degree. So we have a tremendous opportunity to write a lot more business share it with some partners and make fees in the process. Yes, that kind of brings more capacity into the marketplace especially as others do it as well. And it may make more competition, although there’s always competition. And we still think all the money that’s coming in and any of the money that we bring in will only want to come in from profitable business, and so we think it will be a good model. In terms of ultimately what – how much will be fee and how much will be risk taking, that remains to be seen but clearly for now it’s going to be mostly – most of our earning is going to be on the risk-taking side.
Josh Shanker – Deutsche Bank: And then given that you guys have extra capacity along those lines (inaudible) but you certainly could write more business if it became available. Are you giving up profitability in order to make a footprint in the alternative capacity market?
Joe Taranto: No, we’re not looking to take away from anything that we would want to keep for ourselves. That really is the design. Now we’ll try to put ourselves in the same position with our new partners, so they feel as if it’s really a equal trading. But we are not looking to give away $1 worth of business that we would normally write for ourselves.
Josh Shanker – Deutsche Bank: Is there any risk to that? I mean that’s always been my concern that, of course you don’t want to give any way that, there’s a risk of that happening, am I mistaken about that?
Joe Taranto: I don’t see that Josh. We really kind of measure our appetite quite keenly nowadays and would continue to do so. And I think again given the opportunities, we’ll be able to fill our plate with everything that we want. And then have more that we can share with others on a fee basis.
Josh Shanker – Deutsche Bank: Well, thank you. I appreciate the answers.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Amit Kumar with Macquarie.
Amit Kumar – Macquarie: Thanks and good morning. Maybe just going back to the discussion on capital, obviously you have all these new opportunities. How do you think about capital management for 2013? The reason why I’m asking is that relatively it has been lower than some of the other companies. What sort of math do you use? Is it buybacks plus dividends would equal net income or is there something beyond in terms of how you look at 2013 in terms of capital management?
Joe Taranto: Well, I think we start with what are the opportunities that we see and we certainly see plenty of that including some new opportunities on the business side. As Dom noted, we certainly want to be prepared for future opportunities that arise if the world changes and it has a habit of doing that. But at the same time, we look at our stock, where it’s trading, the current portfolio, the people, the future. And we feel very good about buying back a whole lot more stock. Now, we were kind of prevented from doing that in 2012. We took ourselves out of the market for hurricane season. We’re keen to get back into the market in the fourth quarter and then Sandy happened. And we did not want to get back into the market until we put out an estimate on Sandy, which took us late into December. So, we bought some after that and a bit early January. But as I noted, we’re keen as soon as the open window comes to get back into the market and buy some more. So, we are going to foster earnings and ROE in multiple ways, some of it in business, some of it in new business, some of it stock buyback.
Amit Kumar – Macquarie: So, it seems that just based on the ranking, it seems to be of lower relative importance. Just based on how much you’ve grown excess capital in 2012, it seems that you’re saying that let’s look at the opportunities and maybe further down the list, you’re looking at the stocks multiple, because clearly, there’s value which can be created in terms of a buyback right now, but it just seems that it’s somewhat down the list, is that a fair assertion?
Joe Taranto: No, I wouldn’t put it that way. We bought back about 25% of our stock in recent years. We bought back close to $300 million in 2012 and would have bought back a bunch more if it wasn’t for Sandy. So, no, I think it’s still important in the sense that we think it’s a great opportunity for us to buy. And we don’t think it’s going to last forever quite honestly, so we’re keen to do a fair amount now. But there are opportunities out there; both in the existing business and new business, and again what else may come about. So, it’s always a bit of a juggling act, but we’re happy that we’ve both levers to press to increase the ROE for next year. And I would not say that it’s of less importance.
Amit Kumar – Macquarie: I guess, my offset to that point would be why even look at non-standard auto opportunities based on the history, just based on the stock multiple right now?
Joe Taranto: Well, that’s a business we’re already in. We have a small company that operates out of Georgia. We’re looking to be able to add to that and add to the margins by the construction that Dom took you through. And frankly it’s just an add-on and that requires very little capital quite honestly and we believe it will increase profits. We like the proposed business plan, but in the scheme of capital usage, it’s really quite small.
Dom Addesso: And it meets our return objectives in terms of how we think it can perform.
Amit Kumar – Macquarie: And what is the return objective?
Dom Addesso: 12% to 13%, 14% return on capital.
Amit Kumar – Macquarie: Okay. The only other question I have is a lot of the other companies have talked about – they’ve given sort of a flavor in terms of 1/1 renewals, and you sort of have broadly alluded to it. How much do you expect your prop cat book to grow for 2013? I think previously we’ve talked about maybe $1 billion plus number, generally how do you think about that for 2013?
Dom Addesso: Well, as I mentioned in my opening comments, we’ve already at 1/1 increased our property premium by $150 million. So, that was essentially 15% growth if you will.
Amit Kumar – Macquarie: Okay. I’m sorry I was on another call.
Dom Addesso: The annual number – shame on you.
Amit Kumar – Macquarie: I guess related to that, did you discuss your PMLs? Did I miss that too in terms of how do you expect the risk profile to shift with that growth? I think previously the number was 11%ish.
Dom Addesso: Well, you didn’t miss that because we didn’t discuss our PMLs. And they will go up slightly, but as a percentage of capital they’re not expected to move at all.
Amit Kumar – Macquarie: Got it. Okay, that’s...
Dom Addesso: But nominally they will increase of course.
Amit Kumar – Macquarie: Nominal, okay. That’s all I have for now. Thanks so much.
Dom Addesso: Thank you.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.
Mike Nannizzi – Goldman Sachs: Thanks. Just want to understand, Dom, maybe in the insurance book, can you tell us like what percentage of the business is crop, maybe this year and now with all the noise out the way in 2013? And how big is that book as a percentage of the total?
Dom Addesso: Well, for 2012, of the top of my head, I’d say around 20%.
Mike Nannizzi – Goldman Sachs: Okay.
Dom Addesso: And going into next year, we would expect that to increase, because of not only growth objectives and the hiring of some underwriters and marketing teams, and the elimination of the quota share, that’s likely to grow by $100 million, at least.
Mike Nannizzi – Goldman Sachs: Okay.
Craig Howie: Be about 30% to the overall book. Yeah.
Dom Addesso: Right.
Mike Nannizzi – Goldman Sachs: Got it. Okay. And then, do you expect the rest of the – like the non-crop insurance book to grow as well, or do you expect that to kind of – because it sounded like you’ve got a lot of puts and takes, lot of moving parts, some new initiatives, some things kind of going away, I’m guessing the program business is kind of done in terms of the net change?
Dom Addesso: Yeah, the runoff for the program business is not going to have any major impact. But yeah, we will have growth in our excess casualty book, the initiatives that we started, environmental book of business that we have announced. The nonstandard auto was already mentioned. We’ve started up a new specialty unit that will grow – will have a modest amount of new premium maybe $20 million in 2012, but that could rapidly grow from there in the years beyond and as well as, as I mentioned, expansion of the Canadian platform. So, we’ve got a number of oars in the water all over the place in for the insurance space. And as the California DIC will be growing our professional liability book as well, and then of course the double-digit rate increases for workers comp. So, it’s – we’re quite enthusiastic about that space right now.
Mike Nannizzi – Goldman Sachs: And you think, I mean if your double-digit rate on the 80% – 70% or 80% of the book outside the crop, crop gets back to, I don’t know, high 80% or maybe 90%. I mean is low 90s% feasible for 2013 in the insurance business, is that possible?
Dom Addesso: With the good crop year, I suppose that’s possible, sure.
Joe Taranto: Yeah, I would say yes with the good crop year. Comp continues to trend very nicely. We continue to get very sizeable rate increases and that continued into January and Dom touched on all the other areas which we really feel quite good about as well. So the answer is yes.
Mike Nannizzi – Goldman Sachs: Great. And then last question, not to beat on the buyback, I mean I guess I mean in my math, I get about $100 million of buybacks in the beginning of the year next year, book value goes up a buckish. I mean what math when you think about deployment outside of buybacks gets you to that sort of book value growth? I mean if you assume that you’re writing business against $100 million for example like, what is the kind of tradeoff as you see it internally? Thanks.
Joe Taranto: Well, you get into where you can invest it and where you can use it against the business. And we can get into what’s the timing as to when you want to use it, if you don’t buy back on Monday, you can always buy back on Tuesday so it’s not like the opportunity necessarily goes away. But I’ll say that the levels that we’ve been trading at really are pushing us to do more sooner as opposed to later. But frankly we don’t believe it’ll stay at these levels. But having bought back 25% is a good chunk to begin with. And again the fact that we bought back $300 million, we’re looking to buyback more and kind of telling as soon as we can we’re going to jump into the market, tells you that that’s certainly part of what we plan to do as well.
Mike Nannizzi – Goldman Sachs: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Vinay Misquith with Evercore Partners.
Vinay Misquith – Evercore Partners: Hi. First just a numbers question within the U.S. primary insurance operation, the commission expense ratio was really low this quarter. I was just wondering if there was some one-time items in there?
Craig Howie: Primarily related to crops, in other words contingent commissions that would have had to be paid out given that a poor crop year took place were taken down in the quarter.
Vinay Misquith – Evercore Partners: Sure, so we should just move it backup to the normal about 17.5% for the future, correct? Okay.
Craig Howie: That’s correct.
Vinay Misquith – Evercore Partners: Okay, that’s helpful. Secondly, on the margins, as you look at the various opportunities, do you expect your accident – your combined ratio to improve further from these levels? I mean they’re certainly very good right now.
Dom Addesso: Yes we do.
Vinay Misquith – Evercore Partners: Okay. And that’s driven by business mix change or is that pure pricing?
Dom Addesso: Well, some of the pricing that I referenced particularly in the insurance space and in cat, general casualty rate increases as it affects our treaty books. And then of course continued push towards write more excess-of-loss business spread our cat aggregate laterally if you will. And that will have – should have a furthering impact – positive impact on the attritional loss ratio.
Vinay Misquith – Evercore Partners: Okay. That’s helpful. And the one final thing if I may, just looking in terms of cats, could you say that this year is – last year, sorry, was a normal year in terms of cats or do you think it was higher than normal year in term of cats and ag losses?
Dom Addesso: That number was approximately what we project as what we call our average annual loss. And that does...
Vinay Misquith – Evercore Partners: Right.
Dom Addesso: I don’t know that there is an average angle. But over the long-term that would be considered a theoretical average year.
Vinay Misquith – Evercore Partners: Okay, that’s fair. Thank you very much.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Brian Meredith with UBS.
Brian Meredith – UBS: Yeah, good morning everybody. Couple of questions here, first the property growth that you’re seeing, where is that coming from? Is it cat business, is it international, U.S.?
Dom Addesso: The cat business, it’s....
Brian Meredith – UBS: Is it property cat, when you refer to property $150 million?
Dom Addesso: Yes, property – U.S. and Europe, that’s predominantly.
Brian Meredith – UBS: Okay. Great. And then I’m just curious what your thoughts are on the opportunities in Florida as we approach the midyear renewals with the depopulation at Citizens?
Joe Taranto: Well, we think this will be some very good opportunities there. Certainly, the market at the insurance level continues to get healthier with rate increases, so it will be a bigger pie. There’s still an awful lot of companies down there that are very much in need of reinsurance. You saw what Citizens did last year. So I think it’s a big pie, it’s an explosive pie and the people are somewhat cautious as to how they fill up. It tends to be everyone’s number one zone in terms of PML. It is for us. So I think it’ll continue to be some very good opportunities down there for companies like ourselves in June.
Brian Meredith – UBS: Joe, is that a place that you’re more likely to use a sidecar you think at this point?
Joe Taranto: Yeah, it’s not a sidecar that we’re putting together and that’s in the sense that sidecars tend to be operations that are put together for one and two years and then they’re kind of designed to go away. We’re putting something together that would be in place permanently. But Florida is exactly the kind of opportunity where we’re going to have a PML that we don’t want to exceed and we’re going to have a ton of business beyond that that we could write if we wanted to.
Brian Meredith – UBS: Great. And then last quick questions here. Is Heartland much of a player in the winter wheat area? I know they’ve been having some issues with wheat crop this year?
Joe Taranto: It’s in that space. It’s probably about 10% of the book. Soybean and corn is bigger, but it’s in that space and so yes, that is started. And it’s early days, but looks fine so far.
Brian Meredith – UBS: Great. Thank you very much.
Dom Addesso: Thank you, Brian.
Operator: And we’ll take our final question from Greg Locraft with Morgan Stanley.
Greg Locraft – Morgan Stanley: Hi, thanks. Just wanted to open up the reserve side of the equation. It’s been in the past, a concern of some in the investment community. It seems like you exit 2012, it’s a third year of very, very low reserve moving either way. How are you feeling on this line? Our work suggests you have considerable excess here. Many in the industry have been releasing, I guess on the good side that isn’t a headwind going forward because you don’t need to pull from reserves to hit your target ROEs. On the other hand, you haven’t been releasing, it seems like you’ve been holding back. So, how do you feel on reserves as you enter 2013 and beyond?
Craig Howie: Greg, this is Craig. I don’t know. We’ve completed our annual loss reserve studies and we’re comfortable with our overall position that we remain adequate. You know we posted our global cost development triangles for the past couple of years, and they also appear adequate. I’m comfortable with this position and I’m also comfortable with respect to the practices and the procedures that we’ve put into place to come up with such a good reserve position. I think this company produces good results without those releases in place. I think one of the things that I like also is the fact that we’re – we take our time to react to favorable development. Some of these redundancies that you’ve seen have developed over time, but we don’t want to react until that position becomes more mature. So, we continue to hold the more recent years and we expect to do the same going forward as well.
Greg Locraft – Morgan Stanley: Okay. So, actually the peers that are releasing, it’s not that you’re any different; it’s just that you’re holding back. Philosophically you’re holding back more than they are?
Dom Addesso: We can’t speak, we can’t speak to.
Joe Taranto: We’re not going to get into what others do. We don’t know what they do, and we’re not here to comment on that.
Greg Locraft – Morgan Stanley: Okay. And then just last one this is – has the reserving practices of the corporation changed at all in the last few years? And again, it was never a big issue; it just seemed to break against shareholders more frequently several years ago, than it has happened in the last several years. So, I’m just wondering if there’s a shift at all?
Craig Howie: Well, Greg, that’s a good question. I think the reserve practices did change a few years back to create this position that we’re in today. I think the practices that we’ve put into place by meeting on a quarterly basis, and setting up these estimates on a quarterly basis, it’s difficult to estimate what these numbers should be to begin with. But the practice that we put into place is pretty conservative. We look at prior year losses, look at the prior loss review, and then we compare and put loss trend on top of that. And then we also take note of any rate increases or decreases in the marketplace at the same time. But what that does is gives us appropriate data to look and set of our reserve position at given point in time. But that same process has been taking place for the last three years.
Dom Addesso: It’s a kind way of saying, Greg that is my fault.
Joe Taranto: Let me chime in. I was about to say we had a great CFO by the name of Dom Addesso who started this process, did an excellent job in making out process more robust.
Greg Locraft – Morgan Stanley: Okay. Great. And I do just want to clarify. Your forward view on ROE and everything that includes no reserve moving either way, right?
Joe Taranto: Yes, I think that’s correct. We do not put that into any thoughts that we give you with regard to the targets we’re shooting for.
Greg Locraft – Morgan Stanley: Okay. Awesome. Okay, good. Thanks and solid year. I appreciate it.
Dom Addesso: Thank you.
Operator: And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I’ll turn it over to our presenters for any closing remarks.
Beth Farrell: I’d like to thank everybody for participating on the call and talk again next quarter. Thank you.
Operator: That concludes today’s conference call. We appreciate your participation.

===== 2012 Q3  (2012-10-25 10:30:00) =====
Executives: Beth Farrell - Vice President, Investor Relations Joe Taranto - Chairman and CEO Dom Addesso - President Craig Howie - Chief Financial Officer

Operator: Please standby. Good day, everyone. And welcome to the Everest Re Group Limited Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Release Call. As a reminder, today’s presentation is being recorded. And now for opening remarks and introductions, I’d like to turn the conference over to Ms. Beth Farrell. Please go ahead, ma’am.
Beth Farrell: Thank you, Catherine. Good morning. And welcome to Everest Re Group’s third quarter 2012 earnings conference call. On the call with me today are Joe Taranto, the company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Dom Addesso, our President; and Craig Howie, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I note that statements made during today’s call, which are forward-looking in nature, such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations and the like are subject to various risks. As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations. Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements. Now let me turn the call over to Joe.
Joe Taranto: Thanks, Beth. Good morning. As we enter 2012, I indicated that I was optimistic about generating quality earnings for the year. So far through nine months, it's clear that optimism was warranted. Through nine months we have generated $1 billion of comprehensive income for our shareholders, resulting in growth and book value per share, adjusted for dividends of 17.4%. The reasons I was positive continue and accordingly, I remain upbeat about our future. Let me go through that reasoning. First, the global reinsurance market in reaction to $100 billion plus of 2011 catastrophic losses, increased rates and tightened terms and conditions, our strategy was to benefit from these changes by increasing our potential profit margins without meaningfully increasing our PML’s in our peak zones. Our team did a superb job of executing the strategy. Now we have seen alternative capital sources entering the market, also looking to benefit from these improved terms. This additional capacity has stabilized the market at a reasonable level, so I continued to expect quality opportunities for 2013. Second, we have a very clear underwriting philosophy that is solely focused on profit, not volume. It is also focused on portfolio management, looking for the best deals on which to deploy our capital. Third, we continue to pursue opportunities where we possess the specialization to achieve superior results. For our insurance operation, this includes, crop insurance, medical stop-loss business, financial institution D&O and California workers comp. Of course, the drought in the U.S. has produced losses for our crop book. We expect in any given year we will have losses on some portion of our book. But just as 2011 catastrophe losses, increased rates and demands for catastrophe reinsurance, going forward, we expect we will see increased demand for crop insurance, and the government will include the 2012 results as part of future rate making. Fourth, our $16.5 billion of invested assets continue to perform well given the current market conditions. Fifth, our strong earnings will allow us to buyback more stock, which we expect will increase shareholder return. Through nine months, we have bought back $250 million worth of stock or 5% of the outstanding shares as of 12/31/11. We have also paid $76 million in dividends through nine months. In the third quarter, we bought back only $25 million worth of stock, given it was hurricane season, plus we have Hurricane Isaac and the drought conditions. Nonetheless, we increased our surplus by $368 million in the quarter and by $714 million for the year. What we didn't spend yesterday on stock repurchase is in surplus available for tomorrow's purchases. Sixth, our management team is the strongest it has ever been. I would stack it up against any company in our space in the world. Working with Dom, John Doucette, Craig Howie and our other senior managers has been great. We’ve never been more focused and energized. Now, I will turn it over to Dom for the report on operations and then Craig will give you the financial reports.
Dom Addesso: Thank you, Joe, and good morning. As Joe mentioned, the results for the year have been quite positive and the third quarter has added to what was experienced in the first half. In addition, the operating earnings have improved quarter-over-quarter, which reflects the underwriting gain of $129 million this current quarter versus a $46 million gain in the prior year. Underlying this is a pattern of continued quarterly improvement in the underwriting result. The year-over-year comparisons are complicated by the cat losses in 2011, but what is worth noting is the positive trend this year quarter-by-quarter in the attritional combined ratio, that stands at 84.9% in the most recent quarter. This improved operating performance is due to the results in the reinsurance segments where the attritional combined ratio dropped to 77.9% and to a reported combined ratio of 80.1% including catastrophe losses. After the cat losses of $25 million there was $157 million underwriting gain for the quarter. On the year-to-date basis the reinsurance underwriting gain was over $375 million, which includes $85 million of cat losses. All this points to a portfolio that more recently has been repositioned to more of an excessive loss mix, which has the ability to generate healthy margins. Our year-to-date cat premium is approximately $1 billion, three quarters of which is written on an excessive loss basis. As a result, the property lines in all regions continue to drive the improved results despite some slowing of the rate increases. Nevertheless, it was positive rate change during the third quarter. In particular, Australia saw improvements of 10% to 15% in rates during the quarter. Casualty lines on the other hand, while seeing some improvement in rates are still not hard enough or moving fast enough to make any meaningful improvement in results. We continue to remain cautious on casualty reinsurance and while the shift from pro rata to excess in the property lines is improving the bottom line. It has resulted in less premium growth than would otherwise be the case. Turning to the insurance operations for the quarter, the results were mostly affected by the drought-related crop losses. The impact of these losses on the quarter was $20 million. The remaining portions of the book performed in line with expectations. In fact, excluding crop business, the attritional combined ratio for the year was at 99.2%. The primary A&H, which is medical stop-loss business, is growing nicely and profitably. The casualty business, which is focused on specialty classes, is experiencing double-digit rate increases. And California workers’ comp also continues at double-digit rate increases. While the insurance marketplace is currently a challenging environment, the core businesses we are now focused on are trending nicely. We certainly expect the improvements to continue into the fourth quarter with ongoing rate increases, growth in our A&H business and an expected normal crop season for the winter harvest. Overall, we continue to focus on ways to improve the underwriting margins, as investment income gains are difficult to achieve in this low yield environment. Despite this, we have done extremely well over the last three years in maintaining investment income. We are pleased with the performance of our invested assets both for the quarter and year-to-date. And while the investment-- while investment grade bonds constitute the bulk of our assets, at 79% of the total, our asset allocation has become increasingly diversified. This has allowed us to reduce the duration exposure of our assets, maintain an average credit quality for our fixed income securities of AA-minus and add investment income and total return beyond that of our investment grade bonds. Our allocations to alternative fixed income securities and publicly traded equities have been accretive to investment income. As those assets carry an average market yield that is nearly 250 basis points more than our investment grade bonds. The total return of invested assets has also been helped with the non-investment bond assets returning 200 basis points more for the quarter and nearly 600 basis points more year-to-date than investment grade bonds. So while our investment bond portfolio continues to provide principal protection and predictable investment income, our alternatives have added to income and total return, while providing more diversity in our invested assets. While the investment in insurance markets may continue to be a challenge, we will benefit from our financial strength and the unique ability of our staff to seek out creative opportunities. I mentioned on the last call that we had made some organizational changes, and the benefits are already being felt in the number and type of opportunities we see. Our security and experience has never been more highly valued. The combined ratio of 87.2% for the quarter is just one of those positive signs. Thank you. And I will now turn it over to Craig.
Craig Howie: Thank you, Dom, and good morning, everyone. We’re pleased to report that Everest had another very strong quarter with after-tax operating income of $210.6 million, or $4.05 per diluted common share. I won’t be comparing these results to last year, given the record catastrophes experienced in 2011. Net income for the third quarter was $250.9 million or $4.82 per diluted share. Net income includes realized capital gains. On a year-to-date basis, operating income was $673.5 million or $12.78 per share. This represents an annualized operating return on equity of 15.3%. Net income year-to-date was $770.2 million or $14.61 per share. These year-to-date results reflect a continued improvement in the overall current year attritional combined ratio, which has declined from 86.3% to 86.0%. This measure excludes the impact of catastrophes reinstatement premiums and prior period loss development. The total reinsurance attritional combined ratio was 81.8% compared to 82.2% in the prior year. The insurance segment attritional combined ratio was 102.8% compared to 101.8% in the prior year. However, eliminating the effects of the primary crop book, this ratio would have been 99.2% compared to 101.3% in the prior year. These improvements, both on the reinsurance book and the insurance book, should continue as rate increases earn in over time. Also providing better margins is the shift in our reinsurance portfolio from quota share to excess of loss. Gross written premiums of $1.20 billion for the quarter were up 7% compared to third quarter of 2011. This increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Heartland. More on the crop business in a moment. On a year-to-date business, gross written premiums were $3.16 billion. This represents an increase of 2% after adjusting for reinstatement premium and the effects of foreign currency movements. Earned premiums of $1.01 billion for the quarter did not change significantly compared to the same quarter last year, after adjusting for reinstatement premiums and foreign exchange. Although we've achieved strong rate increases on portions of our book, especially on catastrophe exposed risks. Year-to-date earned premiums of $3.05 billion also have not changed significantly year-over-year. However, the shift in capacity, away from proportional risks does mask that effect, as excess of loss business carries lower premium. These increases have provided significant margin improvement on a comparative premium base. The reinsurance segments reported a year-to-date earned premiums of $2.4 billion, down less than 1% from 2011. The insurance segment reported $219 million of earned premiums for the quarter, which was up 1% over third quarter of 2011. On a year-to-date basis, insurance earned premiums are $611 million or down 5% year-over-year. This is primarily due to the runoff of certain program business and lower crop earned premium in the current year. Last year, the crop premium was earned evenly throughout the year as reinsurance premium. The insurance segment reflects $45 million of seasonal earned premiums from crop business in the third quarter, with $84 million now earned year-to-date. We expect full calendar year net premium from this book to total about $150 million. We booked the primary crop business at 145% combined ratio for the quarter and 120% on a year-to-date basis. This represented a $20 million pretax underwriting loss for the quarter but there is still some uncertainty as crop yields and commodity prices are not yet finalized for the year. However, the company does purchase stop-loss reinsurance coverage for its primary crop portfolio. The MPCI coverage attaches at a 110% loss ratio. Currently, the book loss ratio remains below 100% on a year-to-date basis. We would need to see additional pretax losses of more than $16 million for the 2012 crop year before we would attach this cover. The insurance segment reported a $28.2 million underwriting loss for the quarter and a $22.8 million loss year-to-date. This reflects the crop loss I just discussed. All reinsurance segments reported underwriting gains for both the quarter and on a year-to-date basis. Total reinsurance reported an underwriting gain of $157.1 million for the quarter and $375.8 million year-to-date. The overall underwriting gain for the Group was $129 million for the quarter and $352.9 million for the year so far. Our reported combined ratio was 87.2% for the quarter and 88.4% year-to-date. The commission ratio for the year is up 1.1 points compared to the prior year. This increase relates to a number of one-time adjustments and settlements and the change in accounting for deferred acquisition costs. The 21.9% commission ratio for the quarter is within our normal range. The expense ratio for the year is up 0.5 points compared to last year. This increase primarily relates to the increased accrual for personnel costs and incentive compensation. For the quarter, we reported $25 million of current year catastrophe losses. These losses are primarily related to hurricane Isaac in the U.S. this quarter. This brings our year-to-date gross cat losses to $85 million for 2012 or 2.8% of earned premiums. Regarding 2011 catastrophe losses we allocated another $15 million of the $50 million cap IBNR established at the end of last year to cover higher estimates on several 2011 events. We still have $15 million of this catastrophe IBNR remaining. On reserves, our overall quarterly internal reserving metrics continue to be favorable. We are in the process of completing our annual loss reserve studies. The outcome related to these studies, if any will be booked in the fourth quarter. For investments, pre-tax investment income was $152 million for the quarter and $453.8 million year-to-date on our $16.5 billion investment portfolio. Year-to-date investment income declined $40 million from one year ago. This decrease was primarily driven by lower limited partnership income, which was down $19 million this year and by declining reinvestment rates. Despite the declining rates, our investment portfolio continues to perform well. It is a conservative, well diversified portfolio with high average credit quality. The quarter reflected $62.7 million of pre-tax realized capital gains and $40.4 million of gains after tax. On a year-to-date basis, we had $144.9 million of pre-tax realized capital gains and $96.7 million of gains after tax. These gains are mainly attributable to fair value adjustments. On income taxes, the 17.9% effective tax rate on operating income for the quarter reflects higher than expected income. And the impact of the realized capital gains this quarter on the annualized effective tax rate calculation. The 11.0% year-to-date effective tax rate on operating income is within our revised expected range for the year. Turning to other miscellaneous items, the $703,000 derivative gain for the quarter relates to the rise in the equity markets offset by the change in interest rates during the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, we reported a derivative loss of $9.4 million compared to a loss of $19.3 million in the prior year. Other income largely reflects foreign exchange losses for both this quarter and the quarter one year ago. On a year-to-date basis, we reported foreign exchange gains compared to foreign exchange losses a year ago. Operating cash flows were $175 million for the quarter, compared to $208 million in the third quarter of 2011. Higher underwriting cash flows were offset by lower investment income receipts and higher tax payments in the current quarter. We earned $407 million of comprehensive income this quarter. This primarily reflects $251 million of net income for the quarter, plus unrealized appreciation on securities of $118 million and foreign currency translation adjustments of $36 million. We now have $997 million of comprehensive income year-to-date. Turning now to capital management, in addition to dividend payments to shareholders of $25 million, we repurchased 229,000 shares this quarter during wind season, at a total cost of $25 million. For the year, we've repurchased 2.6 million shares at a total cost of $250 million. The company has 4.7 million shares remaining under our share repurchase authorization from the Board of Directors. Shareholders equity increased to $6.8 billion this quarter, up 12% from $6.1 billion at year end 2011. This is after taking into account, the $259 million of stock repurchases and the $76 million of dividends paid so far this year. Book value per share increased 16% to $131.22 from $112.99 at year-end 2011. Our strong capital position leaves us with capacity to maximize our business opportunities as well as continue share repurchases. Thank you. And now I'll turn it back to Beth for Q&A.
Beth Farrell: Catherine, we are now open for questions.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And we'll hear first from Gregory Locraft with Morgan Stanley.
Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley: Thanks. Good morning and congrats on another great quarter. Wanted to just pursue the capital deployment side of things, can you comment on buybacks in the fourth quarter to date or have you been blacked out so far?
Joe Taranto: No, we haven't bought anything so far in the fourth quarter, Greg.
Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley: Okay. And what is your -- I guess you've said you're interested in doing it. It looks to me like between dividends and the repurchases to date, that's about $325 million or so. Yet, your after-tax op income for the year could approach $800 million if you do sort of consensus numbers in the fourth quarter. So that's even just not building a lot of excess, you need to do an awful lot of buyback this quarter. How do you think about sort of your appetite to buyback, and how should we be modeling that in this quarter?
Joe Taranto: Well, your numbers are correct, Greg. And likewise, we see this as a very good year so far and with a good fourth quarter and it will be an excellent year. And you're right, that will give us great capacity to buyback more in the future and certainly in the fourth quarter. Third quarter is basically hurricane season that should be over in a couple of weeks. And I guess, I'm just going to the same place that I believe you're going that there should be ample available earnings and surplus that frankly we can buyback a fair amount in the fourth quarter and beyond.
Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley: Okay. I guess it just, it keeps building up. Is there any other way to deploy it organically and maybe perhaps, the question would be around the January 1 renewals, what are seeing? What do you anticipate on the underwriting side in terms of organic growth going forward?
Joe Taranto: Well, let me first say the fact that it keeps building up in a big way is a good thing. That means that we are having very good earnings and our capital is increasing and we're very, very happy about that. 
Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley: Absolutely.
Joe Taranto: And that's the main thing. And of course, that does mean that we have more available to buyback. As far as the future and January 1, we're not looking at it as if the market is going to change all that much from where it is now. It will continue to be ample opportunity on the property side and the cash side. We certainly are looking into some other areas. Our management team, as we noted is very energized and we do expect to find some opportunities beyond the cat side. Casualty, Dom talked a bit about that where we're still in more of a wait and see approach than putting a lot more capacity into growing that end of the book. But many others are getting much more optimistic about it. We hope they're right. We hope rates continue to go up and frankly that we ultimately will be able to grow our casualty business in a very, very meaningful way. So, I look at 2013 as if it will be a good year. There'll be a chance for us to deploy, certainly the capital that we have, maybe some additional opportunities. But I don't look at as if the world is going to change so much that we won't, especially in today's prices continue to be very keen on buying back the stock as well.
Dom Addesso: And I think that's, it’s about balance. And we look at our capital management as a long-term issue. We certainly will be looking at the opportunities in the fourth quarter. But also as you point out, Greg, we'll soon be approaching 1/1 and actually some of our underwriters are already into that. So we'll begin to access what 1/1 opportunities will be like in the next several weeks. And we do think there are opportunities to expand our presence, whether it would be in the U.S. or I mentioned some changes we've made in our management that will allow us to do some new and different things in Asia and Europe. And so there are some unique opportunities that we can pursue, but it will be a little bit of both.
Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley: Okay. Great. Thanks and congrats again.
Joe Taranto: Thank you.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) We’ll go to Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.
Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank: I want to ask some questions about the investment side of the story. There's been some movements as you mentioned that you don't think you're taking more basis risk. But it does suggest that from a rating agencies standpoint, there's a little bit more credit risk going on. And in terms of the balance of taking money out of equities, what is your market view for investment over the next 12 months, interest rates wise, marketwise what not?
Joe Taranto: No. I don't know, but we're all about trying to predict investment rates. We tried, as they try to portray and/or mentioned in my comments, we want to maintain some balance. We think what we've achieved in our portfolio to-date with an average credit quality of AA, represents a good credit quality. Even in the spaces in the alternative fixed income space, our average credit quality there is just one notch below investment grade. So it's overall still a high quality portfolio from a credit perspective. And as I've mentioned in previous calls, I tend to believe that corporate credits just as an overall market condition are generally underrated if you will. Corporates are well positioned with cash and in fact, one might postulate that they might be better credits than some of the sovereign exposures. So it's not a risky bet. We're generally -- right now we are, as I said earlier, we've got investment and 75% of our portfolio is investment grade. We've got 13% of our portfolio in equities, including our limited partnerships. That's certainly within reason in terms of how the industry has invested over the long-term. And our alternative fixed income portfolio is just slightly in excess of $2 billion, comprised of a mix of high yield, bank loans and emerging market debt. So it will maintain that relative position or at least our current thinking is that that's a reasonable allocation and how to think about our position going forward. That doesn't mean that next quarter, we won't modify that slightly. But I'm not anticipating any major shifts at this point. And from a rating agency perspective and that also gets into the capital management discussion. We maintain a sufficient level of capital to carry this kind of an asset allocation. So it is all part of the entire balance sheet management.
Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank: So, Dom, I'm not really trying to uncover. I was trying to understand, if we went back in time three months ago, you might have said the same thing about corporate versus sovereign. Is there anything different that happened in the past quarter, or merely you just had more cash deployed that cause the weight to move?
Dom Addesso: The weight actually hasn't moved all that much, Josh. It really hasn't. The only thing that we've seen is obviously, the movement in interest rates. Obviously adjusted the back of market value of those securities, so that maybe what you’re referencing, I'm not sure. But that's really the only market movement that I can comment on. We actually have seen obviously a high yield, for example, certainly a compression in rates there. And we actually think that any additional allocation in the high yield space is less likely than not just given the fact that where rates have come in the high yield sector.
Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank: Thank you.
Joe Taranto: The acquisition is something that's evolved over the last two or three years, no sudden changes in the last quarter.
Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank: All right. And then on the derivative mark, on the equities, I'm surprised it was marked down this quarter. It’s obvious because of very difficult calculations. Can you walk us through a little bit, this is a good quarter for equities, when did the market gone up or the interest rates overrode that, what exactly happened there?
Dom Addesso: It is a complicated formula that we have to follow to come up with the result. And yeah, you saw the stock market rise this quarter. So that you would suggest that it would have increased more than it did. But a big part of the calculation is interest rates which went down a bit. Now, interest rates in terms of settlements of these instruments ultimately don't come into play whatsoever. So as far as we're concerned, the stock market going up is far more important. But nonetheless, there is a set formula that we’ve been following for years, continue to follow and that's why you saw little change even though the stock market went up, because one offset the other.
Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank: Okay. Thank you very much for the time.
Operator: Thank you. And we’ll continue on to Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs: Thank you very much. Sorry about that. Just one question I guess. There was some movement. Second quarter looks like U.S. Reinsurance grew this quarter, but shrunk last quarter on a year-over-year basis, International, Reinsurance was down last quarter -- down this quarter, but grew last quarter. Just trying to understand kind of, is there some strategy involved or some tactical reason for that, or is it just have to do with renewals and just kind of the movement of your book and then just one follow-up. Thanks
Dom Addesso: Yeah. Michael, this is Dom. 
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs: Hi, Dom.
Dom Addesso: There is a mixture of things going on. Let’s take the International, which is comprised of Middle East, South Africa, Latin America and our Asian portfolio. Most of what we’ve seen going on there is the shift from pro-rata to excess of loss. So that's what driving the results there. And in the U.S. we see -- we have some adjustments in our subject premium base on certain clients, which give rise to increased estimates as well as some increased shares on certain clients. For the quarter, it's a little bit of an anomaly and that should smooth out into the fourth quarter. And then in Bermuda, it's a reflection of some weakening and some casualty opportunities and so lessening of our cash portfolio in that space.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs: Okay. Okay. Thanks. And then -- so I guess, I mean and maybe building on Greg's question a little bit from before. So you’ve got little bit -- it sounds like a little bit more cat exposure this year than last, more excess of loss, a bit of a move in the investment portfolio. Just trying to understand, what is the capital intensiveness of your book today versus a year ago? Is that -- have the changes subtle and maybe not and maybe less subtle? Have they had an impact on the capital that you need to hold in the business that maybe, we just can't see so well from our perspective?
Joe Taranto: The answer is no. You mentioned our cat book. Really in terms of the peak zones, it really has been no meaningful increases. We may have expanded in some of the non-peak zones. But when you get back to the capital that we need, especially since we’re looking at more rate and tighter terms, I wouldn't tell you that we need anymore today than we needed a year or two ago, which kind of gets you back to the fact that especially with surplus building quite nicely, we have a substantial amount of excess capital. Now, whether we can deploy that going forward into other opportunities, well we'll see what 1/1 brings. We do have some ideas for 2013 and beyond. Right now, I would probably say that those ideas don't take up all the extra that we have and that's why it gets back to stock buyback, particularly at today's prices as a very, very attractive alternative. So we'll do both. But it's not what that we need a great deal of extra capital today. I would say virtually none relative to a year or two ago. The investment side, yeah, there are some things that we've done that we think will produce and have produced better returned. But frankly, I look at it, at least from a company management point of view is that, not putting all your rates into -- in corporate bonds and taking 20%, and putting it into other items is frankly making it less risky as you diversify your portfolio. Could be some additional charges in the rating agency models, but nothing significant and again, we get back to the fact that we have plenty of extra surplus at this point.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs: Okay. And I guess building on that, I mean, with yields where they are I mean another option certainly is to take advantage of that on the debt side your leverage is lower. Is that a lever that at some point if your capital builds this way, or even if not, is that a lever that you're interested in pulling or is there a reason why you want to maintain just a bit lower financial leverage?
Joe Taranto: I'll take that one and as it was mentioned in the past relative to that question, it’s -- we view this as really an arbitrage issue and it's a negative arbitrage. We’ve raised additional debt, where would we invest it. It would be dilutive to earnings. We're already dealing with an excess capital position, so adding debt doesn't help that. It doesn't mean that we like having that we wouldn't in the future and that's always for discussion. But we like the flexibility of where we're at. And we don't have any immediate plans on that front.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs: Okay. And then just last one quick one. I didn't understand Heartland the acquisition was accomplished, completed a while ago. The lift in gross premiums this quarter, I was just trying to understand just kind of the reason for that, did it have something to do with reinsurance or some other legacy relationship associated with that acquisition? And thank you for all your answers.
Craig Howie: Mike, this is Craig. Basically what happened with the Heartland premium was you may recall in 2011 that premium was treated as reinsurance premium and that was earned in evenly throughout the year. So, in 2012, when it moved over to the insurance segment, it's now the gross written premium, is now premium before sessions to the government or third party reinsurers and now that premiums earned in on a seasonal basis. So, that's really the difference in the gross premium.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs: I see.
Craig Howie: If you look at the net premium for that business, it's relatively flat year-over-year.
Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs: That makes perfect sense. Great. Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Vinay Misquith with Evercore Partners.
Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners: Hi. Congratulations on a very strong quarter. The first question is on the margins this quarter, they were very strong. The accident year loss ratio ex-cats some was about 54.1 of the exclude the crop. Did this quarter benefit from abnormally low sort of non-cat weather?
Joe Taranto: Absolutely Vinay. I mean its and the shift again from a movement from pro rata to excess of loss contracts is what's driving that.
Dom Addesso: Vinay, I take your question to be if you take catastrophe is out, whether everything was so good beyond that, that there was just a benefit to property beyond losses…
Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners: Yes. Yes.
Dom Addesso: The small losses were unusual. I don't think that's the case, no.
Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners: Okay. So, these quarters, I mean a true pro forma number that you had for the quarter.
Joe Taranto: Yes. That's the way we look at it, yes.
Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners: Okay. That's interesting. And in terms of cats, what sort of cat loads should we be looking at normally for this business?
Joe Taranto: We generally have given guidance that our cat losses at least for this -- for the past year or two have been around 9 points.
Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners: Right. Great. And do you think that to move the excess of loss would mean that it would be slightly higher now than the past?
Joe Taranto: Not, not. No. Not that in and itself would not drive that number.
Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners: Okay. All right. And the last question is on margins actually for next year. You had rate increases for workers compensation come through, the transition to excess of loss, which has helped to your margins. So, as you go into next year and there'll probably be some pricing pressure on prop cat excess of loss. How do you see margins next year versus this year?
Joe Taranto: I'll start. I mean on the cat side, I kind of said, I -- there is some leveling that's taking place and I do think you'll see that into 2013. I don't know if there is so much pressure that you will see rates come down in any sort of meaningful way. I am not anticipating that. Again, I think when you get back to our position with A plus paper and the security and the clients that we have around the world, I kind to look at our portfolio at least in terms of rate quality on the cat side it will be about the same as it has today. We are hoping on the casualty side and for other pockets that there is continued improvement. You mentioned California comp, where we continue to get rate increases. But our GL business we continue to get rate increases. Some pockets of the casualty we're not getting as much as we would like. But we are hopeful that again some pockets of the casualty continue to do well into 2013. So again, just forecasting a year out, I'm not thinking that margins will be a whole lot different than they are today when you put it all together.
Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And we’ll take our next question from Jay Gelb with Barclays.
Jay Gelb - Barclays: Thank you. I wanted to touch base on prior year reserve development. It's been notably absent for the past three years and I'd like to better understand, how your reserving process is somewhat different from what we’re seeing from other companies in the rest of the industry that have been releasing a lot of reserves?
Dom Addesso: Jay, its Dom. I really can't speak to how other companies reserve. But obviously, the mission and the objective is to have an adequate reserve position, not to be deficient or redundant. Of course, the reserve estimation process is difficult as you know. And I do think we've done a great job historically. I mean the reserve charges that Everest had prior to three years ago were really one-time unusual events and I think it points to the fact that our core reserves development has been frankly, favorable over time. And so I don't know if it's much different than many other folks. We attempt to reserve conservatively and what goes into that is an attempt to pick the current year ex your loss pick is so very important to that. As I've de scribed many times on calls, we have a multi-pronged process for going through that, which involves the prior year loss reserve review and baking on top of that loss trend. And as well as taking note of any rate increases or decreases that are going on in the marketplace. And we think that has given us the opportunity to have an appropriate and adequate loss reserve position. And I think that's demonstrated itself as you point out over the last couple of years and frankly even prior to that, but certainly for sure over the last three years.
Jay Gelb - Barclays: And then on a separate topic, the U.S. insurance underlying combined ratio excluding cats and prior development ticked up again in 3Q now running in about 101 and that excludes the impact of crop as well. What would it take to get that back well into profitable underwriting territory?
Dom Addesso: Well, as I pointed out it was running at a 99.2 for the quarter ex those items. And so it's trending in that direction. And so as I pointed out in my comments earlier increased growth in our NH portfolio, continued double-digit increases in work comp, you are seeing rate increases on casualty and continued deployment of our professional lines which is also tracking nicely. So, all of our core portfolios are moving in the right direction and that so it is trending towards that currently.
Joe Taranto: And of course crop has become a big part of that book. So clearly, we're hopeful for a very good year in 2013 as opposed to what we've had this year.
Jay Gelb - Barclays: Right. And on a normalized basis, the net to gross premium percentage in U.S. insurance, it looks like it was mainly influenced by the crop result in 3Q. What's the normalized result going forward since it's been kind in that 80 to 85 range in the first half?
Craig Howie: That's about right. But you have to realize that historically that number has moved around a bit in the insurance operation, because of some of our program business that was a much bigger influence in the portfolio a couple years ago. So, if you're looking at it historically, you've to recognize some of those differences in the portfolio.
Jay Gelb - Barclays: Right. Fourth quarter a year ago, net to gross of 77%, is that a seasonal issue or is that should we expect it to be more in the 80s going forward?
Craig Howie: I don't know, but I can answer that precisely for you right now, Jay. It’s call 80.
Jay Gelb - Barclays: That's helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Matt Heimermann with J.P. Morgan.
Matt Heimermann - J.P. Morgan: Hi. Good morning, everybody. The first question I have is just with the remixing of the portfolio from (inaudible). Can you give us a sense of where you think we are in that process both respect to the U.S. and international?
Joe Taranto: Well, I'll put it in terms of cat premium, okay. We've -- as I mentioned again in my comments. We had $1 billion of cat premium through the nine months and 75% of that was XOL. And that's I would think we're probably about where we're going to be in that regard into next year.
Matt Heimermann - J.P. Morgan: Okay. So, no further shifts one-one even on the international side then?
Joe Taranto: No. And that could change modestly from year-to-year or quarter-to-quarter depending on what opportunities we see. I mean don't get me wrong, we're not necessarily opposed to a pro rata business, but it has to be at the right terms and conditions.
Matt Heimermann - J.P. Morgan: And then how about like just qualitatively on some of the other property exposed lines, things like marine or energy or aviation has that bias kind of spilled over into those lines too or that’s you're not seeing any noticeable trends one way or another.
Joe Taranto: We're not huge market participants in those lines of business. Yes, we do have marine and aviation business. But we've been relatively conservative given rates and experience frankly in the marine and energy space.
Matt Heimermann - J.P. Morgan: Okay. And then just with respect to I guess Joe or Dom when you think about I guess how would you -- if casualty does get better how would you think about how the demand for might kind of play out from the ceiling perspective. There's obviously quota share that you do on companies XOL portfolios for them to manage, they are not which I would assume would pass through. But more from kind of historical surplus relief just capacity to expand, do you foresee a lot of that? I just ask because it doesn't -- from a balance perspective the industry nobody seems to be starving for capital at least as a generalization.
Joe Taranto: I think that's a good point. And I will agree with that and as casualty improved dramatically to the point where most of the world thought it was doing quite well. I would imagine at least some of the bigger companies might not be looking for more quota share reinsurance, maybe some more XOL. Some of the smaller companies might be looking for more reinsurance as their capital might get tested. So we might see some more opportunities that way. But I think a lot of the opportunities might be on the insurance side. We've been talking about things like California comp where there was a time a few years back when we wrote four times what we're writing today. And we'd love to have the opportunity to do that again. But we don't think the market is positioned for that right now. But so I think a lot of the areas on the casualty side if they improved dramatically where we could do more. I think it would be as important for our insurance operation as it would be for our reinsurance operation.
Dom Addesso: Well, also Matt, we're not totally dependent upon a market expansion, if you will for us to expand our casualty writings. In the U.S. for example, it certainly leverage our property opportunities and where we write a meaningful portion of property business for students into a casualty opportunity. Especially, if they want to improve the credit quality of their panel of reinsurer, so those are where the opportunities might lie. Europe, might be some opportunities portion side in casualty as companies are having difficulty with their capital positions. But it doesn't necessarily require terrific expansion of demand, if you will from a market perspective for us to increase our casualty.
Matt Heimermann - J.P. Morgan: That sounds a little bit more like -- I mean that seems very company specific though in terms of kind of -- I will put it another way. It sounds like your outlook for your own prospects is probably different answer than you might gave for the industry overall, when demand and opportunities for say.
Joe Taranto: Perhaps, yes.
Matt Heimermann - J.P. Morgan: Okay.
Joe Taranto: Yes.
Matt Heimermann - J.P. Morgan: All right. That's helpful. That was it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Amit Kumar with Macquarie Capital.
Amit Kumar - Macquarie Capital: Hi. Thanks and good morning. I guess just two quick follow-up questions to the prior questions. First of all just under discussion on capital management. I'm somewhat curious what is your view on possible special dividend, since you're approaching the fiscal cliff?
Joe Taranto: Well, up until now we certainly have preferred stock buyback over increasing the dividend or special dividend. Now, we're focused on what's going on. And if indeed we start to believe that the taxes on tax treatment of dividends will change dramatically then clearly I think we'd have more conversations amongst ourselves with our board as to whether or not special dividend might make more sense as a way to give back to shareholders. So, our eyes on what's going on and again if we see that as be in the case then we'll talk quite a bit about it.
Amit Kumar - Macquarie Capital: Got it. That's actually quite helpful. The only other question I had is I think in the opening remarks you mentioned about an impending reserve study. And I was curious, does that -- I'm sure you look at the best of reserves to in other areas. Do you have sort of an early view on that or is it I guess too early?
Joe Taranto: Well, in terms of the study, this is the study that we do every year-end. And we do a study every quarter but most companies like ours tend to do a more comprehensive study if you will at the end of the year. No, I wouldn't say that we have anything to report to you unusual at this stage, but really those studies will be taking place between now and the close of the year.
Dom Addesso: And we have other metrics that we follow during the year, before we actually have reserve studies on some of our major lines. And we do reserve studies on the smaller lines throughout the year and they have all been favorable. But we also have other metrics we look at and those again are all pointing to no surprises.
Amit Kumar - Macquarie Capital: No surprises. Okay. That's what I was looking for. Thanks for all the answers and congrats on a quarter.
Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that's all the time we have for questions today. I'll turn things back to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.
Beth Farrell: I'd like to thank everybody for participating on the call. And if you have any questions, please feel free to call. Thank you.
Joe Taranto: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for your participation.

Operator: Good day everyone, and welcome to the Everest Re Group Ltd. Q2 2012 Earnings Release Call. Today’s conference is being recorded, and at this time for opening remarks and introductions I would like to turn the conference over to Beth Farrell. Please go ahead. 
Beth Farrell: Thank you, Lisa. Good morning and welcome to Everest Re Group’s Q2 2012 earnings conference call. On the call with me today are Joe Taranto, the company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Dom Addesso, our President; and Craig Howie, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I note that statements made during today’s call which are forward looking in nature, such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations, and the like are subject to various risks. As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations. Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements. Now let me turn the call over to Joe.
Joe Taranto: Thanks, Beth. Good morning. We are pleased with our results through the first six months. Our comprehensive income for that period is $519 million. During the six months we purchased $225 million of our stock, paid $51 million in dividends, and still increased our surplus $346 million or 6%. Booked value per share adjusted for dividends has increased 10%. Our annualized operating earnings ROE was 16%.  Our reinsurance book has been positioned to capitalize on the best opportunities which have generally been on the property risks as rates, terms and conditions improved in the last couple of years in response to lost activity. We have done this without meaningful increasing our PMLs in any peak zones. We are pleased with our mid-year renewals. Dom will provide more detail on this shortly. Our insurance book has also been positioned to capitalize on our best opportunities. This includes our [DNO] operations, our A&H medical stop loss business, and select property businesses which continue to be profitable areas for us; as well as the California worker’s comp benefits and our general liability book where the market continues to improve; and our [crop book]. Again, Dom will provide more detail. Our $16 billion of invested assets continued to perform well, particularly given the challenges of finding quality investments in the current market. As previously announced, I will continue as CEO through the end of 2013 at which point Dom will become the CEO. I’m excited about continuing to lead our company through this year and next, and thrilled to have such a high quality individual – Dom Addesso – lead our company for many years thereafter. I like our team, our portfolio and our plan. Our company has never been stronger, our future has never been brighter. Dom?
Dom Addesso: Thank you, Joe. Good morning. As Joe indicated, we’ve had an excellent quarter overall. The year so far is playing out generally as expected with the attritional combined ratio improving by one point compared to the first six months of 2011. Rate increases and improving terms are beginning to work through the reinsurance property results. Total CAT premium year-over-year has increased $200 million with approximately half of that in rate increase. These results are also benefiting from the shift of pro rata to excess. Well this has a dampening effect on premium, the positive impact on margin is flowing through the loss and expense ratios. The combined ratio on our reinsurance property portfolios which has not yet been fully reflected through earnings has improved by 11 points. On the treaty casualty side we are beginning to see modest rate increase work through the results. It has not yet reached a level where we feel the need to aggressively expand, but the future opportunities may be more appealing over time. In that regard we are beginning to enhance our teams and structure to maximize our resources around the globe. Overall reinsurance premiums for the quarter were down, but this was due to foreign currency, reinstatement premiums, and the one-time effect of a cancelled [close share] contract. After eliminating the effect of these items, premiums were up 17% for the quarter. This was a result of the previously mentioned rate increases in many of our businesses.  The Florida market at June 1 saw CAT rates move up on average by 5%. Canada property rate movements were similar. The Asian markets had the largest moves, where rates in loss-affected regions were up 20% plus. In Japan, we saw terms improve on proportional treaties although we did move some capacity to excess structures. July renewals in Australia and New Zealand also had an upward movement in rates due to losses in those markets. Increases here were in excess of 10% to 20%. In all other international regions, property rates changes were relatively flat. As I mentioned, approximately half of the CAT-exposed premium increase was rate, but the balance reflects new business opportunities for us in non-peak zones. Our total CAT-exposed premium through six months is $740 million. By year end this is expected to be approximately $1 billion with no material increase in peak PML zones. This expansion reflects our appetite to expand as markets improve and most importantly our ability to execute due to the capability of our staff and the desire of the market for our well-rated capacity. Improving markets and portfolio changes in both property and casualty has resulted in excess of $100 million in underwriting profit for the quarter and $218 million year-to-date for our reinsurance operations. Excluding tax and reinstatement premiums, the reinsurance segment’s combined ratio for the year has trended down to 83.7%. This should continue to improve with the shift to excess. On the insurance side results for the quarter and year-to-date are unfolding as expected. Our growing primary A&H business plus double digit rate increases continuing in both worker’s comp and our general casualty lines are all contributing to a solid 96.5% combined ratio for the quarter. Our professional liability portfolio is also performing well and the runoff of terminated programs is nearing its end. Currently, the only headwind in the insurance book is the crop business. We have only 24% of the crop portfolio in the most severely affected states, yet we have booked conservatively for the year-to-date a small underwriting profit. While it is still early to predict an outcome here it is less likely to have material impact on the annual results since the total MPCI writings for the year will approximate $135 million and we do purchase stop loss coverage on this book. Overall the insurance book continues to move in the right direction with an underwriting profit for the quarter and year-to-date. As we move through Q3 the indications for all segments are still positive. We are moving into the US hurricane season and that still has to play itself out, but July property renewals in the US and Australia were strong. The casualty market continues to move in the right direction. For worker’s comp we are into our third year of rate increases. Our property portfolio has been expanding into non-peak zones and rates are at sustainable levels. We have made some organizational changes and additions in key management positions in both the US and internationally which will allow us to move forward in expanding our footprint in new and different ways. Given our size, credit quality and market positioning we are a market that brokers and clients are interested in doing business with. With these changes I’m confident that we can effectively execute on the right transactions and in the right way. I will now ask Craig to take us through further details on the financials.
Craig Howie: Thank you, Dom, and good morning everyone. We’re pleased to report that Everest had another very strong quarter with after-tax operating income of $223 million or $4.25 per diluted common share. In comparing these results to last year consideration must be given to the record catastrophes experienced in 2011. Net income for Q2 was $214.6 million or $4.08 per diluted share. Net income includes realized capital losses for the quarter.  On a year-to-date basis, operating income was $462.9 million or $8.72 per share. This represents an annualized operating return on equity of 16.1%. Net income year-to-date is $519.3 million or $9.79 per share. This net income includes realized capital gains for the year. These results are reflective of the year-to-date overall attritional combined ratio improving one point from 87.8% down to 86.6%. This measure excludes the impact of catastrophes and reinstatement premiums.  The total reinsurance attritional combined ratio was 83.7% compared to 84.7% in the prior year. The reinsurance segments would have improved even more if not for the $30 million charge in the marine line for the Costa Concordia cruise ship, $10 million of which was booked this quarter. This includes the estimated $200 million of additional costs to remove the wreck. The insurance segment attritional combined ratio was 98.7% compared to 99.3% in the prior year. This ratio is much better than the 105.8% ratio for the full year of 2011. These improvements should pinwheel as rate increases continue to earn in over time. Also providing better margins is the shift in our portfolio from quota share to excess of loss.  Gross written premiums of $909 million for the quarter were down 8% compared to Q2 2011. This decline is primarily driven by the non-renewal of one large Florida quota share reinsurance contract in the quarter – more on this later. On a year to date basis, gross written premiums were $1.96 billion. This represents a decline of 2% after adjusting for reinstatement premiums and the effects of foreign currency movements. Earned premiums of $1.04 billion for the quarter were flat compared to the same quarter last year. Earned premiums of $2 billion on a year-to-date basis have not changed significantly year-over-year. We have achieved strong rate increases on portions of our books, especially on catastrophe-exposed risks. However, the shift in capacity away from proportional risks does mask this effect as excess of loss business carries lower premiums. The reinsurance segments reported year-to-date earned premiums of $1.6 billion, up 1% over 2011. Reinsurance written premiums of $1.5 billion were down 3% over the same period. However, written premiums were flat year-over-year after adjusting for reinstatement premiums and foreign exchange.  For the quarter, written premiums of $654 million were down 10% after adjusting for reinstatement premium and foreign exchange. The decline in the reinsurance written premium this quarter is primarily driven by the nonrenewal of a large Florida quota share contract. The reinsurance segment written premium would have been up 14% for the quarter excluding the impact of the return premium on this transaction. The written premium would have been up 17% excluding the impact of reinstatement premiums and foreign exchange. The nonrenewal of this contract allowed us to deploy our capital elsewhere and write other excess of loss covers in Florida. In fact, we remain a significant writer of excess loss business in Florida. This fits our strategy of shifting our portfolio towards excess of loss business where we feel underwriting margins have seen the most improvement. We expect to see continued improvement in the expected margins to earn in over time assuming a normal catastrophe year in Florida. The insurance segment reported $212 million of earned premium for the quarter which was flat compared to Q2 2011. On a year-to-date basis, insurance earned premiums of $392 million were down 8% year-over-year. This is primarily due to the runoff of certain program business and lower crop premium in the current year. Last year the crop premium earned evenly throughout the year as reinsurance premiums.  The insurance segment reflects $35 million of seasonal earned premium from crop business in Q2 with $39 million now earned year-to-date. We expect full year net premium from this book to total about $150 million. We’re currently booking the crop business at a 95% combined ratio but it’s still too early to tell the overall impact that the record drought conditions in the US will have on this book. However, as Dom mentioned, the company does purchase stop loss reinsurance coverage for its crop portfolio and the MPCI cover attaches at a 110% loss ratio. Our reported combined ratio is 89.0%. This is for both the quarter and year to date. All segments reported underwriting gains for both the quarter and on a year-to-date basis. The overall underwriting gain was $114.5 million for the quarter and $224 million for the year so far. Total reinsurance reported an underwriting gain of $107 million for the quarter and a $218.7 million gain year-to-date. The insurance segment reported a $7.4 million underwriting gain for the quarter and a $5.3 million gain year-to-date.  The commission ratio for the quarter is up 2.8 points compared to the prior-year quarter. This increase relates to a number of one-time adjustments and settlements and the change in accounting for deferred acquisition costs. We expect this ratio to return to a normal run rate of 22% to 23% over the next several quarters. For the quarter we recorded $30 million of losses for current year catastrophes. These losses are primarily related to a number of tornadoes and other severe weather in the US this quarter. This brings our year-to-date gross catastrophe losses to $60 million for 2012 or 2.9% of earned premiums. Regarding 2011 catastrophe losses, we’ve reallocated a portion of the $50 million CAT IBNR established at the end of last year to cover higher estimates on certain events; in particular, the 2011 New Zealand earthquake. We still have $30 million of this catastrophe IBNR remaining. As for other loss reserves, we released our 2011 global loss development triangles in June. There were really no major changes since the 2010 release, and in fact our quarterly internal reserving analysis continues to develop favorably. For investments, pre-tax investment income was $149.3 million for the quarter and $301.8 million year-to-date on our $16 billion investment portfolio. Year-to-date, investment income declined $35.6 million from one year ago. This decrease is primarily driven by lower limited partnership income which was down $22 million this year and by declining reinvestment rates.  The quarter reflected $16.6 million of pre-tax realized capital losses and $8.5 million of losses after tax. But, we had $82.1 million of pre-tax revised capital gains on a year-to-date basis and $56.3 million of gains after tax. On income taxes, the 12.9% effective tax rate on operating income for the quarter reflects 1) the impact of the realized capital losses this quarter on the annualized effective tax rate calculation, and 2) other one-time tax adjustments. The 7.4% year-to-date effective tax rate on operating income is within our expected range for the year. Turning to other miscellaneous items, a $16.3 million derivative loss for the quarter relates to the decline in the equity markets and interest rates during the quarter. On a year-to-date basis we reported a derivative loss of $10.1 million compared to a derivative gain of $4.2 million in the prior year. Other income for both the quarter and the year largely reflects foreign exchange gains in the period as opposed to foreign exchange losses a year ago. This is primarily due to the strengthening of the US dollar against other world currencies. Operating cash flows were $139 million for the quarter compared to $151 million in Q2 2011. As expected, catastrophe loss payouts and income tax payments contributed to this decline. We earned $188.5 million of comprehensive income this quarter. This primarily reflects $215 million of net income for the quarter less foreign currency translation adjustments of $25 million. We now have $590.4 million of comprehensive income year-to-date.  Turning now to capital management, in addition to the dividend payments to shareholders of $25 million we repurchased almost 1 million shares this quarter at a total cost of $100 million. For the year we’ve repurchased 2.4 million shares at a total cost of $225 million. Since 2006, we’ve repurchased over 15 million shares at a total cost of $1.3 billion representing over 23% of the outstanding shares at December 31, 2006. The company has 4.9 million shares remaining under a share repurchase authorization from the Board of Directors. Shareholders’ equity increased to $6.4 billion this quarter, up 6% from $6.1 billion at year end 2011. This is after taking into account the $225 million of stock repurchases and the $51 million of dividend paid so far this year. Book value per share increased 9.5% to $123.75 from $112.99 at year end 2011. Our strong capital position leaves us with capacity to maximize our business opportunities as well as continuing our share repurchases. Thank you, and now I’ll turn it back to Beth for Q&A. 
Beth Farrell: Lisa, we’re ready to take questions. 
Operator: Thank you. (Operator instructions.) And we’ll take our first question from Amit Kumar with Macquarie Research.
Amit Kumar – Macquarie Research : Thanks, and congrats on a very strong quarter. I just had a few sort of clarification-type questions on the crop insurance book, and the color was very helpful that you gave in the opening remarks. First of all, can you just sort of refresh us in what is the crop distribution in the heartland book? It’s not that corn is the predominant just based on where it is, but can you just refresh us what is that distribution?
Dom Addesso: You mean the distribution by crop?
Amit Kumar – Macquarie Research : Yes.
Dom Addesso: Its normal distribution is corn and soybean; corn and soybean are the main products.
Amit Kumar – Macquarie Research : And then do you have the percentages or…
Dom Addesso: Give me a second here, Amit. The information I have in front of me will not let me give you a precise answer, Amit, so I’m going to have to follow up on that question. 
Amit Kumar – Macquarie Research : Okay, that’s fine. And secondly I know you mentioned the stop loss coverage. Would this be similar to sort of what the industry standard is in terms of where it attaches? Can you give us any other color on that?
Dom Addesso: It attaches at a 110%. I think it’s 95% and we have a 5% participation. It’s 30 points of limit. [95 of 30%], excess of 110%.
Joe Taranto: It’s similar in structure to what most companies purchase.
Amit Kumar – Macquarie Research : Got it, that’s very helpful. And I guess the only other question I have for now is you know, obviously your overall book has evolved. You’re talking about CAT-exposed premiums being at $1 billion versus right now at $700 million. I’m curious how should we sort of think about the CAT load discussion? I know we’ve discussed a number in the past but as the book changes how do you think about the CAT load internally?
Dom Addesso: That’s not changed significantly, Amit. As we’ve mentioned there’s been no major shift in our peak zones and we’ve pushed out some additional aggregate into non-peak zones but that’s not changing materially our annual expected outlook.
Joe Taranto: And a lot of the change comes from rate increases.
Amit Kumar – Macquarie Research : Got it. Okay, that’s all I have for now. I’ll re-queue for additional questions. Thanks.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank.
Josh Shanker – Deutsche Bank: Yeah, good morning everyone. I just want to walk through the Florida quota share arrangement a little bit. I wanted to know what impact there was on the expense ratio or the loss ratio in terms of maybe giveback of premiums or something like that that may be one time in nature? Also I wanted to know does the program dissolve or does it go to a competitor? And then talk a little about the philosophy of letting that program leave and what changed in the economics over the last few years.
Joe Taranto: I’ll start with the latter part of that question with regard to what happened and then I’ll turn it over to Craig to take you through some of the numbers. Basically we would have supported the deal that was in place with us last year but a competitor offered terms that we could not support. We in fact had a contractual right on the deal that was put forth to do more than 50% but we chose not to do anything, and instead we redeployed our capital into Florida XOL deals which we think offer better returns. So that’s the long and short of it in terms of that specific deal, but Craig will give you the particulars numbers-wise.
Craig Howie: Josh, one of the things is we don’t typically discuss any one transaction on a call like this. However what I can tell you is what we did is we portfolio’d out the unearned premium. That unearned premium was $194 million. We have to resource the corresponding commission and then we have to remove any deferred acquisition costs associated with that on our unearned premium. But this was a one-time transaction and a one-time event. So you’re right that it was an impact as part of our combined ratio for the quarter but there were a number of other adjustments and impacts in that combined ratio as well.
Josh Shanker – Deutsche Bank: Okay, no problem. But arguably we can be comfortable saying that the expense ratio in US reinsurance is inflated in Q2?
Joe Taranto: Correct.
Josh Shanker – Deutsche Bank: Okay, thank you.
Joe Taranto: The (inaudible) points of inflation on the expense, that’s on a worldwide basis. So there is a blip in the quarter that drove up the expense ratio that should go away.
Operator: And we have Greg Locraft with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Greg Locraft – Morgan Stanley: Yeah hi, good morning and again, congrats on the quarter. I just wanted to get your appetite for buybacks at today’s levels given that the valuation really hasn’t moved much year to date because you’ve had so much book value growth.
Joe Taranto: Our appetite remains strong. We think it’s one of the best ways to use the profits, the earnings that we’re making. Now we are moving into hurricane season and do we’ll be a bit more cautious in this quarter than perhaps otherwise, but we intend to continue to buy nonetheless. 
Greg Locraft – Morgan Stanley: Okay, and then if you can just remind me historically have you ever bought in the wind season and would that strategy change?
Joe Taranto: [We have] but again, we’ve bought less than we have in other quarters. But you know, at this point we have a lot of excess capital, profits are good. We like the portfolio and the only hesitation is the fact that it’s hurricane season. But we like the price and it’s really one of the ways of continuing to move the football down the field. We like buying our stock at these levels.
Greg Locraft – Morgan Stanley: Excellent, okay. Thanks. And then just shifting gears back to crop, it’s actually pretty amazing. You’re not the only carrier but the industry is staring at what at least what would be the largest loss in crop in history and yet you guys are booking at 95% and are going to obviously make more in the line if your projections prove out. And so I guess what I’m trying to understand is what is going into that expectation of a 95%? What gives you guys confidence that what appears to be the worst industry loss ever is not going to result in you guys losing money in that particular line?
Dom Addesso: Greg, it’s Dom. It’s still very early to be predicting what the outcome is, but also recognizing that it’s a limited amount of premium that was earned in Q2 from crop. So that fact that we built a very small underwriting gain, which I think is consistent with what many of the other markets have done; and it’s not inconceivable given that, as I mentioned in my script, we could eke out a small profit because at this point only 24% of the states are severely affected.  Now, that could change in the months ahead in either direction and we have ranges around where the result could end up, which include both a strong profit and a modest loss. So it was really much too early to predict how to book this and frankly, given the level of earned premium that we had in the quarter it wasn’t that material at least as in the impact for this quarter. And ultimately as I said, even as the year plays out on the insurance side our annualized premium for crop is $150 million, and of that $135 million is MPCI-related; the remainder is crop [hail].
Joe Taranto: Yeah, to follow up on that, that really means that this is 3% of our worldwide premium and it’s got a stop loss on it; and as Dom noted only 25% of the business now is in the states that are performing quite poorly. Having said that, as Dom noted it remains to play out. It certainly could get worse and we could lose money on this – we’ll see. But really in the grand scheme of things it is not a real big deal for us.
Greg Locraft – Morgan Stanley: Excellent, very thorough. And then last is on the top line decline, the loss of the contract which you called out in the quarter, are there any lingering impacts to that as we think about premiums and our models going forward on the top line and the bottom line? Just how we should handle that.
Joe Taranto: I don’t think there are any adverse issues in terms of margins or profits or [attritionals] going forward. Premiums may be down a bit; they were down this quarter, and we won’t have that treaty on an ongoing basis. But really our focus is on margin and profits and attritional. We don’t see any issues on that front.
Dom Addesso: In fact, margins really should be going up as again, I indicated moving more of our CAT PML from proportional to excess, we’re benefitting not only on the attritional loss ratio but also on the commission ratio.
Greg Locraft – Morgan Stanley: Okay, great, and again, the profitability is strong. But I guess what you’re saying though is there will be top line pressure that plays through for at least the next three quarters. We’ve taken one quarter of the decline and it should continue but profits are up because of all the reasons you’ve stated. 
Dom Addesso: Greg, what’s in that is you think about the rate increases we’ve had, not only in Florida but around the globe, and a lot of that rate increase is offsetting to a very large degree this one particular transaction.
Joe Taranto: Yeah, and you don’t have one quarter in this quarter. You have the whole unearned premium reserve portfolio’d out, so everything that was on the books has been written but hasn’t earned at this point has been reversed. So this is a very unusual quarter in that regard.
Greg Locraft – Morgan Stanley: Okay, good. Thanks a lot, guys.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Cliff Gallant with KBW.
Cliff Gallant – Keefe Bruyette & Woods: Good morning, good quarter. Just two questions: the first just on the switch from quota share to XOL – is that simply a reflection of current market terms or is there something more intrinsic about the business that you prefer in XOL? And then my second question was just on investment income, and we continue to see low yields and the outcome doesn’t look good there – is there any sense that you should change your strategy, try to get more yield?
Joe Taranto: Well, let me start on the first part. What we have found I think looking around the world in the last year or so is XOL rates have been going out where in many cases pro rata rates have not. So more and more that’s pushing us into the XOL camp. Having said that we still see pro rata deals that we like doing, and we put those through our models and see how those returns compare to other potential deals. We’re talking about CAT deals now and so again, it’s a portfolio optimization model that we’re using. We want to do the best deals. We have a certain aggregate that we’re willing to apply and we want only the best deals to go into that aggregate. And what shakes out of that shakes out of that. Now, as it turns out, given the trends that’s more and more XOL as opposed to pro rata.
Craig Howie: From an investment standpoint, Cliff, I don’t see a dramatic change in our portfolio here. First of all there’s been a lot of changes in the portfolio over the past couple years but right now it’s very conservative. It’s a diversified portfolio. It’s very high credit quality. We don’t’ have control over the low interest rate environment but we have to live with it. We have to make it up on the underwriting side, and there’s been a lot of discussion about underwriting benefits here and a decline in our attritional ratio; and that will make up for it to get to the bottom line ROE.
Cliff Gallant – Keefe Bruyette & Woods: Okay, that makes sense. Thank you.
Dom Addesso: Let me also give you a statistic that might help keep this in perspective relative to the pro rata versus excess. And it’s not as if, as Joe indicated, that we stopped writing pro rata. It’s just reducing the proportion. So in terms of the proportion of pro rata to excess business, in 2010 – and I’m going back to 2010 because that’s a reflection of how it earns through the portfolio – pro rata was 68%, XOL obviously 32%. In 2011 61%/39%, and in 2012 for June it’s 57%/43%. So I mean that just gives you the trend line of the pro rata. The pro rata is also benefitting, by the way, from underlying increases in primary rates but it’s not as if pro rata is falling off a cliff here.
Cliff Gallant – Keefe Bruyette & Woods: Okay, that’s helpful. Thank you.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Ian Gutterman with Adage Capital.
Ian Gutterman – Adage Capital: Hi. Just can you clarify again for me on the universal contract, I think you said $194 million of unearned premium? Over what time period [would you have kept] the contract? Over what time period would that have earned out – by the end of the year, does it go into next year?
Joe Taranto: It would have been one year and you’re correct – the number was $194 million that was portfolio’d out of unearned.
Ian Gutterman – Adage Capital: Okay, so basically that’s Q3 of this year through Q2 of next year that would of earned out.
Joe Taranto: Correct.
Ian Gutterman – Adage Capital: Got it, okay great. And then can you talk about, just given the portfolio changes you’ve made in CAT, I don’t know if you can give us a Florida only PML or just talk about how you’ve structured the portfolio in XOL? Are you exposed more to the [Florida-only’s] and nationals, are you playing high layers, low layers – some sort of sense of what types of events or companies you might be exposed to.
Dom Addesso: Our portfolio hasn’t changed much in that regard, frankly, and it’s pretty well ventilated. We support regionals, locals and national clients. It’s a wide array of client list.
Joe Taranto: And no meaningful change to the PML.
Ian Gutterman – Adage Capital: Alright, even though I would have thought… I mean (inaudible) implies you pay at dollar one where XOL means you pay obviously higher, so it would seem you’d be less exposed to lower events [this year] at a minimum. Is that right?
Dom Addesso: Well slightly that’s true, but there are CAT covers that do attach low. And then of course you can deploy more limit up high and it has a similar PML.
Joe Taranto: And (inaudible) our design was to not increase the PML so we’ve worked backwards from that.
Ian Gutterman – Adage Capital: Okay, and maybe just lastly on that is just as you were trying to reallocate onto XOL-type programs, I mean some of your competitors have sort of discussed it being difficult to stay on programs that they liked in the past because of some of these nontraditional competitors coming in. I just wondered how much of a concern was that as you were repositioning or were you sort of playing on a contract that doesn’t tend to attract that kind of capital?
Joe Taranto: You know there’s always competition in our business, there always will be; and it comes in from the normal competitors and yes, you do see it come in in unconventional ways here and there, be it sidecars or other things. So yes, there was a little bit more than that recently. Having said that, as Dom noted in Florida as an example rates still went up, so I’m sure it had a dampening effect but rates still went up. And I’ve found it overall this June and July to be a very sensible market where we were still able to achieve what we were looking to achieve. To a certain degree, more competition coming in that still keeps it a sensible market is not a bad thing. We don’t want so much coming in that it makes it a market that doesn’t rate very well, but a lot of the competition that is coming in in an unconventional way only wants to come in if it’s a reasonable market and frankly will go away I think if it is not. So put it all together, I don’t think it changed the world all that much and we were happy with what we achieved.
Dom Addesso: We also have demand too, Ian, coming out of model drift as well as companies seeking to buy more protection. So those are some offsetting factors to what you’ve described.
Ian Gutterman – Adage Capital: Of course, of course. Do you have any emerging thoughts as far as a willingness to engage with some of these new form of capital?
Joe Taranto: We’re open. We talk to some of these potential new ventures. If it makes sense for us we could engage. We’re open-minded about it.
Ian Gutterman – Adage Capital: Okay, thanks guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from [Michael Yancey] with Goldman Sachs.
[Michael Yancey] – Goldman Sachs: Thank you very much. So one question I had, you mentioned capital deployment before and you mentioned the nonrenewal of this Florida contract. Just thinking about capital deployment through wind season, I mean does the fact that you have less exposure now it would appear to wind season allow you to get more comfortable with deployment through wind season?  And I guess the second question I think, Joe, you mentioned upfront you’re deploying capital relative to the capital you’re generating. I guess my question would be why stop there? Why not deploy more if you have enough capital and you feel comfortable that there’s enough there to continue? And then I just have one follow-up, thanks.
Joe Taranto: Well you know I think we will be buying back. In terms of going even more aggressively, let’s put everything in perspective. Craig noted we bought back 23% of the stock in recent years and frankly, we’ve added to that that we plan on continuing to buy in a meaningful way. Beyond that we like having excess capital. We like having capital for business opportunities. It didn’t hurt having capital last year when there was a ton of losses out there and some others that downgraded because they didn’t have enough capital. So we want to balance everything. We want to keep having high-quality earnings that we can buy back more, and we will just continue to buy back. I think we pitched it at a very reasonable level all things considered. I think you said something upfront about something that suggested our exposure was down. I think we’ve said we’ve kept the PMLs the same but we didn’t really say that we’ve taken them down. So our exposure if you will just looking from a PML point of view to hurricane is still approximately the same in peak zones.
[Michael Yancey] – Goldman Sachs: Even after adjusting for the nonrenewal of that one large contract?
Joe Taranto: Yes, yes because we redeployed that capital to do some other excessive loss contracts.
[Michael Yancey] – Goldman Sachs: Gotcha, okay. And then one follow-up on the crop stuff: I assume that the reason your losses even in a worst case scenario are limited or relatively bracket-able is because of the reinsurance program that you have. And I guess my question is is that all private market reinsurance? Is some of that back to the government? That’s my first question.
Dom Addesso: What I was referring to is the stop loss program and Craig referenced it as well in his opening comments. That’s private reinsurance. That’s not the sessions to the federal government, no.
[Michael Yancey] – Goldman Sachs: Is there a quota share as well or is it just purely a stop loss?
Dom Addesso: Stop loss. We do have quota share with XOL, right.
[Michael Yancey] – Goldman Sachs: Understood, okay. And then just the last one: the growth, and it looks like a lot of the premium growth came out of international reinsurance, and I just wanted to understand where are you focusing your attention and do you expect that that will continue to be the engine for premium growth for the remainder of the year? Thanks.
Joe Taranto: On the international side some of what you’re seeing is a rate increase coming out of Australia, coming out of Japan, a little bit continuing in Latin America. But we’ve been very strong on the international front for years but again, I think much of what you’re seeing there most recently is rate increase on the XOL side.
[Michael Yancey] – Goldman Sachs: Got it, great. Okay, thank you.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Vinay Misquith with Evercore Partners.
Vinay Misquith – Evercore Partners: Hi, good morning. The first question is on the crop insurance. You mentioned that you’re writing on 95% combined ratio. What’s your loss ratio for the business that you’re working at right now?
Joe Taranto: The combined is the 95%, yes. The way we book it’s 95% combined.
Vinay Misquith – Evercore Partners: So the loss ratio would be similar to the combined ratio, correct?
Dom Addesso: Well you’ve got the commission fees in there. We’ll get you that number in a second.
Vinay Misquith – Evercore Partners: The reason I ask is that the stop loss is that 110% loss ratio so I just wanted to find out the apples to apples. Okay, great.
Dom Addesso: The stop loss ratio works off of the entire combined excluding our internal expenses which are small. And the loss ratio is 75% so it’s [25%] (inaudible).
Vinay Misquith – Evercore Partners: Alright, so just looking at apples to apples it’s 110% of the loss ratio was say maybe the 90% to 95% that you’re booking at now, correct? I mean that’s the potential upside or loss that you may have, correct?
Joe Taranto: 95% could go to another 15 points before the stop loss would begin, yes.
Vinay Misquith – Evercore Partners: Okay fair enough, great, thanks. The second question was on rate increases. You’ve had very strong rate increases and that’s flattening out right now. Where do you see rate increases going out next year should we have a benign CAT season?
Joe Taranto: Well, I think they’re going to level off if you have little to no CATs. If they stay where they’re at I think they’d be leveling off at a very reasonable place where there’d still be some very good opportunities. But I would not expect them to continue up way beyond what they’ve done in the last couple of years if there was little in the way of catastrophes.
Vinay Misquith – Evercore Partners: That’s helpful, thank you.
Operator: And there are no further questions. I’d like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Joseph Taranto for any additional or closing remarks.
Joe Taranto: Well, I will make one comment. We didn’t talk much about the casualty market and Dom certainly noted that whereas we’re seeing rate increases there and it’s getting more promising it’s still not exciting enough for us to really make some bigger bets there. But I would remind everyone that we certainly have the firepower, distribution and people to do so should that end of the market begin to get more interesting.  We have the firepower both on the insurance side and the reinsurance side, so we are hoping that many who are predicting that that end of the world will continue upward and will continue to improve, we certainly hope that that is the case; and if that is the case we’ll be able to do more there. I thought I’d comment on that since we really hadn’t addressed it whatsoever. But other than that, thank you for joining us today.
Operator: And that concludes today’s teleconference. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2012 Q1  (2012-04-26 10:30:00) =====
Executives: Elizabeth Farrell – VP, IR Joseph Taranto – Chairman, CEO Dominic Addesso – President, CFO 
Analysts: Matthew Heimermann – JP Morgan Greg Locraft – Morgan Stanley Joshua Shanker – Deutsche Bank Michael Nannizzi – Goldman Sachs Amit Kumar – Macquarie Howard Flanker – Flanker & Company Ron Bobman – Capital Returns 
Operator: Good day, everyone and welcome to the Everest Re Group Limited First Quarter 2012 Earnings Release Call. Today’s conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks, I’d like to turn the conference over to Beth Farrell. Please go ahead ma’am.
Elizabeth Farrell:  Thank you, Jim. Good morning and welcome to Everest Re Group’s first quarter 2012 earnings conference call. With me today are Joe Taranto, the company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Dom Addesso, our President and Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I note that statements made during today’s call, which are forward-looking in nature, such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations and the like are subject to various risks. As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations. Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements. Now, let me turn the call over to Joe.
Joseph Taranto:  Thanks, Beth. Good morning. We are pleased with our first quarter results as we generated an annualized operating ROE of 17% and annualized net income ROE of 21% and group book value per share adjusting for dividends by 7%. Including other comprehensive income, we made over $400 million for the quarter. We bought back a $125 million of our shares, paid $26 million in dividends and still increased our surplus by $260 million. This increase adds to the already strong excess capital position we had established. Our balance sheet has never been stronger with high quality, low performing assets and reserves that continue to test well. Even though by no means of hard market, we have positioned our portfolio to take the best the market has to offer. We have continued to find opportunities in the property catastrophe market where losses in the last 18 months have driven improved rates, terms and conditions. Although our expected margins have increased, we had not materially increased our P&Ls in any of the peak zones year-over-year. Since our last call, we have completed the April 1st Japanese renewals and we were pleased with the results. Rates on earthquake excess of loss treaties had increases ranging from 20% to 60% compared to 2011 and from 40% to 150%, when compared to the pre-earthquake 2010 rates. Wins excess of loss treaties experienced rate increases of 10-ish percent following 5-ish percent increases from the year prior. Japanese interest to buy proportional covers were improved to exclude natural perils, which increased the demand for specific excess of loss coverage on these overseas risks. The next important renewal date for us will be June 1st, when we have our Florida renewals. We anticipate that that will go very well, given the following dynamic. First, the new RMS-11 model increases the need for most buyers to buy more reinsurance at higher model prices while it reduces the risks – the risk capacity of many of the sellers. Second, the state of Florida will be providing less reinsurance, which will increase the need for professional reinsurance capacity. And third, the underlying homeowners’ insurance rates have been permitted to increase allowing for a bigger healthier premium base. Moving on to casualty reinsurance, we continue to take a conservative position, essentially keeping our book to long-term declines that we have made money with. Many insurance executives are anticipating meaningful improvements in this market and we hope they are correct, in which phase we would adjust their appetite, but for now, we will continue to hedge our best.  Our insurance operation continues to show improvement, whereas it ran to a 101 combined ratio for the first quarter, we expect continued improvement for ensuing quarters as rate increases achieved last year and this year on California Workers comp business works its way into the earnings, and our crop premiums which are seasonally in nature will be much heavier in subsequent quarters. Our financial institution D&O, our medical stock loss insurance and our property insurance both continued to produce an underwriting profit.  On the investment front, we continue to perform quite well despite lowering our duration to better insulators from an upward movement in interest rates. Strong cash flow continues to build our invested asset base. As previously announced, Craig Howie has joined us as Executive Vice President and will become CFO following our first quarter SEC filings. Dom and I, Andrew the large number of qualified candidates for the position, and we were delighted that we were able to attract our number one choice.  Dom remains CFO for the first quarter and accordingly he will present the financial report this quarter. Craig will be on the next call presenting the second quarter financial report. Now that Craig has joined us, Dom will be able to spend most of his time on the operational side of our business. Our management team has never been stronger with Dom as President, Craig as CFO, John Doucette as Chief Underwriting Officer for Worldwide Reinsurance and our many strong executives around the world like Mark de Saram, who oversees Bermuda, Europe and Asia, and Ron Diaz, who oversees Latin America and the other international areas. Last quarter I said I was optimistic about 2012. Clearly now I’m only more optimistic. I like our team, our plan and our portfolio. We have achieved a compounded 13% growth in book value per share including dividends through our 17 year history as a public company. Given our first quarter we are hopeful we will exceed that historical average this year. Dom?
Dominic Addesso:  Thank you, Joe. We are very pleased with the performance in the first quarter. In comparing the results to last year consideration must be given to the catastrophes experienced in 2011. Over the long-term despite the catastrophe levels in recent years, our returns have been quite favorable and this quarter has moved our compound annual growth and shareholder value back towards our historical average. This most recent quarter with $7.31 growth in book value per share was 6.5% reflects an underlying 21% net income ROE. This return is reflective of the reinsurance attrition combined ratio excluding the impact of restatement premiums, improving 2 points from 85% to 83.2%. It should be noted that the 2012 results include a $20 million provision for the Concordia loss and as adjusted for this would mean that there was an underlying four-point improvement in the combined ratio results. Rate increases are primary driver of this improvement as well as the portfolio shift and pro-rata to excess contracts in heavily taxed close regions. The favorable impact of rate increases earning through is expected to continue during the year as rate increases on cap exposed business began picking up momentum starting last April after the Japan earthquake. In this first quarter of 2012, property cap excess of loss in return increased over $15 million or 17.5%. An overall cap exposed premium is up 12% about meaningful increases in CML or peak zones. Premiums in the reinsurance segments were up approximately 9% after adjusting for reinstatement premiums and foreign exchange. This increase was less than the percentage rate increases decided due to shifts in geographic mix as well as shift in capacity to excess of loss from pro-rata. So, this quarter in addition to the attritional results, there was a catastrophe loss $30 million for the February and March tornados. Despite these events, the reinsurance underwriting gained for the quarter as a result of portfolio change and rate increases as mentioned was at $112 million. On the insurance fund, there has been a similar improvement in the attritional combined ratio when compared to the full year run rate. Insurance operation ended the full year of 2011 at a 106 current year attritional combined ratio. This year’s first quarter is as expected showing dramatic improvement over that run rate with 101.2 combined ratio. This improvement is in part being driven by over two years of rate increases, most notably in California Worker’s compensation. Rate increases in casualty and worker’s comp have continued into the first quarter. In addition the insurance portfolio was benefiting from a shift in mix with new products such as crop and ANH insurance and a reduction in certain casualty programs. Insurance premiums are down quarter-over-quarter due to runoffs in certain program business and a light quarter for crop premium. Last year’s crop business was recorded evenly throughout the year as reinsurance premium. With the shift to the insurance, this business now has a certain seasonality which resulted in only $8 million of first quarter net premium. Nevertheless, we expect approximately $150 million of crop premium for the balance of the year. With an expected combined ratio in the low 90s even more normalized weather (inaudible). Turning to investment income for the quarter there was $152.4 million of income compared to $178.7 million one year ago or a decline of $26.3 million. The difference is primarily due to the income from limited partnerships. After adjusting for the impact of the $24 million decline in income from the partnerships, core investment income is down by approximately 2% or $2.5 million. This as a result of declining reinvestment rates offset by new cash flows, which continues to be positive at $166 million this quarter. Capital gains were quite strong for the quarter at $99 million pre-tax and were reflective of the rising equity markets in the first quarter. The combination of solid investment performance and strong underwriting results, produce net income before taxes of $343 million. Taxes for the quarter of $38 million results in net income of $305 million or $5.68 per share. Operating results, pre-tax equal $244 million and $240 million after-tax. The low effective tax rate on operating income of 1.7% during this quarter was a result of the impact of large realized gains in the quarter on the analyzed effective tax rate calculation and other onetime adjustments. It is expected that the tax rate on operating income will normalize with an overall effective rate for approximately 6% by yearend. Turning to other miscellaneous items, the $6 million gain on derivatives was comparable to the prior year’s $7.5 million. Again this quarter was a reflection of the rise in equity markets. Other expenses which are mostly foreign exchange losses were just slightly ahead of the prior year are still relatively minor at $6 million. There was no meaningful change in corporate expenses and other underwriting expenses increased by $3.5 million due to timing certain expenses. Commissions were increased by $2.6 million due to the change in accounting deferred acquisitions costs. Commissions are therefore down on a like-for-like basis due to the shift XOL business which carries lower commissions. This accounting change was adopted prospectively and will impact each of the next four quarters through commission expense for a similar amount. Adding to our income position this quarter was $80 million of unrealized gains after tax from our bond portfolio as a result of declining yields. When added to our net income plus foreign currency translation gains we totaled $402 million as comprehensive income. After taking into account $25.6 million of dividends, $125 million of share repurchases and ended the quarter at $120.30 at book value per share. Our total capital position of $6.2 billion leaves us with capacity to maximize our business opportunities as well as continue share repurchases. We’re also pleased to report that our A+ rating from S&P was recently affirmed with a stable outlook. Thank you. And with that I’ll now turn it back to Beth for Q&A.
Elizabeth Farrell:  Tim, we are ready to take questions.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) We’ll take our first question from Matthew Heimermann with JPMorgan.
Matthew Heimermann – JP Morgan:  Hi, a good morning everybody. Couple of – just a couple of quick numbers questions before a bigger picture question which is just the Concordia loss what segment was that in or it was spread across multiple?
Joseph Taranto:  It’s U.S. reinsurance.
Matthew Heimermann – JP Morgan:  Okay. And then the reinstatement premiums in the quarter, what segment are those booked in?
Joseph Taranto:  International.
Matthew Heimermann – JP Morgan:  Okay.
Joseph Taranto:  And they were mostly from last year’s events.
Matthew Heimermann – JP Morgan:  Okay. Mostly are from last year. Okay, and then the clock premium that earn the rest of the year, is it fair to assume that probably about 90% of that will earn and the second and third will be written in the second and third quarters?
Joseph Taranto:  The bulk of that will be yes.
Matthew Heimermann – JP Morgan:  Okay. And then your tax rate comment I was a little surprised by 6% because that would imply basically no tax on underwriting income if I am doing the algebra correctly. So did I hear that right and is that 6% to run rate and if so why – what’s the significant change there?
Joseph Taranto:  We are anticipating obviously our effective tax rate to grow to 1.7% to 6% by the end of the year. And that calculation would be any other anticipated adjustments that we might have to attract the tax expense during the year.
Matthew Heimermann – JP Morgan:  So, is that like favorable resolution or prior year tax matters, things like that.
Joseph Taranto:  So we shouldn’t play for forward, let’s say in the next year.
Matthew Heimermann – JP Morgan:  Probably not. That’s all – and then, big picture, Joe on Florida – just with respect to the demand picture because I think one of the – there are clearly some increased demand citizens though it look like you the capital markets for a bit more of the program that people were anticipating, there’s obviously been a lot of third party capital setup alongside companies and of course in cars and other rather rated entities. I’m just – how I’d curious if you could just talk to the supply side, I mean how that’s changing relative to demand side?
Joseph Taranto:  You’re right, Matt. There certainly are some moving parts and some go one way and some go the other. Citizens it does seem as if there will be more into the bond market. It’s unclear if they are by and more or less out right reinsurance did. They’d be populating of course with more risk than exposure into other companies and create more meaning for reinsurance. I think the big things are, RMS-11 and the fact that the premium base of reinsurance level is getting healthier. On the supply side, again RMS-11 for many reasons starts to limit the amount of capacity that can provide. I am not seeing any sort of groundswell and our new companies that I think is going to create any sort of meaningful additional capacity for the marketplace. So we do look at the whole equation, I think it will continue to be improvements for re-insurers at 61, that’s my expectation.
Matthew Heimermann – JP Morgan:  Okay. And do you think for your portfolio that means – I mean does that mean growth in terms of – does that mean growing just with your existing clients let’s say you get rate pass through on pro-rata and maybe with maybe with de-popping just a little bit of up growth in their books, are you expecting on top of that to be putting new accounts on the book as well?
Joseph Taranto:  Well, I would like to see there maybe some new accounts and existing clients will certainly come first. And the limitations will be that we don’t really want to increase our P&L in any significant way in Florida. Of course if there is rate increase, we will be pleased about that.
Matthew Heimermann – JP Morgan:  Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator:  We will now take our next question from Joshua Shanker from Deutsche Bank.
Joshua Shanker – Deutsche Bank:  Yes, thank you. I was hoping you might accompany out by walking through reinstatement premiums of 1Q 2011 by segment and then may be talking about exposure growth by various segments reinstatement premium exposure that way?
Joseph Taranto:  Okay. Let me just – all right reinstatement premium for this year?
Joshua Shanker – Deutsche Bank:  For the comparing. I’m trying to sort of normalize this year’s numbers with last year’s by segment?
Joseph Taranto:  Okay, just keep in mind that we do have what we are trying to do is looking at the attritional combined ratios excluding the effects of reinstates, we can give you those if that’s easier. But….
Joshua Shanker – Deutsche Bank:  I’m actually interested in your growth in where you are taking more risk, where you’re taking less risk. It’s hard to describe that with premium, but I would like a qualitative on top of the quantitative I guess?
Joseph Taranto:  We got in U.S. reinsurance this year $337,000 against 16 million reinstate in premium in last year in the first quarter. International $4 million this year versus $9 million a year ago. And Bermuda zero this year against $5 million a year ago. So that brings a total reinsurance of a little over $4 million against a little over $30 million a year ago. 
Joshua Shanker – Deutsche Bank:  Okay, that’s great, Dom. Can you talk about where are you taking more exposure, where are taking less exposure, where and where is the likes for justifying that and what not? I mean can you handle that anyway you want I guess?
Joseph Taranto:  So as we mentioned earlier, in all of your peak zones, our PMLs have not change in many meaningful way. Any exposure growth or stretching at a rag has been primarily in the Midwest with a –little bit of growth in the northeast, but most of our exposure growth has been in the Midwest. 
Joshua Shanker – Deutsche Bank:  And is that in terms of translate tornado or like new mattered earthquake?
Joseph Taranto:  It would be all (inaudible).
Joshua Shanker – Deutsche Bank:  Okay, okay. 
Joseph Taranto:  There maybe pockets like down just decided where we done more. Again, reacting to the rate changes that happened post the tornado at place last year, but in the name when you get to the big zones and in Japan, and Europe and California and Florida, we really don’t have at least an increase first, at least subject to one sharp loss.
Joshua Shanker – Deutsche Bank:  And then in the Midwest it doesn’t feel one of those zone and it’s as one of the big tree?
Joseph Taranto:  It’s not a big item for us, but it’s a bigger than what is was before, but a sudden known to the peaks own area now.
Joshua Shanker – Deutsche Bank: Okay, very good. I appreciate all the talk.
Joseph Taranto:  (inaudible)
Dominic Addesso:  Josh, there has been other areas where we decreased as well of course.
Joshua Shanker – Deutsche Bank:  And do you want to highlight that I mean, I’m just trying to get much as information as possible?
Dominic Addesso:  No, a little bit of a reduction in quake, some modest reductions in Japan wind, Canadian British Columbia quake, things of that sort.
Dominic Addesso:  I can give you some broad executive summary and it’s broad. Last call I mentioned that we expected to write an additional $100 million to $150 million in pure cat premium on our book of business that still looks to be a pretty good number and yet if you ask me in terms of just worldwide exposure I think if anything were down a bit because terms and conditions they are much better and again the rates being up that’s where I think the premium growth comes from.
Joshua Shanker – Deutsche Bank:  Well, appreciated. (Inaudible) very good quarter.
Dominic Addesso:  Thank you.
Operator:  Moving on, we’ll take our next question from Greg Locraft from Morgan Stanley.
Greg Locraft – Morgan Stanley:  Hi, good morning and congrats on a great start to the year. Wanted to just follow up on the commentary regarding book value growth this year, you mentioned you’re hopeful that you can exceed the long term 13% average for the corporation. How do you think about catastrophe losses from here or how do you – yeah how do you think about catastrophe losses and equity market or partnership returns within that commentary?
Joseph Taranto:  Are you asking about each of them separately or collectively Greg, I’m not sure.
Greg Locraft – Morgan Stanley:  Separately because obviously that’s where the volatility can come in to achieving or missing that target and I’m just curious how you guys both modeled it internally as you think forward. Knowing that it’s impossible to present with (inaudible)?
Joseph Taranto:  Okay. I mean we obviously carry capital against all of the risks in our portfolio and not listed which are the ones, but you mentioned thinking about equity returns for example what we try to do is carry a balanced investment portfolio particularly coming out of 2008, 2009, we saw opportunities to expand our investment portfolio, if you will not within any undue risk. So, we generally would like the direction that our position or the posture of our portfolio and it has obviously performed well over the last couple of years and quarters and particularly in the first quarter. But we’re not going to necessarily dramatically change let’s say our investment portfolio front of allocation from here but you would like to (inaudible). In terms of the cash degree risk, we still manage our catastrophe risk through about 11 after tax s basis to largest events through about 11%, 12% of the capital. We’re not looking to meaningfully change that. And...
Greg Locraft – Morgan Stanley:  I guess tell me if I’m wrong, I think what I’m trying to get….
Joseph Taranto:  Its (inaudible) business you get some volatility with that. We usually put in about nine points in our plan is to what we would expect in terms of anticipated catastrophes. Obviously, we were below that for the first quarter and when I start looking forward I am going to put back in the average expectation if you will for the future. I think considering that less volatility on our books this year than we had last year. Again between changes in terms and conditions which have been happening both at the insurance levels and at the reinsurance level. And I think if multiplied to make for a very, very meaningful change. When we start replaying even events like last year at $100 billion under varying scenarios, we just come out with much better answers and much less volatility. So trying to kind of get to the bottom line for you question, yes I’m very expect to have or hope to have good results for the next nine months that give us yearly results that is much better than the historical average. And that certainly will encourage us to continue to buy back stock as well. And I think it will lead good answer, if to say if it’s a year that’s not average if in terms of various catastrophes.
Greg Locraft – Morgan Stanley:  Okay. And then let’s suppose 9 points is what you budget for on tax and then is the equity market assumption like a 7, and 8, and 9, how do you think about that on the investment side? And knowing it’s not perfect?
Joseph Taranto:  The equity markets are going I think even probably guess that is what we have guessed is that it’s been a good place for to us be in the last year. We have an investment meeting every month to decide what we chart to do going forward, but I think we will leave it to you to put expected increases on the equity markets.
Greg Locraft – Morgan Stanley:  Perfect, fair enough. So again on that 13% growth number, if – and I know it’s a historical and it’s hopefully you beat it and obviously you’re off to a decent start, but that points to earnings of north of 14 bucks a share to get to that level. Streets not even close today to that. So as you guys look at our models what are we missing with regards to the earnings power of Everest Re. 
Joseph Taranto:  Well I think you’re – what you’re missing currently is the improvement in attritional results. Essentially we’ve highlighted this as an example the additional cap premium we’ve had just in the first quarter. Already taking into account April those that number is now approximately $100 million. Joe mentioned that we expect that 100 to be an increase by the year end over $150 million. So that’s how the dramatic improvement on our attritional combined ratio is. In addition the shift from (inaudible) excess change in terms of conditions is all pointed towards driving that attritional lost ratio down lower.
Greg Locraft – Morgan Stanley:  And I would add insurance on top of that improving. So put it all together it really improved underwriting with some help from the markets especially in the property catastrophe side, it’s not so much any changes on investments or even future taxes. Share buyback of course will sweeten things but I guess Greg it was being this was what Dom just said improvement on the underwriting side. 
Joseph Taranto:  Perfect. Okay. Great. And then one last one if I could on capital deployment, it was nice to see the buyback in the quarter. Should we be thinking about buybacks plus dividends being at or below operating income going forward and what is your appetite well I guess still 83% of book value now after today’s move given the growth. 
Greg Locraft – Morgan Stanley:  Look our apatite’s buyback we haven’t issued forecast, but – and we won’t just we want flexibility but we will continue to buyback and at 83% we think it’s very attractive to buyback. The fact that we have had very good earnings and certainly are hopeful of continued good earnings only encourages us to buyback more. So that’s our formula with net earnings buyback.
Greg Locraft – Morgan Stanley:  Okay, great. Thanks guys.
Joseph Taranto:  Thank you.
Operator:  Moving on with our next question from Amit Kumar from Macquarie.
Amit Kumar – Macquarie:  Thanks and good morning. Maybe just going back at the discussion on California comp, I wanted you to refresh us, as to what you think is the gap between the earned premium rates versus lost costs?
Joseph Taranto:  Going from the light. Rates that we’re achieving versus how much lost cost are going up?
Amit Kumar – Macquarie:  Yes, one of the written rate and it’s earned over time. So there is a gap. There is a lag. It lags. So that’s what I’m trying to figure out, do you think that on an earned basis the margin is positive or negative or you know you’re looking to get to at end of 2012?
Joseph Taranto:  We feel that by year’s end we will see positive margins in our California comp book.
Amit Kumar – Macquarie:  May be a sign of the loss cost trends?
Dominic Addesso:  Yeah, let me help. We certainly grade it down. We achieved I think something like 9% increases about two years ago. This rating period increased last year, I believe we averaged 15% and this year, to the first quarter we are averaging 10% and these all compound and we think they are well in excess of plain cost inflation. It’s far to put a number on what plain cost inflation is exactly, but if you want to use half of that might be close to my best guess. That means as the rates continue to play out, we are surpassing plain costs to buy pretty decent margin and that’s why we think each quarter just on the back of that should be better and by the end of the year if not sooner we’ll be booking underwriting profits on (inaudible) income.
Amit Kumar – Macquarie:  Got it. Okay that’s helpful. I guess the other question was just going back to the discussion on fixed one and your P&Ls being flat at 12% or so. I’m curious just based on the market opportunities you’re talking about, why not move that number higher, just based on the margin you might be getting on that?
Dominic Addesso:  It’s a good question and certainly we debate it. But we have some other great opportunities like buying stock back and so we want to limit volatility to make sure that we can act on that front as much as we want to as well. So I think it’s just a question of how much did we build on the various opportunities that we have.
Joseph Taranto:  There’s also opportunities to deploy our capital as I mentioned earlier and spread our aggregate to other parts of the U.S. and around the globe and continue to balance up that portfolio as rate increases outside of Florida present themselves and we like deploy our capital in the most diversified way. So that helps us to do that as well.
Amit Kumar – Macquarie:  Got it. Okay thanks. Thanks for the answers.
Operator:  We will now take our next question from Michael Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs.
Michael Nannizzi – Goldman Sachs:  Thanks. Just couple of questions I guess, one is starting at the insurance segment trying to understand talking about 2012 premiums versus 2011 so, you had to star fade out 2011 and you had a family crop was booked as reinsurance in 2011 I’m assuming it was in this segment, and now it’s going to be written on your own paper in 2012. I mean, you have the new NAH business, so just trying to think about, what is that look like growth at the 2011 – just kind of with all these puts and takes from just the top line perspective?
Joseph Taranto:  I would anticipate that it would be kind of flattish by – for the year on the insurance front.
Michael Nannizzi – Goldman Sachs:  Okay. And then, with crop, I’m guessing that the expense in loss ratio kind of look differently than the rest of the book. Should we assume then that the combined ratios look differently in the center and kind of a two center quarters of the year versus the edges or are there – are there contributing factors that would make that less relevant?
Joseph Taranto:  I think that you are right. I think what you’re focusing on is the expense ratio on the insurance side was obviously challenged a little bit, not probably so, but a little bit by the fact that the crop premium in particular was not heavy number in the first quarter. So as that begins to emerge to – back towards that annualized $150 million or $160 million number, we’ll enjoy the benefit of a lower expense ratio in the succeeding quarters.
Michael Nannizzi – Goldman Sachs:  Great. One question I guess just on capital end, you’re (inaudible) clearly biologically big in the first quarter not relative to last year, but just even going back further in that, it was a large quarter for buybacks. You talked about writing more cap business in your PMLs and not reason, I guess, just kind of wanted to understand –I am guessing as you were saying before, geographic concentration. But would you expect, as you go through the year to see PMLs rise either from driving more business at June 1 or just the impact of continuing to buyback your own stock?
Joseph Taranto:  I don’t anticipate any wrath, I really like the formula that we’ve been using which is we don’t want increases in exposures if anything we probably want less, but we want more margin and more premium. I think that’s the sign of an improving market, I think that’s what we want our underwriters to achieve. Again, this is all coming on the back of lot of losses that were paid last year and so I think it’s proper. So I’d just like – I just like to be planned as it currently is and at least for this year I’m not envisioning any increase in P&L, certainly not in the (inaudible).
Michael Nannizzi – Goldman Sachs:  So I – what are you expecting this to see, I mean out of four, I mean if – it sounds like you mentioned that conditions are improving, you’re optimistic heading into 61. So should we read that to mean that you – if everything worked out the way you wanted to your exposure wouldn’t change, you would just be earning more on that business and I guess the question is – is there a rate at which you would write more of that business than you are currently expecting if conditions are better?
Joseph Taranto:  It might be something modestly more, but it won’t be something tremendously more, I think what – where we are looking for is less volatility, more profitability and the ability to again to continue buy back the stock. So I think it’s a good spot, I think that’s the sweet spot for us at this point. So we are not looking to any significant way to increase cash exposure in the peak sums. We have found opportunities in resilience that we didn’t have log exposure, Dom mentioned the Midwest where we weren’t there before the last year or so. And we will continue to look for other opportunities around the world, but we don’t expect any big increase in P&L in Florida, even though we do expect improved conditions.
Michael Nannizzi – Goldman Sachs:  Okay. Thank you.
Operator:  Moving on we’ll take our next question from Howard Flanker from Flanker & Company.
Howard Flanker – Flanker & Company:  Hello, I have two questions, one in your usual releases your loss ratio differs from the loss ratio in the 10-Qs, why is that?
Joseph Taranto:  You have to be more specific in….
Howard Flanker – Flanker & Company:  For example, I haven’t looked through this year 10-Q, but last year in the 10-Q the loss ratio was 120.4, and in your announcement was 123.6, and that’s happened for a number of quarters, so you are using some different measures, I want to know what the difference could be….
Joseph Taranto:  There could be reinstatement premiums, the impact of reinstatement premiums.
Howard Flanker – Flanker & Company:  Wouldn’t you know that when you announced your quarter?
Joseph Taranto:  Of course we do, but I don’t have the specifics in front of me, so I’m struggling a little bit with….
Howard Flanker – Flanker & Company:  Well, I don’t know what the loss ratios is going to be in the 10-Q, but this year you said the loss ratio was 60.4 and last year the similar number is 123.6, correct? First page of your release, but if you look at the 10-Q on the table that 123.6 became what did I say 124.4.
Joseph Taranto:  I should flip the pages. 
Howard Flanker – Flanker & Company:  Yeah, it’s on page 28 in the Q and there is a difference, so I do not understand the difference.
Joseph Taranto:  I don’t have the data with me.
Dominic Addesso:  We would be happy to call you back and do the reconciliation.
Howard Flanker – Flanker & Company:  Okay. And then you used the term, that where I’m not acquainted, it’s not run off but rates of the premium, I forgot the word my memory slipped me.
Joseph Taranto: Well I was referencing on the insurance side, I was referencing the run off of certain programs and essentially what I was referencing there was this is that was terminated and of course using the term run off applying that premiums would be coming down each and every quarter, as that…
Howard Flanker – Flanker & Company:  That I understand. That’s not the word I was thinking. There’s another word you used and I haven’t heard it used very much. It wasn’t underlying premium, it was another word, I’ll probably have to get back in queue and I’ll ask…
Joseph Taranto:  We’ll go through when we chat with you.
Howard Flanker – Flanker & Company:  Okay, thanks.
Joseph Taranto:  Thank you.
Operator:  And moving on we’ll take our final question from Ron Bobman from Capital Returns.
Ron Bobman – Capital Returns: Sounds like you (inaudible) I wanted to talk about with Howard after the call. I just had a follow up – sort of more qualitatively than anything specific about your exact reserves. Qualitatively about Thailand I’m just sort curious as to what’s happening there claim wise? Obviously more time has passed since the flooding, is there a lot more certainty, I know is a strong word, but sort of the risk of variability in claims – claim amounts et cetera, could you just talk about what’s transpired over the last I guess, almost six months or so. 
Dominic Addesso:  That’s a fair question. Of course …
Ron Bobman – Capital Returns: Thanks, Dom.
Dominic Addesso:  Right up until year-end of course it was obviously saw a lot of upward pressure on claims from Thailand, late reporting et cetera. We did it of course a deep dive on the events there in closing out the yearend. We’ve had and of course we do the same thing every quarter with all of our events. And I’m happy to report that this particular quarter has been very stable. As you do know that the yearend, we had some additional provisions that we made, given the uncertainty of 2011 around all of those events, I’m also pleased to say that we’ve not seen any movement around that number. So that’s been stable, we had no reason to quite frankly utilize that IBNR at this point. So it still exists there in the event that there is some volatility around those results, but pleased to report that it’s has been very, very stable. Does that answer..
Ron Bobman – Capital Returns: Yeah, I was a little sort of a little sort of qualitative and specifically about any risk or actual movements in your numbers just there’s all sorts of claims that following, immediately following these events, people talking about BI, CBR, the linkages and I was just sort of qualitatively to answer Joe’s thoughts?
Joseph Taranto:  Yeah, I do think that in the case of CBR for example, I think the industry is obviously very worried about that early on, and that seems to have tempered quite a bit. I don’t think the loss is actually reached a level that the industry had feared. 
Ron Bobman – Capital Returns: Okay. Thanks a lot for your thoughts. Appreciate it and best of luck. Hope that continues.
Joseph Taranto:  Thank you.
Operator:  And at this time that will conclude today’s questions-and-answer session. I will turn it back to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.
Elizabeth Farrell:  I want to thank everybody for their time and participation and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.
Operator:  Thank you. That will conclude the conference. We thank you for participation.

Operator: Good day, everyone and welcome to the Everest Re Group, Ltd. fourth quarter 2011 earnings release call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introduction, I'd like to turn the conference over to Beth Farrell. Please go ahead.
Elizabeth B. Farrell: Thank you, Tim. Good morning and welcome to Everest Re Group's fourth quarter 2011 earnings conference call. With me today are Joe Taranto, the company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Dom Addesso, our President and Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I note that statements made during today's call, which are forward-looking in nature such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations and the likes are subject to various risks. As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations. Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements. Now, let me turn the call over to Joe.
Joseph V. Taranto – Chairman and Chief Executive Officer:  Thanks, Beth. Good morning. There has never been a year-end where I've been so pleased to see the prior year over with and the new year begin. That is to have the losses behind us so we can move into the opportunities that those losses have created going forward. Despite dealing with historic high for industry catastrophe losses, our balance sheet remains strong with capital in excess of $6 billion. This strength will serve us well as we move into 2012. I'm optimistic about our prospects for 2012. Let me tell you why. First, our reinsurance portfolio will be much improved from the changes in our property catastrophe reinsurance portfolio. Property catastrophe rates, terms and conditions have improved throughout 2011, continued to improve at January 1, 2012, and I believe will continue to improve into April Japanese business. Property reinsurance has become an increasingly important part of our operation as we move towards the best opportunities in the marketplace. At January 1, we saw rate increases on the order of 15% for retro business, 5% to 10% for catastrophe clients around the world if they didn't have losses and much greater increases if they did. Churns improved as well. As a consequence, we have meaningfully increased our expected margin on this business and yet not increased our PMLs in any peak zones. Second, we have a significant transformation going on in our insurance operation that I believe will lead to much improved results in 2012. Roughly 20% of our 2012 insurance book will be written by Heartland, our crop insurance company. This book has made a profit the vast majority of years it has been in business and weather permitting should do so again in 2012. About 30% of our 2012 business will be workers' compensation, primarily in California. Our year-end reserve review led to increased reserves which revised our view of 2011 profitability. We have achieved roughly 15% rate increases throughout 2011 and continue to get increases of that magnitude in January. I expect we will continue to achieve increases throughout the rest of 2012 as other companies top-up reserves. We project 2012 to generate an underwriting profit on the back of these increases. About 15% of our businesses is written our professional liability unit. This unit has produced an underwriting profit for the past three years, and I expect another good year in 2012. The remainder of our insurance book includes our medical stop-loss business, which has been running to an underwriting profit, and our general liability and property business where we are achieving our targeted rate increases. Put it all together and the expectation is for a good year ahead. Whereas I would not characterize the current market as a hard market, the positive changes in the property catastrophe reinsurance market, coupled with the improvements we anticipate in our insurance segment should make for a meaningful positive change for Everest. If you project catastrophes at a more normalized level, it should produce very solid earnings, much of which could be used for stock buyback. Dom?
Dominic J. Addesso:  Thank you, Joe. Good morning. I will begin my comments this morning by outlining the major events that have impacted our earnings for the quarter and year-to-date. At this point, we are all familiar with the events that have affected our industry, which in total were in excess of $100 billion. For the year, our cat losses pre-tax were $1.3 billion, which is less than 1.5% of the projected industry losses. Given the size of these industry events, our share of losses were within modeled outcomes. And as reflected in our various risk management scenarios, our capital position remained intact as these events despite their significance were largely absorbed through earnings. The details on the events for the year which highlights how unusual the year was are as follows; [indiscernible] earthquake, $532 million; New Zealand earthquake, $306 million; Thailand floods, $225 million; U.S. tornadoes, $61 million; Brisbane floods, $56 million; Hurricane Irene, $38 million; Cyclone Yasi, $20 million; Canadian fires, $13 million; and a cat IBNR of $50 million. In the fourth quarter, the pre-tax losses were $380 million. The largest event was Thailand at $225 million. The other impacts were from events earlier in the year, most notably, Japan at $52 million, New Zealand at $37 million. Due to the complexity of these losses, the industry has seen continued development. In recognition of this, our reserves include IBNR of $50 million for potential development relating to all 2011 cat events. Overall, the impact of cat losses in the quarter after-tax and reinstatement premium was $246 million, and on a year-to-date basis was approximately $960 million. As mentioned, on a pre-tax basis these losses were $380 million for the quarter and $1.3 billion year-to-date, which brings to light the fact that the underlying attritional results are improving year-over-year as a result of portfolio changes and rate increases. Excluding cat and related reinstatement premium, the underwriting gain was $480 million for the year compared to $435 million in 2010. This is reflected in the current year to-date attritional loss ratio, which stood at 60% for 2011, compared with 61.2% in the prior year. This improvement is solely due to the reinsurance segments, which improved just over two points to an attritional combined ratio ex-cats and reinstates of 83.5% as a result of the rate increases and the portfolio shift from pro rata to excess of loss contracts. This is expected to carry over into 2012 as certain pro rata contracts continue to run off. The attritional results for insurance showed little change year-over-year. This was a result of the crop book having an underwriting loss due to drought conditions and acquisition related costs, as well as higher accident year loss selections on other lines based on the year-end reserve studies. These studies indicated a need for reserve strengthening mainly in workers' compensation and excess casualty, resulting in adjustments to prior years as well as the current year. However, rate increases in California workers' comp, 15% in 2011, which was over and above the 9% achieved in 2010, in addition to more normalized crop results, and the discontinuation of a select number of underperforming programs should result in meaningful improvements in the 2012 loss ratios. It is expected that these changes alone could lead to a 7 to 8 point improvement in accident year results. Offsetting the reserve developments in the insurance segment was continued favorable emergence in the reinsurance segments overall. To complete the discussion on underwriting operations, both net premiums written and net premiums earned were up approximately 4% for the year. This increase is primarily being driven by the new business in our insurance segment, namely crop insurance and primary accident and health. Offsetting this was a decline in reinsurance premium, primarily driven by the shift from pro rata to excess. In the fourth quarter, the reinsurance net premium written shows an 11% increase, with no corresponding increase in earned premiums due to an account written at the end of the quarter, as well as the cancellation of a large program in 2010. Finally, regarding overall operations, I will note that the expense ratio year-over-year is down slightly. This is mainly driven by a 2 point reduction in commission expense in the insurance segment, due to a change in the mix of business. Turning to the other key elements of operating results, investment income was down on both the yearly and quarterly comparisons. The primary driver of this is the difference in income from limited partnerships. Nevertheless, after adjusting for these impacts, net investment income is still down slightly as a result of declining reinvestment rates. However, cash flow remains positive at $660 million for the year, which has helped to offset declining interest rates. Realized gains were positive, in particular for the fourth quarter. And when combined with the underwriting results, investment income and tax benefits, it resulted in net income for the quarter of $41 million and a loss for the year of $80 million. Other comprehensive income was a loss for the quarter of $36 million, but a gain for the year of $35 million. Essentially, there were unrealized gains for the year and quarter, offset by translation losses and a pension liability adjustment, which hit mainly in the fourth quarter. The net effect was a slight comprehensive loss for the year and a slight gain for the quarter, which means that the decline in shareholders' equity for the quarter and year primarily a result of dividends and share buybacks. This leaves our capital position in excess of $6 billion and, therefore, well positioned from market opportunities and potential future share repurchases. Thank you, and now I'll turn it back to Beth for Q&A.
Elizabeth B. Farrell: Yeah, Tim, we are open for questions and answers.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) We'll take our first question from Matthew Heimermann with J.P. Morgan.
Matthew G. Heimermann – J.P. Morgan Securities, LLC:  Hi, good morning. I just wanted to follow up on the underlying loss ratio. I think, you sufficiently addressed the insurance side in terms of suggesting it to 700 to 800 basis points of improvement there potentially in 2012 versus 2011. But just curious, is that when you make that comment; is that kind of where you think the book will be on a written basis or an earned basis in 2012?
Dominic J. Addesso:  That would be on an earned basis.
Matthew G. Heimermann – J.P. Morgan Securities, LLC:  Okay. And then, you also -- it also look like there were some noise in the U. S. reinsurance segment and I don't think you address this in -- that in your opening comment. Could you just -- could you touch on that as well?
Dominic J. Addesso:  Noise in what respect, Matt?
Matthew G. Heimermann – J.P. Morgan Securities, LLC:  Just for -- relative to our expectations, the underlying loss ratios are a little higher. So, given we also saw some adverse there, I was wondering if it was maybe impacted by either a change to the current year -- current accident year loss ratio in the fourth quarter? Or if there were attritional losses that didn't qualify as gaps in the quarter or anything like that?
Dominic J. Addesso:  Okay. I guess the first thing I'll point out is the attritional loss ratio for the U.S. reinsurance all -- I'm sorry, for all reinsurance segments, year-over-year was positive, right? If you're referencing the fourth quarter, the fourth quarter had a little bit of a tick-up because we did have some late reported -- from a number of contracts, late order was reported in the fourth quarter with an increase in current year losses. This came through our loss reserve metrics that we -- outside of our reserve studies and we booked those events in the fourth quarter. So, it really is a current year event. There was some movement depending on the buckets prior year reserves, but overall there was positive development on the reinsurance segments on our -- for loss reserves.
Matthew G. Heimermann – J.P. Morgan Securities, LLC:  And then --
Dominic J. Addesso:  As far as the current year is concerned, year-over-year, which is a much better metric to look at, is improving and we would expect that trend to continue.
Matthew G. Heimermann – J.P. Morgan Securities, LLC:  That's fair. Do have the -- can you quantify the 4Q noise related to the late report even just ballpark it?
Dominic J. Addesso:  It was in the range of $30 million, I believe.
Matthew G. Heimermann – J.P. Morgan Securities, LLC:  Okay, that's helpful. And then I guess, was there anything that affected your ability to buy back stock in the fourth quarter because when I listen to you talk about capital, it sounds like you've got more than enough capital to kind of support the growth opportunities especially given that you are talking about seeing growth without -- in premium without seeing growth in PML. So, just curious on that.
Joseph V. Taranto:  Sure, Matt. First of all, you're right. We have plenty of capital to buy back and we certainly plan to buy back going forward. We will be in coming quarter buying back. Yes, what affected things in the fourth quarter was -- for the most part was the Thai floods. I mean once they happened and we had to get our arms around them and we clearly had information that others on the outside didn't have as we were trying to put together the sums. If there is anything big and important that's going on that we had more information than the outside world, we just don't buy back and that really is what affected us as we went through the fourth quarter.
Matthew G. Heimermann – J.P. Morgan Securities, LLC:  Okay, that's helpful.
Dominic J. Addesso:  Early in -- Matt, early in the quarter, recognized that we're basically out of the market until we come out with third quarter earnings so -- and then soon thereafter, of course, is when Thailand happened.
Matthew G. Heimermann – J.P. Morgan Securities, LLC:  Yeah.
Dominic J. Addesso:  And we did buy back some shares in the fourth quarter, a modest amount, but we did.
Matthew G. Heimermann – J.P. Morgan Securities, LLC:  Okay. And then just --
Joseph V. Taranto:  It just goes back before the Thai floods happened.
Matthew G. Heimermann – J.P. Morgan Securities, LLC:  You had a couple days, I guess.
Joseph V. Taranto:  Yeah.
Dominic J. Addesso:  Yeah.
Matthew G. Heimermann – J.P. Morgan Securities, LLC:  The last question just -- I'm sorry for all the -- sorry for the numbers questions. But just -- I just wanted to make sure that I'm thinking about the taxes correctly, so specifically the net investment income, I was just hoping you could give us a sense of what the tax rate was on the recurring investment income because the tax rate ended up being a lot lower and I wasn't sure if there was a shield on the alternatives or what was happening there in terms of mix of tax rates?
Dominic J. Addesso:  Well, the tax rate has not bounced around all that much. We disclosed the effective tax rate in our supplemental information. For the year, it was 13.7% that contrasts with 12.7% a year ago. The only volatility -- there's two things that drive that. One would be our mix of tax exempts to taxables, which we did have some shift last year in that. And secondly, the income from limited partnerships can be a driver in that. Some of that income is offshore, but it depends on where the income from limited partnerships is coming from, but I'm not sure that the volatility around that number is all that great in terms of being able to use it as a basis for projecting.
Matthew G. Heimermann – J.P. Morgan Securities, LLC:  All right, much appreciated, thank you.
Dominic J. Addesso:  Okay. Thank you, Matt.
Operator:  We will take our next question from Vinay Misquith from Evercore Partners.
Vinay Misquith – Evercore Partners, Inc.:  Hi, good morning. Could you add some color to your exposure to the Thai flood losses and whether you have some uncapped quota shares there and what is the possibility of reserve development should the industry loss rise in that area?
Joseph V. Taranto:  Well, I'll start, Dom, and see if you want to add anything. I think a few points to make with regard to the Thai losses, first, I think it's important to note that the insurance policies in Thailand sub-limits both flood coverage and business interruption, which meaningfully contains the loss. Second point I guess that I would like to make is that we have posted reserve at the high end of any industry estimates that we have seen. And of course, I would add, third, that we've also established a $50 million reserve for additional IBNR for the 2011 cats. So, I think when you take those things into consideration, we're in good shape. Dom?
Dominic J. Addesso:  I think that states it, I mean, we do have quarter shares in Thailand. But as Joe says, those coverages that are affected here are sub-limited, as well as there is not 100% take-up rate on that book of business as well. Vinay, did that answer your question?
Vinay Misquith – Evercore Partners, Inc.:  Yeah, that's helpful. Thank you. The second point is on the fixed maturity securities, we saw the investment income decline about $7 million sequentially. So were there some one-time items in that or do you expect that to continue in the future?
Dominic J. Addesso:  Well, there's clearly a headwind as it relates to investment income, given reinvestment rates which we're all familiar with. I guess, I would -- to maybe help us think through this. We've estimated that our maturities and calls and that's why I say it's an estimate because we have to also consider potential calls and pay downs on mortgage backs. We'll be about $1 billion for 2012. So the average, if you take the average of that of course throughout the year that's $500 million. And the differential in reinvestment rates, call it 250 basis points or 300 basis points. But if you just use the high end of that number, 300 basis points, that's essentially $15 million headwind on the investment income side. Offsetting that of course will be positive cash flow that we anticipate as well, that will not make up that full $15 million, of course, if that in fact turns out to be what reinvestment rates are for 2012. So that will give you a window on the fixed income side. On the -- I know you didn't ask this, but just to complete the picture on investment income, on the limited partnership side, we have about $500 million of limited partnership investments. Our long-term return to date has been around 8%, 7% to 8%. So, you can think about that number in that context, so that would give you about $40 million estimate on limited partnerships. Having said that, in more recent years, those results have been ticking up slightly better, so I think that's a relatively conservative number. There will be volatility around that, of course, given the fact that we do have the marks based on what's happening in the overall equity markets. But directionally, I think that might give you some guidance on the investment income. Is that helpful, Vinay?
Vinay Misquith – Evercore Partners, Inc.:  Yes, it's very helpful. Thank you. One last thing, if I may. The earned premiums in the U.S. insurance segment were lower this quarter, were there some timing issues regarding the Ag premiums this quarter?
Dominic J. Addesso:  I don't believe so. I think we had some adjustments in the third quarter on the Ag book, but I can't -- I don't have the specifics of that with me right now. But I think --
Vinay Misquith – Evercore Partners, Inc.:  Thank you.
Dominic J. Addesso:  Just look at the annual premium, I think that will give you a fix on what the quarterly impacts would be.
Vinay Misquith – Evercore Partners, Inc.:  Sure, fair enough. Thank you.
Operator:  And we'll take our next question from Amit Kumar with Macquarie.
Amit Kumar – Macquarie Research Equities:  Thanks and good morning. Just going back to the last question, if I understand this correctly, if the flooding loss continues to go up for the industry, what you are saying is that your number will not increase proportionately because of the sub-limits and I guess Dom, allocated IBNR should take care of any additional development. Did I understand that correctly?
Dominic J. Addesso:  I think that's a fair way to characterize. Our numbers that we put up excluding the IBNR that was referenced would translate into approximately a $17 billion industry event. And then, of course, we have an IBNR number that is available for that event as well as any other events that occur during 2011. So given the fact that we reserved at a very high industry loss level, therefore, our expectation is that we would not have any development on that number. I think that's probably bit more accurate way to say it.
Amit Kumar – Macquarie Research Equities:  Got it, that's helpful. The other question I have is in the opening remarks you mentioned that your PMLs were flat. I just wanted to sort of reconfirm that number. The one in 250, is that close to 11% or 12% or has that number changed?
Joseph V. Taranto:  No that's still a good estimate on the PMLs and we are still finalizing our one-one bookings, so we don't have a precise number on that, but generally, the trend has been down relative to year ago.
Amit Kumar – Macquarie Research Equities:  Got it. And then -- sorry, go ahead.
Joseph V. Taranto:  In other words our expectation for 1/1 comparison to 1/1. It's not a statement about what that might look like at 4/1 or 6/1 et cetera.
Amit Kumar – Macquarie Research Equities:  Okay, just one last question. On the California comp markets, I think you mentioned that you expect an underwriting profit. I know you talked about the rate increases. I wanted to get some color on the other side, the loss cost trends and your expectations going forward on the margins? Thanks.
Dominic J. Addesso:  Our reserve position at the end of the year contemplate general industry loss cost trends, as well as exposure trends, which for California work comp are in excess of 6% on frequency severity trends and in excess of 4% for exposure trend. And those would be used in our anticipated results and pricing needs for 2012.
Joseph V. Taranto:  And we've been getting 15% rate increases including through January of 2012. So we're outstripping that and then another 5%-ish on top of that, which should move the loss ratio and the combined ratio down for 2012. And I think put it into a modest underwriting position, that's our current projection.
Amit Kumar – Macquarie Research Equities:  I'm sorry. What was that 5% you mentioned?
Joseph V. Taranto:  Well, I guess, Dom was saying, you can put in medical inflation and if you come up with 10%-ish, but if you ever get increases of 15%, you've kind of taken care of the 10% and add 5% to the good.
Dominic J. Addesso:  Right. We have a 5% exposure trend I think is which we're what could be coming in as well.
Amit Kumar – Macquarie Research Equities:  Got it. And that the 15% that is the, I guess that is the actual net rate, which is being passed on the consumers right?
Joseph V. Taranto:  That's correct. And that's what we achieved throughout 2011 and so far what we've achieved in the early part of 2012.
Amit Kumar – Macquarie Research Equities:  That's pretty good. Okay, that's all I have for now. Thanks.
Operator:  And we'll take our next question from Michael Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs.
Michael S. Nannizzi – Goldman Sachs & Co., Inc.:  Thanks. I just had one general question, as you think about capital and from your comments in upfront. If you had to pick one, what's more important to you, ROE or book value?
Joseph V. Taranto:  I don't know that I would -- I don't know if there's an answer to that question. I think they're both very important to us and I guess they both really tie together. We do look at both of it, for us, as growth in book value per share.
Dominic J. Addesso:  And plus dividends.
Joseph V. Taranto:  Plus dividends, yeah.
Michael S. Nannizzi – Goldman Sachs & Co., Inc.:  All right. I guess just thinking, I mean, if my math is right. I mean, every -- at this price every 1% reduction in share count is worth about $0.25 a share in book. I mean just, as you look out at the business that you like, which sounds like, it's more property cat, how do you balance the trade-off of potentially absorbing more capital there versus the buyback? And I'm sure this is something you think about all the time, just to understand kind of where you think about the edge given that choice, I would appreciate if that's possible. And just on follow-up. Thanks.
Joseph V. Taranto:  Sure. I think I'd first say that given the losses and dislocations in the Cat market, there are some very good opportunities this year that we certainly want to avail ourselves to. And we're doing it in such a way where our mantra, if you will, is more premium tighter terms less PML. So in that sense, it's going to consume a lot less capital and hopefully generate some very good profit. And so it's a terrific opportunity. At the same time, it's also a very good opportunity in our opinion to -- with the buyback stock and that's why we intend to pursue both. And it's a little bit of a balancing act, but both provide some very good opportunity and we will proceed along both fronts.
Michael S. Nannizzi – Goldman Sachs & Co., Inc.:  All right. And -- I'm sorry, Dom.
Dominic J. Addesso: Let me add to that.
Michael S. Nannizzi – Goldman Sachs & Co., Inc.:  Sure.
Dominic J. Addesso:  Our growth in book value per share up to 2011 has been approximately 13%, book value per share plus dividend growth. Of course, prior to 2011, it was close to 14%. And any new transactions that we're obviously contemplating are changes to the portfolio are with an eye towards putting those transactions on at levels that would increase or come in above those types of returns. And I know that's not precisely getting to your question, but I think it does give you some view as to how we're looking at. In addition, keep in mind, again, relative to share buybacks, there are other factors. Those other factors are rating agencies and maintaining a strong rating in the marketplace and having some amount of capital available for the market opportunity. So, it isn't just the pure Excel spreadsheet numbers.
Joseph V. Taranto:  That's right. I mean this year, 2011, demonstrates that -- I think it served us very well to have a very strong capital position in 2011. I would like to add to Dom's comment that that record of 13% compounded including 2011 is what we have achieved over the last 16 years and our plan is to beat that record going forward. We think we have the opportunities and the resources to do that.
Michael S. Nannizzi – Goldman Sachs & Co., Inc.:  Great. And then just one follow-up, if I could. On the book kind of tilting more towards property cap than it has in the past, can you talk about what sort of business you are focused on, is it still sort of your low layer preference, is it more U.S. versus outside the U.S., and generally, are you seeing -- do you feel like you are seeing better rate in the book that you are binding versus the market overall? Thanks.
Joseph V. Taranto:  Well, clearly, the market is seeing increases, but I think we are in a position where we clearly want to achieve those rate increases, terms improvements, otherwise we just move elsewhere. There is a lot of good opportunities at this point. I think they will continue to develop, as I said, as we go forward including Japan and even into the Florida business in June and the other business in July. So, there are opportunities both internationally and in the U.S. and when you say the U.S., different parts of the U.S. January 1 wasn't so much Florida business, that's the middle of the year, but I think with RMS 11 and what's going on in the world, I think that will continue to climb when we get into that. So, we are just in a position where we are picking and choosing the best opportunities that come to us and at the same time being very conscious of the PML. As I said, I think we will have a much bigger margin on that business. I'd expect we probably will write $100 million to $150 million of additional premium in cat premium in 2012 versus 2011. And with that, our overall worldwide exposures will actually be down and the PMLs in peak zones will be down.
Dominic J. Addesso:  And also we do not look at the marketplace and say, we're tilting towards the U.S. or any other particular market, it's where the opportunities present itself. So, for example, Europe wind we feel is relatively under-priced, so in that particular area going into 2012, that's an area that we're managing down. We wrote more business this year in the Midwest given where pricing is going, but it's really looking at what opportunities the marketplace is giving you as opposed to tilting towards any particular geography.
Michael S. Nannizzi – Goldman Sachs & Co., Inc.:  Great, thank you very much.
Operator:  And we will take our next question from Ian Gutterman with Adage Capital.
Ian Gutterman – Adage Capital Advisors, LLC:  Hi, guys, just a couple clarifications. On the U.S. reinsurance, did I hear what the prior period adverse development was for, I know you talked about the accident year, but I am not quite sure you touched on where the adverse was from?
Dominic J. Addesso:  That was primarily excess casualty book.
Ian Gutterman – Adage Capital Advisors, LLC:  And what years on that, recent years or older years?
Dominic J. Addesso:  It's a variety of years.
Ian Gutterman – Adage Capital Advisors, LLC:  Okay, got it.
Dominic J. Addesso:  [indiscernible] Ian.
Ian Gutterman – Adage Capital Advisors, LLC:  No, that's okay. And you obviously commented on expected improvement in the cat reinsurance and insurance accident years. What about the other books of reinsurance business the Bermuda book, the international book, are those expected to improve as well?
Joseph V. Taranto:  Let me slice that a little differently for you, Ian. You are right when we talk about the insurance book and cat book, we are probably roughly talking about half of our worldwide premium. And I didn't comment a whole lot on the other half. Now, the other half is probably 25% of the worldwide businesses that are non-cat property business U.S. and international, and I'd say 20% of our worldwide business is casualty reinsurance and then another 5% might be surety and A&H and other lines of business. Now, the reason I didn't comment on that is nothing dramatic is happening in that half like it was happening in the cat world or is happening in the insurance transformation that we have going on. We do expect to achieve an underwriting profit, modest ones in all of that 50%, both of those pieces. But again, in the non-cat property world, we've made some improvements in selection and our clients have been able to get some modest rate increases. But there is nothing to report to you that is particularly different. On the casualty side, I would say the same. We've kind of shrunk that down. As we've kind of gone to core clients with casualty rates particularly in the U.S. going down for the last number of years. We are seeing some flattening and some uptick in pockets there. I know many are getting more optimistic about that space and probably in the less optimistic category there. So I would say that other half of our book we expect it to do reasonably well, but it's not changing dramatically from 2012 versus 2011.
Ian Gutterman – Adage Capital Advisors, LLC:  Okay, got it. And Dom, just to clarify to make sure using the right number on the insurance, the seven to eight points for improvement you were talking about that was versus the full year, so that gets it to about a breakeven for the 2012?
Dominic J. Addesso:  Yeah. And I guess to some degree it being a little bit conservative and I was just really referencing those changes, right. There will be other things that will be impacting positively the insurance book that Joe referenced that could in fact lead to a better result than that.
Ian Gutterman – Adage Capital Advisors, LLC:  Okay, great. And then just last one. Joe, you talked about 1:1 renewal for cat, can you talk about outside of cat, did you grow your book, keep it the same shrink it and maybe what lines drift up or down?
Joseph V. Taranto:  Well, I think a kind of was just given you that, Ian, in the non-cat property and then the casualty, it really wasn't a dramatic change for us.
Ian Gutterman – Adage Capital Advisors, LLC:  Okay.
Joseph V. Taranto:  It was pretty much the same. So, the areas that are really changing for us are in cat side in terms of additional margin and I think the insurance side, where we are, but the comp getting increase is although that that's not going to be anything like what we achieved in terms of combines in 2003, 2004 and 2005. We do think it will be in the black. We are hopeful for bigger margins in the crop business and in our A&H business and some of the other parts of the insurance business. Put it all together and again I just think it will make for better margins and less volatility, I don't think it will make for dramatic top line worldwide increases in premiums, although, I do expect them to be up.
Ian Gutterman – Adage Capital Advisors, LLC:  Sounds good. Thank you very much.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) We'll take our next question from Sarah Dewitt with Barclays Capital.
Sarah Dewitt – Barclays Capital, Inc.:  Hi, good morning. Could you give us some more color on what drove the reserve strengthening in U.S. insurance and how should we think about that going forward?
Dominic J. Addesso:  Well certainly, at the end of the third quarter, based on some interim testing that we were doing, we saw some weakness in our California work comp, the work comp in general and our excess casualty portfolio and we did put up additional reserves in the third quarter. That of course was subject to reserve review in the fourth quarter, which clearly the third quarter trends were certainly indicative of what we needed to do in the fourth quarter. And at this point, we certainly anticipate that that reserve is appropriately booked, in fact, we booked above our midpoint estimate in both of those areas, but also keep in mind that whether it's California comp or excess casualty, those are just couple of reserve buckets relative to our overall $10 billion of reserves and 200-plus reserve categories that we monitor. And from time to time, we're going to get pluses and minuses in any one of those 200-plus reserve buckets. And of course, this has been something that has been -- that we've seen for the last two years here. But we do think obviously that we've captured that. And again, I'll point to the fact that, if you look back at our core reserves overall, those have developed positively for us over in the last few years in total. So, and that's what's most important to us, is the overall reserve adequacy of the enterprise.
Sarah Dewitt – Barclays Capital, Inc.:  Okay, thanks. And then on the premium growth, it's been a bit lumpy and was very strong this quarter. How should we be thinking about the pace of that going forward?
Joseph V. Taranto:  Well, again, as I mentioned, I think we will grow top line 2012 versus 2011. I do not think it will be dramatic. I would not put out a number, if you will, I mean in the cat space, as I said, we'll do more premium. But in the non-cat property there are some switches who will be going from pro rata to excess of loss and the same may be true in some other parts of our book. When you put it all together, I think it will be modest top line growth, but more margin and hopefully better loss ratio when combined.
Dominic J. Addesso:  Some of that that you see there is currency fluctuations. It's -- if you take out some of the currency impacts, it's not quite as lumpy as you would -- one might assume from just looking at the numbers.
Sarah Dewitt – Barclays Capital, Inc.:  Great, thanks for the answers.
Operator:  And at this time, there are no other questions in queue. I'll turn it back to our presenters for any closing remarks.
Elizabeth B. Farrell:  Thank you for participating on the call. I would also like, before we end the call, to point to our new website and I'd invite you to take a look at it. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to call me. Thank you again.
Operator:  That concludes today's conference call. We appreciate your participation.

Operator: Welcome to the Everest Re Group Ltd Third Quarter 2011 Earnings Release Call. Today’s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Beth Farrell, Vice President Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Beth Farrell: Thank you, Patrica. Good morning and welcome to Everest Re Group’s third quarter 2011 earnings conference call. With me today are Joe Taranto, the company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Dom Addesso, our President and Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I will prefix our comments by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I note that statements made during today’s call, which are forward-looking in nature such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations, and the like are subject to various risks. As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations. Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements. Now, let me turn the call over to Joe.
Joe Taranto: Thanks, Beth. Good morning. I’m pleased to report $147 million of operating income or $2.70 per share for the quarter. This is a solid result when you consider the catastrophes in the quarter and the stock market decline during this period. The story this year has been one of heavy catastrophes. Property casualty reinsurers know when they budget for expected catastrophe losses at the actual outcome will in all likelihood be anything but what has been budgeted. Mother Nature doesn’t work that way, typically losses will be much lower or much higher. This year, it was the much higher variety. What’s important is that Everest has the underwriting the diversification to the underlying earnings and the capital to manage through this volatility. Indeed, despite this year’s earthquakes, Hurricanes floods and tornados, we still expect to generate an operating profit for the year given a reasonable fourth quarter. Lost projection is what we sell. Without losses, we don’t have a product. Heightened losses reinforce to our customers while they buy and reinforce to us and to our competitors the importance of charging rates that will lead to meaningful profits overtime. We expect property catastrophe rates to continue to go up into 2012. We expect retro prices at 1:1 to go up about 15%. We expect catastrophe rates on programs without losses in 2011 to average 5% rate increase. Of course, 1:1 programs with losses will have significant increases. The will include Australian and New Zealand accounts as well as some U.S. regional accounts. As we move forward to the 1:1 renewals in 2012, we will continue to execute the following strategies. First, we will continue to reposition our reinsurance portfolio towards the better opportunities. I expect that this will mean we will continue to ride more property business as a percentage of the overall writings and less casualty business. This is based on the expectations that property catastrophe reinsurance rates will continue to improve. As we did for the June and July renewals, our mindset will be more rate, better terms, better upside with no increase in our higher P&L zones. I expect our portfolio will continue move toward more accessible loss less pro rata. This is based on the expectation that property excess of loss rates will continue to improve, while underlying insurance generally will not meaningfully improve. Of course, there will be exceptions for this role. For example, Florida homeowner rates are increasing, improving pro rata results. Second, we will continue to extend our global footprint and distribution capabilities. Whereas we already operate around the globe with a great reputation in ratings there are always seeds to be planted for the future in different countries and in different products. Our operation in Brazil is a good example of a recent success. Our entry into the China market makes for future opportunities. Third, we will continue to reposition our insurance operation towards the better opportunities. I expect we will continue to grow our short-tail book including Heartland our crop insurance company. We will continue to push for higher rates on our property facilities in Florida and California. In the third quarter, we average 3% rate increase on this property business. We will continue to remain in the workers comp market where we are more recently averaging 15% rate increases in California. We will continue to maintain our profitable D&O business written out of New York. We will continue to push for rate increases on our general liability book of business where we average 9% rate increase in the third quarter. We will continue to reduce the amount of standalone access umbrella business that we are right at this space continues to be very competitive. At our last report, we expected our crop book to be profitable this year as it has been most prior years. However, severe weather will now likely make for an unprofitable year when you include our transition and startup costs. This is one of the factors that drove the poor results for the quarter in the insurance segment. Again most years, we expect this book to be profitable. Given the significant restructuring and rate activity, I expect our insurance book will be much improved in 2012. Fourth, we will continue to look for the best opportunities for our $16 billion of investments, finding yield at the appropriate risk level may be more challenging today than ever and disciplined underwriting is needed both in our insurance and reinsurance deals as well as our investment strategy. Fifth, we will continue to buy back stock. Since our last call, we bought back 700,000 shares at a cost of $55 million. Since this timeframe was hurricane season, we were more cautious than we need to be between now and the next call. In summary, our quarter demonstrates the underlying strength of our organization as we posted reasonable results despite unusual losses. Going forward, our market offers select opportunities as parts of our market are showing improvements in response to losses. Dom will now drill down through the quarterly numbers and explain what drove these numbers.
Dom Addesso: Thanks, Joe, and good morning. Before I begin, I would like to bring your attention to the changes in our segment reporting where the specialty segment was combined into the U. S. reinsurance segment except for primary accident and health, which is now included in the insurance segment. In addition, we have provided additional disclosure on our non-U.S. investments, which highlights our limited exposure to European banks and sovereigns in distressed European countries. As mentioned, despite additional cats in the quarter, we had positive operating results with a combined ratio of 95.6. I will start with a review of premiums as this is important in understanding the underwriting results for the quarter. Overall, net written premiums are relatively flat quarter-over-quarter and up slightly over 2% for the year-to-date. These modest changes, however, do not adequately convey the underlying component changes in our book of business. For example, although total net reinsurance premium is down 6% for the quarter and 5% year-to-date, the cat excess of loss component of the book within the total is up approximately 15% while maintaining relatively flat PMLs. The offset to the increase in the cat excess of loss was in the pro rata property book, which was down by 12% and the remaining offset was from a continued reduction in our casualty lines. These changes are significant in that they explain the year-over-year improvement in the year-to-date attritional combined ratio for all reinsurance segments from 85.2% to 82.2% excluding the effect of reinstatement premiums. A significant portion of the shift in premiums earned occurred in the third quarter as a result of the June and July renewal dates and since expected loss ratios and commissions are much lower cat XOL business, we are beginning to see this favorable impact on the loss ratio and the expense ratio. In addition, our projected attritional loss ratio includes provisions for cat events less than $10 million. The amount reserved exceeded reported losses in this category and therefore this provision was reduced by $35 million in the third quarter. Both the shift in mix and the effect of lower than expected small cap losses resulted in an attritional current-year combined ratio for the quarter of 77.3% excluding the impact of reinstatement premiums. Adding approximately 15 points of cats in the quarter and positive reserve development resulted in a reinsurance combined ratio for the quarter of 89.3%. The 15 points of cats in the quarter are a result of Hurricane Irene, estimated at $35 million, an increase of $65 million in the Japan earthquake estimate and an increase of $27 million for the New Zealand earthquake. The increases for Japan and New Zealand were largely in response to additional information provided to the market in general by large sedans [ph] and brokers during the third quarter as they worked through the actual losses. We believe our estimates are at the high-end or above certain industry estimates and therefore reflect a conservative view of ultimate losses. Turning to insurance operations, the net written premiums were up 44% and 40% for the quarter and year-to-date respectively. These increases were primarily driven by our new venture in crop insurance plus rate increases in California workers’ comp and the recent initiative in primary medical stop-loss business. It should be noted again that the medical stop-loss business has been reclassified to the insurance segment since it is a primary business. Results in the insurance segment for the quarter have been impacted by 11.6 points of prior development on excess casualty business and workers’ comp. On the year-to-date, this had a 3.9 point impact. In addition, cats for the nine months were 0.5 a point. After adjusting for these items, the current-year attritional combined ratio stands at 101.8. This compares to 103.8 for the first nine months of last year. This improvement reflects improving rate conditions across the commercial loans markets in particular for workers’ comp as well as structural changes to our portfolio with the termination of underperforming programs and growth in professional lines and California DIC. Current year continues to be impacted by soft casualty rates albeit improving and higher-than-expected losses on the crop book due to severe weather conditions. The latter adversely impacted the quarter by 6 points and the year by 2 points. Looking ahead though, we continue to view the Heartland acquisition as strategically important to the insurance group and expect that its future probability – profitability will add meaningfully to this segment. When taking this into account, it further highlights the improving trend in the insurance results. Net investment income amounted to $156 million, which for the quarter was up $15 million over last year primarily due to limited partnerships, which had a gain of 16 million this year versus a $1 million loss in last year’s quarter. Income from fixed maturities is down due to lower yields while income from equities is up, reflecting our increased investment in dividend paying equities. Also our equity securities income includes fixed income exposure through bond mutual funds which are classified as equities. Our realized losses for the quarter were $138 million before tax and $84 million after tax due primarily to fair value adjustments on the equity portfolio. While not impacting earnings, we also had unrealized losses net of tax of $35 million from our bond portfolio. Although interest rates declined during the quarter, we experienced widening of spreads on high yield and other corporate bonds. Nevertheless, on a year-to-date basis, our unrealized gain position net of tax increased $52 million. And when combined with realized losses net of tax, the overall portfolio experienced just a slight decline of $26 million. As you know though, subsequent to the quarter end, the markets have rallied and as of last Friday the overall portfolio is now at a net gain for the year of $48 million. This, of course, along with rising rates recently should have a positive impact on the derivative loss we experienced in the third quarter that resulted from falling equity markets and interest rates in the third quarter. And finally, book value at 6.1 billion is down modestly from the second quarter despite good operating income due to realized and the unrealized losses on (inaudible) and foreign currency translation adjustments reflected in other comprehensive income, plus the impact of dividends to stockholders and share repurchases. However, book value per share is up slightly to $113.26 reflecting the fact that we had share repurchases of 597,000 shares during the quarter, amounting to $47 million or an average price of $78 per share. After the quarter closed, we settled on additional 105,000 shares or $8 million or an average price of $78.57, which is not reflected in the third quarter financials. Our capital position remains in excess of what we need to support the portfolio on a model basis. That position has served us well particularly in a year like this for the industry. While we intend to maintain some level of excess capital for market events and opportunities, we are still committed to continued share repurchases in the absence of new opportunities. Thank you and I will turn it back to Beth for Q&A.
Beth Farrell: Patrica, we are now open for questions and answers.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we’ll go to Jay Gelb with Barclays Capital.
Jay Gelb – Barclays Capital: Thank you. Can you give us a sense of what drove the reserve strengthening in the U. S. insurance segment in the last quarter?
Dom Addesso: Sure, Jay. Overall we generally wait until the fourth quarter reserve studies unless our interim metrics point us to something else. This year, we’ve seen some unusual large losses on the insurance side, which indicated a need for strengthening. If we see that this in our metrics, we should not and do not wait for the reserve study. Similarly, on the reinsurance side, each quarter our metrics have been improving. This was also the case last year. And therefore given that our overall metrics still point to total adequacy it was we felt it appropriate to re-bucket certain reserves, but clearly the internal metrics pointed us to needing some reserve additions on the insurance side.
Jay Gelb – Barclays Capital: What lines were it in particular?
Dom Addesso: Work comp and excess casualty.
Jay Gelb – Barclays Capital: Okay.
Dom Addesso: Mostly excess casualty.
Jay Gelb – Barclays Capital: Do you expect that…
Dom Addesso: With – pardon?
Jay Gelb – Barclays Capital: I’m sorry. Go ahead.
Dom Addesso: No, I was going to say that which is a turnabout from last year where we actually the – our reserve study work actually indicated some slight redundancies in our excess casualty book. So it’s just something that emerged this year.
Jay Gelb – Barclays Capital: Would it be unreasonable to expect some further reserve strengthening in 4Q then?
Dom Addesso: We really can’t say which way that will go in the fourth quarter. We have our reserve studies. Like as I said, we reacted to what we saw emerge in the third quarter and obviously we took that action but it’s too early to say what our reserve studies will come up with.
Jay Gelb – Barclays Capital: Okay. And then turning to the investment portfolio, we were anticipating instead of showing profits in the partnership income in the net investment income line, given what happened with hedge funds and private equity and the third quarter might actually be flat to down. So what drove that in 3Q and what should we put in there for 4Q?
Dom Addesso: I don’t know what you should put in there for 4Q and we’d not dare an estimate on that. As you know that, Jay, that can be very volatile. It is on a quarter lag relative and most many of the limited partnerships use the equity markets as a basis for providing their fair values or estimated values. In our particular case, we’ve also had some particular individual limited partnerships that had some unique transactions that led to gains. Kinder Morgan, for example, was one of those, that was a very positive outcome for us.
Jay Gelb – Barclays Capital: So the – for the mark – given the one quarter lag then based on the equity market performance of 3Q, would it be reasonable to expect a loss in 4Q?
Dom Addesso: As I said, that’s your business, not my business.
Jay Gelb – Barclays Capital: Okay. But that would be – that would run through the partnership income line, right, not just derivative realized.
Dom Addesso: Correct. Correct.
Jay Gelb – Barclays Capital: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.
Joshua Shanker – Deutsche Bank: Yeah, good morning, everyone.
Joe Taranto: Good morning.
Dom Addesso: Good morning, Josh.
Joshua Shanker – Deutsche Bank: A couple of questions. Historically obviously workers’ comp has been an important part of your business and a lot of that business that competed away a few years back. Would you be more aggressive given the market trend? Where do you see the business that you lost in the past? How do you think that’s performing now and how do you look at your own book today?
Joe Taranto: Well, as you know, we have a long history in the comp market getting into it in a small way in 2001 and then building it a very big way through 2003, ‘04 and ‘05. Yes, subsequent to that, our book – we took it down in part because we did lose some business, but in part because rates started to come down at that point. So we’re still an important player in the market probably doing about $200 million worth of business, but that is down from what was once $900 million. When the market hit its peak in 2004 and ‘05, we were very pleased with the business with reforms going in rates going up and of course that business led to outrageously wonderful results. Today, it’s not quite that. We’re pleased with 15% rate increases that we’re currently getting that kind of comes on top of rate increases of 9-ish percent last year. So the market is certainly taking a favorable turn, keeping in mind some of that rate is needed to cover medical inflation, if we don’t look at it like we looked at the business in 2004 where it was fantastic. We look at it as if it’s okay today and we’d like to see rate increases continue to build. If that’s the case, we may look to grow the book some more than what we’re currently thinking, but right now we are a bit cautious and I think we’re pushing for more rate as opposed to more business and of course these things work against one another. The more rate you push for, the less business that you do to some degree. So well, I’m sorry, in short, we’re pleased with the book, the direction, the rate increase and we expect next year to be a good year in that market and we may grow some and it may be even more than that depending upon how the rest of the market reacts in terms of joining us in rate increases.
Joshua Shanker – Deutsche Bank: When you say next year is going to be a New Year on a written or an earned basis?
Joe Taranto: Well, I guess, I talk of written premium. At least that’s what I’m thinking what we actually put on the books next year.
Joshua Shanker – Deutsche Bank: Yeah. And do you think given a call it, risk-free rate of 3.5% on the 10-year, 3% on the 10-year that that it’s an attractive market overall for the industry or particularly for Everest?
Joe Taranto: Well, the interest rate, you’re getting into the investment income aspect and it certainly is that it’s casualty business, there is a tail on it, but we toast that to the side to some degree even though it does figure into ROE models. We have more old school and warning to achieve an underwriting profit on this business. I do believe at the current rates it generates a fair rate of return, but as I said, we’re looking it for to increase so we can be even more confident in the business. It’s still casualty business that once you write it, it takes a few years to play out before exactly where it’s at, so you need to be paid for them.
Joshua Shanker – Deutsche Bank: Understood. And finally, on the derivative, if I’m not mistaken, the liability for equity puts is about equal to where it was in 1Q09. I just like to run through a little bit of how that’s calculated a little bit, it's not severe, but I would be surprised that it would be that high today given the markets rallied about 45% since that time.
Joe Taranto: Let me tackle it, and Dom, you may want to add to it. We have a bit of a black box formula that we follow to come up with that valuation. And even though these deals at the end of the day will be determined strictly on stock market price and we’re confident that we’ll do well on these deals. The interim evaluation, the quarterly evaluation, the two most critical components are one is stock market price, but the other is interest rate. Even though that doesn’t figure into the final resolution of these, it’s kind of a discounted Black Scholes type model that’s being used, so with interest rates and the key builds in particularly going down pretty dramatically for the quarter and for that period of time that you’re talking about that’s had an impact on the estimates, if you will, even though it has no real impact on the ultimate resolution. With the market up pretty strong through October if it just stays the same, clearly and interest rates are up a bit too, as Dom noted, this will swing the other way in the fourth quarter.
Joshua Shanker – Deutsche Bank: All right. Thank you very much.
Dom Addesso: You’re welcome.
Operator: Brian Meredith with UBS.
Brian Meredith – UBS: Yeah, good morning. A couple of things here for you. First of them, Dom, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about what trends you’re actually were seeing in the excess liability business that resulted in the adverse development?
Dom Addesso: I wouldn’t particularly call it a trend as much as it was higher than expected number of large losses.
Brian Meredith – UBS: Okay. Great. And then the next question, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about your comments about the attritional combined ratio in the quarter and I think you said part of it’s because you’re – you went to more property cat excess of loss versus primary property. Does that mean that going forward we’ll also likely to see maybe higher catastrophe losses?
Dom Addesso: No, because the business that – the shift in business from pro rata to cat XOL was done with basically the same P&Ls. So the expected loss would be approximately the same and that’s just obviously a modeled number, but obviously what’s happening in the attritional is essentially if you have no cats, the XOL is booked at zero, right, but you still have in the pro rata book, you still have some underlying attritional normal loss ratio.
Joe Taranto: And much of the growth in the XOL premium is rate increase.
Dom Addesso: Right.
Brian Meredith – UBS: Got you. And then I guess, because of that shift also should we expect that you’ll have some pressure on top line?
Joe Taranto: Well, I wouldn’t call it pressure, but you’re right, Brian, pro rata pound for pound does give you more top line than XOL. So generally speaking, that trend means we won’t be building top line as fast but clearly the goal here is to focus on the bottom line.
Brian Meredith – UBS: Right, right. Terrific, thank you.
Dom Addesso:

Operator: Greg Locraft, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney.
Gregory Locraft – Morgan Stanley Smith Barney: Hi, good morning. I actually missed the opening comments, Joe, because I was on another call, so if you mentioned this, please just I can review the transcript. But can you go kind of through each of the lines and give us at a broad brush sort of where pricing is and where loss trend is?
Joe Taranto: Yeah, I think you’re probably more looking at the insurance side than the reinsurance side, Greg.
Gregory Locraft – Morgan Stanley Smith Barney: Well I’d love, I guess, pricing color on reinsurance, but, yes.
Joe Taranto: All right, let me give you some overall commentary, because I know – there’s been a lot of discussion, particularly this quarter about pricing. It’s clearly we’ve seen a broad effort by many insurance companies to draw a line in the sand and stop rates from declining and in fact get rates rising. I think this recent quarter showed more success in this effort than we’ve seen in prior quarters. We had mentioned in the opening that we continue in our insurance book to see some pockets certainly responding, California workers comp in the third quarter, we continue to give rate increases that averaged 15%. Our general liability primary rates third quarter, we saw 9% rate increase, which was up pretty significantly from the prior quarter. Our insurance rates, the property rates were up only order of 3% for the quarter, which is okay, but more is needed. Other areas didn’t respond as well. For example, the D&O on the commercial umbrella space I think continues to be flat at best and as in need of some rate increase. So, I’m not particularly forecasting a hard market. Although I certainly hope that that what’s coming before too long. In 2001, we did feel as if it was coming and we increased our market share in many areas. Now our strategy would be kind of to selectively increase where we believe rate to exposure will be quite good, but selectively decreased where we think rates to exposures aren’t quite what they need to be. So, I think it’s good that latest trend is a beneficial, will broaden the opportunities upward corrections are overall helpful, but I don’t particularly expect this to the snowball. Taking that from the insurance side to the reinsurance rates side, I think the biggest issue, the biggest event that’s happened is a property cat rates being up and response to all the losses that we’ve had in last year and a half. And we see that correction continuing into January and beyond, I noted that I thought retro rates will be up 15%. Cat rates, if you didn’t have a loss in 2011 up 5-ish percent and if you did have a loss in 2011 and then you’re coming up in January like many accounts into Australia, New Zealand and many of the U.S. regional accounts, you’ll be facing some meaningful rate increases. So I still think from a reinsurance point of view, likely our book will push into more property given the dynamics. The overall casualty market, I don’t see reinsurance rates changing particularly for reinsurers and when you get to underneath it some of the areas that are most supported by reinsurers D&O commercial umbrella because they require big limits and have a lot of volatility, they’re not moving just yet as they need to be. So Greg, hopefully that answers your question.
Gregory Locraft – Morgan Stanley Smith Barney: That’s perfect, Joe. And I guess some leaders of the company have been opining that this looks a lot like a 2000 timeframe. Do you – do you echo those comments? It sounds like you’re more conservative quite frankly based on the commentary?
Joe Taranto: I think you can take away than more conservative. But what I think won’t matter in terms of what really happens at the end of the day, so yes, I think I’m happy that things have taken a positive change and I hope it continues. But, in terms of anything getting back to what happened in 2000 to 2003 and 2004, I don’t feel anything that extreme is going to happen.
Gregory Locraft – Morgan Stanley Smith Barney: Okay, excellent. Thanks again for the color.
Joe Taranto: You’re welcome.
Operator: Vinay Misquith with Evercore Partners.
Vinay Misquith – Evercore Partners: Hi, good morning. The first question is on your capacity to grow your property cat. I believe you mentioned that your PMLs are flat, so if you could please remind us about your PMLs and how much you can grow on 1:1 please?
Dom Addesso: Remind you of what Vinay?
Vinay Misquith – Evercore Partners: PMLs?
Dom Addesso: For which territory?
Vinay Misquith – Evercore Partners: For your peak territories?
Dom Addesso: Okay. Florida, for example, would be our peak territory, which is 940, but on economic basis it would be $640 million.
Vinay Misquith – Evercore Partners: Okay. That’s great. And do you have a significant amount of capacity to grow that business on 1:1?
Joe Taranto: Yeah. We’re trying – our plan right now is to not row the PMLs in the major zones. Now that doesn’t mean that we won’t write more business, because we may write in zones that aren’t in the major zones, we might write second, third loss. We may write in some of the U.S. regions. We haven’t been big in the regional space and now we believe rates will be going up and it may offer better opportunity. So there may be some opportunity for what I’ll call sideways growth.
Vinay Misquith – Evercore Partners: Okay. That’s fair enough. Second, if you could remind us what the dollar value of your excess capital is, you had in the past disclose that number?
Dom Addesso: We are – and I will answer this in the context of what I’d say is excess, excess. And by that I mean that which we think about in terms of our share repurchase program. And we’d like to think about it as about approximately a $500 million number.
Vinay Misquith – Evercore Partners: Okay, that’s great. And then just one last one. This question, did you mention that you had about $35 million of prior quarter favorable reserve development this quarter?
Dom Addesso: Prior year development? No, we have – the $35 million I was mentioning was a reduction in our provisions for small caps, those caps that are less than $10 million in losses. Is that…
Vinay Misquith – Evercore Partners: So that’s prior quarter – sorry, go ahead.
Dom Addesso: Is that the 35 that you’re referring to?
Vinay Misquith – Evercore Partners: Yes. So that’s not a prior year development. That’s a prior quarter development, correct?
Dom Addesso: No. Correct.
Vinay Misquith – Evercore Partners: Okay. That’s great. Thank you.
Operator: Matthew Heimermann with JPMorgan.
Matthew Heimermann – JPMorgan: Hi, good morning.
Dom Addesso: Good morning, Matt.
Matthew Heimermann – JPMorgan: Good morning. Couple of questions. First, just maybe, Joe, could you give us – I just be curious kind of your conviction around some of the comments you have on reinsurance pricing specifically because it feels like some of the market town and commentary has softened a bit since Monte Carlo?
Joe Taranto: Sure. I mean, the reality is we’ll see what happens at 1:1, but I think let me go back three spaces, the convictions I had for June and July, I think those pretty much came to pass. And much of what I say in terms of where I expect rates to go is where we’re looking for it to go, where we think it should go and where we will be proactive in trying to make it go. Now, this is pretty simple. A lot of this is based on the last 18 months worth of catastrophe losses and if my competitors are saying something different. I don’t think they’re paying attention to what’s happened in the last 18 months. So now you will have some regional companies coming up that had some pretty good losses at 1:1. You will have some New Zealand, Australian companies coming up that have had mega losses and they’re coming up for the first time since those losses in 1:1. You will have retro business, which has continued to percolate as more losses have gone up in Japan and Australia, those have gone into increasing losses in the retro space and so to me that heightens what the price should be going forward. So I feel it will happen and certainly we’ll be looking to do our part. If it doesn’t measure up to that, we’ll do less, but you now have at least the logic which I think is pretty clear and evident as to why I think that’s the case.
Matthew Heimermann – JPMorgan: Okay. That’s fair. And then with the shift to XOL versus from pro rata, can you give us a sense of what layers you’re – what layers that shift constitutes within XOL structures whether that’s generally by zone if that’s the easiest way to do it?
Dom Addesso: That level of detail, Matt, we really wouldn’t have for this call.
Joe Taranto: We’ll get back to you with color on that, Matt.
Matthew Heimermann – JPMorgan: That’s fair. And I guess maybe as you think about it, I’d just be curious kind of thinking about kind of shorter return periods versus than what you normally would disclose in your SEC filings. I guess the other question is just a numbers question on the reinstatements, if you could just give us those figures by segment?
Dom Addesso: Well I can give you those figures overall. For the quarter, we’ve had $13 million of reinstatement premiums. On a year-to-date basis, just shy of $54 million and obviously that’s all in the reinsurance segment. Give me a second here, I can – Bermuda was most of the third quarter number, 12.5. On the year-to-date, we got…
Matthew Heimermann – JPMorgan: Okay, I’ve got the rest of them from prior quarters, so that’s fine. I just wanted to make sure that this quarter I had it right, okay. And then just a follow-up on your comment on the underlying loss ratio, so did I hear you right there was a $35 million benefit from lower – effectively lower RBNI provisions, IBNR, excuse me, provisions in the current quarter?
Dom Addesso: Yeah. In other words, we looked at the small cat events those less than $10 million that occurred during the year and we’ve looked at the reserves we were carrying through the first two quarters and the third quarter against the actual results and we’ve had $35 million of excess reserves relative to those smaller cat event and also realized that that will be positively impacted. The provisions for small cat events by definition go down again and it’s a shift into an XOL versus pro rata. The provision for small cats is more relevant when you have a larger pro rata book.
Matthew Heimermann – JPMorgan: That makes sense. Going – when we think about this going forward, is it fair to – should we expect some seasonality then as we look into next year and years beyond that on a quarterly basis with potentially more favorable back half IBNR or lower IBNR provisions in the back half assuming that either activity is wide or you don’t see upward push to the events you do book are linear?
Dom Addesso: Well, I don’t know that I’d go put it quite that way. First of all, there is seasonality for certain types of cats, but there obviously is no season for earthquake events, but you have to keep that in mind. Secondly, again, as we shift more towards the XOL and that becomes a bigger proportion of our cat premium, then the provision that we put up for small cat events in that in each quarter would be less. I don’t know if that helps.
Matthew Heimermann – JPMorgan: I – I might follow-up, but that gives me a sense. Thanks
Dom Addesso: Okay.
Operator: Our final question Ian Gutterman with Adage Capital.
Ian Gutterman – Adage Capital: Hi, guys. I guess, first Dom, on a crop you mentioned write a loss due to some start-up cost and such, can you quantify how much that is?
Dom Addesso: Our start-up cost that we’ve included in this year-to-date results approximate $6 million somewhere in that range.
Ian Gutterman – Adage Capital: Or was that be on the combined?
Dom Addesso: That would be in the combined, yes.
Ian Gutterman – Adage Capital: And so how many points on the combined, I’m not sure what that net premium is?
Dom Addesso: The premiums for the crop year-to-date, give me a second, about $120 million.
Ian Gutterman – Adage Capital: Got it. Okay.
Joe Taranto: And those will be one-time events Ian. So they won’t repeat next year.
Ian Gutterman – Adage Capital: Okay, right. I was just trying to get a sense of what sort of the core was, because I guess, I thought outside Texas and maybe I’m not familiar with your geographies, but thought outside Texas come out to be a pretty close to normal crop year?
Joe Taranto: Well we had some very hot weather during the summer over 100 degrees for an extended period of time in the Midwest and the Northern part, if you will, that affected the corn crop quite considerably. So that’s kind of what, in addition to the other things.
Dom Addesso: And we won’t, realistically, we’re not going to know obviously it’s a function of not only yield, but also commodity prices, so we’re really not going to know the true results of that until February, but given those drought conditions, we felt that prudent to just add something to our reserves for that potential outcome.
Ian Gutterman – Adage Capital: Okay, got it.
Dom Addesso: It could work back to be a more positive result.
Ian Gutterman – Adage Capital: Okay. So I was wondering because [indiscernible] the people I talked to it sounds like the harvest was going pretty good so far, so there was something I missed. The other area is when you talked about growing your property book, but without raising your PMLs, I know you mentioned the regional contracts, Joe, but outside that, I mean that kind of implies growing in non-peak zones, like international and places like that, is that where the growth is coming from?
Joe Taranto: Well, I don’t know that there will be, how much of expansion there will be, but I think it might more mean second event, third event, things of that nature because when we talk about PMLs, it’s for the one major event.
Ian Gutterman – Adage Capital: Okay. So it’s – got it, I just want to make sure you weren’t going into the lower ROE prices overseas stuff.
Dom Addesso: No, in fact our – you would note that our – through our Bermuda segment, which has been generally trending down of late that’s due to backing away from some of the European exposures.
Ian Gutterman – Adage Capital: Got it. Okay. So basically the growth will be in sort of low ROL type business, but hopefully high ROE?
Dom Addesso: In part.
Joe Taranto: I’d say in part. Yeah.
Ian Gutterman – Adage Capital: Got it. Okay. And then just my last one is, Dom, any update on when we can see triangles? Someone had to ask, so...
Dom Addesso: That’s fine. We do have the work done. It’s being – as I might have mentioned previously, we’re having an outside third party take a look at that work, so it’s – I’ll just say it’s soon. It’s certainly before the year end, but I’m hoping well before that.
Ian Gutterman – Adage Capital: All right, great. Look forward to it. Thank you.
Operator: And there are no further questions.
Beth Farrell: Okay. We’d like to thank everybody for participating on the call. Thank you.
Operator: And that concludes today’s conference. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day everyone, welcome to the Everest Re Group Limited Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Call. Today’s conference is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to Beth Farrell. Please go ahead ma’am.
Elizabeth B. Farrell:  Thank you, Jessica. Good morning and welcome to Everest Re Group’s second quarter 2011 earnings conference call. With me today are Joe Taranto, the company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Dom Addesso, our President and Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard I know such statements made during today’s call which are forward-looking in nature, such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations and the like are subject to various risks. As you know actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations. Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements. Now, let me turn the call over to Joe.
Joseph V. Taranto: Good morning, thank you Beth. For the first six months of this year the industry and for that matter of the world as experience catastrophes on a scale never seen before. Neither history nor any models could have forecasted the devastation experience. Despite these events Everest has maintained its extremely strong capital position. Shareholders equity at the end of June is $6.2 billion or 2% down from the $6.3 billion at December 31st, 2010. Despite second quarter catastrophes, Everest earned $134 million in operating earnings for an annualized ROE of 9.5%. And in the quarter, we increased capital by $238 million or 4%. Given these events, property catastrophe prices have gone up and we are achieving higher risk adjusted returns. While some parts of the property and casualty market are seeing upward rate corrections other parts are not. Our approach is to continue to be disciplined and only right business at proper prices. This has led and will continue to lead to shifts in our business composite. I am pleased with the underwriting portfolio that we have constructed through the most recent renewal cycles. And I believe we are positioned to do well despite a challenging marketplace. Let me take you through some of these underwriting particulars. First let’s begin with our insurances operation. Insurance business is roughly 25% of our overall business. A couple of years back, it was mostly casualty business much return through MGAs. Today it has a significant short tail specialty component led by Heartland our Crop Insurance Company and a growing majority of our business is written directly. About one third of our business is property or crop business, which is running quite well for the first six months even though parts of the country have experienced severe weather. We expect our premium from crop business to continue to grow into 2012 and 2013. Roughly another third of our business is workers comp, mostly California workers comp. Through June, we have achieved an overall rate increase of 15% and this is on top of a 9% rate increase we had achieved in 2010. This is the only pocket of casualty business where meaningful increases are being achieved. We have been in the market for many years and have an experienced team that is focused on achieving an underwriting profit. Another 15-ish percent of our book is our special casualty business written out of New York and Canada, this is primarily D&O for financial institutions. We stated this unit in 2008 when there was a tremendous market need. Our team has generated great results in the last 2.5 years. Unfortunately this market has recently become more competitive. Many having short memories of the 2008 financial chaos, still we will be disciplined and I expect we will continue to perform quite well. The remaining 20% of our book is general casualty, rates continue to flat at best. We have greatly reduced this book in response to market conditions and will continue to do so if the market does not improve. In total, our insurance operation booked an underwriting profit for the quarter, albeit a small one, at 99 combined. Nonetheless, I believe we are positioned to continue do well despite the challenging market as we remain disciplined, growing in areas where we can profit and reducing in areas where we cannot. Turning to our reinsurance operations; for our U.S. book, we continue to reduce our casualty business as we stayed focus on an underwriting profit. We are largely down to a core group of clients, so we believe we’ll be disciplined themselves. On the property side, we were very pleased with the June Florida renewals. Catastrophe excess loss coverage experienced rate increase between 10% and 15%. We also achieved improvements on our pro rata deals and underlying insurance rates are finally being allowed to increase by the Department of Insurance. Our plan was more rates, more premiums, bigger upside and yet not growing our PML or downside. I’m pleased that we have fully achieved our plan. Moving to our specialty book, which includes marine aviation surety and accidents and health, our position in marine and aviation remains quite small as we find minimal opportunities today. Although the recent BP loss and Griffin loss should create some opportunities going forward in the energy sector. Surety is the steady book for us, but not growing given the lack of construction in the US. Our biggest division is accidents and health and our main product is our medical stop loss. Our dedicated unit has done an outstanding job of achieving an underwriting profit. We believe we will be able to continue to expand our writings in this sector especially as the new healthcare bill increases the need for this product. For our international book, which is mainly property business well spread around the world, on 71 business, catastrophe business we achieved modest rate increase perhaps on the order of 5-ish percent for countries that did not experience losses. Of course, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, in those areas significant increases were achieved. Once again, our plan was more upside with no additional PML or downside. In fact, our PMLs for the bigger peak zones were lower. We continue to see growth opportunities in newer areas including Brazil and China. Our Bermuda operation includes our UK and Continental European business as well as business written out of Bermuda. This sector have little business that actually comes up with 71. Much of our retro business is written out of Bermuda. We continue to have ample capacity for one-one renewals and continue to believe that prices will be considerably higher. Summarizing, we are prepared to modify our book as its necessary in response to market conditions. Our well-established global franchise continues to provide access to the best opportunities. Our staff continues to focus on future profits. We are not just sitting back and waiting for some broad market change. Last but not least, a few months ago, the Board initiated a search for a new Present. Discussions were held with a number of high-quality executives and the best candidates, namely Dom Addesso was chosen. Dom has valuable experience both on the financial and operational side for our industry. He has helped Everest considerably as CFO. And we have chosen to broaden his role, so we can help us even more. A search for our new CFO is underway. Dom will remain CFO until that position is filled and then he will move more fully to the operational side. John Doucette has been promoted to Chief Underwriting Officer for Worldwide Reinsurance. Likewise, given the great job that John has already done for Everest, we were keen to expand his role, so we could benefit more broadly. My personal congratulations to Dom and John. Now, Dom will take you through the financials.
Dominic J. Addesso: Thank you, Joe and good morning. The net income for the quarter of $2.41 per diluted share was as previously announced reduced by catastrophe losses. This loss is net of reinstatement premiums and taxes amounted to $90 million in the quarter or $1.65 per share and included losses from events that occurred in both the first and second quarters. This amount is slightly above the pre-announced levels due to a late report from one client that indicated significantly higher losses for the first quarter New Zealand earthquake event. The net pre-tax catastrophe loss estimate included $55 million of strengthening on first quarter events, primarily due to the New Zealand earthquake and $58 million were second quarter events, largely resulting from the Midwest tornados. As previously announced, we do not expect the third earthquake in New Zealand to be greater than $10 million, which is our catastrophe loss threshold. And therefore, this event would be absorbed into attritional losses. Despite these catastrophe losses, the combined ratios stood at 98% for the quarter, eliminating the effects of prior year development catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums, the attritional loss ratio and combined ratio were 59.7% and 87.2% respectively. These attritional ratios are consistent with the prior year and with improvements in pricing, terms and conditions on the renewal book, it reflects our conservative reserving posture for the current year. The variance in the commission ratio quarter-over-quarter was driven by the impact of reinstatement premiums on the calculations. On a year-to-date basis, it is in line. With respect to our prior accident year loss position, the quarter included favorable development of two tenths of a point on a combined ratio. Our internal interim reserving metrics remained quite favorable. Premiums for the quarter and year-to-date were down slightly over the prior year. The reinsurance segments overall were down primarily due to non-renewed US casualty business as a result of continued competitive market conditions. Property reinsurance was also down as we repositioned our book in catastrophe exposed zones. The Insurance segment however was up as new business ventures we entered into mainly the acquisition of Heartland provided for growth in the sector. With respect to results by segment I will start with insurance which reported a 99.2% combined ratio, compared to 105.7% in last year’s second quarter and a 102.8% in the first quarter of this year. These improvements are driven by the strategic portfolio changes beginning to take hold with growth in our crop insurance California DIC and the D&O book. Workers compensation is still being booked at a conservative level above 100 combined but we fully expect this to improve as continuing rate increases over the last 18 months as referenced by Joe Taranto. Within the US reinsurance segment results were impacted by the second quarter cat losses specifically the Midwest Tornados resulting in a reported combined ratio 105.5%. In future quarters we expect 3D property to benefit from improved terms particularly as it relates to the most recent Florida renewals. 3D casualty remains at an underwriting profit with a 98.9% combined ratio. Although as mentioned previously on a declining premium base the soft market conditions persist here. In the Specialty segment it was overall a positive quarter at a 98 combined ratio despite marine, and aviation running at a 114% due to the (inaudible) energy loss. The overall results were high by positive results in A&H and surety at a 91.6% and an 87.2% combined ratio respectively. A&H is the largest line within the segment at $70 million of gross premium writings year-to-date up over 18% for the year as a result of new initiatives in the primary medical stop loss product. The International segment had a 95.3% combined ratio for the quarter despite 18 points or $58 million of cat losses. Rate increases beginning last year in Latin America and continuing into this year in Australia, New Zealand and Japan are likely to lead to more positive attritional results. And finally the Bermuda segment had a profitable quarter with a 91.5% combined ratio as this segment had a relatively modest impact from cat losses in the quarter. On the investment income front, we continue to feel the impact of lower reinvestment rates as net investment income is down 4% or $7 million quarter-over-quarter. Over the last 12 months there have been sales calls and maturities in our fixed income investments totaling $2.5 billion to the book yield of 4.8%. During that time $2.1 billion was reinvested in fixed income securities at a book yield of 3.7% for difference in yield of 1.1%. Remaining funds were reinvested in emerging market debt and equity with an emphasis on dividends as we seek to offset some of this loss yield. This is also done with a bias towards continuing to shorten the duration of our portfolio as well as maintain an overall credit quality of AA or better. With respect to credit risk it should be noted in the beginning last year we eliminated our exposure to Portugal, Ireland and Greece sovereign bonds and have reduced our holdings in Spain and Italy sovereigns. In addition we have reviewed our holdings of European banks for their exposures to sovereign debt to minimize default risk related to the debt crisis of the European countries. Realized losses for the quarter mainly relate to the sales of municipal bonds as we completed our repositioning of that sector. Turning to some miscellaneous items which include other expense for the quarter of 13 million which was primarily foreign exchange related losses. And was a small derivative loss on the equity put contracts driven by interest rates and the indices. The combined effect of all these activities resulted in net income for the quarter of a $131 million. Add to that after-tax unrealized gains in our bond portfolio of $112 million and a translation gain of a $11 million provided for $254 million of total comprehensive income. As a result shareholders equity rose to $6.2 billion at June 30 from $5.9 billion at March 31. Although at this level it is slightly below the $6.3 billion at year end. This decline in GAAP equity was a result of the net loss for the first six months of the year plus share repurchase in the first quarter and dividends paid to date. On a per share basis, our book values stands at $113.21 compared to $109.07 at March 31. Our continued strong and growing capital account positions us well for potential business opportunities. I will now turn it back to Beth for Q&A. Thank you.
Elizabeth B. Farrell:  Jessica, we’ll now take questions.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And we’ll take our first question from Jay Gelb with Barclays Capital.
Jay Gelb – Barclays Capital: Thank you. Good morning. Could you give us a bit more clarity on the decline in premium volume for the US reinsurance and international book and whether you see more of a shift towards short-tail lines?
Dominic J. Addesso: In terms of color commentary, we've had the US reinsurance base and our overall premium is down in part due to crock reinsurance being down on year-to-date basis as we transition that book into the insurance space. In addition, our treaty property premium again, US reinsurance has shifted dramatically to more of an XOL position. So year-over-year our XOL premium is up approximately 20%. And on the international space…
Joseph V. Taranto: We’ve been – really about the casualty component for the US.
Dominic J. Addesso: And the casualty was down $15 million on a year-to-date basis for US reinsurance reasons that we sited earlier. Does that address your US reinsurance questions or treaty property and or treaty property?
Jay Gelb – Barclays Capital: Yes.
Dominic J. Addesso: Before we get into international. On the international side, we – our premium is down slightly particularly in our catastrophe exposed areas, but our PML is down dramatically in many of those zones and rate increases as Joe had mentioned earlier, in the international space, our – in the cat expo in the places where the losses, rates are up 20% to 40% in the loss free zones rates are up anywhere from 5% to 10%, most of the rate increases as it relates to Japan because of the expansion of many of those contracts will really not like to be realized until 71.
Jay Gelb – Barclays Capital: Okay.
Dominic J. Addesso: Follow-up there?
Jay Gelb – Barclays Capital: No. Next issue would be on RMS, what's your expectation in terms of what the impact is to your PMLs and excess capital position and what in turn could that mean for share buybacks going forward?
Joseph V. Taranto:
 :
Jay Gelb – Barclays Capital: Great. And then just on the follow-up on share buybacks thoughts going forward?
Joseph V. Taranto: Well our plans remains for hurricane season to not to be buying anything back. but candidly, we're quite keen after that to and all likelihood get back to doing some meaningful buyback unless they have some overwhelming business opportunities in the market at that point.
Jay Gelb – Barclays Capital: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Matthew Heimermann with JPMorgan.
Matthew Heimermann – JPMorgan: Hi, good morning everybody. 
Dominic J. Addesso: Good morning.
Matthew Heimermann – JPMorgan: A couple of questions, one Dom, would you might just quantifying or providing a little bit more detail with respect to the US reinsurance just maybe give us a sense of what crop was last year and maybe what the year-to-date drop looks like, just so we can better model that. And then also just maybe give us a sense of – on the treaty property side just what pro rata property premiums, how they're changing in the quarter too, just to get a sense of kind of beginning and the end there?
Dominic J. Addesso:  Well, our crop insurance business is down $21 million year-to-date. Is that which we are looking for there?
Matthew Heimermann – JPMorgan: Yes that's helpful. And what – can you remind us what it was in total last year?
Dominic J. Addesso: Last year, our crop business year-to-date was $22.5 million.
Matthew Heimermann – JPMorgan: Okay. All right, perfect.
Dominic J. Addesso: Okay. And I’m sorry what was the second question?
Matthew Heimermann – JPMorgan: The other one was just – you gave us a sense of what the XOL premiums are up, but obviously, XOL consumes a lot more PML per dollar premium than pro rata. So just was curious how the pro rata was changing, because I would suspect that was down decently to kind of get the overall numbers to work out.
Dominic J. Addesso: Yes, our pro rata premium was down year-over-year, year-to-date basis close to $200 million on premium.
Matthew Heimermann – JPMorgan:  Okay.
Joseph V. Taranto: Matt, let me throw in looking forward. You know my sense when we look out the next year lets say, July 1 of this year into next. We will do more property premium than we did on a worldwide basis both in the US and on a worldwide basis than we did taking July backwards for a year, and this is just on the back of rate increase in some additional opportunities that some of which came up in June and July, but I think more will present themselves as the year goes on. But may be more importantly in terms of expected profit I just see the risk dynamic on both the pro rata that we’re doing and on the XOL that we’re doing much more favorable going forward, and in terms of expected ROEs and just premium and upside, downside analysis it does provide us for I think a better expected number. So I do think premiums will be up going forward, but again, the most important thing is the expected profit dynamics looks very good going forward.
Dominic J. Addesso: Now let me also add to that to not confuse the issue, the premium number that I sited that was down includes both property and casualty. All right.
Matthew Heimermann – JPMorgan:  The 200?
Dominic J. Addesso: Right.
Matthew Heimermann – JPMorgan:  Property and casualty in total. Okay that's helpful.
Joseph V. Taranto: And then on the [guarantee] side I would add on that and that’s a little buffer to predict, but you can hear that we’re not bullish on that we’ve cut back quite a bit and unless the market has a meaningful change I don’t expect that would be up in the coming year.
Matthew Heimermann – JPMorgan: That's fair and I don't think that really is all that surprising of a comment given the market back up I guess. In terms of the, can you give us a sense of geographically in the states where you made the biggest shift from pro rata to XOL?
Dominic J. Addesso: Well it happened; the predominant change was in North Carolina.
Joseph V. Taranto: And Texas goes the other way.
Matthew Heimermann – JPMorgan:  All right. That's helpful. And then, just with respect to, and I apologize these are a little bit more numbers focused, but the attritional losses, you kind of suggested that there was, I think you said less than $10 million in international, which would have been related to the third earthquake. Could you just quantify in dollar terms what the marine loss was and then in the attrition in the US just so we can take some of the noise out of the numbers?
Dominic J. Addesso: While the Griffin loss, if you’re asking about that is likely to be somewhere between $15 million to $25 million to us that’s kind of the range of estimates we have around that. The $10 million that I was referencing is our cat threshold so any good loss any cat event above $10 million gets recorded as a cat loss, below that’s covered in our attritional expected loss and that is covered in our expected loss pick for attritional loss pick for the international segment. Does that, I don’t whether it answers your question.
Matthew Heimermann – JPMorgan:  No. Were there any other notable items that didn't get crossed by this cat?
Dominic J. Addesso:  No.
Matthew Heimermann – JPMorgan:  Okay. And then, I guess with respect to, and this is the last one, just when we think about Heartland and the insurance segment, is there, because right now I believe you're sill recognizing that or writing it on a reinsurance basis. And that'll switch to your own paper. It may have already switched, I guess. But is there going to be a difference in terms of just the composition of margins going forward? In other words, should we expect maybe a little bit better expense ratio performance as that starts to get written on a direct basis?
Joseph V. Taranto: It would improve slightly.
Dominic J. Addesso:  Yes, yes.
Matthew Heimermann – JPMorgan:  Okay. and then I guess last one big picture, with just the – with all of the potential consolidation going on in the sector right now, with some of the potential consolidation going on in the sector, how do you feel like that impacts your competitive position?
Joseph V. Taranto: Well, I think its probably marginally improves it you know there will be some dislocation as a result of combinations, some of it will be with regard to clients some of it will be with regard to employees and of course there is a whole lot of distraction that goes as these things take place. So we’re happy to not be distracted and we are happy to be looking at what is going on and basically trying to figure out how we can benefit from it.
Matthew Heimermann – JPMorgan:  Okay. Thank you much.
Dominic J. Addesso:  Thank you, Matt.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Cliff Gallant with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.
Cliff Gallant – Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.: Good morning.
Dominic J. Addesso: Good morning.
Cliff Gallant – Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.:  A quick question on your reserving I know that year-to-date, you've had slightly favorable development. Could you talk at all about it on an accident year basis? Are there some years where you are seeing an adverse development and offsetting with others? Just a little bit more detail in terms of what you're seeing in terms of that?
Dominic J. Addesso:  What we do in the interim periods is that we look at what we call our actual versus expected and it’s not a detailed accident year reviewed. And as I suggested in my remarks, those metrics are coming up quite favorable. We really can't answer that question specifically until we do our full reserve study near the end of the year. We do undertake a number of smaller reserve study, meaning, reserve studies on a less material segments or lines of business in these interim periods and all of those segments are performing favorably.
Cliff Gallant – Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.: Okay, thanks.
Joseph V. Taranto:  Let me expand on that and play actual for a moment. What Dom is referring to is, our reserve studies indicate the outcome of those studies is, there will be a certain amount of reported loss during the year, all accidents years combined. And then we compare what's actually coming in versus what we expected to come in, and so far, those comparisons are looking quite good for us.
Cliff Gallant – Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: And we’ll go next to question comes from the line of Gregory Locraft with Morgan Stanley.
Gregory Locraft – Morgan Stanley: Hi, thanks. I wanted to just ask a bit about the loss trend on the longer tail casualty lines. Are you seeing any kind of pickup in frequency or severity on those lines? We've been hearing from a few carriers that an inflection point may have been reached.
Dominic J. Addesso:
 :
Joseph V. Taranto: Nothing surprising.
Dominic J. Addesso: Surprising there.
Gregory Locraft – Morgan Stanley: Okay, great. And then actually again, on the loss side, again, a carrier came out on the asbestos line and took a bigger than expected charge recently. Do you have any thoughts with regards to the asbestos environment, any change in loss trend there that is worth calling out?
Dominic J. Addesso: No change from what we see on our side. Clearly, it is a complicated area in terms of claims, management claims, litigation et cetera. We’d look at that quarterly, we actually have separate reserve committee meetings on just those areas and that is still performing in within our expected tolerances as well. So nothing new that we're seeing there. We did show a small rather immaterial amount on the ANE line. This quarter as you may have noted that was not an Asbestos loss, it was an environmental loss. Frankly we haven’t seen an environment, new environmental losses reported in some time, quite some time. And so we just decided to take that new case and put it up in reserve. So that’s nothing, what you see there was not Asbestos, it was environmental.
Gregory Locraft – Morgan Stanley: Okay, great. That’s very helpful. And then last is, just thinking forward into 2012 clearly you sound like property is going to be -- is sort of where the action is. Can you help us think about how that line might unfold under different loss amounts emanating from the upcoming hurricane season? So, you know, if there's no losses in the season, how do you think it'll play out if there's an average season which is $18 billion of losses. You know, what do you think would play out? And then obviously, I think we all know what will happen if it's bigger than that.
Joseph V. Taranto: Well, I think you’ve kind of answered it already, Greg, but if there’s no losses I think you'll still see a very, very healthy market for CAT business one-one with the rates going up more modestly than they would have – if there are losses. I think the retro market even if there are no hurricane losses, we’ll still see meaningful rate increases over what it was written at a year ago. So we are more bullish on the property side, retro, Florida, other places around the world. Now, we're still pushing for the best terms and conditions and rates and we still recognize that this as volatile business, just look back the last year and a half, there’s a reason rates are up. And I think we’ve pushed as hard as anyone to get the best terms that we can. But we are pleased that there is more to operate with on the property side. We’re also pleased with some of the other things that are going on, the California comp responding, crop business doing well for us so far than medical stop loss. So it’s a mix back still casualty is not where I’d like it to be. But overall, feel much better about things than a few months ago.
Gregory Locraft – Morgan Stanley: Okay, great. And then if it's just an average year, Joe, how do you think it might play out? There is never an average.
Joseph V. Taranto: Even an average year is going to amp up changes. You take their $18 million and that maybe average and that may mean that you still make money your Florida accounts, because you’ve charged that and then something. But I think there is the psychological part as well as the economic part, which is just what’s going on in the world, how much do we rely on history, which didn’t have four major earthquakes happening and year and a half? How much do we rely on models that cannot contemplate everything? I think a lot of people are saying, let’s be very pragmatic about this, and realize that this is a cover that is much needed, it has a lot of volatility and my gut instinct is I don’t care what model say, we did more rate. So I think that whole notion will be filled by even unexpected amount of losses in Florida.
Gregory Locraft – Morgan Stanley: Great thanks.
Operator: And will go next to Brian Meredith with UBS
Brian Meredith – UBS: Yeah good morning. A couple of quick questions here for you, first just on – understand little bit. Is there going to be some seasonality that the premium pattern coming through on insurance business on that one.
Dominic J. Addesso: I don’t believe so I mean there should be I mean the seasonality to the way that premium comes on the books.
Brian Meredith – UBS: Right.
Dominic J. Addesso: Our earnings pattern would moderate that.
Brian Meredith – UBS:  Okay. So you don't earn it with kind of exposure?
Dominic J. Addesso: No.
Brian Meredith – UBS:  Okay. And then second question, Joe, just curious, on the property retro business, I understand your reason for optimism that things could potentially get better here for that marketplace, but to what extent do the capital markets kind of limit pricing and maybe your ability to do deals in that business given the impact of capital markets and the property retro market?
Joseph V. Taranto: Well, they are part of the supply and so they are a factor but even then I have seen some announcements for some new players coming in or some new capital coming in it really does not feel like it’s a whole lot right now relative to what I expect the demand debate. Of course all these new players coming in they want higher rates than last year or two, which is not like they want lower rates. So I just don’t think it is going to modify the market all that much plus I think there will be some very good demand by the buyers that have just taken some pretty good lumps in the last couple of years.
Brian Meredith – UBS: 
Gr:
Dominic J. Addesso: We are thinking, Brian we are thinking that its in two to three point range in terms of increase in ROE.
Brian Meredith – UBS:  And what kind of ROE do you think you're generating?
Joseph V. Taranto: Well I think John is referring to the worldwide ROE when you kind of blend all of our products together.
Brian Meredith – UBS:  Okay.
Joseph V. Taranto: But most of that two or three increase came from the property side of things and particularly from the cat side of things where the potential returns have gone much higher than what they were before and I think in almost all cases rate over 20% but I think when you put that together with the casualty and all other lines of business Dom and I our best guess was 13% on a going forward basis.
Brian Meredith – UBS:  Great. Thank you.
Operator: And we’ll go next to Ron Bobman with Capital Returns.
Ron Bobman – Capital Returns:  Hi, thanks. Patiently waiting for my opportunity. I have a question about the Florida primary market. You both made a couple of comments, not only with respect to rate from a reinsurance perspective improving, but also terms and conditions at least with respect to your book and your treaties that you've written. I'm wondering if those primary companies, in your view, are they in a better place now, sort of a better profit picture, expected profit picture than they were, I don't know, a year or two ago? Sort of the consensus was there a bit between a rock and a hard place, unable to make money in even a no cat year, with the sinkholes improving and the primary rates improving, but with higher reinsurance costs and maybe structural changes to their treaties. Joe, do you think or Dom, do you think they are better off now than they were a year ago when you look at the pluses and the minuses or the same or worse off? Thanks a lot and best of luck.
Joseph V. Taranto: I think they are better half, you know I think they have been allowed to get rate increases in the past year or so. Many of our clients took 15% rate increase three months back I think many of them are believing that they will be able to implement another 15% rate increase now. So that will tally to 30%, 35% rate increase there seems to be some talk on the political side to help them what sinkholes and the few of the other things. Yes reinsurance costs are a big part of the equation for them too and you’re right that is just one up. So that goes the other way. But still when you put it all together I think they are better half today then they were a couple of years ago. But, it’s still not easy for them.
Ron Bobman – Capital Returns: 
Okay. :
Dominic J. Addesso: Okay.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) We will go next to Jerry Fine with Charter Oak Partners.
Jerry Fine – Charter Oak Partners:  Joe, first of all, congratulations on a good quarter. A lot of people on this call have known you for many years and you have consistently stated your reserving policy has been and is to not manipulate reserves to manage earnings. In other words, to reserve, I think as you stated, conservatively but honestly where you think they should be. A number of the sell side analysts on this call have stated in print that they question RE's reserves and they won't recommend the stock because of that. I’d just be interested in how you feel at this point in time about Everest's current reserve position? Thank you.
Joseph V. Taranto:  Well, I think you’ve stated it, Jerry that we put up the numbers as we see them. Whatever that is, we do the best job that we can, we always have. We believe that everyone is supposed to do it that way. I’m not sure if it always gets done that way, but that’s certainly what we endeavor to do and always have and always will.
Jerry Fine – Charter Oak Partners: And how do you feel when you see that in print from some well-known firms?
Joseph V. Taranto: While it’s clearly, we see it other wise, Jerry.
Jerry Fine – Charter Oak Partners:  Got you. One last question, to make sure I got this right. When we stated that we had hopefully realized it's just a whatever, 13% on a going forward basis ROE on a $113 book that's $14.70 a share. Am I doing the math right?
Joseph V. Taranto: No. Your math is correct.
Jerry Fine – Charter Oak Partners:  Got you. I used to have problems with math. Thanks a lot guys.
Operator:  There are no further questions in the queue. At this time, I would like to turn the call back to Beth Farrell for any additional or closing remarks.
Elizabeth B. Farrell:  Thank you for participating in our call. We’ll see you next quarter. Thank you.
Joseph V. Taranto: Thank you.
Operator:  This does conclude today’s conference. We thank you for your participation.

===== 2010 Q3  (2010-11-01 10:30:00) =====

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen please standby. Good day everyone, welcome to the Everest Re Group Limited third quarter 2010 earnings call. Today’s conference is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Beth Farrell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead ma’am. 
Beth Farrell: Thank you John. Good morning and welcome to Everest Re Group’s third quarter 2010 earnings conference call. With me today are Joe Taranto, the company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Dom Addesso, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard I know such statements made during today’s call which are forward-looking in nature, such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations and the like are subject to various risks. As you know actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations. Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements. Now let me turn the call over to Joe.
Joe Taranto: Thanks Beth, good morning. We are pleased to have grown our book value per share in the quarter by 6.4% to over $114. Despite $514 million of catastrophe losses in the nine months, $347 million of share repurchases and $82 million in dividends, shareholder equity is up $180 million for the year attesting to the strength of our organization. Despite these catastrophes, book value per share is up 11% through the first nine months. Cash flow remains quite strong at just over $790 million for the nine months. Gross written premium increased 3% to $1.16 billion as we continued to grow in the international and US property markets. During the quarter, we repurchased $100 million of our shares. For the year, we have repurchased $347 million of our shares, representing 7.5% of the outstanding shares at year-end 2009. We have $4 million shares remaining available under our current authorization. We plan to continue to purchase shares in the fourth quarter. As previously announced, I will be continuing as CEO through 2011 and 2012. I am dedicated and energized to continue to lead the company forward. Going to our underwriting results by our segments, first, our international reinsurance book which represents 28% of our worldwide book through nine months. This segment includes Latin America, Canada, Asia, the Middle East and Africa. This segment has increased premium by 13.6% to $906 million through the first nine months. Excluding foreign exchange, the increase was 9.3%. The increased volume was a combination of new business, increased participations, rate increases in select areas, and economic and insurance growth in some markets. Included in this segment is our initiative in Brazil which continues to go quite well. We have a long standing important position in the international reinsurance market. For example, we were the number three re-insurer in Latin America, number three in Canada and a strong household name in virtually all foreign markets. Historically, our international reinsurance book has been very profitable. Unfortunately this year has been hit by both the Chile quake and the New Zealand quake, whereas rates increased in Chile in response to losses, we expect to see rate increases for Australia and New Zealand as well. Second, our Bermuda reinsurance operation, which has produced 18% of our worldwide business through nine months. Our Bermuda operation includes London, Ireland and continental Europe business written through our Brussels office. Our international reinsurance in Bermuda reinsurance operations together produced 46% of our worldwide premium and 58% of our reinsurance premium overall. Bermuda reinsurance premiums are down about 5% to $565 million through nine months, mainly being driven by reducing our book of business in continental Europe in response to softening market conditions. The combined ratio for the Bermuda reinsurance operation was 92.7 for the quarter and 94.8 through the first nine months. The nine month combined ratio includes 13.1 points of catastrophe losses. Third, our US reinsurance book, accounted for 28% of our worldwide book. Premiums are at 1% in this segment to $885 million through nine. However within this segment, property reinsurance is up 5% and casualty reinsurance is down 7%. The property growth comes from increased writings from our Florida quota share business, mainly from rate increases our clients have implemented. In casualty we continued to underwrite and respond to changing market conditions. We continued to see insurance rates decline in most casualty products. Within US reinsurance, property now accounts for 70% and casualty for 30%. The combined ratio for our US reinsurance operation was 82.3 for the quarter and 84.1 for the first nine months. Our fourth and last reinsurance category is specialty reinsurance which accounts for 6% of our worldwide book. This category includes accident and health, surety and marine and aviation. Through nine months, this segment has grown by 8% to $198 million. The increase is driven by growth in our accident health book for both travel insurance and medical stop loss insurance. The combined ratio for specialty reinsurance was $97.5 million for the quarter and $104.1 million for the first nine months. The nine month combined ratio includes 10 points of losses for the Deepwater Horizon. Overall reinsurance constitutes 80% of our worldwide premium. Accordingly, our insurance operation makes up 20% of our book. Insurance premiums are down 1% for the nine months to $645 million. The combined ratio was 105.5 for the nine months. The combined ratio for the quarter was 111.8 largely driven by increasing the 2010 accident year combined ratio for California workers comp to just over 100 and the impact of return audit premium adjustments. This demonstrates the current difficulty in the US casualty insurance market. We are currently getting 10ish percent rate increases in California workers comp, but we believe much of this is needed to keep pace with claim inflation. On our general liability business, we have not been successful of getting any meaningful rate increases. Our plan here is to maintain discipline on casualty business and look for new opportunities in property and shorter tail business. Our direct specialty business continues to perform well, and we’ll continue to look for opportunities in this space. Mark Herman and Daryl Bradley have their work cutout for them, but I’m sure they’re up to it. In summary, the markets are mixed bag. I’m pleased that we’ve been able to grow the top line albeit at a modest 3% through nine months. We have continued to expand our global reach in areas such as Brazil, Israel, China and Africa where we write property bond business and selective casualty. We have continued to grow our business in the US and international property where rates are appropriate including Florida quota shares. We have done so without increasing our PMLs in 2010 for any major zone including Florida, California, Japan, Latin America and European wind. Meanwhile, we are doing less US casualty business in both insurance and reinsurance. In short, we continue to expend – extend our franchise where it makes sense to do so but we are looking to avoid the pockets of weak pricing we are increasingly seeing. Now Dom will take you through the financial highlights.
Dom Addesso: Thank you Joe, good morning. As noted, operating earnings per share on a fully diluted basis for the quarter were reported at $2.67 compared to $3.43 one year ago, and $3.18 one quarter ago. These differences were mainly the result of catastrophe losses. In the third quarter, these losses amounted to a $1.34 per share compared to $0.90 per share in the second quarter and just $0.29 in the third quarter one year ago. The third quarter CATs were result of pre-tax losses of $75 million from the New Zealand earthquake and $15 million from the Calgary hailstorm. The New Zealand estimate is based on the upper ranges of our estimates which take into consideration three different methods of measurement. Those being, market share, modeling of similar event sets and underwriter estimates. The net range on the average of these methods was $48 million to $80 million. We feel our pick of $75 million is therefore a conservative estimate, particularly as it stands well above our underwriters range estimate of $45 million to $61 million. Total CAT losses for the year are now at $514 million or $491 million net of reinstatement premium. Our operating income for the year-to-date stands at $4.50 per share contrasted with $9.32 per share one year ago. CAT losses year-to-date amounted to $6.97 per share in 2010 compared with $0.85 last year. Adjusting for CATs, our net operating income per share compares favorably at $11.47 this year, versus $10.17 a year ago. The operating income for the quarter equaled $149 million. This was mainly comprised of a pre-tax underwriting gain of $41 million or 95.9% combined ratio and a $141 million of investment income pre-tax. The other major item affecting operating income was income taxes. The projected annualized effect of tax rate increased to 8.9% at September 30, from 7.1% at June 30, resulting in an effective tax rate of 10.2% for the quarter. The 8.9% effective tax rate assumes a certain level of CAT activity in the fourth quarter. If there is no fourth quarter CAT activity, it is estimated that our effective tax rate could rise to 11% all else being equal. As mentioned the combined ratio for the quarter was 95.9%. This is comprised of a 67.7% loss ratio and a 28.2% expense ratio. The expense ratio remains stable, relative to other comparable periods. The loss ratio was broken down between 60.8 points of current year attritional losses compared to 56.8 points in the prior year, 2.1 points of favorable development versus adverse development of 0.9 points in the ‘09 quarter and finally 9 points of CATs versus 2.5 points in 2009 which I’ve already outlined. The favorable development for the quarter was contained within our reinsurance book and similar to the second quarter of this year, was primarily from our international operations including Bermuda. The rise in the current year attritional loss ratio from a year ago generally reflects a conservative reserving in philosophy in the phase of a continued soft market, along with an assumed increasing loss trend overtime. Turning to investment income, I previously noted that this equaled a $141 million for the quarter. This compares to a $165 million one year ago. This decline is primarily attributable to results from our limited partnership investments where there was a $1 million loss in 2010 versus a $23 million gain one year ago. The loss in 2010 is primarily result of change in equity valuations which are booked on a quarter lag, representing values at June 30. At that date, the overall equity markets were depressed. These markets are used as a relative benchmarking valuations and therefore had a negative impact on limited partnership valued. I would however point out that equity markets have rebounded during the third quarter, and this should have a positive impact on fourth quarter valuations. I should also point to year-to-date investment income of $469 million compared to $401 million last year. This year’s number includes a $30 million gain in limited partnerships versus a $20 million loss – $29 million loss last year. Excluding the effects of limited partnerships, net investment income is up 2% year-over-year. Investment income from fixed-maturities is generally flat over comparable periods in the prior year. There are few factors that play here. First, declining yields available in the market. Second is a bias towards shortening the duration of our portfolio to reduce price risk and anticipate a higher rate environment. Third, is while cash flow from operations is strong, we have directed some of that towards share repurchase and finally, we have increased our allocation to public equities. This strategy has been one which emphasizes dividend income and large cap stocks. This combination has enabled us to maintain our investment income via dividends while providing upside depreciation with less volatility than other equity sectors. Other investment strategies have been deployed to somewhat mitigate the impact of a lower rate environment. We have allocated funds to the high yield markets in the bank loan or floating rate market. While this reflects an approach to increase credit risk versus duration risk in order to achieve yield, it is not been at the expense of maintaining the overall credit quality of our portfolio at AA. Given the economic times we’re emerging from, we find these alternatives opportunistically attractive as spreads have widen for many credits, and overtime we expect them to contract less in a rising rate environment, at the same time credits are more likely to improve as economic conditions turn. We are also considering emerging market debt for these reasons as well. Finally, overall net income for the quarter was a $174 million comprised of the operating income discussed above plus after-tax net realized capital gains for the quarter of $25 million. These realized gains reflect valuation changes for our equity portfolio as a result of a strong market through September 30. There were no significant gains or losses from the sales – from sales of securities. Comprehensive income for the quarter of $367 million is the result of net income plus $193 million of other comprehensive income. The other comprehensive income is primarily the result of unrealized gains in our bond portfolio due to declining rates. The total comprehensive income for the year of $596 million has resulted in book value per share rising to $114.16 from $102.87 at the beginning of the year. This represents a 11% growth in book value for the nine months. Given this capital position we are still bullish on share repurchase. With that I’ll thank you and turn it back to Beth for Q&A.
Beth Farrell: That concludes our prepared remarks and now we would like to open it up for questions.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen if you’d like to ask questions at this time. (Operator Instructions) And we’ll take our first question from Jay Gelb with Barclays Capital.
Jay Gelb – Barclays Capital: Thanks and good morning. Joe, can you give us a bit more additional insight on the recent management changes, as well as any thoughts you might have on next steps in terms of leadership or any areas of focus for you in particular? Thank you.
Joe Taranto: Sure Jay. Well I think I’ve been with – through this with many of you who are on the call, but I’ll go through it one more time for everyone’s benefit. The Board decided it was best for the company if I continued as CEO. Once this decision this was taken it was mutually agreed that it was best for Ralph to pursue other opportunities. We thank him for his many contributions at Everest and we wish him the very best. There are no financial issues whatsoever in connection with this matter. I am fully dedicated to continue to build the franchise. The Board will resume its succession planning and it can be done in a deliberate manner, since I’m here for two more years. Currently with regard to the President’s role, I will be sharing that role with the Executive Vice Presidents. Our EVPs are seasoned group, they’ve known our customer for many years as I have. So I expect no interruption to business. Our team has increased book value per share by 14% compounded over 15 years. And we’re 11% through the first nine months of this year despite the catastrophes. So I expect us to continue to build value. As far as the strategy and the game plan on virtually all fronts, it continues as it has been. I’ve been the CEO and continue to be the CEO. And I think that probably summarizes what I need to say on that front and I’d like to move on to questions for the quarter and the strategy and the future.
Jay Gelb – Barclays Capital: Just for Dom, just a quick one. The market was down overall, the equity markets in the June quarter, and up 11% September the alternative asset income was essentially unchanged. We were just trying to get a little insight in terms of what equity market moves mean in terms of sensitivity for the alternative assets.
Dom Addesso: Well I don’t know I have the direct correlation for you Jay, but I guess I was just trying to suggest that many of our limited partnerships use the equity market as a benchmark in terms of valuations. So that was part of a reason or big part of the reason that our limited partnerships did not experience any uplift in our books for the third quarter because it’s on a quarter lag. So those valuations were based on the 6/30 equity market. And so given the fact that equity markets are up for the third quarter, I would expect that there should be some upward momentum or lift coming from that, but I don’t have a prediction on what that might be.
Jay Gelb – Barclays Capital: And the asset base – that if we were to put a return profile on that what type of asset base do we think about for the alternatives?
Dom Addesso: About $500 million.
Jay Gelb – Barclays Capital: All right, thank you.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Cliff Gallant with Keefe Bruyette.
Cliff Gallant – : Good morning. I just wanted to talk a little bit more about the insurance line of business. Joe, you said that the manager there, who have their work cutoff for them where as we talk a little bit more about in detail, what you think really needs to be done to produce consistent profitability there, and in terms of timeframe, when do you think we can start to see stay profits again in the interest line?
Joe Taranto: Well what I meant there is, that is mostly a casualty book of business at this stage. And the casualty, certainly US market is very difficult. We’re seeing most lines of business are 100ish in terms of combined ratio, some a bit higher, maybe a few bit lower. They’re going to need to press on rate. We’re doing that in the comp market, we were probably the first market out there to start that, at least in a meaningful way. We will continue to push this year and next. We are starting to see the market being a bit helpful in that regard. We’ve done well in these the new operations that we started on the direct side, our FID&O [ph] group is doing very well and where we have selective opportunities on the direct side, we’ll need to grow that. We are looking currently at some opportunities that are not casualty and I think some of the better opportunities going forward for the next year or so maybe in the shorter tail space. So we are examining that as well. We’ve been pushing on the general liability front. As I noted with not great success at this point, but that doesn’t mean that we won’t continue to keep pushing, we will. And if we have to sacrifice some business there, we may. So our outlook going into 2011 is to be disciplined. It’s not necessarily we wanted to grow. We may grow in the shorter tail or the direct side, but we’re going to push for rate in all the business that we have. We’re not going to particularly worry about the top line. My guess is we’ll probably be down next year in the insurance space top line versus this year. We’re much more focused on the combined ratio. So I expect us to do better starting next year. Its little bit hard to give you exact numbers in the sense that it’ll depend upon the marketplace. And as far as our team having their work cutout for them, it’s not just our team, it’s going to be anybody in the casualty insurance space in the United States.
Cliff Gallant – : Thank you.
Joe Taranto: You’re welcome.
Operator: And we’ll move on to next question from Vinay Misquith with Credit Suisse.
Vinay Misquith : Hi good morning. This quarter we saw the accident year margins decline and I believe on the US reinsurance side, you had more property premiums from the Florida quota shares. Just curious as to why the accident year margins were declined this year versus last year when you had sort of a more favorable business mix?
Dom Addesso: Vinay, this is Dom. I think as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, it really reflects a conservative reserving approach. We’ve got certainly in the overall markets a softening market trend. Generally that’s in casualty but also property rates are flat in some jurisdiction and even down in others. So it’s partly in recognition of that as well as in recognition that loss trend although sometimes uneven is a never ending progression upwards. And as I said it does not necessarily mean that loss trends in any one year up but over the long-term, loss trend is on the rise. So we feel that its conservative position in fact, based on the way we’re – we price the business, our pick loss ratio is actually higher than our underwriters estimates that they’ve recorded on each and every detailed treated level. Now it’s my experience that you tend to want to need to do that in a softening environment, in terms of trying to mute some level of optimism. But we feel we’re very conservative in our position and very confident that those numbers will hold up.
Vinay Misquith : Okay, that’s great. The second question was on the fixed-maturity securities. The income was down about $6 million quarter-over-quarter. Was there something special happening in that?
Dom Addesso: No, again as I mentioned in my remarks, its low yield available in the marketplace. And we have redeployed some new money to share repurchases, as well as in terms of maturities and new money into share repurchases and into the equity markets and a declining overall yield.
Vinay Misquith : Okay, so we can use it as a run rate for the future. Okay, that’s great. And then one last thing if I may, your premium to equities on a 0.63 to 1. I was wondering if that can go up in the future or whether your business mix has changed to more sort of property focused account and therefore the premium to equity ratio should stay at these low levels?
Dom Addesso: Well, we think it certainly has room to go up even at 0.63 or even if you change the mix of property business relative to our own capital models as well as rating agency models, we feel that we have some amount of excess capital which is why we continue to be very bullish on share repurchase.
Vinay Misquith : Do you have an estimate as to how much it is right now and when do you plan to deploy that?
Dom Addesso: That’s not something that we have habit of disclosing.
Joe Taranto: In terms of future purchases we just want the flexibility. I did indicate we’d be buying again in the fourth quarter and we will. But on the issue of, the amount of access capital. Can you give any guidance on that Dom?
Dom Addesso: Well I mean certainly we have rating agency model which produces one number but we tend to use our own economic capital models and depending on those scenarios it would be anywhere from $500 million to $1 billion.
Vinay Misquith : Okay and is that $500 million to $1 billion in excess of what really is required?
Dom Addesso: It would be within that yes. The rating agency numbers would be higher than that.
Vinay Misquith : Okay, that’s great. Thank you.
Joe Taranto: The excess would be a lot greater, just using the rating agency models.
Vinay Misquith : All right, fair enough. Thank you.
Joe Taranto: Yes.
Operator: We’ll move on to our next question from Brian Meredith with UBS.
Brian Meredith – UBS: Yes, good morning. Two questions for you. First, on the insurance business. Joe, any changes in strategy here going forward here on the insurance business that you’re thinking about now particularly as it relates to building our platform versus using MGAs?
Joe Taranto: I mean the MGAs that we currently have – we’re very pleased with them, we have some very long standing relationships that we expect to continue. But as a general direction, I think especially at this part of – at this time in the marketplace, unless it’s something unusual most of the future growth would probably be more on the direct side, having said that that’s going to be slow too if the market stays the way it is. We’re not going to be too aggressive on that front either. So it’s really is just selective opportunities to come into us. We’re probably more keen on the direct side. We’re probably more keen on the short tail side. If it’s in the casualty space, it’s going to have to be proven to be highly specialized that we think it’ll deliver some very, very good results. We were able to achieve that a year or two ago with regard to the FID&O where we hit a nice window of opportunity and continue to have a very good renewal base that works for us. So it’s – the general direction might be more direct, more short tail. If it’s an MGA opportunity, we won’t exclude it, if it’s really an exciting opportunity. And those that we currently have that we very much likely will continue with. That’s been the plan, that’s been the trend for us for the last year, maybe the emphasis is a little bit more on some short tail mix to kind of go with the casualty, it’s something that we’ve been promoting more recently but that’s the plan. That’s – and to stay very disciplined on the casualty side.
Brian Meredith – UBS: Great. And then – and the second question Joe, can you give us your early read on what’s it going to look like pricing particularly property CAT and then your thoughts on what things you’re going to do with respect to retentions?
Joe Taranto: Well I think most people believe that there will be some moderation in pricing that’ll continue into January 1. So the general expectation is CAT rates will be off a bit, I guess I hear 5ish percent change down as what most people believe. Clearly if it’s in a pocket where they’ve been losses it will be different, there will be a correction. And we saw that in Chile. You’ll see that in Australia, any other pockets that have had losses, you’ll see some upward corrections sometimes you see a model change that might lead to an upward correction. We saw some of that in Canada. But in the main I think on the property side and on the CAT side, you’ll probably see things come down a bit same for retro CAT pricing. Insurance rates, property and casualty, US and outside the US, again we continue to see a bit of a slope down. Casualty rates you’ve heard about my concern in the US. So I think you’re going to see more of what you’ve seen in the last three – six months except for some selective pockets. I mean we’re pretty lucky that we have this international franchise that we can go into the product lines and into the countries that we really think are offering some new and exciting opportunities. Brazil was a good example of that in the last year or so. But China, I would probably add to that list and even Africa to a degree. But it’ll be tough sliding in terms of any companies that’s mature growing its top line business in 2011. I think we’ll see some more challenges and I think discipline is the word to be used.
Brian Meredith – UBS: What about terms and conditions?
Joe Taranto: I haven’t really seen much change on that front, either at the insurance level or the reinsurance level. It may creep in as you go into 2011. I don’t expect much of that to change in January. We expect there will still be some very good pockets of opportunity besides the international space. I think it was Vinay that mentioned the Florida quota shares, we’re involved there in pretty important way and that’s actually one of the spots that is improving in the sense that underlying insurance rates are going up by a meaningful amount for the first time in years. So it will be a question of picking the spots that make sense and being discipline in those that don’t make sense.
Brian Meredith – UBS: Great, thank you.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) And we’ll take our next question from Matthew Heimermann with JP Morgan.
Matthew Heimermann – JP Morgan: Hi good morning everybody, couple of questions. First, for Dom, I had a question. Last quarter you changed the definition of CAT from $5 million to $10 million. I was curious if you could potentially give us a sense of how that would impact the underlying loss ratios historically, because I would assume you’d get losses reported as attritional on a go-forward basis? And whether that’s a material Delta if we were to look at the last couple of years for example?
Dom Addesso: It is not a material Delta which is why we change it from $5 million to $10 million.
Matthew Heimermann – JP Morgan: Okay. And then with respect to the quota share book in Florida. Could you just remind us how big that book is today? And I’d just be curious given we haven’t really gotten any rate there has been some underlying loss issues, I’d be curious where that business is running relative to the rest of the US reinsurance book today?
Joe Taranto: The book is roughly about $300 million of book of business. Our clients have received pretty much approval for 15% rate increase this year over last year. So their book tends to be growing on the back of that. Keep in mind too in terms of CAT rates; they are paying a little bit less this year than they did last year, so their net has improved that way. And they’re trying to improve the book in some other ways as well. So I think at least for the important relationships that we have, there is much more margin this year if you will than there was a year ago and of course there needs to be, because you have to have a good result to pay for those CATs when they do come along. Fortunately, they haven’t had a hurricane in a few years and they didn’t have one so far this year. But that’s actually improving in terms of the quality of the attritional and the overall combined for the partners that we have, so we’re happy about that. Keep in mind we also have some containment on that book in terms of where we get stopped out. So that’s an equation that actually has gotten better in the last year. In fact we’ve done less excess of loss in Florida and a bit more on the quota share, our PML is pretty much to-date the same. But remember the excess of loss ratio has actually gone down, probably will continue to go down into next year. So the ROEs on that business is a little bit less favorable.
Matthew Heimermann – JP Morgan: Okay and then just in terms of underlying combined ratios because I mean if I looked at homeowners as a proxy for some of the primary guys it looks like, I would guess that ex-CATs that’s probably running around 80%. Is that ballpark?
Joe Taranto: I would say – yes, I was going to say 75% but I think we’re in the same ballpark.
Matthew Heimermann – JP Morgan: Okay.
Joe Taranto: Yes.
Matthew Heimermann – JP Morgan: All right. That’s it, thanks so much.
Operator: We’ll now move onto our next question with Ian Gutterman with Adage Capital.
Ian Gutterman – Adage Capital: Hi Joe, I actually wanted to follow-up on that question too. What did you seen as far as part of the reason I guess combining Matt and Vinay’s questions on the US reinsurance business. Is part of the reason we saw the tickup, where there any issues in Florida with sort of the attritional claims that have been worse for a while, was this bad quarter for sinkholes or anything like that on the attritional side or some of the thoughts there?
Joe Taranto: No it really wasn’t, Ian. I really do think much of the issue just goes back to what Dom said about picking some numbers that are higher. It really is nothing emanating specifically from Florida. That portion of our book, we do like better as we just discussed. But we know at the same time that we have this overall market that if I put it all together, it’s so sense – it’s not better this year than it was last year and so let’s pick some higher numbers. If they prove to be too high as things play out next year or the year after, that’s all well and fine by us. But no, there was nothing new and different coming out of the Florida claim side that I looked that as particularly worse.
Ian Gutterman – Adage Capital: Okay, got it. And then Dom to that point about how you’re seeing the picks. Is it new at Everest to be setting picks above where the underwriters come out or is it just that the margin above it is greater than it is used to be?
Dom Addesso: I can’t speak specifically as to what our practices have been in the past, but I can tell you that generally I think our approach more recently has been a bit more conservative.
Ian Gutterman – Adage Capital: Okay, fair enough. And then if I can just ask one more on California comp, you mentioned Joe how 10% rate increases kind of just keeping up with trend. How does you view on the attractiveness of that business changed at all given just what’s going on with particularly there plus some of the results of smaller competitors in that state?
Joe Taranto: Well it’s certainly not an easy state. I think some of the smaller competitors are – no, that hasn’t concerned me. I think they’re in a different part of the market than we are. Some of them are the USL&H business or the high hazard group, we’ve been in the low hazard group. We haven’t really grown our book of business in quite sometime. We have a book of business that’s been very steady with a very high renewal and retention ratio. And we’ve been there for a quite a number of years. So I think we have a team that knows what it’s doing, but it is still very difficult to figure out just what the medical inflation is going to be for 2010. A lot of the tort reform that was put in place, some of that is certainly being attacked, it will be fought out in the courts, it will be while before we know exactly what the answer on that front will be. So there is still a fair amount of guesswork in terms of just what the severity will be. And I think there is every reason given that to push for rate and to try to be safer. And that’s why we’re pushing for 10 and even as you heard with the 10, much of that may get taken in our mind to pay for severity changes. And we’ll continue to push for something next year on top of what we’re getting this year. So it’s a dicey market, and no question of that. And that’s why even there its more rate than a lot of discipline as far as we’re concerned and watch it closely.
Ian Gutterman – Adage Capital: Okay and can you remind me just ballpark what your premiums and reserves are for Cal comp?
Joe Taranto: Premiums I would guess about $240ish million. That’s pretty close.
Ian Gutterman – Adage Capital: Okay.
Joe Taranto: Reserves, I don’t have in front of me, but Dom do you have it?
Dom Addesso: Yes, about $160 million.
Beth Farrell: No, that’s.
Dom Addesso: No, that’ll be more than that.
Beth Farrell: $160 is the premium.
Dom Addesso: Premium, I’m sorry.
Joe Taranto: Through nine months, okay. So $160 million through nine months. So again would be a bit over $200 million annualized.
Ian Gutterman – Adage Capital: Right.
Joe Taranto: And we don’t seem to have the reserve number in front of us. So we’ll get back to you with that Ian.
Ian Gutterman – Adage Capital: Okay, great. Thank you, guys.
Operator: We’ll move on to our next question with Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank.
Josh Shanker – Deutsche Bank: Yes, good morning everyone. Back in I guess, probably the early part of 2009 you had very topical on the market, you decided to back into equities. And you’ve kind of doubled the size of portfolio. But it’s still nowhere near where you guys were back in 2007. How are you viewing your ultimate equities as a part of the investment portfolio? And what does the NAIC think and what would you in the future?
Dom Addesso: That was a lot of questions.
Josh Shanker – Deutsche Bank: Yes.
Dom Addesso: I’ll answer the last one first, I don’t know.
Joe Taranto: But we’re thinking of that.
Dom Addesso: The one thing we keep in mind is that we look our equity exposure. We consider both our limited partnerships and our public equity and we put those kind of in the same basket, even though it may the specifically or not. But in terms of evaluating our equity like exposure that would be appropriate. And we have just recently increased our allocation to the public equity market. And we’ll probably continue to do that little bit more into the next couple of quarters. And given our level of investments seen in limited partners. We also likely going to be seeing our limited partnership investments continue to trend down, as some of those mature if you will or get cashed out. And at that point we will probably, again given wherever state of the markets are at that point in time, we would more than likely all of the things being equal, allocate some of that take down in limited partnerships more than likely back into the public equity markets. But that’s all predicated on in appropriate market environment at that – at whatever point in the future that is. Does that help?
Josh Shanker – Deutsche Bank: And what you think about NAIC considerations?
Dom Addesso: No, there are none.
Joe Taranto: No it’s purely where we want to put the money that we think it would be best. And it’s a tough call. As you can imagine for anyone in today’s market and, but we are a little bit more drawn to the equity space, some of that’s because we’re less drawn to the bond world. Dom had mentioned we’re going into the bank loan space to some degree in the high yield. So we’re like the rest of the world look best opportunities. We’ll still have very big bond portfolio being an insurance and reinsurance company. But pound-for-pound we probably are finding more opportunities in the equity side today with new money, than we are in the bond side.
Josh Shanker – Deutsche Bank: Understood, and I don’t mean to be labor a point, I do apologize. But I’m trying to understand also when you decide to retire maybe about a year ago, why did you chose to come back as CEO and not interim CEO?
Joe Taranto: I’ve never left as a CEO.
Josh Shanker – Deutsche Bank: Well, I understand, but things in your mind, you maybe had some thoughts about retiring and just what’s going on – how are you thinking about this yourself?
Joe Taranto: Well I think I told you that the Board asked me to stay on and I’ve agreed to and that means that I’ll need to be dedicated towards that end and I am. And that’s why I said I’m energized and I will just do all the work that needs to get done. There will be a succession plan put in place, that the Board will work on that. But they can do that in a way that it’s sensible and deliberate. So I’m here, I’m energized, I’m dedicated to working hard.
Josh Shanker – Deutsche Bank: Very good, thank you.
Operator: At this time we have no further questions.
Beth Farrell: Okay, well thank you for joining us on our third quarter call. And certainly you have any questions, please feel free to call me after the call. Thank you.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen that does conclude today’s conference call. Thank you for attending.

===== 2010 Q2  (2010-07-30 10:30:00) =====
Executives: Beth Farrell -IR Joe Taranto - CEO Dom Addesso - CFO 
Analysts:  Cliff Gallant - KBW  Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital Matthew Heimermann - JP Morgan Vinay Misquith - Creidt Suisse Brian Meredith - UBS Ron Bobman - Capital Returns Management 
Operator:  Good day everyone, welcome to the Everest Re Group Ltd second quarter 2010 earnings release call. Today’s conference is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Beth Farrell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead ma’am.
Beth Farrell:  Thank you Michael, good morning and welcome to Everest Re Group second quarter 2010 earnings conference call. With me today are Joe Taranto, the company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Ralph Jones, President and Chief Operating Officer, and Dom Addesso, Chief Financial Officer.  Before we begin I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard I know such statements made during today’s call which are forward-looking in nature, such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations and the like are subject to various risks. As you know actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations. Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements.  Now let me turn the call over to Joe.
Joe Taranto:  Thanks Beth, good morning. We are pleased to have posted after tax operating income of $185 million for the second quarter even though we increased our provision for the first quarter catastrophes, particularly the Chilean earthquake. For the quarter the annualized operating ROE was 13.1%. This result demonstrates the underlying strength of our underwriting portfolio. We are also pleased to have increased book value per share by roughly $4.50 from $102.87 at year end to $107.31 as our investments performed well, and our share buybacks added value. Dom will take you through the financial highlights shortly. Gross written premiums increased 4% to roughly $1 billion. Adjusting for foreign exchange, gross written premiums were up 5%. Our growth came from our reinsurance operation, particularly our international operation. Insurance premiums were in fact down 4%. Although the markets remained competitive, we’ve been able to selectively grow our business by focusing on those markets with the best profit opportunity.  Ralph will take you through the underwriting particulars momentarily, including the July 1 renewals for both the international book and for Florida. In Florida, although catastrophe rates were down 10% to 15% for the industry we improved our overall portfolio, since most of our portfolio is pro-rata and our pro-rata clients have improved their position, because reinsurance costs are less, and because they’ve been granted meaningful underlying rate increases. Again, Ralph will get into this in greater detail.  In the quarter we repurchased 2.7 million shares at a cost of $200 million. This represents 4.5% of the outstanding shares at the end of the first quarter. 5.2 million shares remain available under the current authorization. In March 2009, we put out a tender offer for $0.50 on the dollar for $400 million of the hybrid bonds we previously floated in the market. They were trading in the market at $0.45 on the dollar, as there was much fear in the market. 40% of the holders took the deal. Today one year later these bonds are selling at twice the value. This transaction was a hard market transaction for us. I go through this example to let you know that I view buying back our stock today, much the same. When it comes to buying back our stock, it’s a hard market. We will continue to invest our earnings into buying our stock. We will do it in a way where our capital and our ratings remain as strong as ever.  Last, I will be retiring, December 31 of this year as CEO. I will remain as Chairman of the Board. Effective January 1, 2011 Ralph will become CEO. I have had the privilege of working with many wonderful people at Everest over the last 16 years. Those people have helped me grow the company from a modest size to the global franchise it is today with over $6 billion of capital. I thank them all.  For the past two years I have with Ralph Jones, I have been impressed with his breadth of experience, his intelligence and his leadership. The Board and I are confident that Ralph and our team will continue to effectively grow Everest in 2011, and beyond. As Chairman I will help Ralph and Everest in any way that I can. Ralph.
Ralph Jones:  Thank you Joe, I am thrilled at the opportunity to lead the Everest franchise next year. You set the bar pretty high during your tenure as CEO Joe. During the last 10 years the average growth and book value per share was over 14%. Even with all the challenges of the decade, from 9-11, to Hurricane Katrina, then financial meltdown, it’s a pretty high standard of achievement in our industry. It’s a great company, I like the people, I like our position of strength, and I like our prospects. Thank you Joe for the opportunity.  Overall it was a good quarter; we wrote just over $1 billion in written premium at a 93 combined. The largest segment is international which includes Canada, Latin America, Asia-Pacific, and the Middle East and Africa, which wrote in total $307 million in written premium for international in the second quarter, up 12% in US dollars and 9% in base currencies in the countries in which we operate. Much of the growth came from new business in Brazil, rate increases in Australia, and in Latin America, but mostly in Chile, and larger signings in Canada and in South Africa. Combined ratio for international was 106% in the quarter, and that included 26 points of the cap loss from the earthquake in Chile.  The US Reinsurance business written premium was $268 million for the quarter, about flat over last year. Some of the growth came in the property segment but this was offset by a drop in the crop reinsurance line as we lost two treaty clients that were acquired. The combined for ratio of US Reinsurance was 79%. As respect to the marketplace we are seeing some good opportunities in property and have a strong renewal season in Florida, which came mostly on June 1. We renewed both of our large quota share deals on similar terms to last year, terms we like. As respects the excess of loss property CAT contracts, we non-renewed or reduced our overall limits exposed by about a third. Some of this reduction was targeted and some was in response to rate reductions we deemed as excessive.  Of the business we renewed, rate reductions averaged about 8%. On balance, we continue to support about 17 of the Florida insurance groups. New capacity available in the Florida wind business allowed the primary companies to see some benefit this year. This was also beneficial to our two quota share partners. On balance, between the quota shares and the XOLs, our aggregate exposure in Florida and the profit potential overall was about the same as last year.  Our specialty segment was up 15% to $65.8 million in the second quarter. The marine business continues to shrink, but we are up significantly in the accident and health book. This is a result of growth in the travel accident business, as well as several new self funded medical accounts. The combined ratio on specialty was 119% as a result of the reserves taken for the offshore oil rig in the Gulf. Our loss estimate of $22 million is about what we indicated it would be last quarter. This is for the property damage on the rig itself.  Our Bermuda operations, which includes London, Dublin and Brussels was $167 million, up 3% from prior year 75 combined. Not much new to report from Bermuda, except that the casualty market is soft, the dollar is strong and the CAT loss for Xynthia is less than we anticipated. And this, in part accounts for the very good underwriting result for Bermuda operations in the quarter.  Our direct insurance operations wrote $205 million in the quarter, down 4% over the prior year. We continue to face headwinds in the US casualty market which makes up most of our direct business. We are now down to six core programs in Everest National that gives us the prospect for an appropriate underwriting margin. Our shift in emphasis for the direct specialty lines continues. Our accident year run rate is about 101% combined. This quarter we ran at 105, due to the settlement of a few large claims for a runoff professional liability program for architects and engineers.  Rate increases held at plus 2% for the GL book and plus 9% for the California comp book, which I’m pleased with. I’m also pleased to report that Mark Herman has accepted the role of CEO for our insurance operations. Mark has been running our speciality operation in New York for the past year. He was formerly the President of Ace Bermuda, and brings a great underwriting track record to his new assignment. Darrell Bradley, our President of Everest National and Marketing will make a great leadership team as I begin to delegate this day to day responsibility.  Overall, we are making some money and we have our dukes up as we battle the marketplace, marketplace with more capacity than good opportunities in general. Over to Dom Addesso. 
Dom Addesso:  Thank you Ralph and good morning. As noted, operating earnings for the quarter were $3.18 per diluted share. When combined with $0.48 per diluted share of realized capital losses for the quarter, it resulted in net income of $2.70 per share. The realized losses for the quarter were primarily a result of fair value adjustments on our equity portfolio, due to changes in the overall market during the quarter and not the result of losses on sales of securities.  The operating income reference for the quarter equals $185 million and was primarily the result of a pre-tax underwriting gain of $68 million and $166 million of investment income pre-tax. Other items on a pre-tax basis included foreign currency gains of $8 million, a loss of $22 million on the equity index put contracts and interest expense and other corporate expense totaling $17 million. The effective tax rate for the quarter applied to these items was 8.5%, resulting in $17 million of tax on operating income. The change in the annual effective tax rate from the 10.5% in the first quarter reflects second quarter actual results combined with the unchanged estimate for taxable book income during the remainder of the year.  The details on the underwriting gain for the quarter are as follows. A 65.1% loss ratio, a 23.9% commission ratio, and other underwriting expenses of 4.2%. This resulted in a 93.2% combined ratio for the quarter. Expense ratios for the quarter are generally consistent with other periods. The loss ratio has three distinct components. The current year attritional result was 59% for the quarter and 59.2% for the year-to-date, which is up over the comparable periods one year ago. This reflects events such as the Horizon rig loss and Tennessee floods, as well as higher accident year picks reflecting a slightly softer market offset by rate increases in certain segments, as previously outlined by Ralph.  The next largest component of the loss ratio was attributable to CAT losses. This represented 7 points or $70 million for the quarter. The dominant driver of this amount was the change in our estimates for the first quarter CATs with an increase in our loss estimate for Chile, and reduction in our loss estimates for Xynthia, and last years Turkey floods. The net effect of these CAT losses in the quarter after taxes reinstatement premiums was $52.4 million or $0.90 per share. The current estimate for Chile, which totals $400 million were $306 million net of tax and reinstatement premium is the result of updated reports from ceding companies in addition to our management estimates. These ceding company loss reports were verified by our claims staff who visited six out of our seven pro-rata clients in Chile.  While it is still relatively early in the adjustment process, these numbers compare to market loss estimates which are now in the $10 billion to $12 billion range. As we evaluate potential future emergence, if any, for this one event we do consider our overall CAT reserve position. When combined with reserves on prior year CATs for which we have seen limited activity, we are reasonably reserved for any future movement on prior CAT events.  The final piece of our loss incurred amount for the quarter was $10 million or 0.9 points, just under 1 point of favorable development on prior year attrition reserves. This was primarily due to favorable emergence in our reinsurance operations coming from our international businesses.  Net investment income for the quarter was $166 million compared to $167 million in last year’s quarter. The decline from the prior year was due to lower income from limited partnerships. On year-to-date basis however, net investment income was up significantly in 2010 over 2009 to $327 million. This was due to a loss in 2009 from those limited partnerships of $73 million during the first quarter 2009.  Income from fixed maturities and equity securities have increased year-over-year, due to investing of our short-term and cash balances, as well as increases in invested assets arising from positive cash flow from operations of just under $500 million in 2010, compared to $284 million in 2009. The increase in equity income was due to increased allocations to dividend yielding equity securities.  Unrealized gains net of tax for the quarter of $113 million flowed through other comprehensive income as declines interest rates continue to positively influence the value of our bond portfolio. Offsetting this in other comprehensive income is translation losses from net assets held abroad in other than US currencies.  Total comprehensive income for the year-to-date was $229 million, and when combined with dividend of $56 million in the six months and share repurchases of $247 million, results in total book value at June 30 of $6 billion or $107.31 per share. This represents an increase of over $16 per share or 18% from June 30 of last year. This book value growth leaves us well positioned for market opportunities, as well as continued share repurchases.  Beth thank you and I turn it back to Beth for Q&A. 
Beth Farrell: Michael we are ready for questions and answers.
Operator:  [Operator Instructions] We’ll take our first question from Mr. Cliff Gallant from KBW. Please go ahead. 
Cliff Gallant - KBW: Two questions, one yet a notable competitor in the California Worker’s comp market, who took reserve charges this week and I was curious as to what you are seeing in terms of your lost trends there. And then secondly, I wanted to ask about your dividend. You were pretty aggressive with capital management this quarter and I think your dividends been flat for awhile. Any thought to increasing that?
Ralph Jones: On the California comp book, we are pretty pleased with what we are seeing. We have about a $230 million annualized book of business, it’s roughly kind of a third of our insurance operations. We’ve filed for rate increases and we’re actually getting what we are looking for. So, through the first six months its just under 10% rate increase and the reserved position looks good. So, I don’t know, I think you might be referring to Seabright, but I don't know what their issues are, but we are very comfortable with what we got and how the market is playing out. 
Cliff Gallant - KBW: I think they were talking about things like, because of the economy people were filing their claims longer, staying on worker’s comp longer than as opposed to returning to work. So you are just seeing a change in the activity of claimants?
Ralph Jones: The Only thing we see that kind of dampens to some degree the impact of the rate increases is that the audit premiums that we get have tailed off, because the payrolls are down. So, as you project some of these audit premiums for some of the clients and their payrolls are down that becomes less income to you over time. But that really impacts the volume as opposed to the margin. So that’s the trend we are seeing.
Dom Addesso: What we are seeing is relatively stable, but we do have to consider the factors that you mentioned as we think about our IBNR estimates. And those are all factored into our management estimates of reserves. 
Ralph Jones: On the dividend question Cliff, there is no plan to modify it at this point. We did change it rather significantly a couple of years ago. We pay about at the 2.5% dividend on the stock price which is a healthy dividend, and frankly I think I find it better to take any extra money and put it into share repurchase at this point. So, I think it’s a good dividend and right now the plan s to keep it the same. 
Operator: We’ll move on to our next question from Jay Gelb with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital:  Ralph I want to focus on a big picture item now that you are taking the position over as Chief Executive, can you give us your thoughts on strategy, execution. And Everest historically hasn’t been too active in mergers and acquisitions but I just want to get your thoughts on that as well.
Ralph Jones: I wouldn't describe it as steady as she goes Jay. The results have been very good over the ups and downs of the market cycle and that’s a direct result of very disciplined underwriting, particularly on the treaty side. So, don't expect any major changes there. We are constantly looking for opportunities, but we can take those opportunities as the market yields it to us. And given the current outlook in the insurance market the way the pricing trends are going it’s probably has headwinds over the next couple of years.  On the insurance side, I think we have a decent business, but it hasn’t performed particularly well. We are working very hard to have that perform in a way that’s commensurate with the reinsurance company, which is very strong. And all hands on deck to make that happen. I think you could see the trend that we’ve been defining over the last year which is an emphasis more on direct specialty lines that present a margin where underwriting expertise matters, versus a more of the commodity, property casualty, or let’s say mostly casualty MGA model. We are happy with the six partners that we have. We are down from a larger number a year ago, but we’re very happy with the six we have. And we’ll continue in that business. We are happy with the California comp play that we are making and Mark Herman and his leadership will be a big boost. And he has more of a specialty lines background, a lot of depth in the professional liability side of the house. So, we’ll kind of work to have that perform better.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital: And then separately on share buybacks, the $200 million repurchased in the second quarter is probably the largest of any quarter since at least 2005. And I’m just trying to get a sense of how fast we should expect the pace buybacks be going forward? Thanks.
Ralph Jones:  Well, it’s probably the largest in any quarter ever. It tells how strongly we feel about that as increasing value for shareholders. Having said that, we will continue to not forecast what we plan to buyback something that we preferred to feel the process as we go through the quarter. Taking into account all the issues, including hurricane season, including stock price and everything else that needs to be taken into account when you get into share repurchase. So, the plan is to continue to purchase, including in this quarter. And the plan is to purchase going forward, because certainly at today’s price we think it’s a great thing to do. But we are not going to put dollars onto it right now.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Matthew Heimermann with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
Matthew Heimermann - JP Morgan:  A couple of questions. First, with respect to the insurance business, now that you scaled down the MGA relationships and given that you are going to have more of a direct focus going forward, how should we think about the expense structure in that business? Both acquisition and MGA. 
Ralph Jones: Well, the expense model for MGAs is relatively high, because you are paying a commission and then you are paying an MGA fee. And that fee is roughly, on average 7 to 10 points over the underlying commissions. And you are going to need that same kind of framework to deal in the specialty lines, because you are focused on building the appropriate teams for the appropriate opportunities. So, I expect the expenses to be down somewhat over the course of time. And not immediately.
Matthew Heimermann - JP Morgan: With respect as to how you are deploying your capital by geographic risks, can you give us a sense, and I guess to some extent I am hoping you’ll dig in a little bit what happened at 71 as well. But, just major geographies around the world whether or not your PML is up or down, relative to last year.
Ralph Jones: Well, in general the PML is about the same. On a overall basis we see good opportunities in Asia-Pacific. We had strong growth in the quarter in Singapore and that book came principally from Australia, as I mentioned. We saw strong growth in Canada, and see good opportunities coming out of Canada, which we book in our international line. And we saw probably, fewer opportunities in Europe. We have an office in Brussels that deals with the continent and those opportunities were fewer. So, if you kind of go around the world and look at the aggregate exposure, particularly for CAT exposure on the one in 100 or one in 250 PML. We saw it down in the European crosswind, we saw it about the same in Florida as I mentioned in the second quarter in the US. We saw it down in Latin America, principally because of reactions after the Chile earthquake. We saw good rate increases in Chile, on the order of 70% to 80%. Of the renewals that we had coming on July 1, we renewed five out of the six. One we didn’t and that was kind of a significant PML reduction because of that. But the ones we renewed we are happy with, and we are happy with the rate escalation.  We didn’t see a broader rate escalation outside of Chile. Particularly little bit stronger demand, a little lower supply in some of the other Latin American countries, but not to any great degree that we had kind of expected because of the size of the industry loss there. But by and large, the PML aggregates overall are about the same.
Matthew Heimermann - JP Morgan:  And then, for Dom I guess just in the alternative portfolio, most other companies that have reported strong numbers have pointed to real estate and private equity. I was just curious if you could give some color on the strong gain there.
Dom Addesso: Well, the strong gain year-over-year was essentially due to as I mentioned due to our limited partnership income which the economy has been approving. And all of those limited partnerships are subject to marks every quarter. And most businesses are improving in many of the sectors that we’re in, whether it’s real estate, or healthcare, or infrastructure most of those sectors are all coming back. Therefore, the marks are improving in those sectors. Year-over-year our limited partnership was $31 million of gain, almost $32 million of gain in the six months of 2010. And a year ago we had a $53 million loss. And in the second quarter we had $16 million of gain; compared to a year ago the second quarter was about $20 million of gain from our limited partnership investments.
Operator: We’ll move on to our next question from Vinay Misquith with Creidt Suisse. Please go ahead.
Vinay Misquith - Creidt Suisse:  My first question is on the growth in the international. Was that mostly from rate increases or was that also from new client growth? And if you could explain to us how you are getting that growth and who are you getting it from?
Ralph Jones: Yes, again a lot of these treaties come up on January 1 Vinay. So, you could see in the first quarter some of that growth was as we defined and as we expected through the course of the years and treaties come out and it is very similar pattern to the way we described it in the first quarter. Canada is very strong. We see good opportunities in Canada. Some of that is rate increases, particularly for CAT programs in the Western part of the country. We saw strong rate increases in Australia, partly because of the CAT losses in Australia. We saw rate increases in South Africa, and some of that Middle East and South African business which we kind of put in that bucket was up. So, it’s I would say equal between rate increases, larger signings on current customers and some new business. But it was really, pretty broadly spread on those four parts of the world.
Vinay Misquith - Creidt Suisse: Okay, and could you help us understand how the PMLs have stayed relatively flat despite higher unit count?
Ralph Jones: Well, the number of customers is approximately the same. I’m again going back to the international question. So, the number of customers came about the same, but you’ve got the remember that within the international segment, we had the new office in Brazil last year which is going to write between $80 million and $100 million this year. And that is principally new property business that’s quota share, that’s not subject to CAT exposures like other parts of the world. So, a lot of the growth that you see comes from that new operation in Brazil, which is kind of earning its way out in 2010. Which is not CAT exposed. 
Vinay Misquith - Creidt Suisse: And the margins this quarter were really very strong. Did you see a very low CAT quarter, extra large CATs within these property lines in your international books?
Ralph Jones: There was really no other CAT activity other than the movements that we mentioned. Chile was up a bit and Xynthia was down, but other than that there wasn’t a lot of activity outside of the US. Some of the US activity was floods in Nashville, but that really came in as under the attritional column for US reinsurance.
Vinay Misquith - Creidt Suisse: Last question is on the tax rate. We’ve seen a very low tax rate this quarter. Should we expect that same level in the future?
Ralph Jones: Yes that’s an annualized effective tax rate based on the projection of taxable income for the remainder of the year. Of course that can change relative to what kind of CAT events if any we have in the third and fourth quarter. That’s the big swing there. And we have assumed some level of CATs in our estimate for the remainder of the year. So, if there are none, then that’s obviously a good thing for operating earnings, but of course then the effective tax rate would move up. But net-net it would still be a positive earnings story.
Vinay Misquith - Creidt Suisse: So the second tax rate would be about 8.5% going forward, right?
Ralph Jones: For the remainder of this year, correct. If in fact the level of catastrophes that we’ve put into our assumptions come to fruition. If they don’t, then that tax rate will go up. But, operating income will go up at a faster rate.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS. Please go ahead.
Brian Meredith – UBS:  Couple of just quick questions here. One, book on the investment portfolio looks like. It is up a little bit sequentially, is that just because of deployment of assets?
Ralph Jones: Yes Brian and you’ll note that our cash in short-term positions have been coming down over time, so we’ve been trying to remain more diligent around moving out of assets yielding less than 1%, and trying to put that money to work. As well as increased cash flow. 
Brian Meredith – UBS: Also did any FX impact on top line?
Ralph Jones: Yes, about 1%.
Brian Meredith – UBS: 1% impact, okay. Positive I assume, right?
Ralph Jones: It was 4% it would have been 5%, FX foreign currency. 
Brian Meredith – UBS: And then last question, on the Chile loss. Where do stand with respect to your excessive loss limits, so you are pretty much maxed out there? And then any kind of color you can give us as far as aggregate caps in your quota shares, and kind of where we stand close to those?
Ralph Jones: Well on the XOL contracts we are very near the top. Now that can move a little bit because of currency movements, but nevertheless it’s still in the last 10%. We are up in the 90% range in terms of maxing that out. On the production-ratas our aggregate limits there are in the low $500 million range.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We’ll take our next question from Mr. Ron Bobman with Capital Returns Management. Please go ahead sir.
Ron Bobman - Capital Returns Management:  I had a quick question with the California work comp book, and curious to know what loss that are taking with current accident year? And then also, how it changed year-over-year, ’10 versus ’09?
Ralph Jones: Well on a combined basis the accident year picks in the mid 90s and that's about the same as last year. Even though we’re getting rate increases.
Dom Addesso: That’s a combined ratio.
Ralph Jones: Combined ratio.
Ron Bobman - Capital Returns Management: And then would you just give us a little bit of description as to the nature of the risks, sort of the profile of the risks and account types that’s represented by the book? If it has any sort of dent one way or the other? Thanks
Ralph Jones: Its two pieces to the book. One is, we write directly through our operations and underwriting operations in Orange County and Oakland. And the other we have through a good program manager in San Diego called Arrowhead. And principally, it is construction and agriculture.  
Operator: And with no other questions in queue I would like to turn call back over to Ms. Beth Farrell for any closing remarks.
Beth Farrell:  Thank you for joining us today. And certainly, as always if you have any questions please feel free to call myself or Dom Addesso. Thank you. 
Operator:  Ladies and gentlemen that concludes today’s presentation. Thanks for your participation.

===== 2010 Q1  (2010-05-03 06:00:00) =====
Executives: Beth Farrell - VP IR Joe Taranto - Chairman & CEO Ralph Jones - President & COO Dom Addesso - CFO
Analysts: Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital Matthew Heimermann - JPMorgan Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Brian Meredith - UBS Vinay Misquith - Credit Suisse Matthew Heimermann - JP Morgan Ron Bobman - Capital Returns 
Operator: Good day everyone and welcome to the first quarter 2010 earnings release call of Everest Re Group Limited. Today’s conference is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Beth Farrell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead ma'am.
Beth Farrell: Thank you, Casey. Good morning and welcome to Everest Re Group's first quarter 2010 earnings conference call. With me today are Joe Taranto, the company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Ralph Jones, our President and Chief Operating Officer and Dom Addesso, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward looking statements. In that regard I note that statements made during today's call, which are forward-looking in nature, such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations and the like are subject to various risks. As you know actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations. Our SEC filings have the full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements. Now let me turn the call over to Joe Taranto.
Joe Taranto: Thanks Beth. Good morning. In the first quarter the industry experienced record losses, including the largest insured loss ever in Latin America. While these losses had significant impact on our quarter they are manageable given our expected earnings and our $6 billion of capital. Our total return for the quarter including dividends paid was essentially zero as strong investment income was strong underwriting results excluding catastrophes and depreciation on our investment portfolio; offset the impact of these catastrophes. Such a result given the magnitude of these catastrophes attests to the fundamental strength of our franchisee. Further attesting to our strength we were pleased that S&P raised our counterparty credit rating during the quarter. Dom will take you through the financial highlights for the quarter momentarily. Gross written premium for worldwide operations increased 2% versus 2009 and eliminating foreign exchange changes was flat year-over-year. Reinsurance premiums were flat with last year, but adjusting for foreign exchange and reinstatement premiums were down about 5%. Lower premiums from US casualty insurance, crop reinsurance, marine and European business offset growth and US property reinsurance, South America and Asia-Pacific markets. US insurance premiums were up 11% as direct specialty business continued to provide opportunity. Ralph will comment on the underwriting particulars shortly, both for our insurances and reinsurance operations including April renewals and our view of the upcoming Florida renewals were we expect our clients on accounts to continue to do well. The marketplace remains very much a mixed bag. Some pockets most notably portions of the US casualty market are under priced and to be avoided, while other areas including property catastrophe reinsurance remain reasonably priced. The quarter’s catastrophe losses will precipitate changes including rate increases in the areas and on the accounts that were hit. It’s less clear what impact there will be beyond these loss areas as ample capacity remains for well rated programs. However these losses remind reinsures of the need to charge appropriately given the volatile nature of the business. We will continue to emphasize discipline underwriting only looking to grow where it make sense and cutting back where it doesn’t. With out meaningful market change I do not anticipate much top line growth on our underlying book Cash flow from operations was very strong for the quarter at $271 million. In the quarter we repurchased 562,000 shares at a cost of $47 million. Since January 2007 we have repurchase 7.1 million shares or 11% of the outstanding shares, 7.9 million shares remain available under the current repurchase authorization. We plan to continue to repurchase our stock in the second quarter as we continue to see this as an attractive way to increase shareholder value. As usual we will not predetermine the amount as this allows us to do better respond to changing conditions. Ralph.
Ralph Jones: Thank you, Joe. Let me take this opportunity to discuss the trends in each of our operating segments. International segment was up 10% in the quarter to $275 million continuing the trend from the January renewal season. The combination of rate increases in Australia continued expansion of our business in Brazil, some indigenous growth in China and reinstatement premiums in Chile were the main factors in our growth overseas. The international portfolio was about $1.1 billion on an annual basis, with about a third coming from Latin America, about 20% each from Canada and Singapore and the balance from the Middle East and Africa. The combined ratio was heavily impacted by catastrophe losses in the first quarter, which Dom Addesso will outline in detail in a moment. Excluding CATs the attritional combined ratio was 84.4%, up 2.5 points over last year. Big renewal season in April comes from Japan, we saw catastrophe rates come in flat-to-down slightly from last year, the impact of the earthquake in Chile will improve rates in terms in Latin America, but we do not see any appreciable impact on the CAT market in other parts of the world so far.  The US reinsurance business was down 8% at $244 million in the first quarter, 3-D property was up and 3-D casualty and our crop reinsurance business were down. We still like the crop business for 2010, but there is uncertainty as to the future margins in this segment as the dust does not settles on how the government subsidies will impact crop insurers and the insurance agents who produce this business going forward. Once the SRA negotiations have been completed, we will have a better picture of what all this will mean over the next year so. Casualty rates and underlying terms and conditions are in a slow downward decline in the US causing us to trim our 3-D casualty ratings, which impacted growth in the quarter. We are still seeing opportunities in 3-D property, which was up 13% in the quarter, principally came from several single state programs incepting in January. Rates for catastrophe prone business are still pretty good in the US and the next big renewal date is June 1 for the business in Florida. We expect a very active month or two coming up with the Florida renewals and negotiations. For the property catastrophe XOL renewals, which we have 16 clients, we expect rates to be about flat. The two quarter share counts are more stable because the reinsurance is such an integral part of the capital structure for these primary companies. State regulators have been buffeted by the changing political winds coming out of Tallahassee, but as we sit here today I anticipate a fairly steady renewal season in June. The combined ratio for the overall US reinsurance business was 92.4% in the quarter excluding caps, the attritional combine was 79.3 up 3.9 points over last year.  Our specialty business was up nearly 12% in the quarter, this was driven by strong demand in our Accident and Health segment. More and more employers are self insuring their medical programs leading to more opportunities for us in the medical Stop Loss business. It's an evolving space as people try to measure the impact of healthcare reform, but change usually means opportunity, so I expect continued growth for us in NH. Our marine book continues to shrink as fewer profitable opportunities are apparent to us in this line. The explosion and sinking of the Horizon oil rig in the Gulf looks like a total loss and we expect our share to be about $20 million in the second quarter. This law should impact the offshore energy market, which have many contracts renewing in July. We're not a big player in the offshore market, but there maybe some new opportunities. The combined ratio for the specialty segment was 95.6 about the same as last year.  The Bermuda operations were down 5.3% in the quarter to $207 million. This includes London and Continental Europe as well as Bermuda. London was up 13% and Europe was down about 27% from last year. We’re seeing significant competition in Europe particularly in the property lines, the impact on the market from the storms from Cynthia should become evident in the next couple of quarters as there were very significant losses sustained in France, Spain and Portugal should impact the market going forward. The combined ratio for Bermuda was as you know heavily impacted by European storm Cynthia, but the attritional combine was 84.2, 2.5 points over last year. The last segment to comment upon is the US reinsurance business. Gross premiums were up 11% to [$128 million] much of this growth comes from our direct specialty operation in New York, which will begin in April 2009. Expect that pre-proportion of direct specialty lines to increase as a percentage of our total insurance writings as the year progresses. Prices for general liability products were flat year-over-year, workers comp was up on an average of about 8.5% for the quarter. Results for insurance segment have stabilized at 99.1%, combined ratio resulting principally from management actions to improve the expense ratio for both underwriting as well as claims management. I expect these trends that I’ve outlined to continue for the balance of the year, as we play offense on the property lines and international development of our business, we’ll play defense in the casualty as well as the marine markets. And overall growth, I believe flat to modestly up as we go forward in 2010. Now let me turn it over to Dom.
Dominic Addesso: Thanks Ralph and good morning. As noted, earnings for the quarter were most affected by first quarter CAT losses of $354 million. This led to a net loss of $22.7 million for the quarter. Nonetheless, comprehensive income for the quarter was $6.3 million led by an unrealized gain on the bond portfolio of $34.6 million after tax. This increase to book value was offset by share purchases of $47 million and dividends of $28 million in the quarter resulting in an overall decline in shareholders equity of $64.8 million to $6 billion or $102.46 per share. Turning to the P&L you just heard from Ralph on the details of premium by segment. Overall, there was approximately 26% positive impact to gross premiums written in 2010 and currency movements of the dollar weakened compared to last year’s first quarter. From an incurred loss standpoint the total CAT losses of $354 million for the quarter breaks down as follows. $290 million for Chile, $30 million for Cynthia, and $35 million for the two hail storms in Australia. These losses equate to 38.2 points on a combined ratio. The estimate for Chilean losses was based on the average of three valuation methodologies. First after consulting with our clients and visiting with them in Chile, we conducted a detailed review of our contracts as to where and how they were exposed. Damageability factors will then apply for these contracts based on the client discussions and observed events. The second method in tail running the CAT model event set against our portfolio. Final technique was determining an estimate based on the industry range of $4 to $10 billion and our market share. An average of the high and low of each of these methods was calculated and an average of all three methods was use for our loss estimate. The two extreme points in all of these methods was $238 million and $386 million. From a market share perspective at the low-end of the industry range we have estimated that our market shares stands at approximately 6%. Of the high-end of the industry loss, our estimated market share drops to approximately 3%. This difference is first the result of our XOL contracts, which generally attached lower now fully exhausted as the loss rises.  Second is that our proportional covers continue to risk limits, which required facultative support above certain values. As the loss rises, it is more like that the larger values, which are placed in the facultative markets are likely to be a disproportionate share of that increase. Finally, we were not a significant writer of facultative reinsurance in this region, so we were less exposed to the larger risks. Current year attritional loss equaled 59.5 points on a combined ratio as compared to 55.7 one year ago. While this reflects consideration of marketplace loss trends along with relatively flat pricing particularly in the reinsurance segments. The overall combined ratio for the current action year excluding CAT is still quite positive at approximately 87 points. When added to the CAT losses of 38.2 points this accounts for virtually all of the total combined ratio of 124.9. The expense ratio for the quarter improved 1.1 points to 27.1 as a result of improved terms on certainty insurance contracts and the effective reinstatement premiums on which there is no brokerage. Whenever these items are just covered resulted in an underwriting loss for quarter of 231 million compared to gain of a 100 million in prior year’s quarter. The largest year-over-year differences were $321 million in CAT losses and $33 million in current year attritional losses offset by a positive swing of $13 million in commissions and a $17 million favorable variance in the prior year losses. Investment income for the quarter for the 161.5 million compared to 68.8 million one year ago. The primary reason for the difference was due to our income from limited partnerships. In 2010 our income from this asset class was 16 million compared to a $73 million loss one year ago, the main component of our investment income that being from fixed income securities had a slight increase this year to 145.2 million. This increase was muted somewhat by a small reallocation of our portfolio into equity securities with an emphasis on dividends. This resulted in an increase of $2 million in income from equity securities.  Other miscellaneous items in our P&L include a net derivative gain of $3 million for the quarter compared to a loss of $20 million in a prior year and a currency gain included in other income of $5.5 million in the quarter compared to a $5.6 million loss in 2009. Income tax expense for the quarter declined to 12.9 million compared to 24.5 million in 2009. Despite the loss before income tax there was nevertheless at tax expense reported for the quarter due in part to taxes on realized gains for the quarter. The tax benefit on the pre-tax operating loss of $82.5 million at in effective tax rate of 10.5% is not sufficient to offset the statutory taxes on realized gains of 72.7 million. In summary, the above sited details resulted in total comprehensive income for the quarter 6.3 million compared to 105.8 million in 2009, this results in a shareholders equity account which was not diminished by the significant CAT losses for the quarter and leaves us with more than sufficient capital to grow our portfolio and consider share repurchases as the opportunities arise. Finally, it should be pointed out that the $200 million or 8.75% senior notes outstanding at year-end matured in first quarter. This borrowing was not refinanced and was redeemed out of operating cash flow. Thank you and with that I’ll turn the call back to back to Beth for Q&A.
Beth Farrell: Thank you, Casey.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) We take our first question from Jay Gelb with Barclays Capital.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital: I wanted to go back to the Chile earthquake loss. What's the risk here that Everest could have adverse development on that claim given the complex nature of it?
Dom Addesso: Jay, this is Dom Addesso, well we certainly have gone through a vigorous process of coming up with our point estimate and it is still very early days in determining what the total losses are to the industry. But I think we’ve been reasonably conservative in coming up with our point estimate and if you think about the industry loss estimates of some where between $4 billion and $10 billion our point estimate centers around approximately 7.25 billion of industry loss estimate, but nevertheless, as I’ve described, we believe that as the loss increases as the industry loss increases we would have a decrease in share, market share of any rising loss, so it is difficult to determine where that loss might go from here, but nevertheless we think we’ve done a pretty vigorous job coming up with our point estimate. That being said, it is an estimate and we’ll see where it goes from here.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital: Okay and then two other points. The first is, I was just a little confused in terms of what the potential is for the remainder of the year on topline growth, on gross written premium. There were a couple of numbers there. And second, Joe, could you comment on how this type of loss should match up with your expectations for this type of industry event with regard to risk management practices at Everest?
Joe Taranto: Yes your first question topline growth, we’re up a little bit in the quarter and I kind of noted there a some pockets where we still can’t see growth and see profitable opportunities but going against that, there are other pockets of the world as I noted US casualty were it’s getting tougher and so in that sense the likelihood is less business so it gets a little bit difficult to put it all together and I guess what I kind of noted to you was flattish, if you will at the end of the day now we may be up if things were to get a little bit better than that, but we’re not talking about the year with lot of topline growth I think is the bottom line.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital: Is that inclusive of the first quarter, which obviously includes some reinstatement premium were flattish for the year including the first quarter?
Joe Taranto : Well, I guess I am more talking about the next month, next nine months, since you already have the first quarter, but I think it’s kind to be pretty much the same scenario, we may be up 5%, we may be down 5% at the end of the day, I can’t really be much more precise than that. I think to me the most important thing is growing where it makes sense to grow and decreasing where frankly that’s the right answer as well. You saw last year how we were able to grow nicely where we had little bit of wind to our back and some up the sectors and certainly had some market opportunities, there’s less of that this year as we move into our market where large parts of it continue to slowly go down if you will, large parts of it remain adequately rated, but it’s not reclaiming where I think I could convey to you nor should you expect any sort of meaningful topline growth. As far as the Chilean loss, I’ll start maybe I’ll have Ralph add to it, but I think you have to remember that we’ve been in very important part of the Latin American market for many, many years going back to the [prove] days, we’re really one of the major reinsures and Latin America, and so I think you have to expect if there is a major loss there but yes, we’re going to have a participation in that we’ve made a lot of money in Latin America, including Chile in the last number of years. We expect to continue to work with our clients to do very well and be profitable in the coming years, so I think when you put all into the right context it’s not particularly surprising loss that we did have. It’s frankly good to know that with this loss and throwing on top of that Australia, and on top of that European storms, nonetheless essentially our book value per share, everything in, is pretty much the same which gets you back to just the strength of the company. Ralph, anything you wanted to add to that or…
Ralph Jones: I would just say that Chile losses stand as pretty much what we expected within our modeled PMLs and as part of the overall risk management review that we do at every country, but as you know, as Joe mentioned, we have a very significant international operation, we got annualized premiums of $1 billion in just a segment that I described plus an additional big component out of the Bermuda ops segment, which is really London and Continental Europe, so it’s more like $5 billion overall.
Joe Taranto: An 8.8 quake pretty close to the capital of Chile, not our usual event.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Matthew Heimermann with JPMorgan.
Matthew Heimermann - JPMorgan: A couple of follow-up questions on Chile, the first thing that what all the numbers you gave, are those net loss estimates including or excluding reinstatements?
Dom Addesso: Matthew, it would be gross losses excluding reinstatement pre-tax. 
Matthew Heimermann - JPMorgan: Then does gross and net compare?
Joe Taranto: It’s a fair statement of tax.
Matthew Heimermann - JPMorgan: No, I mean is gross loss equal net loss ex-reinstatements? 
Dom Addesso: The reinstatement premium on Chile is approximately $20 million and which we have $290 million gross loss. So, net reinstatements that would net $270 million pre-tax.
Matthew Heimermann - JPMorgan: That’s helpful, but I guess I was asking do you have any outwards reinsurance, that is applicable to this?
Dom Addesso: No.
Matthew Heimermann - JPMorgan: Then the other question was when I look at the loss range that you have that $238 million to $386 million, I know you average a bunch of things, but your $290 million is I think below or would be a midpoint of $312 million. Why in the low end relative to high end, given that most of the risks seem to be the upside rather than downside?
Dom Addesso: All the methods that we used, most of the estimates around the other methods kind of clustered around the $290 million. The $386 million that I gave you was really on one point in all the point estimates and all those methodologies, and that was the outlier, but it clustered around the $290 million.
Matthew Heimermann - JPMorgan: What method drove that?
Dom Addesso: The three methods are outline, market share, underwrite 
Matthew Heimermann - JPMorgan: Which one corresponded to the $386 million?
Dom Addesso: The underwrite estimates. 
Matthew Heimermann - JPMorgan: Then with respect just to the accident year loss ratios in the US reinsurance and international segment, those increased pretty dramatically versus the full year 2009 levels, and you’d mentioned that there was $33 million of attritional current year loss. Is that the delta in those or is there other something else at work?
Dom Addesso: That was the year-over-year difference in current year attritional losses.
Matthew Heimermann – JPMorgan: What was the absolute number I guess then because I’m actually comparing it to full year ‘09 rather than just last year’s quarter?
Ralph Jones: Three points on total year.
Matthew Heimermann - JPMorgan: The other question, I was just going to throw out another numbers question was just can you remind us how much crop business there was last year, like a 140 is sticking in my mind, but I can’t recall where that’s coming from?
Ralph Jones: The annualize crop ratings last year is about $80 million and we renewed most of the programs so far this year. We lost good one through company that was very recently acquired and didn’t buy that quota share.
Dom Addesso: The dollar amount of attritional current year losses in the quarter was $551.6 million.
Matthew Heimermann - JPMorgan: Than anything else I want to hit? Could you just on the development, basically was neutral in the quarter, but any pluses and minuses?
Dom Addesso: There’s a lots of what we call IBNR group or loss reserve groups that we would look at 100 and so there’s movement all the time in all those and if I have to point couple of areas that still gave us some development was in our professional and our sub-prime area, and that of course was offset by number of other areas, if there is anyone that I can really point to.
Matthew Heimermann - JPMorgan: If I recall, subprime is now about $100 million or $120 million reserve, well I think what it was at year end. Where does it stand now?
Dom Addesso: About $11 million higher 
Ralph Jones: $110 million.
Joe Taranto: I think we’re feeling better and better about the potential losses coming out the subprime area. We have a formula that kind of dictates what we put up there, I think perhaps feeding too much in terms the current underwriting feelings that it seems to be shaping up better than originally thought.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll take our next question from Ian Gutterman with Adage Capital.
Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital: Just I guess first following up on Chile, the $20 million in reinstatement due is that in the international segment, in Bermuda bit a both?
Dom Addesso:  Would be both
Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital: Do you have a split on that, a rough split?
Ralph Jones: It’s roughly $13 million in the international segment and some it comes from treaty property in the US segment, it is still a little bit Bermuda.
Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital: Just as far as where your losses came from, can you give us a feel for sort of what the quote of share component was versus what XOL? If any retro kicked in, and were you ensuring sort of the indigenous Chilean carriers on Chile-only contracts or these sort of Global Cats for the large European companies who were down there that you maybe have larger limits than a solely Chile country? What I mean, I’m trying to get a feel for sort of what types of contracts are out there?
Ralph Jones:  There were seven XOL contracts and seven proportional contracts, of the seven proportional two were international companies and rests were smaller join companies. 
Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital: Out of the XOL, where were those areas specific or do they tend to be global, global non-US covers?
Ralph Jones:  About the same split.
Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital: So it doesn’t sound like you have a lot of exposure then to I guess the ones that I hear about having the most risk of average development are sort of these global covers for the big Europeans that have big limits, because they were not necessarily written for Chile. They were written for Australia or whatever may be and that as such there’s more risk of limits of having a lot of room left on limits than there would be on an addition to the Chilean carriers. Is that a fair assessment?
Ralph Jones: Yes, that’s probably fair.
Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital: Any retro exposed?
Ralph Jones: No…
Dom Addesso: We don’t believe so.
Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital: In Florida, can you talk a little bit about, obviously there’s a lot of concern about the takeouts or capital bid offs or whatever we call them these days. As far as they’ve a stop and see and their results and what have been carry years and so forth. Can you just talk a little bit about the quality of your book down there? How you get comfortable that you’ve picked the right cedence down there, that you’re not going to get surprised, that someone doesn’t either or just go out of business without event or if just that, if there is a storm that they’re going to perform a lot worse than maybe you expected, because maybe a little bit more of a fly by night than you realized.
Ralph Jones:  Yes, this is Ralph. We’ve been enforced pretty heavily for a number of years and we have 16 clients that we write XOL programs for, and that makes up about $50 million some on in premium. The process to review them is significant every year. Certainly, we watch what’s going on in the underlying rates and politics coming out of the Office of Insurance Regulation, but 16 are good, they’ve gone through begin all the bidding process the last few years, and its survival of the fed is down there for these guys. So we might renew a couple less going forward based on the credit review, but we like the ones once we’ve had and we’ve had very little really minimal in the ride offs, that we wrote off about $150,000 at one installment last year and another company got acquired, but I think more importantly, from the underwriting standpoint for us is the two quarter shares and we’re very actively involved with these two guys and like the managements and like what they’re doing and we think they’re going to be sound.
Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital: Out of the 16 clients, how many of them were formed after Katrina as part of this capital build up program?
Ralph Jones: I would say 80% of them were, what you considered as capital build up it characterizes capital build up companies. It’s very hard there are 60 people in the universe of company that Demotech reviews, I’ll just gives you a flavor, we only do 16.
Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital: I mean, how do you decide, I guess I'm trying to get a feel for how you assess that 2006 startup X. Is it better than 2006 startup Y? It just seems some of these once they went down, some of them more maybe a little bit obvious, but some maybe surprising people too?
Ralph Jones: I think if you wrote a higher proportion of the 60 and you haven’t done the credit review in depth on each one you’re going to being more susceptible to the folks that have trouble, but the review process is quite significant looking into the financials exactly where they make their money, a lot of these are private companies. So you have to go way beyond the statutory statement to see what’s actually going on and where the money is coming out into their MGA’s arrangements and so on, and what kind of reinsurance program they buy. We visit with them and spent a lot of time with them and go to their underwriting plans, in many cases the fact that we are proportional to makes that in much more important thing to do. So we’re pretty close to the companies. We had a no real problems with those kind of have some financial problems up to-date, but once that we have done well and as I said we’re close to them, not only their financial statements, but their underwriting plans and their management and there are certainly a number of reinsurance that are just excel well, but really don’t spend time with these companies.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll take our next question from Brian Meredith with UBS.
Brian Meredith - UBS: A couple questions here. On the investment income, if I take a look at your fixed maturities, sequentially actually a pretty good increase. Was there something unusual in this quarter or fourth quarter that I'm kind of missing? It looks like the run rate portfolio is up pretty significantly.
Dom Addesso: There’s nothing unusual on this quarter, when you say sequentially, you mean compared I’m assuming 
Brian Meredith - UBS: Fourth quarter '09.
Dom Addesso: In the fourth quarter, we had in part some adjustment in some of amortization adjustments and then we also carried a little bit more cash, I think we’re carrying now in the fourth quarter.
Joe Taranto: I think if anything unusual, it was in the fourth quarter, not 
Brian Meredith - UBS: Next question, Joe you mentioned terms and conditions starting to slip a little bit here. I'm wondering if you can kind of drill down a little bit and exactly where are you starting to see the terms and conditions slipping has it gotten worse here in the first quarter? I assume you’re also referring to some of the underlying business?
Joe Taranto: Well, to be honest for you, to battle some to-date has been more on the rate side than it has been on the terms and conditions side. I don’t like to see it either way and the history has been that you do start to erode on terms and conditions as it well, but I would again just point you back to the US casualty side and where there are a lot of classes. Now there are some classes, Ralph mentioned California comp, there are some positive signs for the last few months and there are some other small pockets, but most of the general liability in the umbrella business and then routine if you well non-specialized casualty, we’re seeing rate go down and maybe a little bit of slippage in terms and conditions. It’s kind of a tough thing to read through, but on the umbrella programs its attachment points and attachment point go to some of the tough exposures like auto, and any transportation exposures. So as that happens it really start to erode the potential profitability and then of course when you get into the reinsurance transitions and buying three protection. There’s a lot of pressure on the ceding commission, those would be the kind of two areas of focus for our guys. 
Dom Addesso: We’ve had actually improvement in ceding commission. So depending on whether you include seating commission in that category of terms and conditions, that’s actually been an improvement for us year-over-year so.
Brian Meredith – UBS:  Then on the Chile business and focusing the losses and kind of focus on what do you think the prospects are going forward down in South America? What changes do you anticipate in the marketplace and I am also curious, when do your contracts renew and do you expect any kind of big shakeup down there?
Joe Taranto: I do expect the as the market change in South America it’ll certainly change dramatically in my opinion in Chile, but I think it will be extended into the other CAT areas within South America, now will be less impact as you get away from South America. Number of out contracts come up mid year July and then we have a few thing come up in January, so we can over right now having our own discussions with regard to the upcoming July renewals, but I expect meaningful change within South America.
Brian Meredith – UBS: Great thank you.
Joe Taranto: Before the next question I would just like to go back to that we have some questions on the change in the attritional and lot of that got into the numbers, but I think I'd like to ask Dom to provide a little bit of color as to just why we choose a different point if you will for the attritional loss ratio this quarter.
Dom Addesso: I think the first thing that we consider going into the marketplace because has been pretty difficult here for several quarters is to certainly trying to be as conservative as we can be kind of in the early part of the year picking that current year action have taken, I think we've done that and that's in part the most significant reason why you see the horizon in the current year attritional year-over-year. Also remembering that we’re not that far away for our fourth quarter reserve review and of course coming out of that reserve review we have a view on what that most recent accident year was, so essentially the process that we engage in here now is to look at that most recent reserve review and in effect bridge it into the first quarter by building some loss trend into the New Year as well as overlaying on that loss estimate rate increase and/or lack thereof. So and then on top of that try to be as conservative as reasonably possible to reflect what we think our market conditions and its early years, but we felt it was the most prudent thing to do as we begin the year.
Beth Farrell: Any further questions Casey.
Operator: Thank you, yes, we’ll take our next question from the Vinay Misquity of Credit Suisse
Vinay Misquith - Credit Suisse: Just to follow up on that, on the attritional losses once again. On the US reinsurance and the international reinsurance segments, the loss picks or the attritional loss picks are up around five points. So I just want to get a sense versus the fourth quarter of last year and versus the full year numbers, I just want to get a sense is pricing down four to five points this year versus last year? Is that why you are taking your loss picks up?
Dom Addesso: Well, in particular on those two segments just maybe some detailed wouldn’t have seen last year, but those two particular segments had some loss development in coming out of prior years so they talked about kind of our methodologies that was more leaning towards try to take conservative view of those segments as we begin the year, as opposed to any dramatic price movement in fact those are probably be the areas where we’ve had some year-over-year probably the property lines there either flat to up so it really didn’t have anything to with pricing. 
Joe Taranto: I think it basically Vinay more of cautious outlook that’s the summary.
Vinay Misquith - Credit Suisse: The second question was on the Chilean loss. Just curious as to when you will be required to pay those losses and how we should expect the development for that?
Dom Addesso: Well we’ve actually already paid some losses approximately $40 million have paid losses so far partly it’s not just because of actual loss notices as much as some of our contracts of allow for cash advances and so we’ve already paid some losses.
Vinay Misquith - Credit Suisse : So I just want to get a sense for how long do we have to wait for us to get to the final resolution on this? How long would have be six months, a year before we can be sure to put this to bed?
Dom Addesso: Well my expectations would be that certainly by the end of the year we’d have a very, very clear picture of where the total loss stands. Now in fact how those losses payout would be very difficult to project at this point, but I would certainly expect by 3 to 4 quarter we’d have a much better handle on where to industry losses are coming in notwithstanding the fact that we think we’ve done a pretty rigorous job of estimating it today.
Operator: Thank you. We have a follow-up from Matthew Heimermann with JP Morgan.
Matthew Heimermann - JP Morgan: A couple follow-ups actually, on the horizon loss, I’m correct, right, that’s all going to be in the specialty segment in 2Q?
Joe Taranto: Yes.
Matthew Heimermann - JP Morgan: With respect to the attritional loss on commentary you had, are that specific to one product category broadly like casualty, or property, or is it kind of all lines?
Dom Addesso: It’s across the board Matt.
Matthew Heimermann - JP Morgan: The last thing was on the US Insurance segment, the retention dropped a lot and I’m assuming a big driver of that is probably mix, because I think you’re reinsuring the new lines a little bit more aggressively, but my question was, when I think about retention in that line for the balance of the year, should we expect retention to drop in subsequent quarters as well or is there any timing issues that make 1Q bigger than the rest of the year?
Ralph Jones: No, we reinsured one particularly large casualty program, which is the big gross to net swing in the quarter and that would be similar outlook through the course of the year.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) We’ll take our next question from Ron Bobman with Capital Returns.
Ron Bobman - Capital Returns: It’s a painful wait hearing all those questions from Heimermann. I just had a question, one question. In the area of sort of offshore energy rig operators, generally speaking would companies that buy cover for property and I guess liability as well. Would their reinstatement coverage be largely of a like-size as the first event cover? How is the pricing generally on the reinstatement amount? Is it basically at a comparable amount or a marginally higher? Then I had follow-up. Again generally speaking, I’m not looking into trying to find out Transocean’s program, but just generally speaking.
Joe Taranto: Ralph and I kind of have this confused look with each other here, as we hear that question and I think the reality is, we’ll speak to our marine experts and get back to you on that to give you better idea than I think could give you.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we have no further questions. I’ll turn the conference back over to Ms. Farrell for any additional or closing remarks.
Elizabeth Farrell: Thank you for participating in our conference call. Certainly, if you have any questions, please feel free to call me after the call. Again, thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today’s presentation. We appreciate your participation and you may now disconnect.

===== 2009 Q4  (2010-02-11 13:00:00) =====
Executives: Elizabeth B. Farrell - Vice President Investor Relations Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer Ralph E. Jones III - President, Chief Operating Officer Dominic J. Addesso - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President
Analysts:  Brian Meredith - UBS  Matthew Heimermann - J.P. Morgan Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital  Matthew Heimermann - J.P. Morgan 
Operator:  Good morning, everyone and welcome to the fourth quarter 2009 earnings release call of Everest Group Limited. (Operator's Instruction) At this time for opening remarks I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Beth Farrell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead ma'am.
Elizabeth B. Farrell:  Good morning and welcome to Everest Re Group's fourth quarter and full year 2009 earnings conference call. With me today are Joe Taranto, the company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Ralph Jones, President and Chief Operating Officer and Dom Addesso, our Chief Financial Officer.  Before we begin I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward looking statements. In that regard I note that statements made during today's call which are forward looking in nature, such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations and the like are subject to various risks. As you know actual results could differ materially from our projections or expectations. Our SEC filings have the full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements. Now let me turn the call over to Joe Taranto.  
Joseph V. Taranto: Thank you Beth, good afternoon everyone. Looking back at 2009, we're pleased with what we achieved. Most notably we were able to increase our worldwide premium base by 12% to $4.1 billion. As we capitalized on market dislocations and property rate increases created by the financial meltdown from late 2008.  Our successes included a great start for our new office in Brazil, growing our international books on attractive accounts which was aided by some of our major competitors having financial problems, maintaining a leadership position in the retro property market and the Florida property market, maintaining our core casualty reinsurance clients starting a new insurance operation to respond to the future need for a financial institution directs and officers liability, and adding a new insurance program for smaller financial institutions. Looking forward, I was pleased with our January 1 renewals and the quality of our portfolio remains very strong. This comes despite catastrophe excess rates being somewhat lower, and a continued slow decline in casualty insurance rates. Let me explain why. First, much of the momentum we had in the international reinsurance sector, including the development of our presence in Brazil, continued in 2010. Further, on our U.S. property reinsurance portfolio, we added a couple of new meaningful single state accounts that although CAT in nature didn't add to our largest zone. Hence more premium and more spread.  Much of our worldwide property reinsurance book is done on a pro rata basis, not excess of loss, and accordingly not impacted by excess of loss catastrophe rate changes. This includes most of our business in Florida as well. And although the foreign treaties renew mid-year, our clients have recently been given permission by the insurance department to charge higher rates. On our pro rata accounts, these increases will inure to our benefit as well, increasing our premium and our potential margin.  Our casualty reinsurance book is half of what it was a year ago, as we have responded to rate changes in the market. Our reinsurance book has switched from predominantly casualty in 2004 to predominantly property in 2010. We have taken the casualty book down to a few core clients who we know well and we believe in their ability to manage through the current market place successfully.  Our insurance book is mostly casualty, but roughly half the book is either workers comp or D&O and E&O for financial institutions. In bot of these areas we are currently getting rate increases. We will need to remain disciplined in parts of the casualty insurance market that continue to be challenging. Ralph will provide more details on 2009 and 2010 underwriting activities in a moment.  In 2009 we were also pleased to have grown book value per share by 27% and finished the year with $6.1 billion of surplus. In addition we paid $117 million in dividends for the year. The company repurchased roughly $100 million of it's shares in the fourth quarter and $190 million for the year To company has more than sufficient capital for it's current business plans and expects to continue to buy back stock in the first quarter.  Under the current repurchase authorization 3.5 million shares remain. Dom will provide more details on the financial's momentarily. In summary, 2009 was a very good year, top line and bottom line. Given the successful (inaudible) renewal, we expect growth in our international reinsurance book which is mostly property reinsurance and growth in our U.S. property reinsurance book. All without increasing our PML in our biggest zone. These two areas have been our most profitable and most well rated. We will take a disciplined underwriting approach to our casualty business, both insurance and reinsurance. And without a market correction, these sectors will likely decrease. I expect our overall worldwide composite portfolio to remain high quality so I have every reason to expect 2010 to be a good year. Ralph?
Ralph E. Jones III :  Thank you Joe. The international reinsurance business was a very strong driver for both growth and underwriting profits in 2009. We wrote $1.08 billion last year up 20% in U.S. dollars and up 23% when adjusted for local currencies. The combined ratio was 86%. The Brazil operation was essentially new this year, adding $68 million in 2009. Canada at $163 million and Asia at $222 million both grew at 17%. Some of the growth came from increased rates for catastrophe exposed business in the 5% to 7% range during the year. About 60% of our international book renews in the first quarter, predominantly January 1. We had a strong renewal season in January with premiums up 14% driven equally by increased rates, some new business and increased signings. Primary property rates were up in South Africa and Australia.   The U.S. reinsurance business finished at $1.17 billion up 22% over 2008. The growth here was principally driven by the addition of our crop reinsurance business which added $85 million during the year. The combined ration was 76.8% for the year drive virtually by no CAT loss activity. The largest segment within U.S. reinsurance is our treaty property book, which was a strong driver in of the growth in underwriting profit. About half of our U.S. reinsurance book renews on January 1, and we were happy with the stability of the market at 1/1. CAT rates for the bulk of our book held up pretty well at renewal with an overall impact in the range of -5%.   We were able to fill out the treaty property book with several new state programs that have good pricing margins but do not add to our peak's on aggregate cap exposure.   The casualty reinsurance book was down at year end, except for one long time client that moved from an excess of loss program to quarter share. This was done principally for reasons of surplus relief for them.    The year end renewal negotiations for treaty casualty again, half the book renews at 1/1 were more challenging across the board, which leads me to expect this book to be down for 2010.   The Bermuda operations which include the UK and Continental Europe wrote nearly $800 million in 2009. About the same volume as last year in U.S. dollars and up 6% in local currencies. The combined ratio for the year was 89% which includes $29 million in CAT losses mostly due to the earthquake in Italy.   Nearly 80% of our Bermuda and European reinsurance book renews during the first quarter. We saw more competition in Continental Europe at year end, as well as with the property retro market. We eliminated 70% of our aggregate exposures for the Bermuda property retro account due to increased capacity available to the brokers principally from new participants. From those accounts we renewed the average rate drop was about 5%. Many retro clients had clearly demonstrated increased exposures in their underlying book that we thought was not adequately reflected by some of the new players in the segment.   The U.S. retro account was more stable as contrasted with Bermuda I expect Continental Europe to be down in 2010 and London to be about flat with the total Bermuda operations to be down modestly for 2010.   The specialty segment was $235 million, down 10% for the year and 23% for the quarter. The combined ratio in 2009 was 104% driven mainly by the marine book. Several large quarter share marine contracts reported late claims during the renewal process. Two thirds of the marine book renews during the first quarter and based on the difficult negotiations at 1/1 we expect the book to be substantially down for 2010. I am not excited about the profit potential in the marine market.  Accident and health insurity which make up the balance of our specialty lines were both profitable and growing. That sums up a very good year for the reinsurance business. $3.3 billion up 13% at 85% combined. Year end renewals were pretty strong. In 2010 I expect international will be up, treaty property will be up, casualty will be down and marine will be down. Now let me turn to our primary insurance business, Everest National.   The insurance segment ended the year at $843 million, up 9.2% over 2008. The growth came principally from our direct insurance operations in ENS property and E&O and D&O for financial institutions. The direct business now makes up 20% of our insurance business and will become an increasingly large share over time. The combined ratio for the year was 109.9% which included a $45 million charge in the fourth quarter due to a comprehensive reserve study at year end. The underlying casualty market in the U.S. is very competitive, probably the most challenging environment in which we operate. The eight core program managers that we support which makes up the other 80% of our insurance book, all faced declining renewal retentions as we execute our rate plans. Combined ratio for the 2009 accident year at 101% shows we still have work to do on our program book.  For the fourth quarter rates were up 5% overall with the bulk of those increases coming from California workers comp, whose prospects are improving. I expect our core eight program managers to be down next year as we continue to drive rate improvement. We will also need to continue the belt tightening on expenses and commissions to meet our objectives. Our strategy here is pretty simple. Maintain the core eight program managers, increase rates by at least 5% on average and improve the expense ratio at the same time. Anything new will come from an acquisition of a specialty company, or MGA that can demonstrate a competitive advantage on the requisite margin that follows.   With programs declining, I expect the direct specialty business to become a bigger and bigger proportion of our insurance business over time. Let me now turn it over to Dom Addesso. 
Dominic J. Addesso: Thanks Ralph and good afternoon. As noted earnings for the quarter continued the favorable trend experienced throughout the year The comparisons of net income to the prior year results for both the quarter and year to date are quite dramatic, due in large part to the after tax realized capital losses of $196 million in last years fourth quarter and $581 million for the entire year of 2008. These losses were a result of the financial market crisis, as securities were adjusted to fair value or sold. Operating income for the year excluding realized capital losses on the other hand increased to $12.51 per share compared to $9.10 per share in 2008. This year over year comparison was largely influenced by $364 million of CAT losses in 2008 versus $67 million in 2009. On a quarterly basis, operating earnings per share increased 9% to $3.19 compared to $2.92 in 2008.  You just heard from Ralph the details on premiums by segment, but overall the increase in gross written was 14.8% for the quarter and 12.3% for the year. The impact of foreign currency on premiums was not significant for the quarter but for the year premiums increased approximately 14% after adjusted for foreign currency, due to the weakening dollar.  Premium (inaudible) for the year of $3.9 billion produced an underwriting gain of $407 million compared to $162 million in 2008. On a quarterly basis the underwriting gain of $85 million in 2009 compared to a gain of $150 million in the prior years quarter. These underwriting results were driven by several factors. In both the quarter over quarter and year over year comparisons, there was an improvement in the commission and brokerage ratio of 2.8 points and 1.4 points respectively. This was primarily due to improved seating commission terms on reinsurance contracts and reductions in profit share on certain insurance contracts. While the underwriting expenses rose slightly, a staff was added to build out our financial institutions business. Another factor in the analysis of underwriting results was the development of prior year losses. During the quarter we added $92 million to our reserves for prior year attrition losses which amounted to 8.9 points on our loss ratio for the quarter. Year to date we added $125 million or 3.2 loss ratio points.  The development activity in the fourth quarter was the result of our annual loss reserve detailed analysis which indicated a need to add approximately $49 million to reserves in the insurance segment. This along with actions earlier in the year added approximately 9 points to the combined ratio in that segment for the year The balance of the reserve addition of $43 million in the quarter was in our reinsurance book, in both the domestic and international property lines where we experienced a higher than expected level of late reported losses from a small number of contracts, but offset by some favorable development in the casualty book overall.  Also affecting the year over year comparison of underwriting results were CAT losses. CAT losses in 2008 represented almost 10 points or $364 million of loss in 2008 whereas in 2009 the CAT losses were $67 million for the year or 1.7 loss ratio points.  Excluding CAT losses and prior period development, the accident year loss ratio has increased to 56% in 2009 from 55.5% in 2008. The increase is largely evident in the insurance portfolio where the accident year loss ratio has risen to 71.5 from 68.2. This is a reflection in general of a softening market particularly in the casualty lines. In the reinsurance segment the current accident loss ratio was up, but only slightly. Since this portfolio is dominated by property business, where rates in certain markets and products have been firmed.  Reinsurance segments overall had a strong year, exhibiting an accident year combined ratio excluding CAT's of 80.7%. The overall combined ratio on an accident year basis excluding CAT's for the year was 84.2%. And these results produce very favorable cash flow from operations, $785 million for the year and $186 million for the quarter.  Turning to the investment results, you will note that core investment results are down slightly year over year, but up dramatically on the quarter comparison. First the year, which is down $18 million to $548 million. This is mainly attributed to lower yield available for new money as well as what we had invested in our short term accounts where yields have been at historically low levels. As a result funds in short term instruments have been reduced over the prior year end. Overall the yield on our fixed income portfolio has increased 27 basis points. Offsetting this was a reduction in the loss from limited partnerships, or a $23 million improvement. And while we did have less income in 2009 from equity securities due to sales in 2008, these proceeds were moved into fixed income securities and had minimal impact on the year to year comparison.  The quarter over quarter comparison is much different, although driven by the same factors. Net investment income for the fourth quarter rose to $146 million from $75 million in the prior year. The largest factor was a swing in limited partnership income to a gain of $10 million in 2009 from a loss of $73 million in 2008.  In terms of our shareholders equity account, the book value has grown to $6.1 billion, or $102.87 per share up from $80.77 per share at the prior year end and $100.75 at the end of the third quarter. The increase in our book value from earnings was of course impacted by the normal shareholder dividends but also other comprehensive income. In the fourth quarter there was approximately $46 million of unrealized loss after tax from our bond portfolio flowing through other comprehensive income. On the other hand, for the year there was an increase of $530 million after tax coming from the bond portfolio. As a result the overall value of our fixed income portfolio is approximately $400 million above amortized cost. The majority of the remaining change and other comprehensive income is derived from translation adjustments which were a decrease of $120 million for the quarter but an increase of $84 million for the year as the dollar weakened for most of the year but rebounded slightly in the fourth quarter. The final factor affecting the equity account was our share repurchases during the year which in 2009 amounted to $190.6 million at an average price of $80.65 per share. This was of course accretive to our $13.22 per share earnings and our $102.87 book value per share and added positively to our 15% return on equity.  With that I will turn it back to Beth for the Q & A.
Elizabeth B. Farrell: Caitlin we are ready for questions.
Operator:  Thank you. (Operator's Instructions) And we'll take our first question from the line of Brian Meredith from UBS. Please go ahead. 
Brian Meredith - UBS :  Good afternoon. A couple of questions here. The first one, I think on the primary business when we look at the reserve increase there. I guess the question is what is now the loss trend assumption that you're assuming in that – I guess it's the contractors book of business? It's like loss cost inflation because obviously when you took the reserve charge -  
Ralph E. Jones III:  Let me explain the reserve – you know, we do our reserve review of course every quarter but we do a more comprehensive one at year end, and we decided to strengthen the reserves for the insurance company quite substantially at year end as you can see. This came principally from two run off programs that ended back in 2007, so I'm kind of happy to get those behind us and strengthen our reserve position so as we head into a softer market we'll be fully reserved so to speak.   You know the accident year run rate for the insurance group we moved up three points as you can notice from 2009 from Dom's commentary - 
Dominick J. Addesso:  I think it's 68-71 on the loss ratio. 
Ralph E. Jones III: On the loss yeah, so that moves up to combined right over 100, so that's where we see the book is today, so what we need to do is to continue that rate increase and the belt tightening that will improve the overall combined for the insurance group which we're confident we can do.
Brian Meredith - UBS :  And how did the professional liability business do this quarter? 
Ralph E. Jones III:  Extremely well. So – you know the direct business which is the biggest component as our D&O and E&O business and also the property business in Florida was also combined under 90. 
Brian Meredith - UBS :  Okay, excellent. And then on the Florida business, Joe, you talked about rate increases and how that should positively affect that business. What about wind credits, how could that factor into your quote of share business?
Ralph E. Jones III:  Yeah, the wind mitigation credits that the Florida companies have had to endure over the last couple of years are kind of in the results or in the book. What's really changed there is the kind of overall attitude or orientation of the insurance department because a year ago they were forcing these guys to be more and more competitive and now with concerns about solvency of some of the Florida companies they're kind of taking the opposite tact and they're granting 15% rate increases pretty much to anybody who asks for one. So on our largest client they were granted a 15% rate increase in October and that really should not only take care of some of the credit issues but also as you go into 2010 will look pretty good.
Joseph V. Taranto :  Yeah, for our bigger clients as Ralph noted we got the 15%rate increase which kind of works to our benefit. The wind mitigation credit is something that the department is still tackling. I think there's a lot of agreement that there's been abuse in that system and I think there will be changes going forward that will also help the companies in terms of generating a better result into the future. Little unclear just how much that will be at this stage of the game. But the rate increase, 15% that's just clear and being applied to all policies.  
Brian Meredith - UBS :   Great. Thank you.  
Operator:  We'll take our next question from the line of Jay Gelb with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead. 
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital: Specialty Re seems to be another challenging segment. Can you tell us a little about what was going on in the fourth quarter there? 
Ralph E. Jones III:  Jay, this Ralph. It's principally the marine business. We had a couple of large contracts quoted shares that did not perform well, came up for renewal at 1/1 and we were not able to come to an agreement on the negotiations for each of those so that was the center of my conversation in the report, which was that marine results and what that's going to mean for a drop in revenue in that area for the next year  
Joseph V. Taranto:  The other components of the specialty the accident and health insurity did perform in fact quite well.  
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital :  So the loss issues especially on an accident year basis were driven by the marine book? 
Ralph E. Jones III:   Correct.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital : Ralph, if you put all your comments together in terms of the moving pieces within the franchise, did it still lead you to roughly – and now with a roughly flat-ish premium growth in 2010 overall?  
Ralph E. Jones III: For the entire organization?
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital : Yes.
Ralph E. Jones III: I would say it would probably be up in the single digit range. 
Joseph V. Taranto: Yeah, it's hard for us to guess exactly and 1/1 certainly isn't the entire year. Maybe up a bit. But you know, flat-ish is probably the best take away. Some parts will be up mostly property, some parts will be down, mostly casualty.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital : Okay. And then for Dom, the link quarter core investment income, around $146 million in the quarter was down almost $20 million from the third quarter? What was driving that?
Dominic J. Addesso: Well a big part of that was the decline in a limited partnership income, primarily public equities with limited partnerships that are invested in public equities. Probably lag effect and since the third quarter we've sold out some of our public equity exposure in a limited partnership space. 
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital : Okay, and then on the share buy backs with the stock trading slightly below 80% of book. I'm just wondering, do you have any updated thoughts in terms of how fast you'll do the buy back here?
Dominic J. Addesso: Well, again you know we're not going to provide forecasts but clearly we're going to be in the market. We're keen to get into the market as soon as the window opens and we're going to be buying back in the first quarter a reasonable amount. 
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital : Okay, thank you.
Operator:
Matthew Heimermann - J.P. Morgan: Good afternoon everybody. I guess a couple questions. First, just on the reserve increases, can you talk about just how the process of reviewing reserves is the same or different relative to prior years given obviously some of the people on the phone have changed over the last couple of years?
Dominic J. Addesso :  Well, let me explain the process. I;m not sure I can describe completely how it differed from prior years other than maybe a little bit of timing. I obviously came on to the organization in May and there had been previously I guess in prior years some detailed reserve reviews done - partly detailed reviews done at interim quarters. We elected to have a full reserve review done in the fourth quarter which is what gave rise to the adjustment that we just talked about before. But in the intervening quarters we do a fair bit of work as well. We monitor how our losses are performing relative to expected. So constantly monitoring actual losses up against expected losses in many of our segments and what we call reserving groups, if you will. So that is a continuing process throughout the year, but the annual detail or the detail reserve study which was in prior years split into two different quarters we conduct it all in the fourth quarter. 
Matthew Heimermann - J.P. Morgan: Is the by-product of the kind of the change in the quarterly monitoring – is it fair to think that that in future years probably means that the 4Q review will probably be less impactful in terms of the total change to the reserving amount? 
Dominic J. Addesso:  I'm not sure why it would be less impactful but we are actually looking or I'm looking at how we might conduct these reserve studies going forwards into future periods. In fact, moving the dates upon which we examine losses closer to the evaluation date which would give us a better answer and a more timely answer. So there's a number of things that I'm looking at that – in fact may have the reserve study moved back to throughout the year back to a moving calendar. But let me be clear, I think that whether we do the reserve study – the detail reserve study if we split it up into two quarters or do it all in one quarter does not lessen my conviction about where I think reserves are or the process here. I think the process here – the adjustment that we made in the fourth quarter on an overall basis relative to $8 billion in reserves is well within the bounds of reason and I still feel very strongly about our overall reserve position and it's readableness and certainly how – the conservative stance that we're taking here at the end of the fourth quarter. 
Matthew Heimermann - J.P. Morgan: That's fair. And I guess this might be unfair but from an external perspective clearly reserve additions has been kind of a struggle over the last four years in total and it stands in a bit of contrast to the trends that other companies are reporting. I guess – what are you seeing internally that you could maybe communicate externally that makes you feel like you're on top of the issues that have been driving these increases?
Dominic J. Addesso:  Well, let me first say that that's something that I fully expect and am working hard to put behind us and I think that what we've done here in the fourth quarter is - will do just that. So that lets me be clear on that point. And I think there's another element to it. There's also current accident year. And so while you're examining – paying a lot of attention to prior period reserves, as we should then as we did at the end of the fourth quarter, we also need to be sure that we've got a good and adequate and conservative loss pit of the current accident year. So that doesn't become a prior period adjustment into the future. So that's the other element of this which I feel quite strongly that we've taken good steps in that regard.  
Matthew Heimermann - J.P. Morgan:  Okay. I guess moving on and maybe this is for Ralph. Just on the program manager business, given that you're saying professional lines and the D&O E&O professional lines operations are running at an underrate process. The question I have is is 5% rate enough in that book to actually drive improvement, or is the improvement more going to come in that segment just from the fact that the work comp property or property D&O is just going to become a bigger portion of it and kind of a mix is what's going to get you there rather than necessarily big improvement on the stuff that's problematic today?
Ralph E. Jones III: Well, the mix comes automatically really by the process right - think of it that way. Most of the rate increases that we're really getting traction on have been in the California comp during the last six months, so we're seeing good traction there, we're happy with the prices, that book will maybe grow modestly. On a general liability programs we have two big ones, you know we're having a harder time getting traction because the program managers are losing renewals when we push for the requisite rate increase. So naturally that will kind of be a smaller portion of the book over time. So it's kind of a natural selection process, really.  On the other direct business which again is not through program managers, we kind of control our own destiny to a greater degree and we're happier with that and you know we can get to the (inaudible) in March more clearly in those areas and that's happening in two or three good pockets where we see opportunity so that will just naturally become a larger component of the insurance segment over time. I'm happy with the eight program managers that we have. They are doing the job, it is starting to take shape. It hasn't performed to the degree that we would have liked in the past and you know, we're going to fix that.
Dominic J. Addesso:  Let me add to that that Ralph noted a minimum of 5% so clearly we're hoping and are certainly going to push for more than 5%. now we're not sure what we can actually achieve given the market place. If it doesn't change all that much it's going to be difficult to achieve a big number. But we will push and get what we can get. But the other form of attack was the expense ratio. We're going to look to take that down a bit as well.  
Matthew Heimermann - J.P. Morgan: Okay, that's helpful. And then just one – sorry to take so much time but when you talk about premiums for next year in the renewals that went on, was that adjusting for FX or was that before contemplating the effect of FX?
Ralph E. Jones III:  That was not contemplating anything for FX. 
Matthew Heimermann - J.P. Morgan:  Okay, much appreciate it. Thanks.
Operator:  (Operator's Instructions) And it looks like we have no more questions at this time.  
Elizabeth B. Farrell:  Okay, thank you. If certainly anybody has questions offline please feel free to call me, I do appreciate everybody's participation this afternoon. Thank you. 
Operator:  This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect at this time and have a great day.

===== 2009 Q3  (2009-10-29 08:30:00) =====
Executives: Beth Farrell – VP, IR Joe Taranto – Chairman and CEO Ralph Jones – President and COO Dominic Addesso – EVP and CFO
Analysts: Cliff Gallant – KBW Jay Gelb – Barclays Capital Inc. Matthew Heimermann – JP Morgan Brian Meredith – UBS
Operator: Good day, everyone and welcome to the third quarter 2009 earnings release call of Everest Re Group. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Beth Farrell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Ms. Farrell.
Beth Farrell: Thank you, Laura. Good morning, and welcome to Everest Re Group's third quarter 2009 earnings conference call. With me today are Joe Taranto, the company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ralph Jones, the President and Chief Operating Officer, and Dominic Addesso, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I note that statements made during today's call, which are forward-looking in nature such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations and the like are subject to various risks. As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations. Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements. Now, let me turn the call over to Joe Taranto.
Joe Taranto: Thank you, Beth. Good morning. We are pleased to report the quarter where our top line grew 13%. Our operating earnings were $209 million, producing a 15% ROE and where surplus grew to $6.1 billion with book value per share increasing to $100.75, up 25% from year end. Reinsurance premium grew 12% for the quarter and is growing 12% through nine months. This growth has come from us capitalizing on the following First, a strong property reinsurance market, particularly in catastrophe exposed business. Second, a need for additional reinsurance going into 2009 as many companies weakened in 2008, needed reinsurance as a form of additional capital. Third, we continued the expansion on the international markets including our new office in Brazil. Fourth, new product development, most notably crop reinsurance. I am pleased as to how our staff used our financial strength and distribution channels to foster this growth. Our insurance operation grew its premium 19% for the quarter, and has increased premiums through nine months by 9%. Most of the new premium has come from a new unit we started this year in New York to write financial institution, directors’ and officers’ liability, and additional property insurance written in Florida where rates to exposure remain attractive. In a moment, Ralph will provide more specifics on our underwriting results and initiatives, and Don will provide more detail on financial results and plans. Whereas we are pleased that catastrophe losses have been light and that stocks and bonds have bounced back strengthening balance sheets, we know that these developments reduce pressure to correct insurance rates. Casualty rates are thin and getting thinner. We will remain extremely cautious in this area. Property reinsurance has well rated in 2009, but if there are no large catastrophes, we would expect a downward correction. Generally, my expectation is that 2010 rates will still be adequate, whereas our invested assets are higher than ever, interest rates are currently lower than ever adding to the challenge ahead. Our response to these conditions will be, as always, to stay disciplined underwriters. Part of our response has been to be buyback stock, which we expect to continue to do. I am confident that many strengths that Everest has built will allow us to continue to do well. Ralph?
Ralph Jones: Thank you, Joe. The U.S. reinsurance business was up 23% for the quarter, and produced a combined ratio of 67%. When the wind doesn’t blow – both performs very well. Much of the growth comes from our treaty property business, which has benefit to some degree from increased rates on catastrophe exposed business, but also from the addition of the crop business which contributed $27 million in the quarter and $68 million year-to-date. While treaty casualty terms and conditions are better that what we are seeing in the primary churns market, a slow deterioration of rates in the underlying market has caused for a cautious outlook in casualty. Our international business was up 9.6% during the quarter, and 12% in base currencies for the countries in which we operate. The combined ratio of 91.5% was impacted by $23 million in catastrophe [ph] losses during the quarter. This principally came from significant flooding in Turkey where we have a 3% market share on the property lines. There were also several smaller losses in Asia including the earthquake in Indonesia, which makes up the balance of this number, for the quarter. Year-over-year growth in the quarter was principally driven in the international segment by our Singapore office, up 19% in original currencies in the quarter we’ve some new opportunities have come from Australia, Korea and Japan. The new office in Brazil included $18 million in the quarter and $44 million year-to-date. Our Bermuda operations which includes London and Brussels, was flat for the quarter in original currencies and down 4% in US dollars. The combined ratio of 90.2% was just about what we've expected. The US insurance business, Everest National is up 9% year-to-date on a gross basis and 4% on a net basis. The growth is come from two areas of opportunity the new D&O operation in New York as Joe has mentioned, and from our E&S [ph] property came in Tampa, Florida. Net growth was lower than gross, since we reinsured greater proportion of the book in the umbrella and D&O segment has a way to manage the limits that we offer in the market place. Combined ratio year-to-date is 104%, which is principally driven by a program book is continues to signal a cautious outlook for the primary niche casualty programs. Renewal retentions are down in the quarter and programs because overall rate levels have been trending down earlier in the year. So some rates stabilizing in the third quarter mostly in the California account book where rates were up 5%. Overall, it’s a very strong quarter and is consistent with the trends we have described during the several past quarters. I’ll turn it over to Dominic Addesso.
Dominic Addesso: Thank you, Ralph. Good morning. As previously highlighted, our third quarter earnings were favorable with net income for fully diluted common share of $3.75 compared to a loss one year-ago. Minimal CAT [ph] activity for this quarter as contrasted with one year ago was major factor in the year-over-year comparisons. Nevertheless, the current quarter in many respects continues to perform in a similar pattern what we have seen during the year. Property reinsurance rates continue to be strong and coupled with the low CAT activity during the year that resulted in very favorable underwriting results for those lines of business. Our casualty reinsurance book despite continued softening at the primary level is experiencing generally favorable underwriting results as reinsurance pricing remains adequate and prior year reserves continue to perform favorably. In addition, we have managed that portfolio down [ph] over time in response to competitive pressures. Overall these strategies have resulted in a combined ratio for the total reinsurance book of 83.7% for quarter and 85% for the year. The insurance results for the quarter stand at a 110.1% combined ratio and for the year at 103.9%. Prior year development on one claim counts for approximately six points in a quarter and two points in the year. In addition, the primary insurance space has been soft for several quarters, and it continues to reserve in recognition of that reality. As a result, underwriting results for this segment remain under pressure. Overall, given the mix of business segments the combine book produced a favorable 88.7% combined ratio for the quarter and an 88.8% for the year. The loss ratio component – the combined was 60.2% both quarter and year-to-date, while the expense ratio was 28.5% and 28.6% respectively for the same period. Investment income for the quarter is up only slightly over the prior year despite strong cash flow and therefore a higher invested asset base. Reinvestments rates are below those of the year ago and of the maturing positions in our portfolio. On a year-to-date basis, investment income is less than the prior year due to the decline in value during the first quarter of our limited partnership investments. Since then, the asset class has stabilized and we recognized approximately $23 million of income in the quarter from limited partnerships, up slightly from the second quarter of this year. Most of this income represents gains from the public equity portions of our limited partnerships. Net pre-tax realized gains for the quarter were positive at $31 million and for the most part reflect fair value adjustments on equity securities, as the equity markets have improved relative to the prior year when most markets have been formed [ph]. Net derivative expense, which reflects our equity put contracts with the prior years not material, but nevertheless down over prior periods. This reflects the methodology used to price these contracts and while the indices upon which these contracts were written have risen. Declining interest environment raises the present value of any potential obligation thereby offsetting the rise in the indices. Income taxes for the quarter and year are up over prior year and reflect the improved operating results. The year-to-date effective tax rate on operating results is up slightly over the first six months to 12% due to less than anticipated cat activity, since the tax rate during the year is based on projected results for the entire year. Other comprehensive income is up dramatically over prior years, primarily due to an increase in the unrealized values on our bond portfolio, net of tax. Pretax, the value of our bond portfolio has appreciated by $640 million so far this year. With comprehensive income of $605 million for the quarter and $1.3 billion for the year, shareholders' equity has risen to $6.1 billion. On a per share basis, this represents $100.75 in book value rising from $91.13 at June ‘09. The major factor in this growth along with our $3.75 of earnings was the $6 of growth and the change in our bond portfolio. Thus significant to that was the impact of our shares repurchased during the quarter, which amounted to $41 million, representing an average purchase price of $83.54 per share. With strong earnings, this was viewed to be an excellent use of capital, still remained quite strong. And with that as summary, I will turn it back to Beth for Q&A.
Beth Farrell: Laura?
Operator: Thank you. (Operator instructions) And our first question comes from Cliff Gallant with KBW.
Cliff Gallant – KBW: Good morning.
Joe Taranto: Good morning.
Cliff Gallant – KBW: First question was about the reserve additions in the quarter, you mentioned of one large claim in the primary side, but it looks like four out of the five segments saw some adverse development. Can you talk a little bit about what’s happening there?
Joe Taranto: Well, first of all, I think, any of the developments you’ve seen is in our view, relatively de minimis relative to $8 billion of total reserves. And yes, there was some movement among particular segments. Overall, our casualty reinsurance portfolio had favorable development. There was some movement in some of our property lines, in particular, marine, from some energy losses in prior year, but nevertheless, quite manageable overall. And, of course, in the insurance space where we had one large significant claim contributing to prior period development there. And that’s essentially blowing it down most of the development is coming from that – claim. We do not, from what we see in our quarterly process, and we do go through our reserves quarterly, we see things emerging quite nicely and favorably. We see no major surprises and we will undertake a more detailed analysis in the fourth quarter along with our auditors, but nothing that we’ve seen in the quarters as cause for any concern.
Cliff Gallant – KBW: In the primary side, you are setting aside the one claim, you are still looking at a combined ratio of 104 taking up to six points for the one large claim. I would say with change in interest rates being where they are, should we assume that’s a profitable level you are running here to be running the businesses. Any comments as to what you are doing to address that just to start to move that to below a 100?
Ralph Jones: All right, Cliff, this is Ralph. The big issue that comes in the program both where it really comes down to price monitoring and price movement up, and, of course we’ve – when you approach the action here one-on-one that whole process is in motion. Very hard to get it at the first couple of quarters, we saw actual movement in the third quarter in almost every program with the change in direction. But the real only positive gains were in the California comp book where finally the market is showing some signs of kind of accepting the rate movements upwards. So, we have that price increase effort on every one of the program in the book which makes up about 75% of the insurance total. The other is just the change in mix as we focus on the pockets of opportunities. So, as you see the FI, D&O in Florida property facility, which is now about $35 million in premium, the Specialty areas, kind of around the programs, but it’s tough going on the primary casualty market. I don’t want to (inaudible) any comment on each of these. You tend to see a bit more competition on the bigger accounts, when you are doing the smaller ones, some are the specialty niche programs a little bit insulated, but it’s how it work.
Joe Taranto: Just add to that quick, Ralph is right. Some of the new areas like the FI, D&O, we like – we think we’ll produce some good results through time. The Florida property, we like but, in the main this book is 95% U.S. casualty business and that is top sledding for everyone right now. So, we are trying to kick up rates with some success here and there. We’re also looking at expenses and doing all the good things that we should do, but a lot of this just gets back to the market place and how it’s very competitive right now.
Cliff Gallant – KBW: Thank you.
Joe Taranto: You’re welcome.

Jay Gelb – Barclays Capital Inc.: Thanks and good morning. Joe, could you update us on succession planning?
Joe Taranto: Didn’t you see that I extended for a year there, Jay?
Jay Gelb – Barclays Capital Inc.: I did see that.
Joe Taranto: When a contract goes throughout the end of next year, but we have a process going on here where Ralph is basically studying the process and improving the process in certain areas. So I think we have the right situation in place that's all shareholders and clients should feel very good that we are going to have strength at the top for many years to come. The Board once it makes a final decision as to what timing we’ll let you know as soon as that decision is made.

 : Some of that was capitalizing on dislocations from late 2008, which helped us in some of the new product development like reinsurance and helped us with some international building that we've built including helping our Brazil office kickoff very, very nicely but other parts of the world we also saw opportunities because of weakness that some of our competitors had and the fact that some of our customers suddenly were down in surplus and needed some more reinsurance to help as a capital providers. We are pleased with what we've saw on the insurance side and the FI, D&O in the Florida sector. So there is number of things in 2009 that again we are happy with but that isn’t necessarily repeating it self going in to 2010. So if the market doesn’t particularly improve from where it’s at, the shorter answer would be you would not see double-digit growth next year. We’ll still work as hard as we can to find new opportunities and expand in to those new opportunities. But I can tell you right now that whereas we haven’t finalized the budget for 2010 we’re really not looking at much growth because our outlook is that the marketplace probably will not change significantly. Property reinsurance, in fact rates will all likely it would be down a bit from where they were in 2009 since the results have been very good there. And whereas, we hope casualty rates tick up at the insurance level, we are not planning on the fact that they will, if they do we can do much more but if they’re doing a significant way but that’s not part of our outlook at this stage.

Jay Gelb – Barclays Capital Inc.: All right that’s a very thoughtful answer, and then that sort of leads in to the capital management question with premium to equity at around 62% that the probably the firm out of excess capital on the balance sheet, what are your thoughts in terms of capital management?
Joe Taranto: Well, buyback has been for the last two quarters, part of the process. It will be going forward part of the process. And I think we were one of the few companies last quarter to be buying back stock. We’re one of the few reinsurance companies going into this quarter to say even though its CAT season, it’s likely that we’d be buying back stock. I expect us to be buying back going into the following quarter as well. We are not going to give targets. We like to maintain flexibility on that, so we can do what we think is best as we move from one point in time to the next. But expect us to be buying back.
Jay Gelb – Barclays Capital Inc.: Thanks very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Matthew Heimermann with J.P. Morgan.
Matthew Heimermann – JP Morgan: Hi, good morning everybody. Couple of questions, if I may. I guess, with respect to the insurance segment, is there any – are you giving any thought to potentially actually restricting writings in that business given what's happening with pricing and loss costs transept [ph]?
Ralph Jones: Yes, the current actually here is 101.7, so we're not going to grow that at all. So, you're going to see the book to broad casualty programs probably decline, I think six out of the eight are declined already and with renewal retention because you're pushing the rates up. So, that’s going to continue in 2010 most likely.
Matthew Heimermann – JP Morgan: Can you give a sense of order of magnitude what that will look like?
Ralph Jones: It’s very hard to predict exactly, I mean, we're pushing on all cylinders [ph] to get single-digit rate increases and in almost every one of the casualty programs, the kind of run-rate as you go into 2010 on the renewal retention, kind of depends on what it is. I mean, right now, you are seeing kind of 85% to 90% renewal retention on some of these. So, if it stays in that range you can get a picture of that, so you are hopefully – single digit rate increase and down 10 and renewal retention. That's kind of a way – it's probably shaping up on the bulk of the book.
Matthew Heimermann – JP Morgan:

Ralph Jones:

Joe Taranto: We have largely collapsed bad day (inaudible) over those years to really what we see as our core clients. The group that we are left with, we are very pleased to deal. In fact we continue to stay with because they do a great job in the market place. But as Ralph noted, it's really less than half of what we were doing a few years ago as we have responded to the changes in the marketplace and casualty pricing.
Matthew Heimermann – JP Morgan: Are there any big changes in the products that make up this kind of a $200 million year-to-date relative to the peak of 600?
Ralph Jones: I think there is a gradual shift from customers from quota shares to (inaudible). And then those little uptick rise came under last year because people wanted more quota shares for capital reasons. So, we are certainly right. The quota shares, if we like the terms and conditions, you see a lot of unusual things like last quarter’s and high retention points and so on. But, no other great mix from that.
Joe Taranto: You might find this a bit more specialty today in terms of E&O and D&O and environmental that it was if you went back to 2003 and ’04 where the whole general liability market and the whole automobile market and stock market when everything was really in very, very good shape we really could write a broader spectrum, and frankly we've collapsed back to core pliancy [ph], and those that really are specialized and have some installation from the competition in the marketplace.
Matthew Heimermann – JP Morgan: Okay. And then just one last one on demand, you did see some, some uptick because of some of the pressure on balance sheet last year. I was just curious if you could kind of estimate how much of a growth this year you think was just from demand uptick, that might reverse next year given where balance sheet sits today?
Ralph Jones: Yes. We did have some business in London that, I guess, we call the earring [ph] business that was quota share casualty that did come to us because the clients had diminish surplus and needed to use our balance sheet, if you will. And I guess, we had at least one sizeable deal casualty in U.S. that again our client surplus-wise needed to buy more reinsurance. You are right, things are stronger going into 2010, and so, those deals may not repeat themselves. I think, some of them will, and some of them won’t. So, it will be a different dynamic going into 2010. And that’s why we are not forecasting the kind of growth in 2010 that so far we’ve achieved in 2009.
Matthew Heimermann – JP Morgan: All right, thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS.
Brian Meredith – UBS: Yes, good morning, Joe. Couple of questions. First, Tom, can you give us what are the kind of key items that hit the other income loss item on expense line?
Tom Gallagher: Primarily FX account.
Brian Meredith – UBS: Next one. Second question, Joe, on the property markets, you said going in the year you think things will be pretty disciplined, but I guess, how much could rates go down in that marketplace before you say, all right, that’s enough, I got to start pulling back?
Joe Taranto: Well, I hope they don’t present so much but I really have to debate that too much. If there is a – I'll call it 5% to give you some sort of a number, reduction in rate, I think in most cat deals most reinsurers would find that – still would rate reasonably well, and they may even understand the reductions, in a sense that they just made a lot of money in the prior year on the deals. If it starts getting a whole lot larger than that, then it’s going to be more and more difficult. And if there is some pockets of the business rated a lot better than other pockets of the business, so, all you have to take them one at a time, but clearly, one would have to expect with the very good last year and benign [ph] losses, good results that there is going to pressure to reduce rates. But at the same time, I just think reinsurers still have a tremendous respect for cat business that it is cat business and it can explode and it's a volatile and it can hurt your surplus. I think insurers who buy have a respect for cat business that it’s the flip side, if they’re keeping that and don’t buy that could come back to hurt them too and they do want to maintain their surplus. So, I just think when you put it all together there will be discipline. I think there will be modest reductions, and I think at least with regard to 2010 on most cat business and I could be wrong for me but that hedging there. But I think with regard to most business we’ll find it more than adequately rated.
Brian Meredith – UBS:
 :
Joe Taranto: Well, I know I think we can have a respectable return, the challenges more with interest rates down and the casualty market being competitive. But as we look at the some of the numbers that we’re achieving this year, and putting the unrealized side for the moment, I think we’re well positioned. In part that comes from the fact that we’re much more of the property book at the end of the day. I think 72% of our reinsurance is property and that's by design that's where the rates have been better. So we hope casualty improves, but if it doesn’t I still think we can put forth some very good ROEs.
Brian Meredith – UBS: Thank you.
Operator: It appears there are no further questions at this time. Ms. Farrell, I would like to turn the call back over to you for any additional or closing remarks.
Beth Farrell: Thank you for participating in our conference call this quarter. And certainly if you have any questions feel free to call me or Tom after the call. Again, thank you.
Joe Taranto: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you for your participation. This concludes today’s conference.

Everest Re Group, Ltd. (RE):
Executives: Elizabeth Farrell – VP, IR Joseph Taranto – Chairman and CEO Ralph Jones – President and COO Tom Gallagher – Vice Chairman and Chief Underwriting Officer Craig Eisenacher – EVP and CFO
Analysts: Matthew Heimermann – JPMorgan Arthur Winston [ph] – Pilot Advisors
Operator: Good day everyone and welcome to the first quarter 2009 earnings release of Everest Re Group Limited. Just as a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Ms. Beth Farrell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Elizabeth Farrell: Thank you, Sara. Good morning and welcome to Everest Re's first quarter 2009 earnings conference call. With me today are Joe Taranto, the company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Tom Gallagher, Vice President and Chief Underwriting Officer; Ralph Jones, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Craig Eisenacher, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I note that statements made during today's call, which are forward-looking in nature such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations and the like are subject to various risks. As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations. Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements. Now, let me turn the call over to Joe.
Joseph Taranto: Thanks, Beth. Good morning. The reinsurance and insurance marketplace continues to transform itself very much as we had expected. Reinsurance rates for catastrophe products have gone up and are continuing to rise. Consequently, retro rates are up, energy rates are up and cat excess of loss rates are up. The supply and demand curves dictate that this process will continue as buyers need to protect their capital with reinsurance and reinsurance providers will demand better and better prices to provide these protections. In the next couple of months, most part of business will renew and we anticipate meaningful rate increases over last year’s rates. As reported last quarter, insurers that write property business would have to raise rates or be faced with the losing proposition of reinsurance costs they cannot pass on. Our underwriters are reporting this change has finally started. In April, we have seen a serious change in property insurance terms and conditions, and our property facultative department and property insurance operation in Florida experienced the best month that they’ve had in the long time. Casualty reinsurance and insurance rates and terms are not changing as meaningfully as property with the exception of isolated pockets such as D&O for financial institutions. It’s unclear how this part of the market will respond as 2009 progresses. We stand ready to write more business if market improvements bring additional business up to our underwriting standards. Ralph and Tom will provide more color on this sector, including the California workers’ comp market. Meanwhile on a macro level, the flight to security was more intense than ever before. This has been true both at the reinsurance level and at the insurance level and has greatly benefitted Everest. It has allowed us to attract new business and increased shares on existing deals. On the reinsurance level, some of our bigger competitors suffered loss of business from concerns about their economic status or ownership. At the insurance level, our A+ Best rating and financial stability has buyers putting us on the top tier of their preferred list. All of these changes resulted in gross written premiums being up 14% in the first quarter with reinsurance premiums being up 19% despite foreign currency devaluations relative to the dollar. I expect top line production to remain robust for the remainder of the year. Our underwriting result was solid with a combined ratio of 89.7 which affirms the underlying quality of the portfolio. Our investment results were disappointing as losses on limited partnerships significantly reduced overall investment income. Craig will later provide more color on investments. Surplus grew $79 million in the quarter and their ROE was 8.3%. I would hope and expect to achieve a much higher ROE in succeeding quarters as I anticipate premiums to remain strong, underwriting results continuing to be solid and investment income beginning to normalize as the world economy stabilizes. Ralph?
Ralph Jones: Thank you, Joe. As you can see from the first quarter results, we had a very strong January 1 renewal season with premiums up nearly 14% in the quarter. Much of the growth emanated from our overseas business that now makes up nearly half of our reinsurance premiums. We benefitted from opportunities in just about every region in which we participate. Our Latin American business was up substantial, partly due to the new Office in Brazil, which we expect will write over $60 million in premium this year. Much of our strength overseas comes in the first party lines where catastrophe exposed property treaties show the most demand. We also benefitted from the uncertain future of several large competitors. Overall, rates for the overseas business were up between 5% and 10% during the first quarter. Our Bermuda and UK book was up 14% coming from good opportunities presented in London and Brussels. Some of the growth came from quota share contracts written for two Lloyd syndicates that are looking for capital support partly due to the weakness of the pound versus the dollar. We see a distinct trend in clients focusing more on reinsurance for capital support. Our US reinsurance business was up 13% coming partly from several new crop hail quota share treaties which will amount to about $80 million on a full year basis. This is a relatively new segment for us where we see good margins available. For the US, reinsurance terms and conditions are tightening for casualty treaties. The trend we see is a switch to some degree from excess of loss to more quota share deals which we believe is often driven by the capital concerns of our ceding company customers where they are now looking for broader reinsurance support. The US insurance business was flat during the quarter. 80% of this business comes from niche casualty programs. Underlying rates on the primary casualty side were flat to down 5% during the quarter. While casualty reinsurance terms and conditions are improving a bit the underlying primary casualty business remains pretty stagnant. As per California workers’ comp, the rate increases anticipated at year end based on competitors’ rate filing, their initiatives in the rate filings have been slow to materialize in the marketplace. If actual rates do not improve, we will slow down our growth plans for this line of business. We have established a new division in New York called Everest Specialty Underwriters led by Mark Herman. Mark is an experienced underwriting leader in the D&O, E&O product lines. He was formerly President of ACE Bermuda and more recently Chairman of Ariel’s Insurance Business. Mark and I worked together for several years during our Chubb days and we are thrilled to have him join us as President of this new division. This will help bolster our direct insurance operation Everest National where we look to match underwriting expertise to market opportunity. I am certainly pleased with our first quarter underwriting results with a combined ratio under 90. This includes 33 million in cat losses emanating – resulting from the European storms and the Australian bush fires. Tom Gallagher will now share some observations about the marketplace in which we expect some excitement as the June 1 Florida cat treaty season approaches.
Tom Gallagher: Thanks, Ralph. As Joe noted in his opening comments, the transformation of the reinsurance market continues. The upward trend noted in January is showing signs of building momentum, which we also noted in April renewals and getting more pronounced as we head into midyear activity. Though the pace of change varies by line, industry, territory, and loss history, the theme is the same. It is an improved reinsurance environment. The strongest changes noted is in the US property and commercial and cat business, international, retro, and the energy area where there remains an increased demand for stable, high quality security in a turbulent market. Also as Ralph noted, we have experienced growth from emerging markets such as Brazil, new lines such as crop, plus positive rate movement in many areas, a change in some buying habits from excess to proportional and obviously the flight to quality. For casualty, it is much more of a mixed bag. With some improvements in rate terms and conditions, the general theme continues to be relatively flat. Overall, we are beginning to see their rates decline slow or stall, but it is a slow process. The only area which Joe noted where prices have moved greatly is in the financial area for D&O and E&O were cautious growth is the watchword. We would project that the casualty markets to remain challenging throughout 2009. Though, there are some signs of positive change, as new submission activity has increased. And we see that most of them are not easily filled. We would expect this trend to continue also through the remainder of the year. All participants in the markets are gaining a greater appreciation for the need to improve churns. Presently, it is evident that reinsurance market is firming much quicker. But that will filter through the primary sector as well over time. Everyone is dealing with the same market dynamics. Underwriting performance has deteriorated, investment income has diminished, the volatility of the exchange rates, capital constraints, profitability has declined, all leading to a new respect for the financial security. Capital preservation is a key item today. Both insureds and cedants are very focused on the financial security of their counter parties, and seeking much more diversification of placements, not putting all their eggs in one basket, all of which works quite well for us. Another consequence of the current financial environment is that everyone is managing their exposure much more prudently, both as respects to the property and casualty underwriting, investments and the use of capacity. Capacity remains a very precious commodity. It is an area where there is higher demand, but reduced supply in many segments end [ph] market, and that is for many reasons. Capital constraints, exchange rate fluctuations, limited retro-capacity, concerns about sub-prime. Specifically, cat capacity for critical zones remained tight. Some suggest a potential shortfall of 15% between the design curves and the availability with no immediate relief in sight in the near term. This was observed in January also in April. And we expect the stress level to increase as we head into the mid-year renewals with Florida issues which are still percolating at the top of the list, while you still have Australia, the Caribbean, Mexico, Central and South America as well. As we look out to the remainder of the year, we expect the positive trends noted in the first quarter to continue and take a firmer hold. We are in a great position to reap the benefits of this transformation in the marketplace for the future. Now, I will turn it over to Craig.
Craig Eisenacher: Thanks, Tom. As stated in our earnings release operating income for the quarter was $106 million, $1.73 per diluted share. Net income, including the gain on our debt repurchase and realized capital losses, was $109 million or $1.77 per diluted share. Our pretax underwriting gain was strong. Our combined ratio was just under 90%, about equivalent to last year’s first quarter. However our investment results were disappointing largely driven by our limited partnership investments. And I will talk a little bit more about that in a moment. As well, we reported a $20 million loss on the equity index put options we wrote in 2001 and 2005. We had realized capital losses of $65 million before tax and $48 million after tax. Most of this loss emanates from sales of Banc of America and Wells Fargo fixed maturity securities. As a result of their acquisitions of Merrill and Wachovia, our aggregated debt holdings exceed our risk thresholds and we reduced our holdings accordingly. As well, we recorded other than temporary impairments of $8.3 million before tax and $7.6 million after tax. As you know, we repurchased via tender offer $161 million of our outstanding subordinated debt for $83 million, including the transaction costs. This produced a pretax gain of $78 million and an after tax gain of $51 million. We like the outcome, the tender offer was at its core an opportunistic play. We have the liquidity, capital and earnings power to easily handle this transaction. So we repurchased 40% of the issue and in so doing reduced our leverage a bit, although it’s already very conservative, book to gain, and reduced our interest expense going forward. From a cash perspective, the opportunity return is roundly 13%, so well in excess of investment market opportunities, even very long opportunities. Tom and Ralph have described the quarter’s production and written premiums and outlook. I would like to add a couple comments on our underwriting results. Our underwriting profitability was strong in the quarter with a combined ratio of 89.7%, up very slightly compared to the first quarter of 2008. Catastrophe losses were light at $33 million. We continue to closely monitor our reserves for hurricanes Gustav and Ike and they continue to look very good. As a result, we are staying with our original estimate. We experienced a small amount of adverse development in the quarter, $18 million. There were some small increases and decreases in our US treaty and Bermuda operations. We didn’t receive any new reports of credit crisis losses and reported losses to date are still less than $5 million. Nevertheless, we did add a bit to our IBNR, in fact more than half of the increase relates to this as activity in that arena continues to build. The current year attritional loss ratio at 55.6% was up just a bit from last year as one might expect. Corporate expenses were about level with last year’s first quarter and the commission ratio was a bit lower. So all in, we are quite pleased with our underwriting result. On the other hand, our investment income was very negatively impacted by the results of our limited partnership investments, which in total lost $73 million. This compares to losses of $5 million in last year’s first quarter and $73 million in last year’s fourth quarter. The losses in the fourth quarter of last year came principally from funds invested in public securities that generally report one month in arrears. The losses this quarter came principally from the partnerships invested in non-public securities, both equity and debt. These funds generally report to us a quarter in arrears, so the results reported in our first quarter reflect their results from the fourth quarter of last year. The preponderance, 75% of our limited partnership portfolio is non-public equity with concentrations in energy, which is about 25% of the portfolio; health care, about 7% of the portfolio; and real estate, about 10% of the portfolio. Also about 16% is in funds with the country or region-specific focus. As well, we own some mezzanine debt early stage and LBO funds. We have no part [ph] funds and no leverage funds per se although a couple of our funds do employ modest leverage. As of March 31, 2009, the market value on our balance sheet was $563 million. It is difficult to forecast future results for these investments, each has its own unique strategy and portfolios consisting of a few too many investments. So any one fund’s results can vary significantly from financial market trends. It seems clear though that the last couple of quarters results of these investments were heavily impacted by the sizable declines in the equity markets. And with some improvement in the general climate, we might expect better results in the future. Over time, except in the last couple of quarters, these investments have done well for us, and we would expect that to continue to be the case although obviously we can expect a great deal of variability on a quarter to quarter basis. Otherwise, our net investment income was down somewhat compared to the first quarter of last year as our invested asset base is somewhat smaller and short term yields are lower. As well, in this uncertain financial environment, we have been holding more liquidity, and longer term investments we have been making have been in very short, very high quality paper. We recorded derivative expense of $20 million in the quarter, that’s on the equity put options principally because the S&P 500 Index declined in the quarter. Our cash flow from operations was $181 million in the quarter, about $70 million lower than in last year’s first quarter. Paid losses were quite low in last year’s first quarter, and hence trended higher in this year's first quarter. We paid out $83 million for the debt repurchase and $30 million in dividends. So, net cash flow to the investment portfolio was just under $70 million. Our investment portfolio continues to be very high quality. AA2 on average. Short duration and liquid. Our public equity exposure, including public equity oriented limited partnerships remains light at about 2% of the portfolio in total. At this point, I would like to give you a note on the presentation. We give you the embedded yield on our portfolio in the supplement. Prior to this quarter and I think I noted that on prior calls, we’ve been using 8.5% for our limited partnership investments. We dropped that to zero this quarter and that’s what caused the 30 basis point decline in the overall yield. Our capital position is very strong and increased by $79 million in the quarter and our financial leverage continues to be very conservative with a debt-to-cap ratio of 16.8%. So all in, we feel we are in a strong financial position to capitalize on market opportunities as they rise. Underwriting trends are favorable, and if financial markets cooperate, we should be reporting some better net income numbers in future quarters. And now we would like to open it up for questions.
Operator: (Operator instructions) We'll go first to Matthew Heimermann of JPMorgan.
Matthew Heimermann – JPMorgan: Hi, good morning everybody. You talked, Joe, about expecting growth to remain pretty healthy over the balance of the year. With respect to some of the growth you saw in the international sector, there wasn't any – was there any front end loading with respect to business you are writing this year. I know you had the S&P review going on. But I just wanted to make sure there wasn’t anything unusual on any of those numbers.
Joseph Taranto: No. There wasn't anything unusual about the numbers.
Matthew Heimermann – JPMorgan: Okay. Easy enough. And then could you just revisit either you or Tom the comments with respect to buyer changes? On one hand, I thought you mentioned people shifting to excess of loss versus proportional which I've heard in other places but in another comment, I thought I heard that there were some shifts from excess to proportional. So if you could just flesh that out a little bit.
Joseph Taranto: Sure. Let me give you a more broad answer to that, Matt. First of all, I think there's just a lot of positive things going on in the marketplace that have benefited us and that we’re capitalizing on. Part of that is a flight to security. Part of it is some of our competitors having some difficulty and even some of our customers having some difficulty when it comes to protecting their surplus. I think what we probably were referring to on some of the shift to quota share was at least in some cases where clients wanted essentially more surplus relief. Ease their balance sheet a little bit, and that's something that we could provide since we have a strong balance sheet. You are right at any particular point in time, different lines, different countries. There's an ebb and flow, as clients move between excessive loss and pro rata. But we did see, at least with regard to surplus strain some clients moving more to the pro rata side. But between pockets that are hardening very nicely, where we have some very unique opportunities, and the flight to security and some of the troubles that others have had, we have just had had a lot to operate with in the first quarter and I see most of those drivers being opportunities that we have to capitalize on for the remainder of the year.
Matthew Heimermann – JPMorgan: Okay. That's helpful. The other question, just with respect to some of the surplus relief you are providing customers, as well as the quota share to some of the Lloyd’s entities. How is that affecting the PML? Or your risk tolerance, your ability to take more risk has to move into the midyear renewals if at all.
Tom Gallagher: This is Tom. As with respects to accumulations, let me go back for a moment on the question of proportional versus excess loss. Most of the activity we’ve seen on the proportional side has been related to the casualty more so than property. So accumulation is not necessarily affected. Now with respect to accumulation, since the beginning of the year we’ve taken a pretty conservative stance on our accumulations, both in the US as well as internationally. And at this point in time, from 1/1, we have in the US shrunk our accumulation by zone in almost every one of the individual zones. In the international market, we have seen declines as well in our overall. We will have some limited growth in PMLs? Well, all within our willing to risk capabilities.
Matthew Heimermann – JPMorgan: Perfect. All right, thanks very much.
Operator: We'll go next to Arthur Winston [ph] of Pilot Advisors.
Arthur Winston – Pilot Advisors: In terms of the investment portfolio, it seems like there's a barbell approach. You take these very risky investments on one hand and then buy very conservative securities and I wonder two things, if you can estimate the future – how the future risk compared to the past risk on these partnerships, derivatives, S&P puts. And, two, are you going to continue to be conservative on the investment portfolio after being so aggressive and risk taking on these partnership situations?
Tom Gallagher: It sounds to me like there are three questions here. The S&P puts, the partnerships and the portfolio structure, correct?
Arthur Winston – Pilot Advisors: Yes.
Tom Gallagher:

 : On the other hand, we do invest in equities looking over time to get a better return in the equity markets, recognizing that they are more volatile than the bond markets. We have backed off our equity exposure, particularly our public equity exposure over the last six months, and really our remaining equity exposures in public and private equities are in the limited partnerships, which represent a very small portion of our investment. So, net-net, I would say that we’ve lowered the risk in our portfolio. Does that answer your question?

Operator: And it appears we have no further questions at this time. I will turn the conference back over to our speakers for closing remarks.
Elizabeth Farrell: I would like to thank everybody for participating and certainly if you have any questions, please feel free to call myself or Craig Eisenacher. Again thank you.
Operator: And that concludes today’s conference. Again, thank you all for joining us.

===== 2008 Q4  (2009-02-12 08:30:00) =====
Executives: Elizabeth B. Farrell - Vice President of Investor Relations Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Ralph E.

Operator: Good day, everyone and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2008 Earnings Release Call of Everest Re Group Limited. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the conference to Ms. Beth Farrell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Elizabeth B. Farrell: Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Everest Re's fourth quarter and full year 2008 earnings conference call. With me today are Joe Taranto, the company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Tom Gallagher, Vice Chairman and Chief Underwriting Officer; Ralph Jones, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Craig Eisenacher, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I note that statements made during today's call, which are forward-looking in nature such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations and the like are subject to various risks. As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations. Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements. Now, let me turn the call over to Joe.
Joseph V. Taranto: Thank you, Beth. Good morning. Thank you all for joining us. In the fourth quarter, operating earnings after taxes were $179 million and for the year, operating earnings were $563 million. This yields a 10.5% ROE for the year. When you consider that underwriting results included over $300 million of catastrophes led by Hurricane Ike and investment income was reduced by roughly $80 million from losses on equities from limited partnerships, our 2008 operating earnings was solid and evidenced the underlying strength of our portfolio and of our franchise. We ended 2008 with surplus of $5 billion or $81 per share. Our $5 billion of surplus amply supports our business plans for 2009. Once again when you consider the hurricanes we experienced, the global financial meltdown and its impact on assets, the devaluation of foreign currencies which reduced surplus by $193 million and factoring that we bought $151 million back in stock and $119 million were paid in dividends. The $5 billion in surplus represents a solid result and again points to the underlying quality of our organization. We ended the year with a very strong balance sheet. Our reserves for our liabilities continue to test well. And our invested assets, 94% of which are now either in cash or fixed income are high quality and diversified. Our bond portfolio as at 12/31 we derived from trades in an extremely tight market. Given the market and the quality of our portfolio, we believe it is likely values will increase and this is exactly what we've experienced so far for the first half of the first quarter. Our liquidity remains robust between positive cash flow, maturing bonds, liquid assets, and our credit line. Our liquidity is well in excess of what is needed for our business plan. In 2008, we had an insurance and reinsurance market that was in decline. Everest maintained its underwriting discipline which resulted in us doing less business than in 2007. We expect improved conditions for 2009 and accordingly anticipate growing our business in terms that offer better expected margins. We are pleased with the January 1 renewals. Tom Gallagher will provide more detail by underwriting area shortly. But the areas we predicted would harden at 1/1 did so. So far the market has played out exactly as we had anticipated. The retro market was as hard as it has ever been. Property cat rates increased particularly for peak zones and we expect this movement will continue. By mid-year, reinsurance capacity for the Florida market and the Gulf will be extremely costly. Little capacity outside the traditional reinsurance routes has come into the market. Energy rates both onshore and offshore are rising. At January 1 on sure tell business, the improvements were more for reinsures than insurers. Insurers will need to get their rates up and pass along the increased reinsurance costs or they will operate in the red. The causality market, both at the insurance level and reinsurance level, showed some stabilization, with some pockets such as FI, D&O showing improvement. Both in the U.S. and in the international markets we have seen a continued flight to quality which benefited Everest. Some of our competitors experienced market dislocations which gave us increased opportunities, some of our clients, whose surplus suffered in 2008, were in need of additional reinsurance. We mentioned our entry into Brazil last quarter and that's continuing to develop. As well we expect to have an Ireland company licensed in the near future and we are planning to establish a small office in Germany, both aimed at increasing our visibility and access to opportunities in Europe. We expect continued improvements in the market in 2009 and additional opportunities for Everest. I an upbeat about 2009, not only because of the market opportunities, but also because of some of the internal changes we've made to strengthen our bench, which brings me to Ralph Jones, who joined us as President and Chief Operating Officer, two months ago and has been an instant contributor to the cause. Ralph is a highly respected executive with a distinguished career at Chubb, Hiscox and Arch. Tom has known him for many years and I've had the pleasure of getting to know him in recent years. It's been great having him on board, having his insights, his industry relationships and his overall management abilities. I asked Ralph to particularly focus attention for the first couple of months on our insurance operation, Everest National. I will ask him to comment on his plans in this area for 2009 and beyond.
Ralph E. Jones III: Thank you, Joe. It's a pleasure to be here. While I've only been on board a couple of months, I've been a customer of Everest for over 25 years, so the strong reputation of the company and the caliber of the people is nothing new to me. The reinsurance operations which are our principal profit engine are quite well known and highly regarded. Tom Gallagher will comment on our reinsurance market conditions in just a few minutes. Our direct insurance business which trades as Everest National is not insubstantial. We wrote nearly $800 million in premium in 2008 and employed over 400 people in our insurance operations, with offices in Atlanta, Charlotte, New York, Tampa, Oakland and Orange County, California. It's principally a program operation with 13 major customers or program managers with half the business concentrated in three large underwriting agencies. Most of the business is casualty focused with a concentration on niche programs. About a quarter is workers compensation and about 10% is property. I'm very happy with the 13 contracts that we have. You can do well in the program business if it is tightly controlled and you follow the pricing like a hawk. I was very pleased to find that we have some substantial strengths in our ability to monitor pricing and oversee both the claims and underwriting process. Good metrics will distinguish the winners and losers in the underwriting game and we also have the dexterity to move quickly upon new opportunities. Our emphasis in 2009 will be to make a bit of a larger play in California, workers compensation market, pricing will edge up during the next year as early filings have shown and between our program managers and our two direct offices, we could write up to $300 million in this segment if terms and conditions and pricing holds as we expect. I also see opportunities to expand in a few specialty areas. We have an environmental team that is up and running and have just added a small financial institutions group. As you can imagine the FI, D&O, E&O market is in great dislocation creating big price increases and tight terms and conditions. Rates are up dramatically, for any... will be up dramatically for any level of serious capacity, particularly for strongly rated carriers. So we will take a highly focused share of that in 2009. D&O capacity for both commercial and financial businesses will grow in demand as the current litigation from the subprime claims moved through the last settlement process. Board members are very keen to keep coverage and limits in place. Market turmoil created by question marks for two of the D&O market leaders will create opportunities. Everest has an excellent reputation and financial strength rating and brokers will favor us as we put the right underwriters in place. So in expansion a very targeted segments, environmental, professional liability programs and D&O and E&O will be some of our building blocks for 2009. As Joe commented in prior calls, we'll also look to acquire teams or possibly specialty underwriting companies that share the same philosophy as we do, which is to concentrate resources and expertise on market opportunities that make sense, where pricing and policy terms and conditions are better than average. So I am enthusiastic about our prospects for 2009. Next, I will turn it over to Tom Gallagher.
Tom Gallagher: Thanks Ralph. In the last call, I noted that the market was poised for some positive changes citing the current environment of increased loss activity, rise in combined ratios and the financial crisis. All would have an impact on the world market. We didn't expect the change to be dramatic or for all segments, but it would come and take hold throughout 2009 beginning with the January renewals. First sign to change are evident. We are pleased to report that based on our results for the renewal season, the market is clearly in transition with positive and directional change noted in the marketplace. Let me take you through some comments on our January business. Approximately 50% to 55% of our reinsurance business renews in January, though this varies by line of business in territory. Overall, we had about $1,540 billion up for renewal in January and we wrote roughly about $1,575 billion, an increase of roughly 2.3% including the impact of foreign exchange. If we use the constant foreign exchange rate, we estimate our increase would be over 5%. The results vary by operating area but the end result is a well balanced portfolio business reflecting what we believe should provide us excellent returns and position us to take advantage of the opportunities that we believe will emerge in the future. A few points to make in general regarding the market. It has shown much more stability than we've seen in a long time where rate reductions have slowed noticeably, and with increases achieved in a number of areas with improved turns. Market uncertainties have resulted in an increase in new business activity. Also what stood out was a more disciplined (ph) reinsurance market, which displayed a prudent use of capacity. Lastly as Joe indicated, there is clearly a flight to quality, all of which serves us quite well. Let me make some specific comments by segment, first, for our international reinsurance. Overall, our international units including business written out of our international units and our Bermuda operations had a very successful January 1 with written premiums up 2.5% to about $1 billion, including the impact of foreign exchange. Approximately 65% of our international business renews in January. This increase resulted from a combination of some new business, increased shares on renewals and rate increases. Most offices obtained some new business or increased shares to seceding companies, increased concerned about financial security, which allowed us some negotiating leverage in our renewals. Along proportional covers, terms and conditions were largely unchanged, that includes in Asia, Europe, Latin America and Middle East with some adjustments and commissions depending on the results, except for some very large programs where we obtained some major improvements. Primary rates are beginning to stabilize and we would expect to benefit from some of these increases in primary rates in various markets in the future. This will have a positive impact on results as they work their way within the system. As respect to cat rates, this varies by country with the overall trend moving upward. For example, in Asia we saw rates from flat to 5%. In Canada we saw a plus 7%, Continental Europe of flat to up to 5%, in Latin America up 5%. Now, looking at the London market, it did show some signs of improvement, where rate reductions have slowed down. And we were able to get more attractive terms on some contracts. There was a positive movement in excess business in putting risk excel, cat excel and casualty, anywhere from a plus 5% to a plus 15% rate increases. The greatest movement was in the D&O financial institutional area and credit markets, where loss experience is showing a real need for immediate action. Also in London, we did have a noticeable uptick in new business, as clients were concerned about security of other market participants, with the largest impact on our casualty portfolio there where we were able to obtain better signings. Let me move on to the U.S. reinsurance business. We wrote roughly $415 million of business through our reinsurance operations in the U.S. and Bermuda in January which equals to our expiring premium, which represents about 43% of our annual U.S. business written. Though the results were equal to last year, overall the make up of this portfolio has improved, especially, in the property and retro areas where the rates have moved up and our exposures have been reduced. Let me highlight some points on each of these areas. As respects treaty property and worldwide retro, this is a place we have seen some of the most meaningful improvements in price terms and conditions, as well as usage of capacity. Whereas we have written less premium in January it translate into a much better portfolio, less exposed with improved pricing and making more capacity available for the future. Some specifics on renewals, on proportional business we saw a much tighter occurrence caps and the occurrence limits down significantly. For cash, the average rate on line on our portfolio went from 15% to 23%. We did note shortfalls were evident, particularly on the very large national programs. Our exposures in peak zones have flattened or reduced. In the retro area, we saw our increased retentions on virtually all of our deals with the rate on line profiles moved from just under 30% last year, with lower layers, to just over 35%. In balance, is an effective increase was over 30%. Overall, the market is being much more prudent on its use of capacity. Moving on to the U.S. casualty business. On balance, we had a good renewal season, recognizing that this segment has just begun to stabilize. We anticipate that we will see further improvements later this year. We had renewed most of our major accounts and wrote some new business, which resulted in a small increase in our premium volume with some improvements in terms. Here again sheeting companies were very interested in the quality of reinsures when assigning shares which served us well. Clearly, the flight to quality has resulted in a increase of new business here as well. Again the D&O and financial institution market is a segment that we right now characterize as the leader in this trend of upward movement, towards improvement in insurance and reinsurance pricing and terms. Going forward, into 2009 we see the current market dynamics as presenting promising signs for renewed growth in this portfolio. Let me move on to the specialty operations. In our specialty operations, which include accident and health, marine, aviation, and surety, we wrote approximately $124 million in premium, which represents an increase of over 8%. Our marine, aviation and surety areas were basically equal 2008, with the increase coming in our A&H area, where we wrote some new business. Approximately 46% of our annual premiums in this segment renews in January. Looking at this business, the A&H and surety markets were relatively stable with no significant changes in price, capacity or retention. We did see some positive rate movement on the aviation side. The only area of note is the marine business, where we saw rate improvements some in the neighborhood of plus 10% to 20% but we also noted much stress on the Gulf of Mexico business with most programs done excluding this exposure. As a consequence our Gulf, our grids are down. We would expect to see attractive opportunities mid-year when offshore energy business is predominantly ready. All in all, I believe it was a very satisfying renewal season for us. Clearly, the reinsurance world is in a midst of positive change, which should get stronger as we progress through the year. We are very well positioned to benefit from this trend with our strong financials, grid ratings, a seasoned staff and locations around the globe. We're looking forward to these developing opportunities, would expect to prosper in this environment. Now, I'll turn it over to Craig.
Craig E. Eisenacher: Thanks Tom and good morning. Our 2008, gross written premium was down 10% compared to 2007 and that's consistent with the guidance that we've provided since the beginning of the year. Gross written premium for the quarter was 15% lower than in the fourth quarter of 2007 but about half of that was due to the inception of the brownstone program effective at the end of 2007. That resulted in a one-time $76 million inward premium portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2007 which didn't repeat in 2008. The U.S. insurance segment shows a 37% decline for the quarter however, if you adjust for the brownstone distortion, the decline is 13% and that decline is due to a couple of program cancellations and lower writings from the C.V. Starr program. Looking briefly at the other segments, U.S. reinsurance was flat with the fourth quarter of 2007 and down 20% for the year. Both casualty and property were down as we responded in 2008 to softer market conditions. International reinsurance was up 16% in the quarter and 12% for the year, driven by generally more stable to stronger pricing and a flight to quality as Siemens (ph) looked to upgrade their reinsurance security of their panels. Bermuda was down 36% in the quarter and 15% for the year. And about 10 points of the quarter's decline was from foreign exchange. Specialty reinsurance was down 3% for the quarter and 4% for the year. Our after-tax net operating income was $179 million or $2.93 per share for the quarter. Our net operating income was $563 million or $9.12 per share for the year. For the fourth quarter and the year as a whole, we reported net losses of $17 million and $19 million respectively including net realized capital losses. Our operating return on equity was 13.8% for the quarter and 10.5% for the year. Underwriting income at the group level was very strong. Combined ratio was 83.5% for the quarter and 95.6% for the year as a whole. We recorded $42 million of favorable reserve development in the fourth quarter and strengthened reserves by $24 million for the year as a whole. We had light catastrophe losses in the quarter. We had $20 million of loss cost but only $8 million net of reinstatement premiums. We recorded a loss of $257 million net of reinstatement premiums for Hurricanes Gustav and Ike in the third quarter. We took great pains at that time to develop an estimate we believe could be adequate. We've monitored and analyzed the ensuing reported losses and we have concluded that our original overall estimate still represents our best estimate. Investment income was disappointing at $75 million for the quarter and $566 million for the year. Our limited partnership investments lost $73 million for the quarter and $64 million of that $73 million was from the partnerships principally focused on public equities. We significantly restructured our investment portfolio during the fourth quarter and at year-end, 94% of our investment assets, invested assets are in fixed income or cash. We have a $137 million in our equity portfolio and $156 million in limited partnerships that are invested principally in public equities. So in total about 2% of our invested assets are exposed to public equities at this point. The reduced asset risk and volatility will allow us to better capitalize our 2009 business opportunities. We recorded a derivative expense of $34 million in the quarter and $21 million for the year. That's on the equity put options, because both the AAA corporate interest rates and the S&P 500 Index declined both in the quarter and for the year as a whole. Cash flow from operations was $55 million for the quarter and $663 million for the year. Just to summarize the quarter's operating results, underwriting results were excellent but investment results were poor as a result of the drop in the equity markets. Our GAAP equity ended the year at $5 billion down $76 million for the quarter. We had $179 million of net after-tax operating income and this was reduced by $77 million of after-tax investment losses, a $126 million in currency translation losses, and a $29 million dividend paid out to shareholders. Our capital adequacy is very strong relative to our own internal economic capital measures and those of the rating agencies as well. Our liquidity is strong with over $2 billion in cash and short-term investments. In addition our cash flow is positive. We have significant maturing bonds and available credit lines. All in all, our balance sheet is strong with ample capital, great liquidity, reserves that are strong and assets that are high quality. We are pleased with our January 1 renewals and we expect continued opportunities during the year. Accordingly, we expect to continue strong performance in 2009 and beyond. Joe would like to comment on our rating status with S&P and then we'll take questions. Joe?
Joseph V. Taranto: Yes, a quick update with regard to S&P. We are meeting with S&P late next week to discuss our rating. We expect that they will finalize their decision shortly afterwards whereas we hope to keep our AA-. If we do not... I do not anticipate any meaningful impact on our business. Let me explain why. First, the worst outcome is an A+ S&P rating which is still a very good rating. Second, our best rating is A+ Excellent and most of our customers use that. Third, our clients know us and our strength; we have been dealing with many of them for 30 plus years. When we went through credit watch in late December, during the renewal season, I did not hear from even one underwriter that it was a factor in any of our deals. Having said that, I believe we are deserving of a AA- rating and I hope S&P does as well. We'll now take your questions.
Operator: The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. (Operator Instructions). Our first question will come from Jay Gelb with Barclays Capital.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital Inc.: Thanks and good morning. Joe, on the gross written premium growth for 2009, is the 2% or so growth that was generated for the January renewals, is that a good run-rate for the full year or should we consider other one-time items?
Joseph Taranto: I guess, we would hope there would be a little bit greater than that as we see continued opportunities and improvements during the year. Plus, I think as Tom noted, we reduced the exposure in some areas at January 1, even though we wrote more premium. Part of what you're seeing at January 1 is the dollar having increased in value until when we you get done with translation, had it not changed it would have been more probably 5% or 10% growth in January and we did a little less business with AIG. So when you put those two things together that's part of why you saw the number at 2% for January. Our hope would be that it will be greater than that for the year.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital Inc.: Okay. And then next question on investment income and realized gains and losses, how should we be thinking about that going into 2009?
Craig Eisenacher: Well, we don't really project realized gains and losses. I guess I would comment that since the end of the year, our bond portfolio has appreciated and obviously we're watching that. Our equity exposure has reduced and there is, as a result of that reduction hasn't had much of an impact so far this year. In terms of looking at investment income, our run-rate of investment income exclusive of the limited partnership investments was about $630 million as of year-end. The limited partnership investments interestingly enough if you look at the internal rate of return on those investments since inception is over 10% despite the fact that 2008 obviously was a dismal year. We tend to plan those at about 8.5%, so if you were to look at it that way, there would be another $30 million - $40 million to add. We are holding approximately $2 billion in short terms or we where as of year-end. Obviously, short-term rates particularly in high quality securities are very low. We're looking to put some of that money out and in fact have invested about $500 million at an average duration of approximately one year and a rate of about 5%. And principally, we are doing on agency CMOs very short high quality credit enhanced structures involving credit cards, prime auto loans et cetera. They're a bit difficult to find, difficult to do, difficult to do in size but we feel that we want to stay relatively short with the portfolio. And we are not satisfied with the 1% yields where we are looking for ways to enhance that by some amount.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital Inc.: Okay and--
Craig Eisenacher: Do you feel that's helpful?
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital Inc.: Yes, it is thank you. And then finally Joe, I don't know if you can update us on succession planning?
Joseph Taranto: Well, I think the Board is still working on that but I think the important of the update there is with Ralph and some of the other senior members that we are thrilled to have at Everest. Now on board we really have the future management team in place.
Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital Inc.: Okay. Thanks very much.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). We will go next to Vinay Misquith with Credit Suisse.
Vinay Misquith - Credit Suisse - North America: Hi, good morning.
Craig Eisenacher: Good morning.
Vinay Misquith - Credit Suisse - North America: Historically, you've had a significant Florida pro rata book. I was just curious as to what do you think the impact of what's happening with (inaudible) would have on your business. If the Florida homeowners' insurers have to pay more money for private reinsurance, would that hurt your margins there with the pro rata riders or where do you play in the tower for these pro rata riders in Florida?
Joseph Taranto: That said, it's an excellent question and it's one that we will have to determine the answer on in the next few months. Our Florida business comes up for renewal in June and July. But you are correct, if they don't have the same structure that they had before, if they have to buy more outside reinsurance, the state provides less. There will be a high cost to some of that outside reinsurance and that will reduce the profit levels for the homeowner companies and if you are a pro rata rider, that would then reduce your profit margins there as well. So you would have to try to adjust for that in the deal. But the flipside of that is we can be excess reinsurers as well and we are and so we may just change the mix when it comes to June or July where we will become more excess and less pro rata. But all of that remains to be seen as we see how the Florida story unfolds in the course of the next four months.
Vinay Misquith - Credit Suisse - North America: Okay, that's fair. The second question is on the S&P ratings. It's nice to hear that on January 1 there was not much of an impact. Would you say that the impact will be more in the Europe than the U.S., because they focus more on the S&P ratings?
Joseph Taranto: Well, there is no question that in the U.S. people tend to use the best grading and S&P does get used more when you get outside of the U.S. So that is the case. But once you get outside the U.S. as well we're dealing with a lot of clients of ours that have known us and dealt with us for many, many years. So the worst case scenario is we still have a very high rating with people that we've been dealing with for a very long time that know we have strong capital, $5 billion of surplus. So if it didn't have any impact during the renewal season, I just don't see it having much beyond that. But once again having said all of that, it is our hope to maintain the AA- nonetheless.
Vinay Misquith - Credit Suisse - North America: Thank you. One final question if I may. Could the hiring of Ralph... do you sense that your company is moving more to the primary insurance side versus reinsurance?
Joseph Taranto: We will be maintained both. We have historically been more of a reinsurer. That will probably at least remain our orientation for the next year or two. But there are opportunities on the insurance side that with Ralph's help, we can now tackle that I think we couldn't tackle before. So I am quite hopeful that you will see us with more business in the wholesale and retail space and even on the NPA side that you will see us framing out a bit there as well. Ralph, do you want to add anything on the insurance side?
Ralph E. Jones III: No, I think as you saw in my opening remarks that the insurance operations here principally been a program operation which are good. So we are happy with them. But as we look into these new opportunities that will be kind of expanding out more in the direct side with brokers and agents in these special areas where we think the opportunities make sense. So it's more of a change in emphasis as opposed to major change in strategy.
Vinay Misquith - Credit Suisse - North America: Thank you.
Operator: We will go next to Josh Shanker with Citi.
Joshua Shanker - Citigroup: Thank you. Yes, I just was anxious, talking about where you get your implied volatility quotes from a long-term puts and what implies volatility in the marketplace, right now?
Craig Eisenacher: We use the volatility, we get volatility quotes from Deutsche Bank, our investment advisor. And I think while we use long-term volatilities to basically in conformance with the maturity on the puts to do those calculations, so current volatility is not so much of a factor. One of the things that impacts our valuations of these is when we initially book, the S&P puts we booked them to a much higher volatility, than was indicated at the time. And basically what that did is it caused the booking of the puts, not to generate any profit up front. So we're using a higher volatility than market volatilities would indicate and that volatility is coming down overtime which seems counterintuitive to what's going on in the markets. But it's as a result of the volatility that we had to initially use, so that there was no initial gain or loss on the puts and that whatever profit or loss there, it would be emerge over their lives. Does that make sense?
Joshua Shanker - Citigroup: Yes, well, let me rephrase, what is the long-term volatility that you are using currently?
Craig Eisenacher: It's in the 20s. I want to say 25% - 26% and it varies depending upon the maturity. If you want to go, I can go offline with you later and I can give you the exact numbers but it's in that magnitude.
Joshua Shanker - Citigroup: And it's reasonable to say that over the last six months that hasn't escalated (ph) very much?
Craig Eisenacher: No, I think what we used to do the calculation has actually come down a little bit because it amortizes downward overtime.
Joshua Shanker - Citigroup: Okay. And thank you very much.
Craig Eisenacher: Welcome.
Joseph Taranto: Well, let me add to that and perhaps a less technical answer is, those puts were stress tested I think as much as they could be by 2008, which led to $20 million change for the year in that evaluation. We still expect to make money on these puts. And frankly the way that I look at it is that change in valuation is just something that would get undone as we go forward.
Joshua Shanker - Citigroup: Thank you.
Joseph Taranto: You are welcome.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). We have no other questions at this time. I would like to turn it back to our presenters for any additional or closing remark.
Elizabeth Farrell: Thank you for joining us today. And certainly if you have any questions, please feel free to call me or Craig Eisenacher. Again thank you.
Operator: That does conclude our call. We would like to thank everyone for their participation. Have a great day.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2008 Earnings Release of Everest Re Group. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks, and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Beth Farrell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Elizabeth B. Farrell - Vice President of Investor Relations: Thank you, Mark. Good morning and welcome to Everest Re's third quarter 2008 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Joe Taranto, our Chief Executive Officer; Tom Gallagher, our President; and Craig Eisenacher, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I will start with our comments by noting that SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I note that statements made during today's call, which are forward-looking in nature such as statements about projection, estimates, expectations and the like are subject to various risks. As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations. Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investor should consider in connection with such statements. Now, let me turn the call over to Joe Taranto.
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Beth. Good morning. Normally on the quarterly calls, we go right into what's happening in the insurance world and I will shortly ask Tom to do just that and have Craig follow with the financials. However, there seems to be little that's normal about this quarter, as the central issue seems to be more of the chaos in the worldwide financial system. It's easy to get down, when you consider the meltdown of the system, the destruction of value, the loss of many companies that were household names, and the many economic close that are still to come. Perhaps, there were many excesses that needed to be running out of the system. I trust they have been and we can now move forward. At Everest, despite the blood in the Street, we have remained strong with our client base intact, our employees committed and our ratings among the highest in the business. Going forward, I expect the world will be very different and that these changes will work to our benefit. As a reinsurer, we are capacity provider. Well, many of our clients are suddenly in need of more capacity, we'll try to help. As a reinsurer, we mitigate our clients' risk. Again, many of our clients as most of the world will be more risk-averse and looking for more partners to sharing their risk, again, we'll try to help. As a reinsurer and an insurer, we have extremely strong financials and financial ratings. Well again, the world is looking more closely at the credit quality of its partners than ever before and paying more for credit quality than ever before, which works well for Everest. Some of our competition has lost strength and as a result will lose business. There will be opportunities for us to pick up business, people and perhaps other companies. Much of the money that so easily came into our space from hedge funds and other sources has dried up. The staying power of many of the smaller companies in our sector will be questioned more than ever, again this will work to the advantage of Everest. The insurance market has been softening; in past cycles it had taken many years of deteriorating rates and conditions before the market turns up. At the beginning of the quarter, I thought we had years to go before better days appear. Now I see that timeframe dramatically reduced and expect the portions of the reinsurance and insurance market to improve by the one-month renewal season. In summary, it's been a rough three months but I see change coming and much will work to our company's benefit. Tom?
Thomas J. Gallagher - President and Chief Operating Officer: Hi, thanks Joe. Well, I'll continue what Joe, said about in his comments. It's been quite challenging in the last nine months. But as Joe said, we are entering a changed world. And we are well positioned to take full advantage of these changes. Let me make some brief comments on each segment of our portfolio which is a reflection of where the overall market has been in the first nine months of '08. Recognizing that third quarter has continued to perform generally as it has to the first six months of the year. Our international business including London and European ops represent almost 38% of our worldwide portfolio. We continue to see the treaty reinsurers being disciplined in their approach. Fortunate programs have remained stable with some price reductions on excess programs with good results both for our cat as well as per risk. And increases in areas where loses have impacted programs such as China, Chile, Australia and Peru. We have been able to increase our premium volume through new business as well as increased participations on existing programs in Latin America, Asia, Middle East as well as Brazil due to the recent opening of the reinsurance market in that country. We continue to benefit from our strong long-term relationships, preceding companies and our solid financial strength ratings which has allowed us to obtain preferential signings. Our U.S. business, including business written out of our Bermuda branch. This year RE represents 32% of our worldwide business with property being 22% and casualty 12%. The market conditions in these segments continue to be the most stressed. With pricing pressure both on property and casualty warrants, as well as ample capacity even at reduced prices. Though there has been limited treaty activity in the past quarter, our assessments of these segments are based on feedback from our clients or audit observations and our calculative step. And that is, that the overall price continues to decline. But the rate of decline seems to have slowdown. The only increases have been where loses have emerged such as property per risk business and our financial D&O and the E&O sector. It is the market that needs the most attention. And we don't expect major movements until January as Joe said. And those adjustments will vary by market segments, but change is on our horizon. Our focus continues to be the same maintaining our most profitable relationships and growing with claims that are key to our success. Our specialty reinsurance book represents 7% of our worldwide book and includes accident and health, marine, aviation and surety. We continue to experience increased competitive pressure in most of these areas and we appear though in our portfolio overtime to key core programs, and are comfortable with where we are today. And we don't anticipate much change for the remainder of 2008. Insurance; our insurance operation represents roughly 21% of our worldwide premium. It's the U.S. portfolio and we continue to mainly focus on niche casualty business. Though we have expanded our writings this year in the property area, through the first nine months of this year, we have written some new programs and lost some older programs. And as expected, have been impacted by increased pressure for reduced rates and higher retail commissions. But today, we are very comfortable with our mix of business, and continue to see a good flow of new opportunities, both in a program area as well as retail business. And we see this area, as a key area of growth for us in the future. That's where we are today. Now, looking forward to the future. The market is poised for positive change. The combination of price reductions, the recent loss activity book to pattern risk resulting in increasing combined ratios plus the current financial crisis has impacted the whole market greatly. This environment look for us all participants in the market. To revaluate their willing-to-risk position going forward, and increase their pricing posture and reinsurance purchases to address their portfolio more in balance with a reduced surplus. Our insurer plans were changed, we are in the works right now at all companies. Which will be implemented beginning 2009 or sooner. Initially, we don't expect change to be dramatic or for all segments. But it will come and take hold throughout 2009. And I believe we are in a excellent position to respond to these changes very quickly. Now, I'll turn it over to, Craig.
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Tom. Our third quarter net after tax operating income was $12.6 million which includes $210 million net loss from Hurricanes Gustav and Ike. Net operating income per share was $0.21 compared to $3.68 per fully diluted share in the third quarter of 2007. Catastrophe loses were much less significant at $17 million after tax in last year's third quarter. Absent all cat loses from both periods net operating income was $231 million in this year's third quarter compared to $249 million in last year's third quarter. So our underlying operating income fundamentals remained quite strong. The financial markets were front page news this quarter and they affected us. We incurred $246 million of net after tax realized capital loses in the quarter. After these loses, our net results were a $233 million loss equating to $3.80 per share. The realized losses broke down as follows on an after tax basis; $131 million from other contemporary impairments on fixed income securities largely financial institutions. $53 million from mark-to-market losses on our equity portfolio which is carried at fair value and $62 million in realized capitalized losses on sales of booked equities and fixed income securities. In addition, we suffered approximately $190 million of after tax unrealized losses on our fixed income portfolio as credit spreads widened significantly during the quarter. We repurchased 3,002,000 shares of our common stock early in the quarter at a cost of $25 million and we declared and paid our regular dividends to shareholders. After all of these items, our GAAP equity declined by $530 million in the quarter to $5.04 billion from $5.57 billion at June 30th. As well, our book value per share decreased by 9% to $82.02 from $90.32 at the end of the second quarter. I will talk about liquidity and capital resources in a moment but suffice it to say that both are strong and we have plenty of capital to support our financial ratings. Through the nine months, net operating income was $383 million compared to $714 million for this first nine months of 2007. Realized capital losses and fair value adjustments year-to-date were a loss of $385 million after tax. In contrast, we had a realized capital gain of $113 million during the nine months of 2007. Net income then including after tax realized capital gains and losses was essentially a breakeven to the nine months of this year compared to a gain of $827 million for the same period last year. Looking a little deeper at our operating results. In total, our gross written premiums were $999 million for the quarter, 7% lower than in the third quarter of last year. Year-to-date, our gross written premium was $2.8 billion, which is 8% lower than for the nine months of 2007. The decline is not unexpected, it very much reflects our underwriting discipline as markets have continued to soften. By segment, U.S. reinsurance at $280 million was 14% lower for the quarter than in last year's third quarter. Most of the decline was in our treaty property book. Despite good renewal results, increased common account reinsurance protections particularly on one quota-to-quota share count and two non-renewals of quota shares resulted in a 13% decline in premiums compared to last year's third quarter. At the same time, treaty properties gross written premium was substantially higher than in any quarters since the third quarter of 2007. Treaty casualty was lower than in last year's third quarter, but by just 5% as we have now reduced this book to a group of core accounts in response to the softer market conditions. U.S. insurance recorded gross written premium of $194 million and that's down 15% compared to the third quarter of 2007. Conditions for workers compensation, contractors and public entity business have gotten increasingly competitive, which has reduced the volume of business which meets our underwriting and pricing criteria. Although less than half of the short fall compared to last year's third quarter is from the CV star program, where we have lost several public entity accounts because it would not match market pricing and terms. International at $249 million was 16% higher than in the third quarter of last year. Approximately one quarter of the growth emanated from foreign exchange. International experienced strong renewal increases in the quarter and saw higher rates in some markets. As Tom noted, our long-term relationships and our solid financial strength ratings are definite advantages in the international markets. Recently, we obtained preferential signings and in some cases preferential terms and conditions. We've also seen several opportunities recently to replace reinsurers which offer less solid financial strength ratings. The Bermuda segment had gross written premium of $221 million for the quarter which was lower than the third quarter of 2007 by 6%. The London and European brokers leveled with the third quarter of 2007, although Bermuda portion declined principally due to the conversion of one large casualty quota share contract to excess. Gross written premium for the specialty segment was $55 million for the quarter and that's down 22% from last year's third quarter. Marine and A&H premiums were each lower, surety was a bit higher. We had no aviation premium for the quarter as marketplace premium volumes and rates continued to decline. Now, looking at underwriting results, the group combined ratio was 115% for the quarter and it now stands at 99.6% on a year-to-date basis. Hurricanes, Gustav and Ike were significant events we have estimated gross losses of $40 million and $255 million for the two events respectively. That's $295 million before reinstatement premiums and $257 million after reinstatement premiums. Here is another $10 million of what I will call the noise in the quarter some ups and downs on older events, so $267 million in cat losses in total. That's 34.2 combined ratio points on the quarter. We also had a small amount nine-tenths to 1% of favorable development. No significant movements just some minor ups and downs. The accident year accretion loss ratio was 55.5% versus the identical to last year's third quarter results. Our commission and expense ratio ran at 27.7% for the quarter a little better than the 28.1% we had in last year's third quarter. So our underwriting results continue to be quite attractive on a fundamental basis with a combined ratio under 85 and about on par with last year. Investment income for the third quarter was $164 million compared to $173 million for the third quarter of 2007. The $9 million decline was primarily attributable to a reduction in limited partnership income and lower rates on short and long-term bonds. Of note although it may seem odd we had a gain of $15 million on the equity put option contracts in the quarter. Under these agreements we have a future payment obligation on multiple contracts settling between 8 and 23 years in the future. If a reference index is below the threshold level. But both the index is still in the quarter the valuation model uses a AAA corporate discount rate which increased by close to 200 basis points. Given the long dated nature of the contracts the strongest determinants of gain or loss is movements in interest rates. Which provides a bit of a hedge against the impact of interest rates on our bond portfolios. So a little of bit of good news among the bad news if you will. Other terms principally foreign exchange was $8.2 million in the quarter, the U.S. dollar strengthened against the British Pound and the Euro, and since we hold investments and receivables in both of these currencies, their value has declined in U.S. dollar terms. Looking at cash flow, cash flow from operations was $375 million for the quarter compared to $356 million from the third quarter of last year. Excluding income tax, we see some payments cash flow from operations was $278 million in this year's third quarter compared to $463 million in last year's third quarter. The primary driver of that reduction was premium collections, which were $153 million lower in this year's third quarter than in last year's, not unexpected due to our low volume. Looking in investments, the meltdown of the global financial markets drove down the values of both equities and fixed income securities. In the aggregate, our investment portfolios experienced a negative 2.5% total return for the quarter. That's made up of investment income of $164 million and realized and unrealized capital losses aggregating $549 million including impairments. Our investment portfolio has been and is one of the diversified liquid, high quality and short duration. The average quality rating of our portfolio remains very strong and AA too. The duration was 4.4 years as of the end of the quarter unchanged from June 30th. We have virtually no exposure to sub-prime or all time mortgages, CDOs or COOs. We have not brought nor sold credit default swaps. We have virtually no counterparty risk beyond the issuers of our fixed income securities. By policy, our maximum exposure to any single issuer is $75 million, which represents one-half of 1% of our invested assets. Our actual exposures are lower than that. Nevertheless, when you experience the devastation we experienced during the third quarter and continuing into the fourth no portfolio, however, carefully constructed is going to be immune. To put it in perspective, a AAA corporate with a 10-year maturity loss 15% of its market value between June 30th and September 30th. And the S&P Index declined by... as well by a little over 9%. And while we have been reducing our equity exposure since the beginning of the year, our equity portfolio still lost $127 million in the quarter. In order to give investors more and hopefully useful insight into our investment portfolios, we've expanded the information in our earnings supplement which is posted on our website. We've broken down the categories a little more finely, and we've provided unrealized gain and loss information by category. Now, I'd like to talk a little bit about capital and liquidity. The following comments maybe over done but given our recent stock price performance and investor sentiment generally, I think it's useful to reiterate what you may already know, reiterate the obvious if you will. We are extremely liquid and we have no current or foreseeable cash needs beyond what is readily available or even close to what is readily available on our balance sheet. As of September 30th, our cash and short-terms aggregated $1.4 billion and that's slightly higher as of now. All of our securities are mark-to-market and most have ready markets, so there is significant availability even beyond the $1.4 billion. We began the year with a significant capital redundancy related to our financial ratings. Our capitalization remains strong and comfortably supports our current rating levels. Our debt to capital ratios are well below currents as expressed by each of the rating agencies. We have committed an unused revolving credit availability of $500 million which could be used to bolster capital if we felt the need to do that, which we do not. In addition, our statutory operating companies are well capitalized and can provide about $650 million of additional dividends to the Group if that were needed which it is not. We don't see or foresee a near-term capital need. Our capital supports our ratings with a good size cushion, our debt is longer term with the earliest coming due in 2010 and that for only $200 million. Our run-rate of operating income is in the neighborhood of $225 million per quarter and operating cash flow is running at a similar pace, so the operation is self sustaining. The story this quarter is the catastrophic events both natural and man-made. Significant hurricane losses and financial market losses would have been characterized as a black swan event comparable to winning the lottery twice in a week. While, I don't think I buy into that level of remoteness, I do agree that this has been a very unique quarter nothing like we've ever seen before. And while, our investment portfolios took a hit it was not a devastating one. Our basic conservative nature and diversified portfolio mitigated against a much larger loss. We do not feel we need to fundamentally change our investment strategies which have kept us away from major pit falls. We've maintained our underwriting discipline and our fundamental operating results were strong, our accident quarter combined ratio ex-catastrophe losses was under 85, adding to that our expected cat losses of 9 points gives you an expected combined ratio in the low 90s, quite good at this point in the cycle. We have to our back a significant amount of stock over the past year and a half and we are ever mindful of capital management and the potential benefits to our shareholders. Our stock is very attractively priced in our view, 80% of book value looks like a real bargain to us. Nevertheless, given this current uncertainty in the financial markets, we think it makes sense to be less aggressive until the environment becomes less volatile. That doesn't mean we'll not buy in additional shares, but given that we now have less capacity to do so, we will likely be less aggressive than we might otherwise have been. We continue to have a very strong balance sheet. Our reserves are solid and our capital position is strong with low operating and financial leverage. We have plenty of liquidity to meet our cash obligations. We have no issues with respect to debt service or financial covenants in our credit agreements. Our capital position continues to be redundant relative to our meetings. We are optimistic that the recent financial market turmoil will hasten a turn in the insurance and reinsurance marketplace. And when that happens, we believe we are and we will be in a good position to capitalize on the opportunities. That concludes my remarks and we will open it up for questions now. Question And Answer
Operator: Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions]. Let's take our first question today from Josh Shanker with Citi.
Joshua Shanker - Citigroup: Good morning. In your opening remarks, you mentioned that these CV Starr business might have appeared under price to that you are receiving and for you are returning it down. I'm wondering if you have any opinions about this. Is this business that would be otherwise placed at AIG or what the... or where that business is going and whether it will turn it back to if things harden? And the second question and then I will get back in line. I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about outlook on 4Q investment losses?
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Okay. If I can try on the CV Starr, I mean my understanding is that the biggest part of the decline was the public entity business in the quarter. And it's simply that the pricing pressures in the market are such that the business just isn't meeting our return levels and therefore we're not riding it.
Joshua Shanker - Citigroup: And where is it going to?
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: It is going to be a variety of competitors, but certainly AIG would be the one but not the only one. It tends to be the bigger company is riding that business.
Joshua Shanker - Citigroup: And any comments you can make about equity losses or other investment losses in the fourth quarter?
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Clearly, since the end of the third quarter the equity markets have declined further and we've taken some unrealized losses there as well both credit and the Muni bond markets have widened some more. And we've taken some losses there. I think at this point it's premature to speculate of how much that might be. But it's not a significant amount from our perspective.
Joshua Shanker - Citigroup: Now, I'll get back in line. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Susan Spivak with Wachovia.
Susan Spivak - Wachovia Capital Markets: Good morning. Joe, thanks for your comments just on where we are in this cycle. And I guess, I just wanted to follow-up on something we heard this morning from a broker about the pricing in AIG in Lexington. Basically what AIG is doing everything they can to defend the pricing on this business. And my question to you is whether do you think this will work and will reinsurers be there to provide capacity outlook competitive prices or will we be in a better environment as you alluded to in your openings comments, where the clients will need more capacity and reinsurers will fit to the discipline?
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well Susan, I certainly I would like to think that that the reinsurers will take a good look at what they're supporting and only support those that are riding at adequate rates. We have seen certainly that AIG has some difficulty with attaining new business and even with some of its renewals given the changes that have happened for them and I'm certain here and there that they and others have gone to lower prices to maintain business. Again, we kind of are looking for a different world not just from them but from the whole marketplace going forward. A lot of this competition that we're talking about took place in the third quarter. And again, most people when they put their financials together at the end of the third quarter are looking at different numbers than they were at the end of the second quarter. So we certainly are hopeful that we will see some improvements across the board as we move toward one - one, as we move into 2009 from most of the companies out there because that really is what is needed, might you see some short term distress from those that have been harder hit by the changes? Yes we hope that works its way out, we hope that reinsurers only support those that are riding business at adequate rates.
Susan Spivak - Wachovia Capital Markets: Okay. And just I think a follow-up Joe, it's really the first time in years I heard you actually talk about an opportunity to pick up other companies and so I was wondering if you could just give us some more details of what might make a good fit with Everest?
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well, you are right Susan, historically we have looked to home growth and still that will be the primary focus. But there are some good companies out there that are certainly at very attractive prices and there are some small good companies that may want some added strength to give them better staying power in the current environment. And so I do think there maybe some increased opportunities. Now, our stock is not what it was, but that's the case for many of the public companies out there. So, that might even itself out. But looking for a better future in the industry and looking at some of the prices on some of the quality businesses out there, we are going to look around and have more conversations than we would have had a year ago.
Susan Spivak - Wachovia Capital Markets: Okay. That's fair. And just one more, any premium targets you have for '09 or is just too early?
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Too early. We put together budgets in the last couple of weeks, but I think we need to re-visit those budgets in light of new circumstances.
Susan Spivak - Wachovia Capital Markets: Okay. That's great. Thanks for the answer.
Operator: Next is Jay Gelb with Barclays Capital.
Jay H. Gelb - Barclays Capital Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. On the potential for a cycle turn, could this be a situation perhaps more like after the 2005 hurricane season, where there was expectations of perhaps more of a broad based churn and it just didn't come about given the amount of capital that was in the system or urged us, just something fundamentally different about it from this perspective?
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well certainly, that could happen, we can't tell you precisely what's going to happen, but there is certainly less capital suddenly in this system. And that's something that wasn't as much the case I think at the end of 2005. So that would mean that you might see changes that go beyond just the sectors that were hit by the hurricanes in 2005. And certainly we are hopeful that, that would be the case. But we can't guarantee anything in terms of how the world would change. I think Tom and I believe there certainly will be pockets that will change for January 1st, there will be more changes as we go into 2009. We don't expect wholesale across the board, every product, every country that happened before. I mean that happened in 2001 that happened in 1986. We don't see that happening, but we certainly are hopeful that as an intelligent industry that response to the conditions and we do see some improvements.
Jay H. Gelb - Barclays Capital Inc.: Okay. And then just to switch gears on investment income, the $11 million of partnership income in the third quarter. Any prospects of what that could be in the fourth quarter given dislocations in the market?
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: That income tends to be fairly volatile. We had exited some of our public securities oriented limited partnerships. At the same time we've embarked on an enhancement I guess to our equity management strategy and we've allocated some funds to some strategic equity managers. So we both decreased and increased our exposure to public securities in that sector of our income statement if you will. So at this point, we've got about 25% exposure to public securities in the overall limited partnership bucket. The project oriented part of the portfolio which is close to 50% and it's 45% to 50% tends to be more stable. And then we have another 30% that's in the Mezodine private equity finance and that tends to be more stable as well. So it's a little difficult to tell because you've got operating income or I guess I should say earned income flowing through there on the investments. And as well any mark-to-market gains to losses flow through that as income. I think it's likely to continue to be quite volatile given that the financial markets continue to be quite volatile.
Jay H. Gelb - Barclays Capital Inc.: Is there any lag on that from what was reported in the third quarter?
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: There tends to be a lag it can be a month to a quarter I will tell you one of our equity oriented limited partnerships did report their September results in time for us to book that in the quarter it was a loss and as a result we booked it.
Jay H. Gelb - Barclays Capital Inc.: Okay. And then I think you also mentioned the $15 million equity put option where did that get reflected in the income statement?
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: That's in derivative income; it has got a separate line item.
Jay H. Gelb - Barclays Capital Inc.: Okay, is that included in operating income?
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes.
Jay H. Gelb - Barclays Capital Inc.: So $15 million benefit?
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes.
Jay H. Gelb - Barclays Capital Inc.: Okay, thank you.
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: You are welcome.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tom Cholnoky with Goldman Sachs.
Thomas V. Cholnoky - Goldman Sachs: Good morning. And just two question, Joe. Just going back to acquisitions should we think, how should we think about you looking at there from a strategic perspective are you going to be looking at bolt on transactions potentially or transformational ones? I guess that's my first question and I will follow-up with another one. And would it be reinsurance versus insurance?
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Tom, I think in the last few years we probably were more interested in insurance than reinsurance but at this stage I think we would open up the... what we look out a little bit more. And I wouldn't rule out either, I mean bolt on always sounds more manageable, transformational sounds bolder for sure but I wouldn't dismiss either.
Thomas V. Cholnoky - Goldman Sachs: Okay. And then just, I don't know if there are any updates on Centrix at all or as you can just... we are still comfortably with where we are?
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Sure, Craig, will give you the answer.
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, very comfortable with where we are at present. Based upon well we commuted about a-third of our exposure with one of the policy holders and that was as of the end of last quarter, I think we covered that in our call last quarter. Looking at the actual paid losses this quarter, I think we would have expected about $10.5 million and we've seen $8.5 million. It's only one quarter so, I think it's probably premature to get too excited about it. But it's probably the first quarter we've seen in the long time, where we have seen actual results better than what we would have expected. The portfolio continues to decline and value are estimated, overall exposure is down in another $20 million - $30 million from last quarter. The portfolio is more mature, 90% plus of it, tends to be 60 days or less past due. So things seem to be pretty much under control there.
Thomas V. Cholnoky - Goldman Sachs: Okay. Then just sorry, one other final question, just in terms of the market environment in '09, is it my sense correct that probably perhaps more of the opportunities will be on the reinsurance than necessarily the insurance side? Is that the way to think about it given the way you describe the market environment?
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: If I could think, it will be both Tom, I mean we are certainly hoping that insurance rates reverse and begin to go up, in some pockets that have been heard like the property side, or the D&O side lead the way. We are also hopeful that there will be increased reinsurance opportunities, especially for companies that have the ratings and the financials that we have as the world wants to reduce some of this risk, and at the same time, get the best quality in terms of the reinsurance that it purchases. So it's a fluid situation. We can't predict it entirely, we'll see what happens and take it from there. But I'm hopeful both sides, we see increased opportunities.
Thomas V. Cholnoky - Goldman Sachs: I know, this I said was the last question, I'll get one more, sorry. Just going back to acquisitions, if in fact you were to do something on a transformational basis, would we... should we expect you to do that maybe perhaps within equity offering in conjunction within a large acquisition or how would you fund something like that?
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well, again Tom, in every situation would have its own uniqueness. Let me just state the obvious in terms of our stock is down and that's kind of something that makes you less keen to use it. But if you are talking to a potential partner that is also public with their stock down in our sector. Well as I said that kind of is offsetting, starts to make those kind of transactions more possible. The cash side of things, we're all looking to kind of maintain cash at this point and you had at the same time, you are looking at entities often that are selling below book. So that kind of is an inducement to go that way. So it would depend on the situation and the size and what we thought we have in the way of excess capital and what we thought the other entity has in the way of capitals and we deal with the uniquely molded.
Thomas V. Cholnoky - Goldman Sachs: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Matthew Heimermann with JPMorgan has a question.
Matthew G. Heimermann - JPMorgan: Good morning, everybody. Couple of questions, first on with respect to the improving pricing conditions next year, I guess one question I had was the sustainability, if we suddenly see credit improving and a lot of the damage has been done the fixed income side if spreads suddenly starts to come in, how would that affect the sustainability in your mind or the duration of any hardening we see next year?
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: That's really good question and I can't pretend that I know more than you know in terms of the answer to that. Let's face it most of us sit here hoping that the credit situation does improve and that bond values do come back. And if that's the case then suddenly you have more surplus coming back and I could see where that might mitigate some of the transformation that we are hoping will take place. But I would just say to you that, you know the dynamics on that as well as I do and so you can kind of do your own guess work, it's as probably as good as my guess work.
Matthew G. Heimermann - JPMorgan: Fair enough. And then I guess, how much of your, I guess one thing as I mean at '09, it's... in my view would be there is probably pressure there. So how much of you can book renews let's say in the first three months of the year where you potentially have maybe have higher probability to walk in a better environment?
Thomas J. Gallagher - President and Chief Operating Officer: I will have to say we probably do about 45% to 50% of our business during that period.
Matthew G. Heimermann - JPMorgan: Okay. And then... I was just hoping you could confirm or correct, my rough math was that AIG was roughly 7% of your business and I wanted to know if that was correct and in particular, how that's going to change given, I don't know whether to think of them was somebody you potentially needs more of your capacity or because of some of the dynamics potentially, you'll be looking elsewhere?
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: It's a mixed bag AIG has been and continues to be an important client to us. We deal with a number of the subs and entities within AIG. Clearly, they are going through some changes and those changes will continue. Certainly, you could argue that they may look to buy more reinsurance because of the surplus issues they have had. In addition, to that, a lot of these companies maybe sold and then they may have some new reinsurance purchasing missions after that. So far, we've probably seen little change in terms of the reinsurance purchasing that they do. It's been on that side of the fence for them, it's kind of been business as usual. But of course if there are sales and other things that may change going forward, it's hard to figure out whether all of what they are going through is good or bad or someone like in Everest, I'd like to think that as they go to their changes, we stand there ready to help them and it will actually be a net positive for us.
Matthew G. Heimermann - JPMorgan: Okay. And then I guess one for Craig, you made the comment that all your books mark-to-market and you have liquid proxies for most of it. I wanted to drove down on the Muni book, there is a big difference between where secondary pricing and where primary pricing is on similar new obligations coming to market. And I was just curious, which... how much flexibility you had in marketing and which price I guess signal you are relying on?
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Okay. I believe its secondary market. Its interactive data, Corp does our pricing for us through Deutsche and that's based on actual trades and similar trades and similarity in issues. And of course as you know that the muni market has been under a significant amount of pressure and we think... I guess it's more technical and fundamental as well as leverage structures are coming undone. Muni bond funds are in a negative cash flow position, the auction market of course collapsed etcetera so. It is the secondary market measure I believe and I can verify that to make sure that, that's my belief.
Matthew G. Heimermann - JPMorgan: Okay. Perfect, thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question will come from Ian Betterman with Adage Capital [ph].
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, guys. I want to ask you how you are thinking about your cost of capital today versus what it was say year ago? And what I mean by that is... if I am an insurer, a client of yours who maybe made some bad investment decisions maybe got hit by the cash pretty hard and the agencies are breathing down my neck a little. And I have a choice between raising capital well below book or given that I've raised my retentions the last few years coming to you guys and saying you know what maybe I am just going to buy a whole lot more reinsurance this year, because the cost of that capital is maybe today is 12% to 15%, maybe next year even if it is a little over 15%, still a heck of a lot cheaper than my alternative. So I guess what I am wondering is maybe pricing even more than your suggesting than maybe should be charging at 20% cost of capital because these clients do not have better alternatives and sure supply and demand with suggest. It is almost a new version of the reinsurance over charged not to your be ticking that business but that you are sort of that the cheap capital around the world for anyone to access?
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well, we certainly are hopeful that pricing will trends up and you probably need to give that speech to all of our competitors.
Unidentified Analyst: I hope they are listening.
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: We make an interesting point obviously companies that have dropped below the capital level that they need to run their businesses it's not an attractive option to go out to the market right now and raise additional capital. And so, one would guess that a better alternative might be increased use of reinsurance, which kind of just get back to our capital usage as well. So I think we're talking the same thing and I think we are seeing a dynamic play to improvements in our space and we certainly hope it does.
Unidentified Analyst: Well you have a higher hurdle rate for new business at one - one of '09 or one - one of '08?
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: We will. For certain segments of our business, we really will look to have improved conditions.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Great. That's what I wanted to hear. Thanks, Joe.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vinay Misquith with Credit Suisse.
Vinay Misquith - Credit Suisse: Hi, good morning.
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Good morning.
Vinay Misquith - Credit Suisse: In looking at the impact of unrealized losses on the capital of companies, could you help me understand whether rating agencies are actually looking at the unrealized losses because of your spread widening and things you have to hold more capital or are they looking beyond that? And this management that I... thinking in terms of the unrealized losses due to spread widening, is just a temporary phenomenon or how do you see that just more of a capital depletion which would make you to want raise rates more?
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Okay. Vinay, I think there is two parts to the question. On the first one kind of I guess is may sound a little flip, but intrusive how the rating agencies reviewing unrealized losses it's probably best to talk to them about that. Generally, the capital models require certain levels of capitals to back certain sort of risks. And unless and until they change those factors, the fact that you are in an unrealized or even a realized loss position isn't going to change those factors. As a result of what's happened in the last quarter or quarter and a half, they may reassess some of the those factors, and it may have an impact on the capital that they require at various rating levels going forward, but thus far, we haven't seen that. We have had discussions, and the discussions that we have had with the rating agencies relative to where we are, they seem to be quite comfortable.
Vinay Misquith - Credit Suisse: Okay. So, just to paraphrase that, would it be fair to assume that right now at least the rating agencies are looking beyond these spread widening and saying this is more of a temporary factor. And therefore, not pressing companies to keep more capital because of that.
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well no, I mean I think realistically, the rating agencies look at the required capital based upon the makeup of the income statement, the balance sheet, the reserves, the lines of business premium, growth, all of the aspects that they require capital for. They look at that relative to the capital that you have in your business, and then in essence they have a grid, right, that based upon the relationship between their view of the required capital and the actual capital that you have, you fall in the ratings grid. So, whether it's realized or unrealized I don't think that has a big impact at this point. Having said that, I would say in the short-term given that we're beginning at least to see a little bit of improvement maybe in the credit markets they may not be too active in terms of reducing company's ratings and give us some time to see what happens if some companies capital positions are not as strong as they were.
Vinay Misquith - Credit Suisse: Fair enough. The second question would be about your capacity to AIG. Now, we've heard anecdotes in the market about they being more competitive, would you be willing to pull back based on as you thought that the pricing was not adequate?
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, always that's what we do. I don't want you to sing a lot of AIG for us on that. That's true with any company we'd be training with. And sometime, we just look at the line of business that frankly we see if we did this to last soft market. It cuts to the point where many lines of business. We didn't like anybody was riding the business at. And so we pulled back from the entire market. So I think no one has done that better in the past than we have. And frankly, when you look at our numbers through the nine months, you can kind of see that even though we have great credit, we have been doing less business as we really have pulled back from certain areas. We continue to do that we thought rates were inadequate.
Vinay Misquith - Credit Suisse: It's fair enough. One last question if I may. Have you actually seen trying to become more rating sensitive because I often heard the arguments during hard markets as lines go to better red that green shows and of course you're one of them but have you actually seen that happen this time and if you could talk about the last hard market that's really happened?
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I think we're seeing it internationally probably more so than domestically. We're hearing that companies are looking to upgrade the overall credit rating with their panels; they are looking to replace companies whose credit ratings have fallen off etcetera. And in fact we can get, we have got seen some situations were we've gotten preferential pricing in preferential terms as a result of that. I think there is some shopping going on here in both on the direct side and the reinsurance side where companies whether they are actually replacing insurers and reinsurers in their programs. They are at least in the market looking where they think may have some credit concerns so I think from that standpoint stronger ratings it is definitely a benefit in this market.
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: But we see it in the U.S. on the casualty side not as much on the property side, but on the casualty side where it takes years for the losses to play out, and you were reinsurers would be around many years later we see a flight toward security.
Vinay Misquith - Credit Suisse: And would you say that a AA rating is sort of a must for the casualty reinsurance business?
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well I'd like to say that... various company is do is another matter and that obviously would be great limitation to the panel if they just use that. Although there are a few that keep the quality that high. There are some big companies that really only five or six reinsurers that they deal with and we just about always we are one of those five or six. But there are other companies that want a broader panel and certainly if it's property business they tend to broaden the panel because they are looking at it like they just need to the reinsurer to be around from one or two years. And so it's a lower requirement than the casualty business.
Vinay Misquith - Credit Suisse: And I thank you.
Operator: Josh Shanker with Citi has a follow-up question.
Joshua Shanker - Citigroup: Thank you, I don't mean to have you comment too much on a competitor but it's... remain to your business, I want to talk a little about what are you seeing in your business for the relation to the AIG situation are you seeing resonates are you seeing brokers contracting, and finally are you getting calls from clients who are just sniffing around finding out what their alternatives are?
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well, the answer is all of the above. I mean, I don't want to this call to turn into call that AIG, suppose to--
Joshua Shanker - Citigroup: I understand.
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: About Everest. But some of the things you cited are the things that you expect to be happening given the situation that AIG defends. And so, these things are at least in part happening. Now, where they go from here, the time will tell, we know that's going to be number of sales, we'll see what that does as they do get broken up. But I just want to cut a talk about it from the emphasis side, yes, there will be people, yes that will look to do other things outside of what the situation currently is at AIG. Of course their world has changed. At the same time, I think a lot of the units within AIG are still looking to bind together and still looking to be a major player and still looking to buy a reinsurance and still looking to deal with a company as like ourselves that they've been dealing with for many years. Even if they get sold, in fact if they get sold they may need us more than they ever have before, because certainly we're not talking to this company that's $200 billion in market cap and could very, very frequently tell us, we'll just keep it next if you don't like it. So, I do think it will make for opportunities for us, but as far as the AIG itself the things that you mentioned. Sure, I mean that's happening because of what they are going through.
Joshua Shanker - Citigroup: I appreciate I really think you can't give too much away. But, thank you.
Operator: And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the conference to our host for any closing or additional remarks.
Elizabeth B. Farrell - Vice President of Investor Relations: Thank you for joining us this morning and certainly as always if you have any follow-up questions that we did not touch on, please feel free to call me. Again, thank you.
Operator: And that does conclude our conference call. Thank you for joining us today. .

Operator:
Good day, everyone. Welcome to the Second Quarter 2008 Earnings Release Call of Everest Re Group. Today's conference is being recorded.:
At this time, for opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Beth Farrell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.:
Elizabeth B. Farrell - Vice President, Investor Relations: Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Everest Re's second quarter 2008 earnings conference call. With me this morning are Joe Taranto, our CEO; Tom Gallagher, our President; and Craig Eisenacher, our CFO. Before we begin, I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I note that statements made during today's call which are forward-looking in nature, such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations and the like, are subject to various risks. As you know, actual results could differ materially from current expect projections or expectations. Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements. Now let me turn the call over to Joe Taranto.
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Beth. Good morning. I'll comment on the marketplace and our portfolio and then turn it over to Craig to review the financials. Our core book of business continues to perform well, and even though we are seeing increased competition, our ratings and established platform help us to attract the best clients and the best deals. Our international reinsurance book, including our one in the European operation, represents about 38% of our worldwide portfolio. Overall, we found major treaty reinsurance to be disciplined. Price reductions on catastrophe and the risk excess programs to clean records have been on the order of 5% to 10%. Price increases have been attained on programs that have been affected by losses, which includes clients in Mexico, Australia, Chile and Peru. Proportional reinsurance terms have remained stable. We are pleased with our July 1st renewals. About 15% of the international business renews in July. We were able to increase our business in 2008 over 2007 as we obtained increases in Latin America, the Middle East, Asia and Canada. We continue to benefit from our strong long-term relationships with ceding companies and our solid ratings. Our U.S. reinsurance business, including business written out of our Bermuda branch operation, represents roughly one-third of our worldwide business with property reinsurance being about 20% and casualty reinsurance being about 12%. Regarding the property business, the bulk of our midyear activity is June, where we fared extremely well in securing our positions in the Florida market. This block of business is about $300 million in total with roughly 250 million being pro rata and 50 million being excess. Whereas excess rates were off, perhaps 15%, this in fact increases the profitability on the pro rata business and leaves the potential profitability on the overall portfolio undiminished. On the commercial property business, despite mounting risk losses for the industry, rates continue to go down, perhaps on the order of 10%-ish, 2008 versus 2007. Here, we continue to maintain our portfolio of highly select industry leaders that historically will outperform the market. U.S. casualty reinsurance continues to experience rate reductions on underlying insurance, coupled with reductions at the reinsurance level. We also see a continued trend to our company's keeping more net. This activity has reduced the available business with reasonable profit potential. Accordingly, we continue to reduce our premium as we maintain our disciplined underwriting approach. As mentioned, this segment in 2008 represents only 12% of our overall portfolio. The only prominent exceptions to the market softening have been in the E&O and D&O coverage written for risks exposed to the subprime crisis. Our focus is to maintain our most profitable relationships. Our ratings are particularly valuable on casualty deals where payments were made over many years. Our insurance operation represents 23% of our worldwide premium. It's mainly niche oriented casualty business. Even the orientation of our portfolio, we are more resistant to the softening taking place in the market. Still we see increased pressure for reduced rates and higher retail commissions. Programs that we recently added kicked in for the second quarter and helped premiums to rise 18% in the quarter and 6% year-to-date. Our specialty reinsurance book represents 8% of our worldwide book and includes our marine, aviation, surety accident and health book. Whereas we have experienced increases competition in all of these areas, we have taken this book down in recent years to the core profitable clients and don't expect much overall change in 2008. In summary, the marketplace is getting temperature, particularly in the U.S. Our portfolio will be affected, but -- given our international reinsurance composition, our insurance business composition, which is highly specialized, our position in the Florida property reinsurance marketplace, and our quality client base, which includes many long-term relationships. Now I'll turn it over to Craig.
Craig E. Eisenacher, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Joe, and good morning. Our second quarter net operating income was $180 million, compared to $213 million in the second quarter of 2007. Net operating income for fully diluted share was $2.90, compared to $3.36 in the second quarter of 2007. Net income including net after-tax realized gains and losses, and fair-value adjustments was $153 million, down from $283 million in the second quarter of 2007. On a per-share basis that's $2.47, in this year's second quarter, compared to $4.45 in last year's second quarter. During the quarter, our book value per share decreases slightly to $90.32 from $91.01 at the end of the first quarter. The quarters operating earnings were slightly more than offset by changes in the fair-value of both our fixed-income and equity portfolios, share repurchases and dividend payments. On a year-to-date basis our book value per share is almost flat, reasonable result given that the S&P index was down almost 13%, [inaudible] aggregate was down by 1.4% and we paid out $0.96 per share in dividends. For the six months net operating income was $371 million, compared to $481 million for the first six months of 2007. Realized capital losses and fair-value adjustments year-to-date were at loss of $141 million after-tax, almost all of which derived from our common stock portfolio, and almost all of which is mark-to-market related. In contrast, we had a realized gain of $99 million during the first half of 2007. Net income including after-tax realized gains and losses was $231 million for the first half of this year, compared to $580 million for the first half of last year. Our operating ROEs were 12.8% and 13.2% for the second quarter and first half of 2008. Looking at the top line, in total our gross written premiums were $905 million for the quarter, 3% lower than the second quarter of last year. Our year to date gross written premium at $1.8 billion is down 9% compared to the first half of 2007, about in line with our expectations. By segment, U.S. reinsurance at $200 million was lower by 26% for the quarter, both treaty property, and treaty casualty were lower. Treaty property was lower for the quarter due to increased common account reinsurance protections on some Florida business and non-renewal of several agreements. However, we do expect more favorable comparisons in the third quarter. We continue to see less casualty business that meets our term requirements and our casualty book continues to shrink but at a slower rate than in prior periods. U.S. insurance recorded gross written premium of $191 million, up 18% compared to the second quarter of 2007. Our newer programs, most notably the brownstone program, plus growth in the CV stock program more than offset declines in our [inaudible] programs principally the workers comp and contractor-related books. International at $219 million was up 8% compared to the second quarter of last year, we saw increased new business in Latin America and the Middle East, and some growth from existing business in Asia. Canadian premiums were down somewhat as we continued to see our Canadian retain more premium net. The Bermuda segment brought $211 million which was lower than in the second quarter of 2007 by 6%. The London and Europe book was up by 11%, compared to the second quarter of 2007, aided by the weaker U.S. dollar. The Bermuda book on the other hand was down due to a discontinued account and conversion of a large casualty quota share to an excessive loss cover. Specialty segment gross written premium was $84 million for the second quarter up 10% from last year's second quarter. Remaining premiums were up significantly, primarily due to two new accounts. A&H was slightly lower and Surety was slightly higher. Looking at underwriting results, the group combined ratio was 94.4%, for the second quarter of 2008 compared to 89.2% for the second quarter of 2007. The increase for the quarter results from a 2.2 point increase in the loss ratio, and a 3 point increase in the expense ratio. Most of the expense ratio increase is driven by commissions, which are moving higher because of competitive conditions, higher contingent commission payouts, and the structure of several quoted share agreements. An increase in the reserve for the Centrix subprime auto loan credit insurance program, which is in runoff contributed 7.4 points to the group's loss ratio for the quarter and I will talk more about that in a moment. Absent discharge, the loss ratio would have been 56.8%, compared to 62% in the second quarter of last year, a decrease of 5.2 points, the principal drivers of the improvement were very low catastrophe losses in the second quarter of 2008 compared to the second quarter of 2007, 1.9 points in this year's second quarter versus 8 points in last year's second quarter, a 6-point improvement. This was partially offset by a 2.6 point higher accident year attritional loss ratio, that's excluding catastrophes, which was at 56.5%, compared to 53.9% last year. Most segments experienced increases in their accident year attritional los ratio; this is driven by changes in market conditions as well as changes in business mix. Excluding the Centrix charge, we experienced $16 million or 1.7 points of favorable development across the remainder of our reserves in the second quarter of 2008. This compares to a deminimus amount of adverse development in last year's second quarter. Our ongoing results are developing fine -- the accident year loss ratio is attractive, albeit slightly higher as one would expect given market conditions and trends. Our reserves are strong and ran off a little favorably in the quarter, exclusive of the Centrix strengthening. On the subject of Centrix, the quarters and six-month operating results were negatively impacted by reserve additions for the Centrix subprime auto loan insurance program, which after taxes totaled $45.5 million for the quarter, and $55.4 million for the six months. Our previous reserve actions on this program were reasonable, given the actual historical loan-default rates and the claim amounts. However, the recent deterioration in general economic conditions and apparent adverse impact on loan performance, particularly subprime loan performance overall has resulted in unforeseeable in loan default base and claim amounts. This program is our only exposure of this type, and it has been in run off since December of 2005, so I want to be clear that we're not in this business on a continuing basis. Moreover, we have commuted our remaining liability with our largest policyholder who represented about one third of the outstanding insured portfolio prior to the commutation that took place this quarter. Therefore given the magnitude of the current reserves, maturity of the remaining insured portfolio, and the reduced principal exposure, future loss development if any will not be material. We believe this reserve strengthening is sufficient for several reasons. First, adjusting for the commutation, we had $51 million of reserves remaining to cover future losses on the remainder of the portfolio as of June 30th. This amount anticipates claims on 100% of the loans currently known to be in default, and contemplates claim payments attributable to future defaults on an additional 30% of the active loans. Second, as of June 30, only 7% of the remaining insured loans were over 60 days past due. Looked at another one, 93% of the portfolio was current to less than 60 days past due. The portfolio by now is mature and seasoned. The average loan is 47 months old, and therefore the average borrower is obtaining for almost four years and demonstrated a strong propensity to pay. Finally the oldest loans are 57 months old with only nine months remaining. Putting all of this in to perspective, our reserve now provides for defaults on 30% of the active loans, and as I said, we believe this is a very strong provision. Even in the highly unlikely event that the default on the remaining loans were to reach 50%, the after-tax impact would be just $15 million. So at this point there is just not enough remaining exposure for this to have a material effect on our balance sheet or the financial results in the future. Moving on looking at cash flow. Cash flow for the quarter was $18 million, negative for the quarter, compared to $100 million for the second quarter of 2007. We paid out the arbitration loss we reported last quarter, plus premium collections have fallen somewhat as our premium bases declined. In addition, last year's second quarter cash flow benefited from reinsurance collected on prior accident year coverage that has since been fully exhausted. Quarterly cash flows can be quite variable. Looking at year to date cash flow from operation, it's $232 million, compared to $263 million for the first half of last year. And that's probably more in line with what one would expect. Moving on to the investment portfolio, cash and invested assets were $14.6 billion at June 30, 2008, compared to $14.9 billion at year end. That's a decline of about $300 million. Year-to-date, operating cash flow was $232 million, and we've repurchased $126 million of our common stock, plus paid out $60 million in dividends, leaving $46 million that flowed into our investment portfolios. On a year-to-date basis, we have experienced $150 million of market value loss on our public equity portfolio and $215 million on our bond portfolio, generally in line with the financial market's performance overall. Given the Fed-driven decline in short-term rates, we've trimmed our short-term portfolios quite significantly, redeploying close to $1 billion into short duration or zero duration floating rate instruments, the intent being to increase our book income without significantly increasing our interest-rate risk. We estimate that this has mitigated what would have been about $20 million decline in our annualized investment income. Our charge for other than temporary impairments for the quarter was $5.6 million, relatively immaterial, as our conservative portfolio continued to hold up well in the face of very volatile financial market conditions. The average quality rating of our portfolio remains very strong at AA2. The duration moved out just a bit to 4.4 years from 4.1 years as of March 31st. As I noted, we redeployed about $1 billion in short-terms. As well, we've bought some longer muni bonds where the yields are going to be quite attractive relative to historical levels. Looking at investment income, pre-tax investment income was $176 million for the quarter. That's down $3.8 million from the second quarter of last year. The decline was driven by short-term… lower short-term interest rates more than anything else. Our limited partnership investments after… for our first quarter performed much better than in the second quarter, producing an annualized return of about 15%. If I may summarize, our gross written premium was down just slightly from last year's second quarter. Our current accident year results were strong. Catastrophe losses were light. And investment income was much stronger than in the first quarter. Despite the charge for the Centrix program, our GAAP net operating income was $180 million and our combined ratio was under 95%. The Centrix runoff is well reserved at this point. And if there is any future development, it won't be material. So, that's behind us, which we view as a plus. On the other hand, the stock and bond markets have been both volatile and in decline since late last year and thus has constrained our ability to grow book value. We continue to have a strong balance sheet. Our reserves are solid. Our capital position is strong with low operating and financial leverage. We have a well-diversified underwriting platform that's generating attractive combined ratios. So despite a tougher marketplace, we expect to continue to produce attractive results. We now have authority to repurchase up to an additional 6.1 million shares of our common stock, which enables us to add further to shareholder value. While all of the markets in which we operate have become tougher, we will continue to run the business for the long term. We will continue to exercise underwriting discipline and we will focus on maximizing shareholder value. That concludes my prepared remarks. And now, we'd like to open it up for questions. QUESTION-AND-ANSWER
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And we'll take our first question from Tom Cholnoky with Goldman Sachs.
Thomas Cholnoky - Goldman Sachs: Good morning. I have a couple of questions. First, if I could just focus on Centrix for a second. Craig, in your 30% default assumption rate, are you assuming any recoveries in that forecast?
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Not other than collateral value on the loans. So basically what we're doing is we're looking at an ultimate default rate. We're looking at the collateral value to come down to a net amount per claim and the reserves developed by the numbers of claims times the estimated average value of the claim. So, there is no recovery for anything else.
Thomas Cholnoky - Goldman Sachs: So if the value of the cars go down or you don't get the cars back, you are not assuming anything on that?
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. If we don't get the car back, there is no claim. Part of the process of funding a claim in this situation is for the automobile to be auctioned off.
Thomas Cholnoky - Goldman Sachs: Okay. So, if auction values decline significantly from these values, could that raise your loss assumption?
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, it could. We've forecasted, you know, based upon the existing collateral value and forecasts are continuing to decline over time.
Thomas Cholnoky - Goldman Sachs: And how much… what is the balance of the loans outstanding? Is it about 170 million?
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: The loans outstanding after the commutation I mentioned?
Thomas Cholnoky - Goldman Sachs: Yes.
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: It's about 270 million, and we would estimate that exposure, that is the gap between the loan value less the collateral or what we are could pay for loan, is about 165 million at this point.
Thomas Cholnoky - Goldman Sachs: Okay. Okay. Got you.
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: So, our exposure -- I guess, another way to put it is our exposure at this point is $165 million. And it's going down as the loans either pay off or pay down.
Thomas Cholnoky - Goldman Sachs: Right, right, right. Okay. Some other people may have more questions on that. Two other quick questions if I can. In looking at the U.S. insurance business and the way the C. V. Starr business has kicked in, and I know there can be quarterly fluctuations in your premium volume, but 18% was very strong growth. How should we think about that going forward? Are you going up against some tougher comparisons, or is this a bit of anomaly in the quarter in terms of absolute growth?
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer: Tom, I would say that you should look at the quarter it anomaly 18% is -- my guess would be much higher than what we would expect for the year. I think we're looking at something like 6% for the six months, and that would be, I think, probably a better gauge as to what you might expect for the year. But we do have a lumpy second quarter in terms of CV Starr premium, and even to a degree the brownstone premiums.
Thomas Cholnoky - Goldman Sachs: Okay. And then I guess on the buyback, if I can just real quickly, given, you know, how under -- much under pressure the stock was in the second quarter, why weren't you more active in buying back stock?
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer: Tom, we have been buying back quite a bit of stock for the last year, as I suppose the -- as a whole industry has, you know, it's hard to say that we've seen an immediate result on that, although all of us believe that we'll see a quality long-term result, having invested in our ourselves, and we plan to continue to do that, which is why we've opt the authorization. But I will tell you, as we bought some in the beginning of the quarter, you know, we continue to look at what was happening in the -- in the financial markets. We saw the trends that were going on that were just, you know, causing the numbers to be read for everybody that was in the financial sector. Candidly, I thought we could just pause, take a step back, see where the market was going because we certainly couldn't change it in and of ourselves. Having said that, yes, we have dropped to appoint -- and I think many other companies would say the same thing that we think is irrational, and we're very happy to start repurchasing and investing in ourselves for the long term once again. By not buying sooner, that just means that we have more to buy with at this stage of the game. We're going in to the third quarter, which typically is you know, hurricane quarter, and in the past we decided not to purchase and put that message out, we're not taking that approach here. We will maintain flexibility and frankly we expect to be purchasing in the third quarter.
Thomas Cholnoky - Goldman Sachs: Okay. Great. And sorry one last, just number's question, IBNR is a percentage of total reserves, where does that stand now roughly?
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Off the top of my head, I can't answer that. I can check and let you know offline.
Thomas Cholnoky - Goldman Sachs: Okay. Great. Thanks.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Jay Gelb with Lehman Brothers.
Jay Gelb - Lehman Brothers: Thanks and good morning. On the reinsurance businesses given the difference in growth trends between primarily insurance and reinsurance, can you sort of give us your outlook for '08 for gross written premium growth? If we should expect, say, 6% for the year in insurance?
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer: Well, let me start with, you know, it's hard to be precise about this. So, I don't want everybody leaving with 6% in their mind. That's only precise, and it's a very, very a changing marketplace, and challenging marketplace, but, you know, it's been tougher on the reinsurance side than it has on the insurance. As I have mentioned in previous calls, we're well established and then seasoned on the reinsurance side, whereas, we're relatively young company on the insurance side. Casualty reinsurance, we have a tough situation with people keeping more net with reinsurance terms getting more favorable for CD company, and so that continues to become a lower percentage, and even on the property side, you know, it is certainly getting a bit tougher. So, I would expect that we would decline in the second half of 2008, relative to what we wrote in the second half of 2007.
Jay Gelb - Lehman Brothers: For reinsurance overall?
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer: For reinsurance over overall. For our U.S. reinsurance.
Jay Gelb - Lehman Brothers: Okay.
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer: On the international side, we continue to do quite well, and as I mentioned, in July, we were really pleased with the results that we achieved. Now, we're pleased with what we did on the property reinsurance in June and July as well, which is mainly the Florida marketplace, but I still see casualty reinsurance kind of reducing in the U.S. and probably taking down the amount of U.S. reinsurance in the second half, again, relative to last year. International, probably would be modestly up in the second half relative to last year. That's my best guess.
Jay Gelb - Lehman Brothers: Okay. And if I kind of pull that all together, I think initially at the beginning of the year, Joe you were talking about a 5% to 10% decline overall in gross written premium, you still okay with that range?
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer: I am, I mean obviously, we were higher in the first quarter, lower in the second quarter, and I guess what we're 9% at this stage of the game, so we fallen in to that range. But yes, given the climate, and we put our whole book together, the whole composite, I would still expect us to fall in that range.
Jay Gelb - Lehman Brothers: All right, thank for that. And then the partnership income showed that a sharp rebound in 2Q. What was that driven by given a tough market for the industries overall?
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Really what happened in the first quarter is the limited partnerships with public equities did terribly, and in the second quarter that wasn't the case. So, the rest of the portfolio performed about the same.
Jay Gelb - Lehman Brothers: And how are things looking so far in 3Q?
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: We -- you know, we get reports on -- you know, monthly or quarterly basis from our LPs, so, you know, at this point I would anticipate that it's probably more of the same.
Jay Gelb - Lehman Brothers: Great. And then just a final quick one, on the -- does Everest Re have any exposure to crop reinsurance in the US for reinsurance?
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer: No, we don't have any.
Jay Gelb - Lehman Brothers: Okay. Thanks very much.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Josh Shanker with Citi.
Joshua Shanker - Citigroup: Good morning.
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Joshua Shanker - Citigroup: My first question regards the retentions on the primary side. They have doubled from what they were a year ago, 19% now from 10%. Of course you had the growth of 18% from CV Starr and Brownstone. I am trying to understand in terms of business mix, are you ceding that CV Starr and Brownstone business or ceding your legacy business and retaining a lot of that CV Starr and Brownstone business?
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: There is more reinsurance being purchased on the primary side.
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer: And there is an increase because of CV Starr. CV Starr is more volatile, bigger limit program than many of our other programs, and so it -- it requires us to get some partners on the reinsurance side.
Joshua Shanker - Citigroup: And how do you feel about the terms, the pricing of the reinsurance that you are buying, versus the reinsurance that you are selling. Do you see -- do you see that softening compared to where it was a year ago?
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer: Well, yeah, I mean the trends that we are seeing as we are reporting, is it's getting tougher for reinsurers, so we are seeing people asking for more commission and better terms and certainly the market is headed that way.
Joshua Shanker - Citigroup: Okay. And coming back to Centrix, I know it's a sore subject but I got to keep with at it little longer.
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer: Okay.
Joshua Shanker - Citigroup: In terms of -- of your confidence and your current level of adequacy with regards to it, are you saying that you were so adequately reserved that there's the possibility of being meaningfully over reserved at this point? Have you -- Is there any reason to consider that?
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I wouldn't go there at this point. I think the experience has been -- it's continued to deteriorate for sometime if we take a heavier hand this quarter than we have in prior quarters. Absolutely we have, but that's -- that's not to say that we're, you know, expecting to have a significant redundancy here. I think we're in good shape with it.
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer: Let me add to that, and -- and you are right, Centrix has been a painful experience for us in the past that we don't just dislike. We hate. So, let's get that clear. But we are trying to very clearly communicate to you that its -- the good news is it's in the past. You know, I think Craig has taken you through a host of numbers, and went through Armagedon, at least in our minds, which 50% to both on loans that don't have much longer to go that have been paying for four or five years, and that comes down to net-net after tax $15 million. So clearly, you can see, you know, this is a past item. This is not a future item. So, that part is -- is the good news, and we're looking to move on to talking about what will our affect our business in the future.
Joshua Shanker - Citigroup: Well, is there any IB&R in the reserving for Centrix, or is it really all case?
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer: No, it includes, these are all defaults -- ultimately, this is not the way some companies do it, where they don't post the reserve until there is a default. This is ultimate, if you will.
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Our lag from when a loss is reported to us, we paid is very short. So, actually it is almost all IB&R.
Joshua Shanker - Citigroup: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Susan Spivak with Wachovia.
Susan Spivak - Wachovia Securities: Good morning. I guess a lot of questions have been answered, but Joe and Craig, couple more. I was hoping on a net-net basis in Florida versus a year ago, could you tell us how much you did increase your exposure there? That's my first question. And then second, and this is broader, Joe, your stock looks like it is going to test the valuation lows of 1999 at this point, or at least come close, and, you know, I'm very happy to hear that you are -- will be repurchasing chair shares, even in the midst of hurricane season. But could you compare and contrast the fundamental reinsurance market now versus then, and Everest position now versus what you were like back then at this time when the stock trade at this point?
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer: Let me start with the second part, Susan. You are correct. In 1999, I think the stock fell to something like 72% of book. We felt that made no sense. We went in, we bought 10% of the stock at that particular point in time, proved to be the best investment that we could -- we could make. If I had to contrast -- and we thought it was an irrational price then, and frankly, we think it is an irrational price now. If I had a contrast, the market in 1999, the reinsurance market, was terrible, and frankly is much better today than it was in 1999. There's plenty of deals to be found today that are adequately priced or more than adequately priced. It was very difficult in 1999 to find much of anything in any line in any country that was reasonably -- reasonably priced. I would add to that that the balance sheet of most of the companies in the industry in 1999 were -- were not very good, and when you think about 1997 and '98 and '99 that ran off very poorly and that wasn't fully appreciated at that point in time. But if you really throw that into the thinking process, the balance sheet today for us and most people in the industry are just much, much stronger than they were in 1999. So, yes, some comparisons be made in the sense that in 1999, during the dot-com boom, we were labeled old economy, and for that reason, traded to levels that made no sense. And frankly when you start throwing in the balance sheets today and the marketplace today and our strength today, frankly it doesn't make a lot of sense to us today either. The Florida market, on balance, I would say that our increase in exposure in Florida has been just over 5% in cat capacity.
Susan Spivak - Wachovia Securities: Okay. Well, it won't be so bad if your stock performed the way it did in 2000 from here. So, that would be great. But another just follow-up question. Could you talk about a little bit about whether you are starting to see some additional business on the casualty reinsurance side, coming out of, say, the woes of other companies we saw yesterday that there is talk of State [ph] bringing excel reoff of their approved lists? I would think that you'd be the one of the primary markets to benefit, you know, as we see problems at other companies.
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer: Well, I would just say that we're pleased that, you know, we're A+ Best and AA S&P, and that really does mean that we see all the best deals. And obviously, as ratings change for others, that can be helpful to us.
Susan Spivak - Wachovia Securities: All right. Okay. Thank you, Joe.
Operator: And we'll take the next question from Matthew Heimermann with JPMorgan.
Matthew Heimermann - JPMorgan: Hi. Good morning, everyone.
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, Matt.
Matthew Heimermann - JPMorgan: I had a… Joe, I was just wondering if you could clarify something from your earlier comments. You made the comment that, I think if I heard it right, that with excess pricing and profitability falling, quota share profitability was up. And I don't know if you were just… that was a relative comment or absolute. And if it was absolute, I was just wondering if you could explain why that would be the case.
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer: Sure. Let me take through that. Roughly 80% of the premium dollars that we get from Florida are actually share proportional. So, you know, we're in there with the underlying insured and pretty much experiencing the same loss ratios that they do. If they are suddenly paying excess rates that are 15% lower than the rates they were paying the year prior, then on that basis alone, you would expect their loss ratios to be better. And therefore, our loss ratios would be better. So, it's kind of a good news-bad news thing. With excess rates going down when we're an excess reinsurer, we're getting paid less. We're not thrilled about that. But as a proportional reinsurer, which is 80% of the business, our loss ratio is actually improving. And I think when you put it all together, I really see our profitability picture and potential going forward being much the same. As Tom noted, our exposure maybe up on some of the proportional deals. We did have to offer some more capacity. But you can see how just excess rates coming down actually work to our betterment. Now, it gets a little muted. It's a little more complicated than that, because now the insurance companies have to get approval from the insurance department with regard to rates and they do have to factor in, in part their reinsurance costs and certainly the State may want them to take rates down a bit, because they're paying a bit less. But still I think on balance when you put it all together for our portfolio, I don't really see the potential profit diminished.
Matthew Heimermann - JPMorgan: Okay. And does the excess add [ph] on to your benefit in all cases on all quota shares?
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, unless we choose not to buy or participate with the client. But if we are participating with the client in essentially what they've bought and our net loss ratio will be the same as their net loss ratio, and suddenly they are paying less for reinsurance, then yes, it works to our benefit.
Matthew Heimermann - JPMorgan: Okay. And then just a numbers question. Can you give us the P&L as it stood at June 30?
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer: The P&L for what?
Matthew Heimermann - JPMorgan: Just your 1 and 100 P&L, as a percentage of… I think you guys gave it as a percentage of shareholders' equity.
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I think we disclosed it as of January 1st in the 10-K. I would say it hasn't changed this time. I think as Tom indicated, we're up maybe 5% in Florida, but there is not a significant change in that.
Matthew Heimermann - JPMorgan: Okay. And then, Craig, on that… you made the comment about the reallocation out of short-term investments.
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Correct.
Matthew Heimermann - JPMorgan: And you were a bit quantitative, and that that was going to save 20 million of NII. Yet, NII looked a bit lighter than I would have expected even with the move in rates. So, I'm guessing is… was there something about the allocation in 1Q that depressed NII relative to run rate or it was the --.
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: The portfolio… the short-term portfolio was much larger in the first quarter. And short-term rates, of course, were lower in the first quarter of this year than the first quarter of last year. So, that was part of it. And then we basically made most of the move from short-terms into floaters, some longer-rate paper, et cetera, in the second quarter. So, you don't really see the full impact in the second quarter, because it took place during the course of the quarter.
Matthew Heimermann - JPMorgan: Okay. That is fair. And then the only question on Centrix that I had was just you know, on subprime there's been a delineation in terms of vintage, I mean, kind of '06, and later is worse than '05 and prior. Now obviously you stopped originating the business kind of at that demarcation point, but I was just curious within your book, do you notice any difference in performance for old versus new?
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Generally speaking the newer the origination month or vintage as you call it, the worse the experience is.
Matthew Heimermann - JPMorgan: Okay.
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Generally speaking, it's not universally true. I mean we're looking at these things on a month-by-month basis. That's kind of generally speaking the trend on the newer worsen the trends on the older.
Matthew Heimermann - JPMorgan: Okay. All right, thank you very much.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from William Wilt with Morgan Stanley.
William Wilt - Morgan Stanley: Hi, good morning. Craig, a question for you, staying with the investment scene, in the first quarter call you mentioned that you -- that Everest has purchased lots of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and I was wondering if you could quantify that, describe what those securities are, maybe just give an update on their performance.
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Lots for us -- I think we hold $130 million, so lots is maybe not lots in the context of some other companies and basically, those securities are at-cost in our portfolio at this point no debt securities.
William Wilt - Morgan Stanley: And there are senior debt of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac?
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Excuse me.
William Wilt - Morgan Stanley: I'm sorry. There was senior debt of in your data of Fannie and Freddie.
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: They are debt securities of Fannie and Freddie, yeah.
William Wilt - Morgan Stanley: Okay. Thanks for that. And the question on commissions, you commented that commissions are going up is that the natural sort of cycle. Could you quantify how much they have gone up thus far and maybe relative to past cycles where you are in terms of work, where the market is in terms of upward pressure on commissions?
Thomas J. Gallagher - President and Chief Operating Officer: Commissions right now are -- I think as Craig suggested there about 3% higher than they have been in the past. I don't know if I can give you an answer this relates to other segments of the market in different times, but it's a fairly good-sized increase 3 points over a year. So I don't know if it will go much further.
William Wilt - Morgan Stanley: That's fine. I appreciate that. So it's 3% higher than a year ago?
Thomas J. Gallagher - President and Chief Operating Officer: Yes.
William Wilt - Morgan Stanley: Average? Okay. Thanks very much.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Vinay Misquith with Credit Suisse.
Vinay Misquith - Credit Suisse: Hi, good morning. On your Florida exposure, would it be fair to say that you are more exposed to frequency rather than severity events? And what sort of losses maybe should we expect from a smaller storm, say a storm that cause around $5 billion worth of losses?
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer: Well, I guess you would say yes that we would be more than people are just doing excess exposed to smaller storms and frequency on that, but when you start getting in to the smaller-storm scenarios, frankly the modeling that we do with most of our clients, they still come out profitable for the year. I mean, in the main -- I think you see something like 50 is combined on most of these insurance companies in Florida if there's no hurricanes. So there is certainly room for small hurricanes and even more than one, so, yes, you would see some losses where if you were only excess, you wouldn't have any losses, but we believe we would still be look at a profitable scenario, even for the pro rata unless you get into a big loss scenario.
Vinay Misquith - Credit Suisse: Its fair enough. Is most of your exposure with the home owner's or do you also have some amount of commercial in there?
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer: We have both, but most of it with the home owner.
Vinay Misquith - Credit Suisse: All right, fair enough. And a question on the investment portfolio, I noticed that the mixed move from -- you know, lower AAA to more A and AA, was it a function of the financial guarantors being downgraded, or did you actually move some securities from AAA to A and AA.
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: The biggest factor was the monoline downgrades. It affected about $1 billion of our muni paper. So, that was all AAA and its now basically AA and A in category. I would point though that our A and higher -- the A and higher portion of the investment portfolio, was 91.6% at December 31st, and its 91.3% now, so it's not like we have taken the stops out in terms of our quality buys.
Vinay Misquith - Credit Suisse: Sure. Fair enough. One last question on U.S. insurance, you are accident -- your combined ratio was 101% this quarter, I was just wondering whether there was something special this quarter or -- and what would you expect the run rate normally to be within U.S. insurance?
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I thought it was like 98.
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer: Let me get in to what the run rate is. We really expect on the ongoing programs to be achieving an underwriting profit, something in today's market that would put us in to the probably low 90s combined, worse-case scenario, mid-90s combined. It's getting tougher to get huge margins but most of our programs are still rated that way, and we believe will produce those kinds of results.
Thomas J. Gallagher - President and Chief Operating Officer: Yeah, and there's some distortion in the numbers you see because of the Centrix going through the insurance portfolio.
Vinay Misquith - Credit Suisse: Fair enough. All right. Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our final question, it is a follow-up from Jay Gelb with Lehman Brothers.
Jay Gelb - Lehman Brothers: Thanks, I said one follow-up on Centrix. You said that the reserve going forward assumes 30% delinquency on remaining loans. What has the historical delinquency trends been and also for the more recent vintage years?
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: That's default, so we're assuming that 30% of the remaining loan portfolio will result in claims. That -- you know, that portfolio is fairly mature at this point. I guess the way to compare it and contrast it might be that as of the end of the first quarter, we assume that 38.5% ultimate default rate on the portfolio, and it's now up to 44%. And that's on the portfolio as a whole based on the original loans. And basically, if you look at the trends in terms of how the default rates develop, we see very little development beyond 48 months. Now, I have to say that, you know, there's not a lot of experience, and we don't have any loans that have actually gone all the way to maturity. So it looks to us, based upon the historical data, like there isn't an awful lot of development from 48 months to maturity, based upon what we can see at this point. It's the younger loan, is the loans from 36 months to 48 months, which is where we have seen development in the past. Does that make -- does that help you.
Jay Gelb - Lehman Brothers: Right. And you said even if it goes to 50% default rate, it's a $15 million hit?
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: After tax, yes.
Jay Gelb - Lehman Brothers: Okay. Thanks.
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I don't want to say that's inconceivable, but it seems almost inconceivable.
Jay Gelb - Lehman Brothers: Separate issue, on the effective tax rate that was lower in the first half of '08 than '07. What is the right run rate for the effective tax rate?
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: If you look at the year to date tax rate, that's based on your expectation for the year. The quarter, of course, was impacted by the Centrix loss, which was all deductible in the US.
Jay Gelb - Lehman Brothers: So around 15%?
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: More or less. That's pretty close.
Jay Gelb - Lehman Brothers: Okay. Thank. And then the final one, on M&A, Joe, we have seen a couple -- well, we have seen increased activity sector wide in mergers and acquisitions, how does Everest Re potentially plan trying to take part in that?
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer: Well, you know, we've answered this before. I think in terms of agency books, we have ongoing discussions. Those ended up being smaller deals. We have some -- some interest on the insurance side to amplify our platform. We don't have too much interest on the reinsurance side. Where stocks are trading at right now, should really reduce the number of potential deals that certainly our point of view as well. But most of our history has-- has been -- you know, we eat our own cooking and -- so we don't want to dismiss acquisitions, but it would have to be strategic. It certainly would be not for the sake of just growing top line.
Jay Gelb - Lehman Brothers: Great. Thanks very much for the answer.
Operator: And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn it back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.
Elizabeth B. Farrell - Vice President, Investor Relations: Okay. This is Beth Farrell. Again, thank you for participating. If you have any further questions, please feel free to call.
Operator: That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation, and have a great day.

Operator: Good day, everyone and welcome to this Everest Reinsurance First Quarter 2008 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Beth Farrell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Elizabeth B. Farrell - Vice President of Investor Relations: Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Everest Re's first quarter 2008 earnings conference call. With me this morning are Joe Taranto, our CEO; Tom Gallaghar, our President; and Craig Eisenacher, our CFO. Before we begin, I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard I note that statements made during today's call which are forward-looking in nature, such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations and the like are subject to various risks. As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations. Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risk that investor should consider in connection with such statements. Now let me turn the call over to Joe Taranto.
Joseph V. Taranto - Chief Executive Officer: Good morning. In first quarter the turbulence in the financial markets continued unabated. The credit markets debacle added to its victims, while concerns over the worldwide economic futures grew and the stock market dropped significantly in response. Meanwhile in our own insurance and reinsurance marketplace we continued to see market trends of reduced rates in virtually all P&C product lines and in virtually all countries. Concerns have continued to grow as to what these economic woes will pose for the insurance industry. We, at Everest are pleased to report that despite these challenges we had a 190 million in operating earnings or $3.03 per share. We modestly increased book value per share in the quarter while giving back a $130 million to shareholders through $100 million worth of stock buyback and $30 million worth of dividends. Worldwide gross premiums were down 14% as we remained disciplined underwriters and only accepted business that we have evaluated to produce an acceptable return. Last quarter we guessed that we'd be down top line 5% to 10% in 2008. Whereas the first quarter reduction was beyond that range, I believe it contained some booking anomalies and we continue to guess that future 2008 quarters will be off 5% to 10%. Premiums for our international book, our specialty book and our insurance operations were essentially level in the aggregate. Our international book continues to benefit from our ratings, reputation and relationships. Continuing to expand on our already extensive reach we plan to open a new office in Brazil to capitalize on the legal changes in that insurance marketplace and to capitalize on the economic growth expected from Brazil in the future. Our overall worldwide decline was driven by U.S reinsurance. We have reported for a number of quarters that most of all casualty classes are seeing continued rate decline at the insurance level, coupled with many ceding companies keeping more business net. Property insurance rates were also falling and competition among reinsurers has increased. Some dumb deals are now on landscape. Competition and rate reduction is higher in the U.S. than has taken place internationally. The combined ratio for the quarter was 89 and cash flow remained strong, reflecting the quality of the existing portfolio. With disciplined underwriting we look to continue to maintain the high quality of our portfolio. In summary, despite some serious drag from the financial markets we moved ahead. We expect to continue to move ahead and hope for less future head winds from the financial markets. Craig will now give the financial report.
Craig E. Eisenacher - Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, John. Good morning everybody. Operating earnings were $191 million or $3.03 per diluted share for the quarter. Net income after realized capital loses was $78 million or $1.24 per share. Our annualized operating ROE was 13.6% for the quarter, quite respectable we think given the environment. Our GAAP equity finished the quarter at $5.6 billion, lower than at year end by $51.8 million. In the quarter we repurchased $101 million of common stock and I'll talk a little bit about that in a moment, and paid $30 million in dividends, so we generated $79 million of increased equity prior to the amounts we returned to shareholders. The taxable equivalent total return on our fixed income portfolios was 1.1% compared to 2.2% for the Lehman aggregate. The total return on our public equities was a negative 9% compared to a negative 9.9% for the S&P 500. So we did a little bit in stocks and a little worse on the fixed side. Share market and mark-to-market adjustments for the portfolio as a whole resulted in a reduction to our GAAP equity of $114 million in the quarter. Not too bad we think given the adverse performance of the financial markets Since quarter end through this past Friday, our portfolios have rebounded by about $66 million basically driven by appreciation in the equity portfolio. We repurchased 1,000,052,000 shares in the quarter for an aggregate consideration of $101 million or an average price of $95.85 per share. Book value per share stood at $91.01 at quarter end compared to $90.43 at year end and that's an increase of $0.58. Overall, a reasonable performance given the competitive nature of the insurance and reinsurance markets and the rather dismal performance of the financial markets during the quarter. Our gross written premium at $878 million was lower than the last year's first quarter by 14%. The US reinsurance segment had gross rate premiums of $234 million, which was 34% lower than in the first quarter of last year, although I should note down just 3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2007. Both treaty property and treaty casualty were lower on the quarter. In the case of property we received lower quota share premiums from some of our Florida clients. This was due to increased purchases of common account covers which reduces the quota shares subject-based premium. Seasonality and lower excess of loss writings at January 1 also contributed to the decline. Casualty continues to become more competitive with lower rates, demands for higher ceding commissions and relaxed terms and ceding companies retaining more business net. As a result we continue to see less business that meets our underwriting criteria. Gross written premium for the U.S. insurance segment at $210 million was lower by just 3% compared to the first quarter of 2007. While there were many ups and downs by program, the predominant trends are increases from our new programs and decreases largely in our workers comp and contractors programs. Specialty was flat with last years first quarter at about $55 million. Marine is up a bit and aviation, where market premiums continue to look to be inadequate, in the aggregate was down. Gross written premiums for surety and A&H the other components of our specialty area were little changed from last years first quarter. International aided by the weaker US dollar was up 7.5% to $186 million for the quarter. Currency movement accounted for growth of about 6.7% but we saw slightly more new business and increased shares at January 1, particularly in the Middle East and Latin America. Asia due to timing was down slightly in the first quarter but we expect that trend to reverse as the year progresses. The Bermuda segment was down 11.5% overall to $192 million for the quarter. Business written out of Bermuda was flat with last years first quarter, while our London and European book was lower principally due to reductions in premium estimates for several large deals. We continue to expect gross written premium for 2008 as a whole will be lower by 5% to 10% than in 2007 despite the somewhat larger negative comparison during this first quarter. Our combined ratio was very strong at 89.1% for the quarter; the accident quarter loss ratio was 55.2%, exclusive of catastrophe loses which is 1.4 points higher than the last years first quarter. Catastrophe losses were light at $21 million and consisted mainly of European storm Emma, the China snow storm and the late December 2007 hail storm in Sydney. These contributed 2.3 points to the loss ratio for the quarter. So our current business continues to run fine, continuing that... recognizing that most of the quarter's earned premium was written returned last year. We experience adverse development of $26 million including catastrophes for 2.9 points in the quarter. An adverse reward by an arbitration panel involving a 2001 retrocessional cover resulted in a net loss to us for $32.6 million. Otherwise net development across the group for the quarter was slightly favorable. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $251 million compared to $162 million, reported for the year ago quarter. The growth coming most ... the growth coming mostly from reduced catastrophe pay-offs from the 2004 2005 storms in this year's first quarter relative to last year's first quarter. Cash and invested assets finished the quarter at $15 billion compared to $13.9 billion at March 31st, 2007 or up by a little over $1 billion in the past 12 months. The increase for the quarter was $60 million. We had strong cash flow over the quarter, a little north of ... operating cash flow in the quarter, little north of $250 million as I just noted. However the financial markets were uncooperative to say the least. Our publicly traded stock portfolio declined by $94 million, excuse me and our fixed income portfolio by $21 million both after tax. As well, we used $130 million for dividends and share repurchased which is why we didn't see more growth in invested assets during the quarter. Our net investment income was $150 million compared to $156 million for the first quarter of last year, that's down by $6 million or by 4%. The net income from our fixed maturity, short term and public equity portfolios grew commensurately with asset growth. However our limited partnership investments experienced a $5.1 million loss for the quarter compared to a $7.6 million gain for the first quarter 2007, and that's a negative swing of $4.7 million. Our limited partnership investments can be broadly broken into three categories. First, public equities and second project funds and third what I would call other, which includes private equity, LBO and mezzanine finance. We don't own any Quad [ph] funds. The loss for the quarter was driven by the public equity partnerships which are generally invested long in a small number of names. They have proved not to be immune to market forces and lost $15.6 million or about 9% of their value. The remainder of the partnerships had an aggregate gain of little in excess of $10 million representing a positive annualized return of 9.1%. Nevertheless in the main we are quite happy with our investment portfolios. They are well diversified and while we did not escape the first quarter woes of the broader financial markets, they held their own and then some. We ended the quarter with $5.6 billion in shareholders equity, down by $52 million from year end. More importantly book value per share grew six tenths of 1% to $91.01 during the quarter. We are very well capitalized with a strong balanced sheet; as well we remain focused on maximizing book value per share over the long term and at the same time maintaining our strong capital base and financial ratings. And now I will open it up for questions. Question And Answer
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. We will take the first question from Tom. Cholnoky from Goldman Sachs.
Thomas V. Cholnoky - Goldman Sachs & Co: Good morning, I have got three questions, if I can. Number one, just on the U.S. reinsurance business Craig you indicated, that you lost a large, I guess some sought of retro cover, of $33 million, but that would - - I guess that would account for most of the prior year strengthening, if you look back on the fourth quarter of 2007, you were releasing reserves at the rate of about $35 million a quarter, which would suggest that there was perhaps $35 million less of something else their, I was - - is there anything else going on with reserve prior year development other than this loss, this arbitration loss?
Craig E. Eisenacher - Chief Financial Officer: I mean, in terms of US reinsurance.
Thomas V. Cholnoky - Goldman Sachs & Co: Yes, yes
Craig E. Eisenacher - Chief Financial Officer: No, I think, the reserves continue to look strong, we look at our margins every quarter and things continue to look quite favorable
Thomas V. Cholnoky - Goldman Sachs & Co: Okay, so there is no other strengthening, there then?
Craig E. Eisenacher - Chief Financial Officer: No
Thomas V. Cholnoky - Goldman Sachs & Co: Okay.
Craig E. Eisenacher - Chief Financial Officer: No, U.S., the U.S. reinsurance in total was favorable ex that.
Thomas V. Cholnoky - Goldman Sachs & Co: Okay, I guess, second I just want to clarify your views on the premium outlook because Joe seemed to say one thing and you seemed to say another thing which was that gross premium's down 14% and you still and Joe said, I thought he said he still believes that future quarters will be down 5% to 10% per quarter which would imply that for the year you will be down more than the 5% to 10% in the year and yet I thought Craig you said you are still comfortable with 5% to 10% for the whole year?
Craig E. Eisenacher - Chief Financial Officer: I think we just said the same thing different ways, I think we still believe we'll down 5% to 10% for the year.
Thomas V. Cholnoky - Goldman Sachs & Co: Despite the hole that you have in the first quarter?
Craig E. Eisenacher - Chief Financial Officer: Correct.
Thomas V. Cholnoky - Goldman Sachs & Co: So, you are actually... you are more optimistic now about the future quarters than you may have been relative to the year when you provided the initial guidance.
Joseph V. Taranto - Chief Executive Officer: Well I think... I think you are splitting hairs their a little...
Thomas V. Cholnoky - Goldman Sachs & Co: Well, I maybe but I am just trying to...
Joseph V. Taranto - Chief Executive Officer: We are still faced with competitive marketplace, we still expect to be down, we are still guessing at the next nine months, we still have to write the business yet, we still have to see what Florida brings in June and July. But we are just trying to give you our sense that what you saw on the first quarter was probably not indicative of Craig used the word seasonality, I guess I used some booking anomalies but when we look back it just seems that, anyhow there is always a certain amount of lumpiness to a quarter we just thought that that the lumpiness kind off worked against the first quarter this year and probably worked in favor of the first quarter last year.
Thomas V. Cholnoky - Goldman Sachs & Co: Okay, and I just... my final question just on these public equities, can you give us some idea of how much you have invested in these public equities that resulted in these $15.6 million loss?
Craig E. Eisenacher - Chief Financial Officer: In the... in the partnerships?
Thomas V. Cholnoky - Goldman Sachs & Co: Yes.
Craig E. Eisenacher - Chief Financial Officer: We have a total of about $650 million on the balance sheet, invested in limited partnerships. The public equity portion, what I would... what I would classify as the public equity portion, of the portfolio is about 25% of that about a $150 million and then the project toward the added about a third and they are generally real estate, health care, energy, specific types of partnerships and the mezzanine and others about 40% of the total.
Thomas V. Cholnoky - Goldman Sachs & Co: Okay, great thank you.
Operator: We will now take the next question from Joshua Shanker from Citi.
Joshua Shanker - Citigroup: Hi, good morning.
Craig E. Eisenacher - Chief Financial Officer: Good morning.
Joshua Shanker - Citigroup: A few of quick questions, one is Centrix, the credit insurance that's performing adequately at this point?
Craig E. Eisenacher - Chief Financial Officer: Yes, we put up a little more reserves in the quarter. We are not... I guess our borrowers are not immune to general economic conditions. So it continues to develop a little adversely. Overall though, the insurance segment was just about flat in terms of its development. So we are nearing the end of the road on this thing and there is not much more exposure to go.
Joshua Shanker - Citigroup: Very good, second, you mentioned weakening of terms and conditions generally, your competitors have consistently been saying that despite pricing coming out, terms and conditions have been holding up pretty well. I'm wondering if you can speak to some examples what you are seeing there.
Joseph V. Taranto - Chief Executive Officer: Well, I think, people talk about terms and conditions you really need to kind of slice it into two sectors. One is what's happening at the insurance level and I do believe that there is not a tremendous change in terms and conditions. We do see some shifting in deductibles on the property side that works against insurers and in turn works against reinsurers. What we were more referring to is on the reinsurance we have entered into more debate in terms of terms and conditions then we had a couple of years ago. A lot the issues get into things like should there be disagreement and arbitration, what rights does the reinsurer have, what rights does the insurer have? There are also more and more debates about if there is changes in ratings. What does a re-insurer have to do? In any event there's certainly is a movement to weaken the terms and conditions that a reinsurer has. And we are in a position where we look to maintain the strengths that we currently have. So there's more debate on that front today than there was a couple of years ago.
Joshua Shanker - Citigroup: Okay, very good. And finally related in terms of where we are in the cycle at this point right now. If you had a handicap do you think the industry is writing at levels of underwriting profit right now as a whole and where do you see it sort on a cyclical basis. Where do we stand in the traditional cycle if you can be so reductive as to make it that easy for me?
Joseph V. Taranto - Chief Executive Officer: Well of course it is not easy, but I put us into the normal part if you will, and not either extreme. I think certainly most companies, including us, believe what we've written. We've written at terms, at rates that we believe will make a profit. You'll still see the combined ratio from us and from many others that are quite good, quite profitable combined ratios, number of things we didn't see five and six years ago. Now it's been helped by good property losses, or benign losses. But I think we are at a point where you can still get adequate margin on most of the business that you are presented with, most of your renewals certainly. More and more of the new business that we seem be to looking at people or shopping around, and its not rated quite as adequately as most of what we see in terms of our renewal base. So it's not easy, but there are certainly adequate rated business out there. So I kind of put it into that normal part of the cycle where you have to work hard to get the proper margins, but it is doable.
Joshua Shanker - Citigroup: Okay, I appreciate the candidness. Thanks you very much.
Operator: Now Jay Gelb with Lehman Brothers will take the next question.
Jay H. Gelb - Lehman Brothers: Thanks and good morning. I was hoping to touch base on the margins. Joe, the accident year loss ratio pre-cat in the first quarter of '08, was around 84% or 85%. What kind of a drag do you anticipate on that going forward based on lower pricing, reduced premium volume and what's the terms and conditions?
Joseph V. Taranto - Chief Executive Officer: We are trying to resist any drag on that. We are trying to maintain that. Whereas we did get a good cat quarter. We had some other items that went against us in the quarter, so from that point of view on balance I looked at it like it was kind of a normal overall cat quarter. Property side, I think we can still maintain the accuracy that we currently have. Casualty, you see that we're reducing because we couldn't write as much business and maintain the combined ratios that we had. The international front looks a little bit more favorable. I'll ask Tom to comment on the international front.
Thomas J. Gallagher - President and Chief Operating Officer: Well, on the international side, we see some changes in price, but nowhere near what's happened in the U.S. It's a 5% to 10% reduction across the board and most jurisdictions in the world and the overall combined ratio still seems to be very good and there's adequate not only towards the traditional losses, but also for the cat element.
Jay H. Gelb - Lehman Brothers: Okay, and separate issue. Can you touch base on the realized losses that ran through the quarter. Was that reflecting a change in accounting?
Craig E. Eisenacher - Chief Financial Officer: Well that's almost all mark-to-market. Our equity securities are fair valued, and we started doing that in the first quarter of last year. So the bulk of that is actually unrealized. Actually almost all of it is unrealized, in the old sets of unrealized.
Joseph V. Taranto - Chief Executive Officer: Yes, that's a change on our billion and half of equities and as Craig noted in the opening about $65 million of that has already come back in the effective quarter.
Jay H. Gelb - Lehman Brothers: I see okay, and then can you talk about the potential opportunity for the state of Florida and the other wind pools with the reinsurance demand at mid year?
Joseph V. Taranto - Chief Executive Officer: Well I said the insurance demand is largely equal to what it was last year there is a lot of dynamics going on in the market place from the governmental bodies and the pressure is obviously to keep the rates down not only for the primary sector but for the excess. There is some talk right now about them opening up more cat capacity so the market could fill in. It is not finalized yet. I believe we are in a very good position in that market, have been now for over two years with a well established position with a numbers of carriers there, and the overall results have continued to be quite good. The rate structures though that have been somewhat subdued in last year still have produced a very, very good combined ratio.
Jay H. Gelb - Lehman Brothers: Right, so what kind of market opportunity could that be if Citizens opens up more to the private market the cat funds some of the other Gulf wind pools?
Joseph V. Taranto - Chief Executive Officer: Well, first of all I would say that its far from clear that the legislature is going to make any changes whereby the State of Florida takes a lesser position and opens up more to the professional range, so that will be decided in the next month or so. Obviously if more is put on the table for professional reinsurers to write in the form of excess of loss, we can participate in that and clearly should Citizens decide to buy something as well from the professional market, we would have the ability to participate in that as well. Having said that, the majority of our writings and our profits have really come from participating in quota shares with few select primary insurers in the market place. We continue to have very good relations with this group. And we continue to believe that business will probably renew itself June and July and it looks somewhat same that it did in the last couple of years, but its looks very good and performed very well.
Jay H. Gelb - Lehman Brothers: Great. Thanks for the answers.
Operator: And now we will take a question from Susan Spivak of Wachovia. Go ahead.
Susan Spivak - Wachovia Capital Markets, Llc: Good morning. Joe and Craig and Tom, I was hoping you could answer a couple of questions. First, are you exploring any changes to your investment strategy in terms in trying to take advantage of some of the widening spreads? And then second, historically it just seems that you have been aggressive on the share buy back plan when your stock has been at these price levels, and so what could we expect before the end of the year? I believe last year you repurchased 4% if I'm correct. And then Joe, just an industry question. It doesn't seem as if this pressure on investment income will be enough to change pricing. So in your...in your view what do you think needs to happen? Are we still in a situation where overall results are too good, the industry is too flush in capital so we could live like this for a few more years?
Joseph V. Taranto - Chief Executive Officer: Okay, Craig will start and I will finish.
Craig E. Eisenacher - Chief Financial Officer: On the portfolio, we are not really significant in managing our portfolio strategy. We are looking for pockets of opportunities, for example in the first quarter, we bought a lot of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In this quarter we've been buying munis as the spreads have been quite wide. So we've been selectively deploying funds in pockets of opportunity as we see them now. I have got to say about as soon as a pocket of opportunities appears, it disappears because I guess there is a lot of it out there that's has significant liquidity and are looking for opportunistic places or places where we think we see opportunities for longer term gains to deploy the funds. But basically we continue to be a conservative investor. We have a lot of liquidity. We have significant short term investments. Our portfolio is higher quality, relatively short duration and I would expect to see it continue in that vein. In term of the buy backs--
Joseph V. Taranto - Chief Executive Officer: Yes, I will tend to it. But yes, just to kind of later on to the investment, as Craig noted, we don't have any major shifts, but we are happy with the overall strategy. but when munis did strike a few weeks ago and the levels at that time really had nothing [ph] seen before. I guess we did shift the $250 million into these better yielding munis Now since then we've seen them correct largely and so we're starting to probably level out in terms of the shift that we made, but we are happy with shift that we did make a few weeks ago, so we'll always be moving to take on current opportunities. Buyback, yes you are right Susan it was 4% last year, $250 million and it was another $100 million in the first quarter so, we're making a very clear statement. That's part of the mix, that's part of the strategy, and certainly stock price figures into those calculations, as well. We continue to not provide estimates and guidance in terms of we'll do into the future, just to maintain flexibility but it is pretty clear what we've been doing. Pricing, I am sorry to say that I do believe the world is pretty much as you've described it, flush with capital, still posting some very good earnings and it's not a scenario that is going to begin an uptick in pricing. Now what would do that, people are speculating and they usually some up with the big bang theory and we are not hoping for the big bang, so I am not exactly rooting for that, but in the short term and I don't know for how long you can probably expect an overall rate decline to continue.
Susan Spivak - Wachovia Capital Markets, Llc: Okay, and thank you very much for your answers.
Operator: We will now take a question from David Small of Bear Stearns.
David Small - Bear Stearns: Good morning, can we just talk about the insurance book for a second. Could you just let us know, you talked last year about the renewed programs that are now, should be fully online for Q1. How much premium did those three programs generate in the first quarter?
Joseph V. Taranto - Chief Executive Officer: In the first quarter I don't recall exactly how much they have but let me quickly go through the three programs. One is the brownstone program, the other one is Manny, and the last one is chips. As it stands right now the premium volume as Craig has indicated in the insurance side has been offset. We had some declines in some of the lines of business, contracting being one of them, and the fact that we had these new programs has really filled the gap. The one that has performed right now, the best has been the brownstone. I think we're doing in the first quarter probably $50 or $60 million there. The other two programs, Manny is a little bit behind what we projected, and chips I'm not sure exactly what the number are right now. But their expectation is that they will perform as we originally indicated and give us approximately about a $150 million of new business this year.
David Small - Bear Stearns: Okay, and then just from your guidance should we assume that there are some new programs out on the horizon that you haven't talked about?
Joseph V. Taranto - Chief Executive Officer: There is nothing that we are so close to closing on that we can put it out as a done deal. So, there are always opportunities that we are working on, but really nothing big and close to finalizing that we can report to you. But we still a lot of activity and have so since the beginning at the year. Nothing has come close to getting to where we think it is a good opportunity for us. But tremendous amount of activity in the market place right now.
David Small - Bear Stearns: And then just on the reinsurance book, given how much, I guess given how much premiums are off in the quarter, may be just help us think about for the year. How much of that book do you think would be Florida exposed by the end of the year?
Joseph V. Taranto - Chief Executive Officer: Well, I guess the Florida business is probably $400 million worth of business, call it $100 million per quarter. And at this stage of the game, I don't really see... I don't envision a big change one way or the other on that. Its yet to be done that's June, and July, but based on conversations to date, I don't see that number changing significantly one way, or the other for us.
David Small - Bear Stearns: And my last question is just in terms of Florida, do you have any appetite there to be more aggressive right in primary either on the commercial or the residential side?
Joseph V. Taranto - Chief Executive Officer: No, we've done some commercial. If you are talking about home owners business, we are not looking to get into that market. Its too much of a political game. You have to wait every year to be told by the politicians, what kind of profit you can make? What kind of rates you can charge? What you can write and what you can't? Its a very difficult way to run a business. As a reinsurer you can decide if things are wrong to get out, but as an insurer rate you kind of stuck in this state, and you are stuck with the politicians.
David Small - Bear Stearns: Hey, great. Thank you.
Operator: And Matthew Heimermann of J.P. Morgan will have the next question.
Matthew G. Heimermann - J.P. Morgan: Hi, good morning everyone. Craig, maybe opening question for you on the...it looks like you sold some equity securities in the quarter and I just was wondering if you quantify that and in building on that I was just curious whether, or not the equity portfolio was a constraint with respect to how much stock you could buy back?
Craig E. Eisenacher - Chief Financial Officer: Okay, Matt we've bought back or sold rather about $250 million of equity securities early in the first quarter. We just... and we looked at the equity markets, and its just looked like it was more downside risk than upside potential, and I do not know if that's changed a lot at this point, but it seems to be bumping along in the range at least at this point. In terms of our buy backs at some point if we were to buy back enough stock then we wind up with the a ratio of equity investments to our GAAP equity there might be a issue from a rating perspective, but given that our operating leverages is low, given where we are at this point. I think its very easily manageable.
Matthew G. Heimermann - J.P. Morgan: How far away are you from that threshold?
Craig E. Eisenacher - Chief Financial Officer: We're fine. We look at it as we probably maxed at 50% equities to GAAP equity given our operating leverage etc, but we don't really want to go there.
Matthew G. Heimermann - J.P. Morgan: Okay.
Craig E. Eisenacher - Chief Financial Officer: We are running closer to 40% at this point.
Matthew G. Heimermann - J.P. Morgan: And then on the buyback Joe, I guess you have I think 1.4 million share left on the authorization. And I'm just curious as to whether or not that gives you sufficient flexibility to do up if you really felt the stock was in an attractive price and there was nothing else going if that enough power or so to speak or the right?
Joseph V. Taranto - Chief Executive Officer: That's $150 million worth of buy back. The Board meet quarterly, the Board meets next month. If we think we need more we would chat about it and I have no doubt that we would agree on it, and just authorize more? So that's easily changed the techniques [ph] today.
Matthew G. Heimermann - J.P. Morgan: And then the last question just on lost trends in general. Have you noticed any changes with respect to loss trends recently and just as important have you made any changes with respect to how you are booking the business today versus the past?
Joseph V. Taranto - Chief Executive Officer: We haven't really, I mean there is always the spike that comes with things like the credit crunch, But if you are talking about more normal medical inflation, I guess we've seen a bit that may affect our workers comp business but nothing too severe. We have read, some analyst are seeing some uptick here and there and I've been asking our actuaries and surveying our business to make sure that if there is any uptick that we are putting it into our numbers, but really most of our business is unaffected by any severity increase at this stage.
Matthew G. Heimermann - J.P. Morgan: Okay, and then may be, you can tell me if I am reading too much into your opening comment with respect to that question where you said, with not really but for, there is obviously pressure with the equity markets. Is that a signal that you're perhaps holding IBNR, and other things longer than you might have been in the past on old business?
Craig E. Eisenacher - Chief Financial Officer: No, I think we are doing what we have always done, which is to release reserves when we get to the point where we are confident that we can do so. So I think it's always the same as it has always been.
Matthew G. Heimermann - J.P. Morgan: Okay, alright thank you.
Operator: And now moving onto Vinay Misquith with Credit Suisse.
Vinay Misquith - Credit Suisse: Hi, good morning.
Joseph V. Taranto - Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Vinay Misquith - Credit Suisse: On your Florida business, how do you think the margins of that business will be impacted if the HFCF provides less cheap reinsurance? Wouldn't they then have to go out and buy it from the private reinsurance market, thereby negatively impacting the margins there?
Joseph V. Taranto - Chief Executive Officer: Well the answer to that is probably it would in the following sense you're right that the foreigner markets provides reinsurance at costs that are way below what professional reinsurers are charging. So, if they provide at less and professional reinsurers were providing more, one would believe that the charges to the insurance companies would go up. Now having said that, in their rate making that get approved by the state their underlying insurance rates they put in what they are being costed for reinsurance. So they would now have an argument that they have to present to the state that they could ensure raise their rates, which should presumably offset that. But going back to the beginning, it has not been decided yet whether the state will change what it did last year, but if it does that's the way it should shake out.
Vinay Misquith - Credit Suisse: Fair enough. And on your exposure to D&O and E&O, do you have you update to that? Have you seen any more claims on that business?
Joseph V. Taranto - Chief Executive Officer: We constantly do a review of all the activities as respect to the subprime and we have kept the concept with our ceding companies not only directly, but also we have done on side audits, and we haven't seen much development whatsoever, but it's early times. There is a lot of discussion out there. There's still lot of activity in those markets, but at this point in time we don't see it to be a material thing for us.
Vinay Misquith - Credit Suisse: Okay, fair enough and one last question on the combine. You combined the state pretty steady over the last few quarters, no significant uptick. I'm just curious, is your business mix more towards property and less towards casualty? Is that benefiting the combines, in light of the fact that pricing is declining 10% sometimes even higher than that?
Joseph V. Taranto - Chief Executive Officer: Well there has been a trend and probably for the last couple of years, particularly in the U.S. reinsurance where we were doing more and more property and less and less casualty. So the percentage of the overall mix that is property has been steadily growing now. Now I would tell that has probably benefited the combines, because property results have been very, very good. And in part because worldwide losses have been relatively low.
Vinay Misquith - Credit Suisse: All right, thank you
Operator: And now the next question will come from Ian Gutterman with Adage Capital.
Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital: Hi, Joe. Just a couple, first that $32 million arbitration loss, was that related to the World Trade Center decision that came down in the quarter?
Joseph V. Taranto - Chief Executive Officer: No, it was something else.
Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital: Well that's okay. And then just to go a bit more into Florida, your mix I get is pretty biased towards the takeout companies and I guess from what I understand that they going to be needing to buy more... did they see that because of all these new takeouts being formed, that there is going to be a lot of demand from them for more reinsurance and I guess you guys probably haven't heard it yet but Platinum said on their call that rates might actually be up a little bit in June. I would assume they are probably referring to that takeout space. So I was just wondering if you think rates and/or margins in the takeout space will be more favorably impacted in the rest of the Florida market and if that works to your favor?
Joseph V. Taranto - Chief Executive Officer: That's unclear, I don't know... I didn't hear what Platinum said, so I don't know exactly what they are referring to. If they are referring to reinsurers rates on excess of loss of business in June, honestly I don't think that will be up versus last year. We had dinner with a client last night to discuss some excessive loss quotes for this June and they were talking 10% down as to the consensus of those quotes. So that's the story at least with regard to reinsurance. Whether or not we take out companies or will really be taking on other additional large blocks is unclear. Most of the guys we've been talking to, we really haven't been hearing much about them doing big take outs. So I don't see that affecting our book.
Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital: Okay, the fact that they can now assuming the legation goes through, can now write at higher gross premiums and therefore they need to obviously buy more reinsurance to get to the net requirements, that won't be a benefit?
Craig E. Eisenacher - Chief Financial Officer: Well, it could be a benefit based on the ratio of writing surplus you are referring to.
Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital: Right, that's what I am thinking about.
Joseph V. Taranto - Chief Executive Officer: Well it could be a benefit based on the ratio of writing surplus you are referring to.
Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital: Right that what I was thinking about.
Thomas J. Gallagher - President and Chief Operating Officer: Yes, there could be some benefit. We have a very selective group of clients we have done business with down in Florida when we made decision to go in to that market. And unless something changes we will stick with those guys and look at some of the newer opportunities but we have been pretty comfortable with the clients we have right now and some of the new things we have seen and we do so see some new ones, they haven't been as good as we have had with these other clients.
Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital: Okay, that makes sense, thanks so much.
Operator: I think we have time for one final question. That question will come from William Wilt, Morgan Stanley.
William Wilt - Morgan Stanley: Hi, good morning a couple and I will make them quick questions, the strong losses in the U.S, did they contribute to your account losses in the quarter or were they typically below the reinsurance layers?
Craig E. Eisenacher - Chief Financial Officer: No, we saw virtually nothing from U.S losses in the quarter.
William Wilt - Morgan Stanley: Okay, thanks and the arbitration ruling was Everest acting alone in that... that dispute or was Everest part of... part of a syndication that was addressing issues with Retrocession if I understood it correctly?
Craig E. Eisenacher - Chief Financial Officer: No, I had only to do with us.
William Wilt - Morgan Stanley: That's all I had, thanks very much.
Craig E. Eisenacher - Chief Financial Officer: Thank you.
Operator: With that, I will turn the call back over to your host for closing remarks.
Elizabeth B. Farrell - Vice President of Investor Relations: Thank you for participating on the call. Certainly if you have any further questions you can reach out to Craig Eisenacher or myself. Again, thank you.
Operator: Once again, that completes your conference for today. Thank you for participation. Everyone have a wonderful day

Operator: Good day everyone. Welcome to the fourth quarter 2007 earnings release call of Everest Reinsurance. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference to Ms. Beth Farrell. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Elizabeth B. Farrell - Vice President, Investor Relations: [Technical Difficulty]. ...on our business operations and current market conditions. Next Craig Eisenacher, our CFO will review the fourth quarter and year-to-date results. This will be followed by Jim Foster, Senior Vice President of Claims, who will discuss in detail the previously announced asbestos claims review; also in attendance for questions, is Tom Gallagher, our President. We will open up the call to questions following these prepared comments. I will preface these comments by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I note that statements made during today's call, which are forward-looking in nature such as statements about projections, estimate, expectations and the likes are subject to various risks. As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations. Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements. Now let me turn the call over to Joe Taranto.
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Beth. Good morning. We are pleased to report net income of 839 million for 2007. When you consider the strengthening of our asbestos reserves that's a great result, and highlights the quality of our underlying portfolio. We are pleased to our written 4.1 billion of premium, which is a modest increase over 2006. Considering the challenges posed by the market, we are happy with that achievement as well. Further, we end the year with our balance sheet extraordinarily strong. Now onto 2008; reporting on the January 1 renewals, first our international reinsurance, which represents about one-third of our worldwide book of business. Here we have seen the following. Underlying insurance rates continuing to decline modestly, perhaps 5%ish, generally less than the reductions we are seeing on U.S. business. Reinsurance terms had very little change, tax rates were modestly down in areas with no recent losses, up in areas that have losses, such as Mexico, the U.K., and Australia. Our rating experienced personnel and quality relationships continue to service well and we get to see and participate in the best business offered in the sector. In short, I expect another good year with the quality of the portfolio much the same as 2007. Next I will review our U.S. property reinsurance portfolio, which represents about one-fourth of our worldwide business. Roughly 40% of this book or 10% of our worldwide premium renewed in January. Some observations: first, commercial insurance rates continued to trend down of 10%ish. Risk with the cat elements are declining less than risks without a cat exposure. Second, reinsurance cat rates were down perhaps around 15%. Note however that pure U.S. excessive loss cat business represents a very small portion of our overall book. Third, retro cat rates were down about 10% with the better deals still offering reasonable opportunities for reinsurers. Fourth, we did see increased competition among reinsurers, including for a single state pro-rata home owner reinsurance deals. We saw some examples, where major reinsurers aggressively offered improved terms to decline to win the account. Keep in mind the substantial amount of business in this category for us is Florida business that renews mid-year. Accordingly that business will run at the existing terms to the first six months of the year. In summary on the sector, although we see some rate decline and increased competition, our book is quite unique and should remain a quality portfolio into 2008. Next I will comment on the U.S. casualty reinsurance book, which represents about 15% of our worldwide book. Here we continue to see underlying insurance rates going down. For many classes, rates are significantly off their highs of two and three years ago. We also continued to see many seeding companies keeping more business net and buying less reinsurance. Whereas we have witnessed a disciplined reinsurance market up until now, we are starting to see some done deals getting done. This segment of our book decreased in 2007, and we expect it will decrease again in 2008 as we remain disciplined and respond to market conditions. Next our insurance operation, which represents about 20% of our worldwide book; most of our business is causality, but it's a very specialized book. And many of our programs are composed of small premium accounts. This is the end of the market that's seeing the least softening. As we reported last quarter, we recently added three new accounts that will flow into 2008. I expect us to maintain our diversified specialized quality insurance book top-line and bottom line in 2008. Our specialty book of Accidents and Health, Surety, Marine, and Aviation completes our worldwide operation. I expect the Marine and Surety book to remain steady and profitable in 2008. We have reduced our aviation writing substantially as we see market rate is wholly inadequate. We do not expect significant improvement soon unless spurred by increased losses. Our A&H division is likewise down significantly from where it was a few years ago as we have responded to the weakness in the market, particularly on the medical stop loss business. We don't expect any major changes in the A&H landscape in 2008. But our writing should be stable as we have previously taken the underwriting actions necessary. When this market does improve, we will be fully prepared to grow our book. In summary, we expect to see more competition in 2008. Our ratings, people, and distribution will allow us to continue to participate in the better end of the market. Our unique portfolio will insulate us to somewhat from the market decline. We will remain disciplined and respond to the market changes appropriately. Now, I'll hand it over to Craig.
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks Joe. Our after tax net operating income for the quarter was $63 million or $1 per fully diluted share. And last year's fourth quarter, we reported after tax operating income of $201 million or $3.07 per share. As we pre-announced, we strengthened our asbestos reserves by $325 million on a gross basis. Net of reinsurance and federal income tax, the charge was $235 million or $3.72 per share. We also experienced roughly $100 million of favorable development during the quarter on our poor reserves. So our underlying operating results for the quarter were quite strong. After tax operating income prior to the asbestos reserve strengthening was $298 million, which equates to $4.72 per share. Our net income, which differs from after-tax operating income only $51 million of net after tax realized capital losses was $12 million or $0.19 per share. In last year's fourth quarter, our net income including realized capital gains and losses was $206 million or $3.15 per share. I would like to comment on the realized loss. Our realized loss is under the old definition of realized losses that is gain or loss on sales of securities plus other than temporally impairments were significant. Our equity portfolio lost approximately $59 million of market value during the quarter while our bond portfolio appreciated by about $81 million. However, because our equity portfolio is recorded as fair value changes in its market value whether actually realized or not are recorded as realized gains and losses for the P&L. Changes in bond values, on the other hand, are recorded net of tax directly to shareholders equity. So when reality changes in the market values of portfolio holdings, net it to a $23 million gain after taxes. Losses due to sales and our write down were near zero for the quarter. We don't make rules, but we are trying to explain to you exactly what happened during the quarter. Moving on to 2007 as whole, it was clearly a terrific year. We reported after tax operating income of $777 million or $12.21 per share even after significant strengthening our asbestos reserves. It should be noted that we strengthened our asbestos reserves in the second and third quarters as well. So the total strengthening for the year was $388 million. We will discuss in detail the asbestos study and charge a little later, but right now I would like to comment on the favorable development we experienced on our attritional reserves. We experienced favorable development of about $100 million for the quarter and $189 million for the year as a whole. But we have comparison; we booked $243 million of favorable development on our attritional reserves in 2006. Our reinsurance segments particularly U.S. has seen strong positive development on their reserves reflective of the favorable market trends in recent years. This is becoming increasingly evident as these reserves mature. Accepting the strengthening we did in the year for centric, the insurance segments reserves are also developing favorably. We have expanded our quarterly financial supplement and we now provide to a breakdown of incurred loss components including prior year development by segment. So for details, please refer to the supplement, which is available on our website. Our 2007 accident year results were very strong with the combined ratio of 86.4%, consistent with the accident year results for 2006. Our catastrophe losses were light in 2007 at $160 million. Our expected cat loss is based on our portfolio were 8 to 9 points for the year. So actual losses, which equated to about four loss ratio points were favorable. Our GAAP equity grew by $577 million to 5.7 billon at year-end. Our book value per share increased to $90.43 or by 15 % from $78.53 at December 31st, 2006. While growing our GAAP book value, we returned $363 million to our shareholders, a $121 million in dividends and $242 million in share repurchases. The share purchases represent 3.9% of beginning outstanding shares providing incremental growth going forward in our earnings per share and book value. In addition, we issued $400 million of subordinate debt in the second quarter at a very attractive 6.6% yield, and we used half the proceeds to call in higher coupon trust preferred. Net-net, we decreased our borrowing costs and we increased our financial flexibility. Looking at the year as a whole, our gross written premium grew a modest amount to $4.1 billion. And for the full year, our combined ratio including the assess charge was 91.6% compared to 89.7% for 2006 as a whole. Our operating return on equity was 14.6% for the 12-month period, and our net income return on equity was 15.7%. S&P removed its negative outlook from our AA minus financial strength rating. AM West reaffirmed us a plus and Moody's reaffirmed its AA3. So now, all of our ratings contain stable outlooks. For the fourth quarter, our gross written premium was $1.1 billion. Our U.S. reinsurance operations reported gross written premium of $240 million down 31% from the fourth quarter of last year. We have been taking about the softening casualty market for sometime, and we continue to see casually...we continue to see less casually business that we believe make sense to write. Property was lower in this year's fourth quarter as well; largely the result of higher seeded reinsurance costs on one large Florida property deal, and the continued run off of non-renewed accounts. U.S insurance recorded gross written premium of $278 million in the fourth quarter, up by $75 million over the fourth quarter of 2006. The growth M&As from the Brownstone program, which we have talked about in prior quarters, we assume through a reinsurance transaction, the December 31 unearned premium on this program, which added $76 million to our gross written premium for the quarter. Specialty was up 22% for the quarter to $69 million. Marine and Aviation and A&H were up to the quarter impart to the premium on two new quarter share programs. Surety was down continuing the trends we have been seeing in recent quarters. International recorded $216 million of gross written premium for the quarter that's up by 13.6% over the fourth quarter of 2006. The largest gain was in our Latin American book although Asia and Canada each showed gains as well. Stronger foreign currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar were a significant growth factor compared to last year's fourth quarter. Foreign exchange gains represented 9 million or about one-third of the $26 million increase in this segment. Other wise the positive trends for the quarter are mirroring what we have seen all this year as this segment continues to benefit from economic growth and insurance growth in many international markets. Our long-term relationships and strong ratings are an advantage in garnering new opportunities and expanding core relationships. Bermuda, including London, was up 30% to $247 million with both the Bermuda and London books growing nicely. Increased premium on several on several large London contracts as well as the impact of foreign exchange added to the growth in this segment. As well, Bermuda continued to benefit from the addition of one large contract new for 2007 and growth in its business with existing clients. The economic fall out from the sub-prime to Banco [ph] appears to be far from over, clearly has affected the market values of our stocks and bonds in a general sense. But more directly, we have largely avoided any significant impacts on our insurance and re-insurance results and our invested assets. From an underwriting standpoint, we posted an additional $13 million in losses during the third and fourth quarters of this years related to sub-prime exposures. And we have been conservative in setting and holding reserves on our treaty casualty book for the 2007 accident year in line with the sub-prime issue. Otherwise, we have not seen a significant activity, doesn't mean we want, but thus far we have not. Moving on to investment results, net investment income was $174 million for the fourth quarter of 2007 compared to $184 million for the fourth quarter of 2006; and that's down by about 5%. The largest factor in the decline is income from our limited partnership investments, which was 9 million in this year's fourth quarter compared to $27 million in last year's fourth quarter. The annualized return on limited partnership investments was 7.4% for the quarter. Clearly, the equity markets have not been attractive to play, and we anticipate the first quarter 08 limited partnership results will likely be negatively impacted by the equity markets' performance. For the full year, net investment income was $682 million compared to $629 million for 2006; that's an increase of 8%. The growth was in line with our growth in invested assets, which grew by about $1 billion or 7% over the 12-month period. We are very small investor in sub-prime structured paper. Almost all of what we own is AAA rated; and to-date we have not experienced any significant problems here. The total December 31st, 2007 book value of our securities with underlying sub-prime credits was $25.9 million and the related market value was $25.4 million. During the fourth quarter, we recorded impairments of $3.4 million, $1.5 million related to sub-prime and $1.9 million related to the housing sector. In addition to the sub-prime exposures at December 31st, 2007, we held securities backed by all day credits, which had a cost of $49.8 million and related market value of $49.2 million. The book and market values of our remaining asset backed securities at December 31st, 2007, those would be credit card balance student loans, auto loans et cetera were $269.4 million and $267.4 million respectively. All of these securities are investment grade. As far as our mortgage-backed securities are concerned to December 31st, 2007, we held agency issued residential mortgage-backed securities with the book value of $1.03 billion and a market value of $1.02 billion. We held non-agency mortgage-backed securities with the book value of $611.3 million and a corresponding market value of $606.1 million. As well our investment portfolio includes $3.6 billion of long-term municipal bond securities of which $2.6 billion are insured by monoline financial guarantors. Despite the market concerns about these guarantee companies at December 31st, 2007 our insured muni portfolio was in an unrealized gain position overall. The book value and market value at December 31st of these securities was $2.49 billion and $2.58 billion respectively, so all in the $90 million unrealized gain. As of December 25th, that is last Friday, the unrealized gain on our insured munis was $120 million. At present insure municipal bonds are trading on their underlying credit quality. The market is not according any value the insurance graph at this point, so future monoline performance would not seem to pose any threat to the insured muni market values going forward. In the aggregate, we have a very high quality investment portfolio and we always have with 85% or $12.7 billion with the portfolio invested in fixed maturities, short-term investments, and cash. Of the total, 98.3% or $12.5 billion is investment grade. The embedded yield for the port folio is 4.7% pretax and 3.9% after tax and it has a duration of 3.9 years. Rounding out our investment portfolio, at December 31st, 2007, we held approximately $1.5 billion of equity securities, which as previously mentioned carry to fair [ph] value. During the early part of January of this year, we sold $200 million of our holdings. Nevertheless, we estimate the equity portfolio lost approximately $136 million of market value between year-end and last Friday. The value of our limited partnership investments at December 31st, 2007 was $654.4 million; and the yield on these investments for 2007 was 13.5%. The returns allowed the partnership investments fluctuate depending upon the performance of the individual investments made by the partnerships as well as movements in the equity markets. As I mentioned, we expect below average returns for the first quarter of 2008. Cash flow from operations was $236 million for the fourth quarter of 2007 compared to $142 million for the fourth quarter of 2006; lower catastrophe loss payments $86 million this quarter down from $188 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 explain almost all of increase. Lastly, I would like to comment briefly on our asbestos reserve strengthening and Jim Foster will comment more fully on the work done and the conclusions drawn. As we pre-announced and disclosed in our earnings release, we strengthened our grosses asbestos reserves by $325 million in the quarter. That $325 million was split, $250 million reinsurance and $75 million insurance. After honoring [ph] reinsurance, the pretax charge for the fourth quarter was $311 million; and for the year as a whole, we incurred $388 million. An enormous amount of work supports the estimate of our ultimate liabilities. Our current department undertook an exhausted defendant-by-defendant analysis and work it through all of our reinsurance contracts. And our actuaries developed nine different methodologies to project our ultimate liabilities. We developed projects based on internal data and assessments. We extrapolated non public and publicly available data for our seeding companies, and we benchmarked ourselves against the industry. To put my summary on it, we did a thorough job, very confident and very thoughtful. We made what we think is a strong provision for ultimate losses. And we believe our reserve levels are now strong as any in the industry. To put in context, our net asbestos reserves now aggregate $763 million. The survival ratio on the reinsurance side is 13.6 years, and on the direct side 8.2 years excluding the impacts of settlements in place. For AM West, the industry aggregate for all insurers and reinsurers was 8.9 years. Domestic industry aggregate survival ratio was 8.9 years as of 12/31/06; and for reinsurers alone, it was 9.5 years. So relatively and absolutely, we believe we are in a good position at this point. I think you will be impressed to the extent quality and thoughtfulness of the work we have done here. And with that, I would like it turn over to Jim foster, our Senior Vice President of Claims, who will provide you with more detail perspective. Jim?
James H. Foster - Senior Vice President: Thank you, Craig. With that introduction, I will get right into the study and provide some color on study. In planning the study, we made two fundamental decisions early on. First features the conducted study internally rather than retain an outside consultant. That approach very utilized the expertise we have in house and we believed produced the better product. Second, we decided to study it to combine the efforts of our claim actuarial legal and financial staffs. In approaching the claim portion of the study, we focused on a number of Bellwether [ph] policyholders, who is experienced was potentially significant in themselves and which we thought would be indicative of the potential development across the entire book of business. In choosing policyholders to study, we focused on companies who felt this experience was mature enough that there was information available to study and on which we felt we could crate a reasonable estimate of their ultimate exposure. This led us to choose a couple of dozen policyholders. Among those policyholders, Everest claim experience ranges from having already paid tens of million of dollars having further little by a way of loss experience. Having searching the target policyholders, we then pull to gather all of the available information and insights concerning those policyholders, including information actually reported by our seeding companies, general market intelligence, information developed in our role as a direct insurer of many of the policyholders, and from other sources including our attorneys were appropriate. For each policy holder, we constructed an estimate of not only its ultimate liability, but also how that liability would be allocated across the insurance coverage, which is purchased. With those estimates as a starting point, I will then turn to my reinsurance claim staff, which in intimately familiar with the business that Everest wrote to our major clients. The staff took the estimated liability and allocation at the insurance level and analyzed the potential exposure to each reinsurance contract that was issued to the major insurers of that policyholder. That process involved the painstaking review of hundreds of insurance contracts...reinsurance contracts by years and layer on many of which we have never received any claims. This allowed us to create a preliminary estimate of the potential reinsurance exposure we might face when each of the subject policyholders. Then, together with our actuaries, I reviewed the preliminary estimate on each policyholder and attempted the factor into the estimate of wide variety of uncertainties and limitations inherit in this kind of study. For example, based upon the facts unique to each policyholder, our level of confidence in the initial estimates of policyholder liability and insurance allocation might well vary. In addition, we needed to take account of significant factors such as the potential application of coverage defenses at and either the insurance or reinsurance level, as well as the impact of additional reinsurance, which our seeding companies may have purchased and which would work to reduce the exposure to our reinsurance trees. This secondary level of analysis not only allowed us to refine our estimate we respected the target policyholders, it helped clarify for us some of the issues relevant to the process by which we extrapolated from the study group through remaining book of business. We also then had to assign a range of confidence to these estimates. As you can probably tell from even a fund nail sketched the process, this was a very intensive effort. As we went through the process, we became more comfortable with our initial decision to handle the study internally rather than relying on a third party. There are two main reasons for that comfort. First, we felt that accident will be critical that the analysis of the reinsurance exposure be handled by people, who not only know expenses liabilities in general, but also know our seeding companies and our book of business. Only that level of familiarity, which would never be duplicated by an outside consultant, allowed us to consider the many nuances applicable to some of these decisions. Second, if we would retain a consultant that consultant would most likely rely impart one data, which it had from other assignments and/or a proprietary model, and we might not have had access to the data or the inner workings of that kind of model. By doing the study ourselves based on the information in our hands and based on our intimate knowledge of our business, I feel that we had a much greater sensitivity not only to the projections being made, but also to the significant and often sudden uncertainties embedded in the projections. In other words, conducting the study ourselves leaves us with a much better understanding of both the strengths and potential weaknesses in the projection. Because of the inevitable uncertainties and projecting asbestos liabilities, we believe that forcing ourselves to get to this exercise yielded a much better foundation for the judgment as to how to restart our reserves. Of course the process we went through on the claim side, there was only one aspect of the study. We also had our actuarial staff working in parallel with our claim staff. Although it's well-known that asbestos liabilities do not lend themselves to analysis to customary actuarial reserving techniques, our actuaries took a very proactive approach in looking at a wide range of techniques that offered some promise of helping us analyze the potential exposure. They not only looked at this from the perspective of projecting our exposure solely on...they also looked our projection of our exposures by examining industry positions. Without going into our gained details at only an accelerated level, the methods applied to directly estimate our potential exposures in addition to the work based on the claim study included a technique using report your analysis; and that approach claims are slotted into the year, in which they are first reported a triangle of those used to developed and then carry forward reflects future years and create an estimate of potential IBNR, although the forward-looking aspect of this technique relies on judgment test of the future number and severity of claims, which might be reported. We felt that having gone to the reclaim portion of the study we are in a better position to make those judgments. The actual results looked our potential exposure based on assumption as to varying levels of survival ratios, which might be booked. In addition, using estimates of exposure prepared for prudential back in 1990s, we compared our actual paid loss development to the estimated paid development in the earlier studies to project a new ultimate based on our actual experience. Among the several techniques that were exclusively based on industry related comparisons, our team went through and exercise to look at the bulk IBNR carried by some of the major national insurance companies and calculated how that IBNR might slow through the claims that might eventually you put in adverse. Our actual results also looked at the comparison of Everest's claim aversions to avoidance across the entire industry. Further, they looked at how Everest survive ratio might look if we book the same level of adequacy as the entire industry. We respect the several techniques that were based on industry data. One important feature that we feel adds a significant element of conservatism through our approach is that we did not assume that the industry is adequately reserved. As you may know, in its recent report, AM West estimated the industry as a whole to be deficient by $2.8 billion. In making our estimate relative to the industry position, we read a number of scenarios, including scenarios assuming that the industry is currently at an adequate level, assuming the $2.8 billion deficiency assuming my AM West and assuming a deficiency of $10 billion or nearly four times that assumed by AM West. Although we do not rely exclusively on any of these techniques, in broad terms the reserves that we booked correspond to an assumption of an industry wide deficiency of $10 billion. That reference point gives us a lot of additional comfort that our figures are conservative one. Putting all the elements of this study together, we are able to provide Joe, Tom, and Craig with a variety of analytical perspectives during both by claim specific and actuarial methodologies. In light of the uncertainties surrounding asbestos in general, we obviously would have not have considered any one of these techniques to be definitive. That's why we try to provide as many perspectives as possible. The fact that techniques in which we have greater confidence generated IBNR indications that we are in the same ballparks of each other gave us greater confidence that this multi-faceted approach provided the best possible basis from making a judgment in an area that admittedly carries uncertainty. Overall, well of course we would prefer that the asbestos environment become more benign rather than less so, we faced those changes collectively. I am confident that the creativity and collaboration among the staff generated the best study possible. While we are not pleased to having to post the reserves, we are very pleased with the analytical work that underlined the decision. All these comments up until now related to our soon reinsurance business. As Craig has indicated, a portion of the charge related to our direct to our direct insurance business in Mt. McKinley. Our approach to this in McKinley necessarily differs from that on the reinsurance business. McKinley's insurance business at this point is relatively small with much of the potentials exposure concentrated in a small number accounts. Each year my staff at McKinley performance review when which we look all the policyholders from whom we have received asbestos claims. While we regularly attempt to attain information from policyholders, it can be very difficult to I think at extended period of time to get information. The focus of our annual review is to take a fresh look at the information we have been able to gather on a given policyholder and reevaluate the significance of that information. Where we have been able to get additional information either informally or encourage litigation that information can also be taken into account. In addition, the annual review attempts to refine our estimate of potential exposure to expenses as well as loss payments. For 2007, the review suggested some incremental exposure and just a couple of policy holders. That normal development plus some increment additions with respect to expenses constitute a portion of the charge on McKinley. Because of the McKinley book is fairly small, to a certain extend, McKinley's potential exposure is dependent on the most significant individual accounts. However some of these accounts present such uncertainties that is simply not possible to calculate and expect that exposure. Instead, some of the more significant accounts represent situations in which we believe that there is and should be no exposure, but where the circumstances have not yet allowed those issues to be fully litigated. As a result, the portion of the charge of McKinley is not attributed to any specific case, but reflects the decision that the uncertainties McKinley suggest the prudence of reserving in a more conservative level. In the some then, just like other companies, we have rustled with the uncertainties related to asbestos. In working over the past couple of month to push the envelope in estimating our potential IBNR exposure, we are very pleased with the study to put together and feel comfortable that the provisions we have announced places in a very strong position both in the absolute and relative to any benchmarks in the industry. With those comments, I will turn it back to Craig.
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Jim; great job. As you just heard, we have thoroughly examined our exposures and made what we believe is a strong provision for the ultimate liability. We believe we are strongly reserved both absolutely and relative to the industry and relative to our peers. This should be behind us now recognizing of course that you can never 100% assured in this area. In summary, I noted earlier a myriad of accomplishment for 2007. I do believe 2008 will be much tougher year for us both from an underwriting perspective as well as an investment prospective. Having said that, I really believe we are very well positioned with strong reserves, our conservative investment portfolio, ample capital and financial flexibility strong financial ratings, well controlled pricing and underwriting operations and a well diversified insurance and reinsurance portfolio. And while we see increasingly competitive conditions pretty much across the board, we expect our 2008 results absent catastrophes will be quite good. And with that, I would like to open it up for questions. Question And Answer
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from Tom Cholnoky with Goldman Sachs.
Thomas V. Cholnoky - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good morning. Jim, I was wondering if you could kind of repeat couple of your presentation there. I just...well, let me just ask one or two questions if I can. On the asbestos, is that fair to assume now and I just...I am probably asking the obvious, but let me just ask it anyway that given what you have done in the fourth quarter, which was obviously a very exhaustive study that the chances of you having to make any meaningful adjustments to your asbestos reserves over the next couple of years is going to be pretty minimal. Is that...I am not to put words in your mouth, but is your level of confidence pretty high that that should be something minimal outside of some extraordinary events?
James H. Foster - Senior Vice President: That's our intent, and hopefully much more than two years.
Thomas V. Cholnoky - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Let me just ask a question then if I can on the sub-prime the D&O insurance exposure. How different is the environment today for you from an underwriting perspective than it was back in the late 1990s and with the tech bubble and all the D&O claims that came out there? Why should we feel comfortable that the very minimal losses that you have thus far are not going to balloon in some fashion? Have you done anything different today versus what happened back then?
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Tom, I don't think that we can guarantee you that there won't be more to come out, but guess I would start by saying that the D&O portion of our book is really not that bigger portion of our worldwide book. And I am sure that's less than 5% of our overall premium. Plus there was such a stock market bubble as you point out at that time that affected so many stocks that had done so overvalued that I just think to my mind that was going to cause more shake out than this, which is very specific item that affects a very specific number of stocks. But let me ask Tom Gallagher to give you little bit more color as well.
Thomas J. Gallagher - President and Chief Operating Officer: Well, also the world that changes, we changed our underwriting; our claims have changed their underwriting. We cut out most of the big banks, the big financial institution that's been thanking. So, we limited our downside risk, and we also put out less limits exposed what we did right.
Thomas V. Cholnoky - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, I guess it's the only other last question I have and I will get back and if I need to, is just in terms of the capital management, Joe, obviously you didn't back...buyback much stock in the quarter. And you are going to generate if you meet anywhere close to consensus number this year, I mean somewhere between 900 and...let's call 900 million of income potentially. How should we think about that? Because you are not growing the top-line all that much, and what are you going to do with all that cash?
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well, let me...you are right for fourth quarter. Although we bought that roughly 4% of the stock during the year, which I think was percentage wise more than most we are buying back in our sector. That's something that will likely continue to do into 2008. And we will take a look at that continually and also the business opportunities. But as we have done in the past, Tom, that's not something that we are going to give guidance on. That's something that we continue to want the flexibility each quarter to say what are the business opportunities, what do we need to support our ratings and make a decision at that particular point in time.
Thomas V. Cholnoky - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Sorry, one just one last question on D&O just to wrap it up; are you...your limits exposed to D&O lower today than they were back in late 1990s.
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, they are.
Thomas V. Cholnoky - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, all right, you want to give some idea of magnitude?
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: We will have to get back to you on that, Tom. But I think some of it was just the D&O market impart raised our going down in 2005, and we started cutting back at that particular point of time, some on the basis of just rate decline.
Thomas V. Cholnoky - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, great.
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: It is down pretty significantly from a couple of years ago.
Thomas V. Cholnoky - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Next we will go to Joe Shanker with Citi.
Joshua Shanker - Citigroup: Thank you, good morning.
Unidentified Company Representative: Good morning.
Joshua Shanker - Citigroup: Looking at the...you guys have been very candid about the rate environment somewhat more than some others sayings that insurance rates down 10%, reinsurance potentially down 15%, but excluding the new program that you are writing...your writings are about flat and do you expect us to process or do you think your exposure...your actual premium should drop in the 10 to 15% range is there some loss to that for 2008?
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well, it's getting tougher. As you've kind of heard and me describing things and there will be parts of our business that we currently expect will begin I guess I will start with our U.S. casualty business, where underlying insurance rates are often people are keeping more net and just the general reinsurance competition is becoming a little bit tougher. So, we declined in 2007 over 2006. I think we were down something like 25% in that portion of our business. And we see that shrinking again by probably again a reasonable percentage in 2008. Property reinsurance in the U.S. probably be down a bit as well. And now impart it's because we have to just a stellar year in 2007. We really grew that book; some of that was Florida business some of that was retro business, some of that was other single state opportunities. We had a terrific year and we expect to do most of the deals we did in 2007 to renew in 2008, but probably not all. So that might be off a bit too. Our insurance operation, there I think we have some opportunities, so I won't predict any sort of reduction. International operation continues to go well. I won't predict any thing there and same for the specialty book. When you do put it all together though, I do think will be down in 2008 on a worldwide basis. And if I have to offer you a guess, it would be 5 to 10% remains to be seen if there is a lot of the year to go just yet. Tom, maybe you want to comment on the January renewals as to book that we renewed versus last year.
Thomas J. Gallagher - President and Chief Operating Officer: Yes, when we look at the January 1 renewals, the overall portfolio, we had about 1.7 billion for renewals, which is about 55% of our overall portfolio. When we put the tally together just this week, it looks like we did about 16...a 1.6 billion in premium, a little higher. So we are off about 5 to 6% for one month. The majority of that decrease really came out as Joe said on the treaty casualty side. Our property is up slightly in the U.S. or A&H and specialty business were about even. Internationally, we were up, but in some places, we were slightly down one thing being specifically the place. We are...we showed increased retention and much more competitive environment. All and all, it's a very good market,
Joshua Shanker - Citigroup: Okay, well. Thank you for being so frank. And one other quick question I think given where the equity markets are right now, given potential opportunities in credit markets, do you see any portfolio management strategy changes in terms of the way that you are investing your flow?
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: No, the Fed has managed to push short rates way down, so we have been a little more aggressive in trying to put some money to work. And we are working...we kind of worked that portfolio off. We are really trying to stay very short in terms of our fixed income investments. It just seems to us that there is significant interest rate risk in the market either the stimulus package works and interest rates go up, or the stimulus packages doesn't work and we have inflation and interest rates go up. And who knows what the timing of that might be. But as we put money to work, we are trying to keep it on the short end. I think I mentioned in my remarks that we pulled a couple million dollars out of the equity markets early in January and that was again reaction to a situation, where we thought that the downside risks looked...didn't look unattractive relative to the upside potential. So we are going to continue to be conservative investors, high grade, probably shortest maturities until there is more evidence in terms of where this is headed.
Joshua Shanker - Citigroup: Thank you for all the disclosure, appreciate it.
Operator: Next we will go to Jay Gelb with Lehman Brothers.
Jay H. Gelb - Lehman Brothers: Thanks and good morning. I had a couple of numbers questions for you. First, Craig, on the partnership income, is that or the other income on page 9 of the supplement, or is it part of that other income?
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: It's other investment income. It goes through the investment income line. Other income on P&L is primarily foreign exchange gain and loss.
Jay H. Gelb - Lehman Brothers: Right, right. So, on page 9 of the supplement where there is other income with a net investment income. So if the numbers didn't exactly match up, I guess maybe there is some other revenue flow coming through that. Could you give us by quarter the 2007 partnership income as you track it?
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: That is it, isn't it on page 9?
Jay H. Gelb - Lehman Brothers: Okay. Because I was looking at December 31st, 07, you said 11.7 million.
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, I don't know why that...is that...I don't know if the...I know the 29...is there anything else to go through there?
Unidentified Company Representative: Some minor items.
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, there is some other...I guess there is some other minor items, but it's almost all of it in the partnership income.
Jay H. Gelb - Lehman Brothers: Okay. So even though you are saying first quarter 08 partnership income is going to be challenged, there was 11 million in the first quarter of 07. So, are the comps going to be that difficult versus year-ago in the first quarter?
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I think it's hard to say; that income...we report that between a month and a quarter behind, depending on when the limited partnerships report to us. And a portion of our portfolio is long, short funds. More of the portfolio is what we would call infrastructure; it's healthcare, power, energy et cetera. And then there are some of the out funds as well. And it's more of the long short funds that I think are likely to have poor results. I think it's hard to comment on how we would expect it to perform against the first quarter 2007, but it's going to be weaker than it's been, I would think.
Jay H. Gelb - Lehman Brothers: Okay. So if you had 70 million or so partnership income in 07, could you venture to guess directions what that...
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Beyond the first quarter, no. I mean I have some insight into the first quarter, because it's...a lot of it's going to be based on what happened in the fourth quarter, right, because we are a quarter behind. Beyond that, it's...I really can't forecast.
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: No, I think when you look at the whole year, we are not suggesting less. And we are still very happy with a lot of the partnerships that were in. And many of them are still coming up with some very good returns. So I think Craig was just indicating a couple of them in light of what's happened in the market in the last couple of months might have some tough sliding for the first quarter; but overall for the year, no significant implications.
Jay H. Gelb - Lehman Brothers: Okay, that's good. And then the effective tax rate, what's your sense for 2008 given some of the quarterly gyrations in that number?
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I guess I would expect it to be fairly similar to this year as a whole, maybe a little lower, because we took the expenses charge in the fourth quarter and a lot of that income. That affected the tax rate for the year.
Jay H. Gelb - Lehman Brothers: So on operating income 17 to 18% range?
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Probably a reasonable guess.
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: In the neighborhood.
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, reasonable guess.
Jay H. Gelb - Lehman Brothers: Okay and then could you explain the uptick in the combined ratio in the Bermuda segment for the quarter and how that business is going?
Unidentified Company Representative: Yes, that would be the results of the asbestos charge.
Jay H. Gelb - Lehman Brothers: May... if its... if you have the numbers now but if you would have the asbestos impact by segment that would help us maybe get a better baseline on the underwriting results?
Unidentified Company Representative: Yes, it is always direct. And it is in the... it is on the segment page as well I think.
Elizabeth B. Farrell - Vice President, Investor Relations: Yes, underwriting stuff.
Jay H. Gelb - Lehman Brothers: Both on the supplements.
Unidentified Company Representative: Yes, it's right. It's in each of the segment.
Unidentified Company Representative: If you look at the segment pages and that they would start on page 5 I believe, maybe page 4. Page 4 of the settlement starts with total reinsurance and then total insurance. There is some asbestos in the environmental line and on the bottom.
Jay H. Gelb - Lehman Brothers: Got it. Alright, thanks very much.
Unidentified Company Representative: And that gives you the break down.
Unidentified Company Representative: The effects on the Bermuda operation if you look the difference with and without the asbestos will probably go from a 94 down to about 82 combined ratio.
Jay H. Gelb - Lehman Brothers: For the full year.
Unidentified Company Representative: Yes.
Jay H. Gelb - Lehman Brothers: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Susan Spivak with Wachovia.
Susan Spivak - Wachovia Securities: Good morning. I was hoping to get more of an outlook on the mid-year renewals specifically on the property side. Your comments make it sound like it will be much more challenging this June and July versus the year ago and so if you could just remind us how much of your business renews them that would be helpful? That's my first question. Then I just wanted to explore whether there was any impact on your business from the Berkshire Swiss re-transaction, were you on any programs that might be taken over? And then finally Joe could you give us an update on your outlook for M&A whether some of the use of that $900 million in generated earnings this year could be used towards some new growth opportunities?
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes Susan, on the Swiss really I don't know of any impact on us. With regards to property renewals in mid year I would guess that half of our U.S. property business, if I said U.S. property was 25% of our worldwide books and maybe half of that is in the mid year, a lot of that is our Florida business, not all of this but lot of it is. We have established some very, very good physicians with some very good clients where it tends to be the market leader on the deals that we have done. We tend to cemented the bond over the last two or three years as we have really helped these companies through a difficult reinsurance market particularly in Florida. So, I think we are in very good position but you are right we are seeing more competition and in January we saw more competition across the Board. And we did see it on some single state pro-rata deals not Florida but other states. And just did a couple of done deals there as people who are aggressively reaching to get on new business. So, we know that we will have to deal within all likelihood more competition but I think we are in very good shape. But I will have to report back to you in June and July just exactly what takes place. On the M&A front we look, we continue to look, we are finding at least on the insurance companies side and even the agency side of things kind of pricey now a days. And on the reinsurance side we have seldom found operations that we thought were complimentary. So we haven't been big clearly in the last few last few years on the M&A side but we don't exclude it. We certainly have seen a couple of interesting stories and explored them. So yes, you always like to have the financials were withdrawal to tackle that if that is something that want to tackle. Let me go through the noodling on excess capital and beside you know what should we do in terms of buy back versus what should we say for business opportunity that's certainly one of the aims we have to contemplate.
Susan Spivak - Wachovia Securities: Joe if I could just follow up again on your comments about some of the competition actually becoming undisciplined, its really you know one of the first comments we have heard about that and moving into the market and I'm just wondering is that stemming from more of the larger... the European players or is it coming from some of the new capital sources who are just struggling to get on program?
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: You know, it ends up being all of the above, Susan. I mean it should not be anything that's a surprise. Its something that comes I think with a normal market. I think it was nice to say everyone was being disciplined but it is almost unrealistic and do not expect to see some deals out there that are priced below what you really think is adequate. You take the U.S. casualty side were the pie is shrinking because more people are keeping that not mention insurance rates are going down. It stands to reason that what does come to the market might be a more fought over. So, yes, I have realized a lot of my brethren have kind of said, everyone has been disciplined. I am just trying to give you I think a more realistic view that not everyone on every deal is perfect according to us. And I am sure we are not perfect according to them sometime. But the world that we are entering is a more normal reinsurance market.
Susan Spivak - Wachovia Securities: Your calendar is definitely appreciated. Thanks Joe.
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: You're welcome.
Operator: Next we will go to David Small with Bear Stearns.
David Small - Bear, Stearns & Co.: Hi, just one clarification and a question. Just on the insured fees, could you just explain to us the impact the Brownstone program had in Q4 and then I think in the last quarter call you said you expected that to be $60 million of annualized revenue, is that still what you expect it to be or you think it is going to be larger now?
Unidentified Company Representative: I don't know if can comment, well.
Unidentified Company Representative: No, I will comment on it. We have still about $60 million, we expect on annualized basis that will flow into 2008. Craig, will take you through the fourth quarter.
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: We took on via reinsurance transaction, a portfolio transaction, the unearned premium reserve related to the Brownstone program as of December 31st. So that got booked at $76 million of gross written premium, and $76 million of unearned premium reserve. You will also notice in the balance sheet that our deferred acquisition cost ratio went up because there is higher commission ratio on that. And all that went into the unearned premium reserve.
David Small - Bear, Stearns & Co.: Okay, great.
Unidentified Company Representative: That's the primary impact.
David Small - Bear, Stearns & Co.: Okay.
Unidentified Company Representative: That business and that $76 million will earn off all of that business is not one year policies or three year policies in there as well. So you can't view the $76 million as all subject to earnings if you will or the premium being earned in 2008.
David Small - Bear, Stearns & Co.: Okay, that actually is very helpful, thank you. And then just in terms of as you look for growth in the insurance business, we've heard that competition for new MGAs is pretty intense out there. I know you guys have historically had tighter underwriting guidelines around new MGA programs than others, just can you give us some comments on what the environment is like for that?
Unidentified Company Representative: Well the environment for MGA business is no different in general than the rest of the insurance world, people looking for premium. If we are different in one respect we don't focus on getting a lot of the everyday account, we as Joe indicated, we try to pick out the specialty business and it's worked for us. Over the course of time we build up the portfolio whether be it Brownstone recently or security guards or forest tree landscaping, very specific programs that have less competition and once we do get them we lock them in for a multiple year of contract. So there isn't a lot of competition on those programs and if there were, for the whole program it will take a lot before it could change. The rates are getting pressured somewhat, but again as Joe indicated before, not as dramatically addressing the marketplace. New programs are clearly tougher to find especially those that really meet our standards, but as far as what we have going for us in this space, I really think its far more than most, certainly starts with an A+ invest rating which is very important. We call that as very good reputation in the MGA world. We tend to do deals with our agents where they are exclusive deals as Tom kind of noted, some of the people that we compete with may have multiple agents riding the same kind of business and that doesn't work as well for the agent as the deals that we tend to put together. And in the last few years we have just developed a very good back room that's very helpful to the business and to the agent. So I think we have some competitive advantages but yes there is no question that along with everything else is being more sought after
David Small - Bear, Stearns & Co.: And then just finally could you just give us a Centrix update?
Unidentified Company Representative: Yes, we added $5 million to the Centrix reserve in the quarter and it was something that we didn't necessarily have to do. The reserve that were holding or I guess what I should say is the bottom end of the range moved up such as the reserve that were holding was a little below the mid point and we talked up to the mid point of the range. The port folio continues to run off. We are quiet comfortable with where we are in terms of the reserves. There is continuing litigation over the program, over the period of years that we were on it, and we will see how it all turns out.
David Small - Bear, Stearns & Co.: And can you just maybe also help us for how much kind of the detail about how much more there is to run off?
Unidentified Company Representative: I think there is... while we are holding... I think we are holding at this point about $45 million of reserves. The portfolio of loans I think is down to 60, it's down to about $60,000 and the ageing of the loans if you will overall of course ages are quoted on average and so I would guess there is probably 24 months on average to go.
David Small - Bear, Stearns & Co.: Great, thank you.
Operator: Next we will go to Vinay Misquith from Credit Suisse.
Vinay Misquith - Credit Suisse - North America: Hi, good morning. There appears to have been a shift from... on your fixed income you released from AAA and AA to A and BBB, was that really because of rating downgrades on the secured release or did you actually put more money into the securities?
Unidentified Company Representative: Not surely because of ratings downgrades. The biggest item effecting that was Washington Mutual. We had $23 million I believe of bonds that were downgraded to BBB, $5 million of that has since matured or also matures soon. Overall if you look at the quality characteristics of the portfolio relative to the third quarter it looks like it is down a little bit but if you look at it relative to last year the quality is actually stronger.
Vinay Misquith - Credit Suisse - North America: Sure, what new securities did you buy?
Unidentified Company Representative: Excuse me.
Vinay Misquith - Credit Suisse - North America: What new securities did you buy, put the lower quality, do you think that the spreads now are sufficient that you want to get more aggressive with your portfolio?
Unidentified Company Representative: Well, we haven't, I mean we haven't aggressively gone into BBB. We have looked at some hybrids not in the fixed income securities but we participated in the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac preferreds. So we are going where we see relative value but we are not investing specifically in BBB securities. So junior securities if you will are good issuers of utilities but good names over all and as I said short maturities.
Vinay Misquith - Credit Suisse - North America: Sure and on the D&O side, is it just a 2007 year issue because these are claims made policies and if you could give me a sense of how much IBNR you have on that business?
Unidentified Company Representative: Well D&O is done on a claims made basis but that's... so there isn't any IBNR but that doesn't mean that you won't see more claims reported next year for the industry that will follow into 2008 covers.
Unidentified Company Representative: Vinay, I think as I mentioned in my remarks well that as we looked at where we reserved the cash that we booked this year we thought we had some room in there, we opted not to take that down even if it is a question against what might be coming.
Vinay Misquith - Credit Suisse - North America: Alright, thank you.
Operator: Next we will go to Matthew Heimermann from JP Morgan.
Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan: Hi, good morning. Not much left, but I thought Jim when... with respect to the reserve charge on the reinsurance side, I guess simplistically when I think about, what changes overtime and why estimates maybe higher or low, one is kind of the adequacy of the Cedant [ph]; two kind of claims and process claims that Cedant [ph] knows about, but there is a reporting lag; and then three just be the actual process for us. So with respect to the reinsurance increase there, could you maybe allocate by those three categories that $250 million if that's possible just to give a sense of how much is attributable to each?
Unidentified Company Representative: No, I don't think we could sub divide it like that now. I think what we can say is that the decision to do this study was stimulated primarily, almost exclusively by external events that we were seeing in the market so to speak. In the sense that, through late 2006, end of 2007 we began to see changes in how claims were getting reported to us that suggested a difference in what... from what we had seen earlier. And that really suggested us that we needed to take a new look and a different kind of look. So frankly we don't know exactly why some of our companies were reporting to us differently. It maybe that they were taking some of their bulk IBNR and flowing it through and then reporting it to us and maybe that they were selling cases themselves more readily. It maybe that they were simply reporting to us something they totaled earlier but didn't tell us about earlier. We don't really know why but most of the issues are all in essence external stimuli that we were seeing that told us we have to do something.
Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan: Fair enough. Just one clarification on the insurance segment. Joe, you are talking about flat year-over-year, that's flat including the assumption of the Brownstone program in 08, because originally I was thinking not hit 08, not offset what otherwise might be some decreases in the rest of the box, I am just trying to get a sense if it is flat, including the impact of the assumption in 07 or flat ex that?
Unidentified Company Representative: Well it's very hard for me in January to be precise about the whole year. So flat kind of conveys you what our thinking was. And if it includes at least in my mind the portfolio into 2007, so us competing with that in 2008. But we maybe up a bit, we certainly hope to be, we certainly will look to do that as much of the year left. We have got some new programs that we are working on. We have some other ideas that we are working on. In some ways we have more opportunities on the insurance side where we are still a small player and in the U.S. much less the worldwide insurance schemes. Where as on reinsurance side we really are an established matured player. But, yes, I guess I was generally thinking we will be able to match 2007 including the portfolio. Is that enough.
Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan: Alright, appreciate it.
Unidentified Company Representative: Thank you.
Operator: Next, we will go to William Wilt from Morgan Stanley.
William Wilt - Morgan Stanley: Hi, thanks a lot, I will keep it quick given the time here. On the U.S. insurance, your extra detail in the supplement is great, the attritional looks like very modest adverse loss development in the prior years. Again U.S. insurance calendar year 07. Question really is the California workers comp reserves if I am remembering 02 to 04 for the years that are at the height of your involvement in the California workers comp environment call a commentary on how those reserves have developed as part of U.S. insurance?
Unidentified Company Representative: Yes, they continue to look very, very good. We have actually released a little bit over the course of the year. I can tell you when we reviewed it at December 31, they continued to look strong. Now obviously we have released a good bit over the years so you can expect it to continue to be released and we have run out of reserves.
William Wilt - Morgan Stanley: Sure, do you have a sense for about how much remains at this point or...
Unidentified Company Representative: If I had a sense of that I would have booked it.
William Wilt - Morgan Stanley: No, how much as of year end, do you want to answer that?
Unidentified Company Representative: Our total reserves, off the top of my head I don't think I do know.
William Wilt - Morgan Stanley: Alright, I will follow up.
Unidentified Company Representative: Okay, I will follow up with you on that.
Operator: Next we will go to Mark Serafin [ph] from Citadel.
Unidentified Analyst: Good morning, thanks for taking my question. Just the numbers question here, so with the new disclosures if I add up other underwriting expenses on all the segments that come up to about $47.3 million in the quarter and then if I compare that to what you guys reported on the income statement of $38.7 million I get about a $8.6 million benefit in the quarter, what was driving that and when I look back at prior quarters this number has been averaging at about negative 7.5 in last quarter. It was negative 8.4 so that's about $17 million year-over-year swing?
Unidentified Company Representative: I'm not sure I understand the question.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Are there underwriting expenses in all the segments you provide data on now.
Unidentified Company Representative: Right.
Unidentified Analyst: So if I add up that by segment I get $47.3 million in other underwriting expenses. When I look what's reported on the income statement other underwriting expenses is that $38.7 million. So somewhere there is an $8.6 million benefit in the quarter other corporate, I'm not really sure where that comes from, and if I do this math going back to 4Q 06 and 4Q 06 that was an $8.5 million expense and the average has been about $7.5 million of expense over last four quarters. So the swing is somewhere around $17 million year-over-year, I'm just trying to get as sense for what that was from? And then what type of tax rate I could apply to that expense or benefit would be helpful as well?
Unidentified Company Representative: You know, off the top of my head... I am sorry, I can't answer that question for you. Let me take a look at it and I'll get back to you. Can I do that?
Unidentified Analyst: Sure. Its corporate expenses somewhere but I mean it's a $17 million year-over-year swings that was corporate income from somewhere and what type of tax rate would apply would be helpful?
Unidentified Company Representative: Okay. Let me take that offline and I'll get back to you.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you.
Unidentified Company Representative: Okay.
Operator: And our final question will be a follow up question from Tom Cholnoky with Goldman Sachs.
Thomas V. Cholnoky - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. I guess I'm at both ends of the sandwich. But just to take you back on the D&O for a second, can you give us some idea Joe, I guess two questions one is just in terms of the types of programs you are attaching on. The primary guys have been also a lot more stringent, in another words they are applying... are they writing just side A, coverage or you are also covering side A, B and C that's first question? And then the second question I guess is, so far and I know we are still early in the reporting season but everybody seems to deny that they've got huge exposures to D&O and if it turns out that you are correct and others are correct who has all this exposure?
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well, I think it's first of all unclear just how much D&O exposure there will be to begin with. I do believe it is true at least with regard to the big banks what you've been hearing from some others which is if there is a claim it will be mainly self insurance. The bank will pay for it themselves probably because they just brought side A. Having said that, this exposure goes beyond the big banks, it goes to insurance companies, it goes to smaller banks, seems to be reaching overseas and clearly some of those companies may have D&O that gets hit, that they didn't self insure. So that becomes less clear. And there may be some E&L claims as well. Clearly that gets, so we do expect some losses to come to the marketplace. But I know you've heard from some of the major riders of D&O and we are really fighter [ph] compared to those guys and with regard to this issue. We really had bracketed down as I said it is less than 5% of our worldwide work. We really have a couple of major accounts for the last couple of years and so we've had a good dialogue with them and their feeling is that it's not a big deal for them. So if that's the case it won't be big deal for us. But having said all of that Tom, you know the story, nobody can tell you exactly what's going to shake out of this in the next year or two. So there is an element of let's wait and see. But at this stage of the game, given what we have put up in specific reserves, what we have in kind of unspecific reserves, we feel like its going to be fine.
Thomas V. Cholnoky - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, well just had to ask the question.
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I understand that.
Thomas V. Cholnoky - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Alright. Thank you.
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: We will all sign off. We will thank you for joining us on the call. Realize this is a little bit longer than usual. But it seems to be unusual time, with some unusual things to talk about. But thank you for joining us.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's teleconference. We appreciate your participation. Everyone have great day.

Operator: Please stand by. We are about to begin. Good day everyone. Welcome to the third quarter 2007 Earnings release Call of Everest Reinsurance. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference to Miss. Beth Farrell, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Elizabeth B. Farrell - Vice President, Investor Relations.: Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Everest Re's third quarter 2007 earnings conference call. With me this morning are Joe Taranto, our CEO; Tom Gallagher, our President; and Craig Eisenacher, our CFO. Before I turn the call over to Craig for a review of the numbers, I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I note that statements made during today's call, which are forward-looking in nature such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations and the likes are subject to various risks. As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations. Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements. Now let me turn the call over to Craig Eisenacher.
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thank you Beth and good morning everybody. First I would like to summarize our financial results and then our comment on our investments balance sheet and capital management activities. After that I will turn the call over to Joe for his comments on the market and our underwriting activities and lastly Joe, Tom and I will take questions. We had a perfect quarter and in fact a terrific nine months. For the third quarter, our net operating income was $232 million, just slightly lower than the $240 million we earned in the third quarter of '06. Our net operating income for fully diluted share was $3.68 for both periods; but 3% fewer shares upstanding in this year's third quarter. Net income including net after-tax realized gains was $247 million, about equal to $246 million we reported for the third quarter last year. Our net income for fully diluted share was up 4% to $3.90, due to the fewer shares outstanding. Our annualized operating return on average equity was solid at 17% for the quarter and 18% year-to-date. The annualized net income returns on average equity were also strong, 18% for the quarter and 21% year-to-date. For the nine months net after-tax operating income was $714 million, up by 16% from $617 million for the first nine months of last year. After-tax realized capital gains year-to-date were $113 million, almost all of which derived from our common stock portfolio. Net income including after-tax realized gains was $827 million for the first nine months of this year compared to $634 million for last year's first nine months, and that's an increase of 30%. Gross written premiums were $1 billion for the quarter and that's up 3% from the same quarter of last year. Our year-to-date gross written premium at more than $3 billion is essentially flat compared to last year. Looking at the segment's gross written premium for U.S. reinsurance at $327 million was down 2% for the quarter. It was nicely up for the property side due to several new quota shares. On the other hand both treaty casualty and facultative were lower again this quarter, and that's due largely to our reaction to the more competitive market conditions. U.S. insurance reported gross written premium of $228 million, down 9% compared to the third quarter of 2006. We saw some growth from our newer programs, but otherwise premiums were lower, particularly for workers' compensation, contractors and the Florida property books. International was up 15% for the quarter to $214million. Foreign currency movements provided about 3 points of this growth. All though the weaker dollar aided the comparisons somewhat, we experienced strong fundamental growth in Asia where economies are growing and demand is strong. We also saw growth in Canada, while Latin America was relatively flat this quarter. And Europe $235 million of gross premium and was up a strong 16% from the third quarter 2006. As with international, the weaker dollar contributed to the favorable comparisons and that is about 3% or three points rather on the quarter. As well, earlier in the year, we wrote some worldwide casualty business for U.S.-based clients, out of Bermuda and this too has contributed to the growth. The specialty segment gross written premium at $71 million was down $7 million compared to the third quarter of 2006. And this was largely due to lower surety writings as we responded to the softer markets conditions. Our combined ratios for the quarter and nine months were excellent. For the quarter our combined ratio was 86.6% and this compares to 83.1% for the third quarter of last year. Year-to-date our combined ratio is 86% and this is 2.6 points lower than during the first nine months of 2006. Looking a little below the surface, for the quarter we experienced the calendar and accident year loss ratio of 58.5% and this includes 3 percentage points of catastrophe losses; so a like quarter for catastrophe losses. This equates to... the catastrophe losses equate to $30 million for the quarter and the largest losses were the July London floods, hurricane Dean and the Peru earthquake, which we had estimated at $37 million in the aggregate. This was partially offset by a $9 million $ reduction for the June London floods and the New South Wales storms, both second quarter events. Catastrophe loss estimation as you know soon after any event is difficult. And both London and New South Wales events are proving to be a bit less severe than we had originally estimated. Overall our reserve development was negatively unfavorable for the quarter both in dollar and percentage terms. Our asbestos reserves developed upwards by $38 million which was almost completely offset by favorable development coming from the remainder of our reserves. Our earnings release noted that we are going to more fully review our asbestos reserves as part of the year and reserve review process. We have noted before there our exposure is small relative to many of our peers because of the shorter window during which we wrote contracts covering expenses liabilities. And our earnings supplement which is posted on our website contains details of incurred and paid losses, and gross and net reserves for our direct to our acting reinsurance asbestos exposures. The $38 million of the asbestos development we saw this quarter came from the reinsurance segment and that's where our focus is. Our current reserves are $321 million for the reinsurance book and this represents a survival ratio of eight years. Admittedly that's a rudimentary measure but its one that's widely used in our industry. We've seen increased activity in this book with new incurred losses of $75 million over the past twelve months. This is an uptick to be sure, although nothing too severe. Nevertheless, we believe it's only proper to give these reserves a thorough new look. We'll look at the direct reserves as well, as part of this process, but other than the remaining seven high profile cases we are not seeing much activity on the direct side. I'd like note that my previous comments here are intended to provide some context but clearly, until the study is finished, we can't comment on a likely outcome. Cash flow from operations was $356 million for the quarter, up from $181 million for the third quarter of 2006. The main driver of the increase was lower paid losses. $126 million lower in the third quarter of this year compared to the third quarter last year. Our cash in invested assets were $14.9 billion, up $932 million from year end and by $1.3 billion from September 30, 2006. Since year end, we've generated $619 million of cash flow from operations and we've raised $400 million from the issuance of new subordinated debt. Over the same period, we've returned $331 million to shareholders in the form of repurchases and shareholder dividends. Net investment income $173 million for the quarter, that's an increase of $25 million or 17% from the third quarter of 2006. We had 8% greater average invested assets, which drove much of this change. The pretax yield on the fixed income portion of the portfolio was 4.7% up from 4.6% in the third quarter of '06 and that added a bit to the growth as well. Other invested assets which represents our limited partnership investments, earned $17 million in the quarter and that's an increase of $9 million from the same quarter a year ago. The annualized yield on the $600 million asset class was 13% for the quarter and this is a little bit higher than our long-term expectation. The quality of our fixed increase portfolio remains very high, a AA2 on average, and the duration is short, at 3.7 years. Despite the securities market turmoil during the quarter, when all is said and done, our bond appreciated by almost a $100 million and our equity portfolio appreciated by $27 million. Although we don't normally comment on other income, there was a significant increase in the quarter. It was $16 million this quarter compared to $6 million in the year-ago quarter. This growth is primarily due to foreign exchange as we benefited from net loan positions in foreign assets as the dollar weakened against other currencies. You will note that our tax rate is 20.8% for the quarter and this is about 3 points above the rate for the first six months. This largely emanates from our tax treatment of foreign exchange which has been challenged by the IRS. They'd accepted our treatment in the past and consequently, we believe we have a strong chance of prevailing on this issue. Nevertheless, GAAP reported requirements, specifically FIN 48 mandate that we provide for the potential additional tax and we have done this in the quarter. All other things being equal, we expect our tax rate to fall back to the 17% to 18% range for the fourth quarter. Looking at our liabilities; our gross loss reserves were $8.8 billion at September 30, and this is down by $29 million from year end. We've paid out $345 million so far this year, on prior year catastrophe losses, which has mainly been offset... mostly been offset by reserve additions for current year business. As noted on our last conference call, we issued $400 million of at 6.6% long-term notes during 2,067. Given the wider credit spreads recently, we feel really good about the timing on this. And previously, we talked about calling the $210 million of 785% trust preferred securities on November 15th, and we've now notified the trustee of your intent to do that. So you see debt outstanding at year end. Our balance sheet remains conservative for the debt-to-capitalization ratio of 20% as of September 30. This will call for 70% when we redeem the $210 million of trust preferred. We have $5.6 billion of equity compared to about $4 billion of annualized writings and this is conservative as well. Our book value per shares stood at $89.33 on September 30 and this is up by 40% from year end. We purchased $40 million of our shares during the quarter at an average price of $96.72. Originally we did not intend to purchase shares in the quarter since we were still in hurricane season. However, we decided to take advantage of the buying opportunity provided by the market volatility that we saw during the quarter. In summary, our balance sheet is the strongest as it's ever been, and we remain very conservatively leveraged. As well, we can focus on capital management and maximizing shareholder value. That concludes my prepared remarks and now I'll turn it over to Joe.
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks Craig. We are most pleased to have earned a net income of $827 million for an annualized ROE of 21% through nine months. We are also pleased that our worldwide gross premiums are essentially leveled with last year through nine months. Given the changes in the market that is quite a strong result. Commenting on the market, I will begin with our insurance operation. Recently, we announced that Daryl Bradley had been promoted to President of Everest National. Daryl has been with Everest National for 12 years and has been key to the success of the operation. I am confident that under Daryl's management, the building process will continue and our success will be taken to a new level. Through nine months, Everest National represents about 20% of our worldwide book of business. We are seeing intensified competition in our municipality business and contractual liability business which has affected production on the CV Starr book. We also continue to seek increased competition in workers' comp both in California and elsewhere on our New York contractual liability business and on medical malpractice. As a result, through nine months the overall book is down 8%. Despite the market trends, I am optimistic about growth for 2008 in this unit. We have recently agreed to three new programs that will have roughly $100 million of premium, next year. This book removed a niche highly specialized book of business that I expect will continue to produce quality results going forward. I will move on to our international property and casualty reinsurance book. This sector remains roughly one-third of our worldwide book of business. It includes the UK, Continental Europe, Latin America, Asia and Canada. Generally insurance rates in this area have continued to decline modestly, and reinsurance terms have also weakened modestly. However we continue to believe a reasonable return can be achieved on the better business. Through nine months our international premiums have increased 7%. The fact that we are a large established player with great long-term relationships, terrific ratings and highly regarded employees around the world, continues to be a great advantage for us and continues to help us combat the market decline. Catastrophe losses in this area for 2007 include flood losses in the UK and Australia, the earthquake in Peru and Hurricane Dean hitting the Caribbean and Mexico. Whereas these losses may mitigate some of the decline on property business, we do not expect they will produce material upward market corrections. I'll move on to the U.S. property reinsurance sector, which represents about 25% of our business through nine months. This business has shown excellent growth through nine months and has offset declines in our US casualty reinsurance operation. Much of our growth continues to come from lead positions that we have established on single-state pro rata deals, with the majority from Florida. As I reported on our last call, in June and July we successfully renewed most of our 2006 deals, and in fact have modestly expanded this part of our business. In Florida we're continuing to find that our clients do not have to adopt inappropriate rate decreases that represent more savings than they will receive from the larger participation from the Florida hurricane catastrophe fund. We also continue to find that insurance extended [ph] to write the business that our clients don't want and has not meaningfully invaded their portfolios. Our casualty and reinsurance book represents about 16% of our book through nine months. This sector is down most for us as we continue to experience casualty insurance rates declining, ceding companies keeping more net and ceding companies looking for more favorable terms on their reinsurance rates. Again, we will continue to maintain discipline and only write business that meets our standards. Our specialty book represents about 6% of our writings and includes marine & aviation security, and accidents & health business. We continue to see these markets much the same in 2007 as in 2006 and we expect to have leveled premium writing. In summary, we have used our broad distribution system, our extensive product array and our leadership position in the market to crack the unique and profitable, both in the US property reinsurance, US casualty reinsurance and on our international business. We have used our seasoned team, market reputation and terrific ratings to secure the better part of what the market has to offer. We also continue to build our highly specialized and profitable insurance operation. While doing this, we have maintained the most cost effective expense ratio in the business. I am extremely pleased about the overall quality of our portfolio and it is showing itself in the quality of earnings. Now Craig, Tom and I will take your questions. Question And Answer
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And we will go to Tom Cholnoky with Goldman Sachs.
Thomas V. Cholnoky - Goldman Sachs: Hi. Good morning everyone. I have three questions, if I can. I know you didn't want get too much into the asbestos study, but if could give me... give us a little bit of background as to what changed, because it seems to me and having listened to other primary companies, asbestos seems to be relatively stable from a primary side; and yet you seem to indicate that there may be some trends that are somewhat troubling. And in part two of that question, so I guess it's a two-part question, you've kind of historically adopted a bit of a pay as you go approaching. Would this suggest that you may change the way that you look at asbestos?
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Okay Tom. Yes. What we're doing here is we are responding to the uptick that we're seeing in reported losses and principally what we are looking at is the reinsurance book. So there's a lag between what the primary companies see and when the reported losses get to us, and as a consequence to that, we're continuing to see leakage. We feel that we need to do a study and potentially post additional reserves to represent what we're seeing...representative of what we're seeing so....
Thomas V. Cholnoky - Goldman Sachs: Will this be an outside study?
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: We're, not at this point planning on using outside consultants, although this may change. We really think that our own people, our trained professionals, our actuaries, underwriters, auditors, etcetera are really well qualified to do this. You know and as I said, it's in response to an uptick that we're seeing, not necessarily a big change in direction.
Thomas V. Cholnoky - Goldman Sachs: Okay. And then my second question revolves around capital management. I mean clearly given the kind of earnings that you are generating, even if your premium writings are relatively flat in a normal Cat year, you are going to be generating a tremendous amount of operating income in 2007. Would it be wrong to assume that you wouldn't become more active in capital management if you can't deploy that capital?
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I would say it would not be wrong and we certainly don't expect looking at our expenses reserves to have a significant impact on our capital management activities. Yes we are generating very strong earnings. I think we signaled earlier in the year that we really didn't plan to be active in the third quarter in the market, just because we are in the midst of the U.S. hurricane season and we, I think indicated we wanted to husband our capital through that. So as of this point in time, yes. We are probably in the best financial condition we have ever been in. Our capital position is real strong and so we can continue those activities.
Thomas V. Cholnoky - Goldman Sachs: Okay. And sorry, my last question. Just these wildfires in California; should we be concerned from your perspective on how everything is unfolding?
Thomas J. Gallagher - President and Chief Operating Officer: At this point... I am Tom Gallagher. The events here in progress right now, I don't have much information right now but based on our portfolio, I don't see it to be material event to us.
Thomas V. Cholnoky - Goldman Sachs: Okay, terrific. Thank you very much.
Operator: We'll go next to Josh Shanker with Citi.
Joshua Shanker - Citigroup: Thank you. Just following up on the investors; in the past few quarters not looking at the study, but when you closed a case, is there any pattern about how much of a premium it cost you compared to what you set up on the reserve to close that case? And given the two cases you closed this quarter, how much more than you had set up did you have to settle that for?
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I would say no, there hasn't been a pattern. I think... I know on one of the cases we settled for a tab less than we add up for. Does somebody know...?
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes. But again the cases we're talking about in this quarter are on the reinsurance book. So be clear: these aren't the cases that we are settling. These are cases that our reinsurance ceiling companies are settling and I guess what we're saying especially with regard to this quarter is we've got some surprises from our ceiling companies that ended up posting reserves or settling cases beyond what we were led to believe by audits and back and forth with those companies previously.
Joshua Shanker - Citigroup: Well in terms of... I'm talking about the open claims to clients by two cases this quarter?
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, you're talking about the insurance side now. There was little activity on that this quarter. Yes, you're right. That's down to just a small number of cases on the direct side, but the reserves for this quarter primarily emanated from our reinsurance book.
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes. And I think if you look at the direct reserves, there wasn't any change or incurred loss for the quarter. So that would signal between case reserve, additional case reserve, and IBNR, we settled that at what we expected to in the aggregate.
Joshua Shanker - Citigroup: Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Susan Spivak with Wachovia.
SusanSpivak - Wachovia Securities: Good morning. Joe, I was hoping you could go into some more detail about the competitive environment and what it means, having Munich making acquisition and say that they are really looking for profitable growth potential within the U.S., and how you think that will impact the competitive environment in U.S. going forward?
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well I'm not so sure exactly what Munich will bring to bear going forward. But looking at the marketplace today, it's a mixed bag. We certainly are seeing more competition in the U.S. casualty business and that's most impacting insurance rates. I would say reinsures have been pretty disciplined about resisting some of the changes that have taken place in avoiding business. And within the U.S. casualty world most of the competition we're seeing is on tougher business, big premium items, like medical malpractice, like huge products liability cases, time track to liability and that's the part of our insurance book I think that's been most impacted. Now a big part of our insurance book is really small premium items and highly specialized niche business like landscaper liability and security guard liability, and that is much less impacted at this stage, and I think will be much less impacted going forward. Property cap rates have held pretty well. We'll see what happens this January. Property insurance rates are off a bit, but again if it's cap business, they are not bad. International rates are up modestly but we still kind of like in the main where they are especially the better end of the business. So clearly, we're seeing more competition and that's to be expected after two wonderful years, and really a benign loss activity, but still the better end of the market which we can access, given our ratings and distribution and people, we're still pretty pleased about. And if you know, we are willing to change the pro rata deals that we've done on the property side, especially in Florida something that we are happy about. The retro business that we did in last couple of years is something that we've been very pleased about. We're still the market leader on the casualty side. So we can get the best end of the business. And on the insurance side, we are looking at the smaller premium highly specialized business. So more competition and frankly there will be more to come, going forward, from Munich and from everyone else. But given a snapshot as to where things are at, and the part of the market that we can, we are pleased.
SusanSpivak - Wachovia Securities: Thanks Joe, that's helpful.
Operator: And we'll go next to Vinay Misquith with Credit Suisse.
Vinay Misquith - Credit Suisse, North America: Hi good morning. Could you provide us with some color on the mid-teens growth in the Bermuda and the International segment, and how pricing is outside the U.S. versus the U.S.?
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Pricing on international business versus U.S. business?
Vinay Misquith - Credit Suisse, North America: Yes, correct.
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: You want to talk a little about...
Thomas J. Gallagher - President and Chief Operating Officer: Yes, sure. The International business, our portfolio internationally is predominantly a property portfolio. And though the rates have seen some decline as Joe indicated, it has held pretty well worldwide. Some places as Joe indicated also that we have CapEx at least so that should make it stay. It is quite different than that in the U.S. which the U.S. market had dramatic increases for a couple of years, both on the property cap side or the Cat exposed business as well as the casualty, and have more room to shrink which have had shrunk particularly on the casualty side. But overall I think, the international portfolio is in a much better position today and the rate of decline, I will give you an example just take cat rates. Internationally cat rates are probably down about 6%, wherein the U.S, it's down 9% or 10% as an example, because of the increase for some rates over the last few years. It gives you some idea?
Vinay Misquith - Credit Suisse, North America: Sure. And your growth in those areas has been a function of your strong ratings?
Thomas J. Gallagher - President and Chief Operating Officer: Well I think the growth in the international areas been a combination of not only the strong ratings but the fact that we're located in most regions of the world where local staff has given us good insights into local market. By doing so we're able to have good contacts with our client base thereby being able to knowingly increase the shares of the programs we have today, will increase our new program activity.
Vinay Misquith - Credit Suisse, North America: Okay, that's great. The second question was on your accident margin statement really strong this year and better than last year in part because you've moved more towards property business and more Florida pro rata business. How do you look at your business mix going forward next year? Do you see there more property and less casualty business next year and the offset to that being lower pricing, because we've had a pretty benign hurricane season this year.
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Its little hard to tell going for you're correct that if you went back a year two ago we probably on a world wide basis would be would have been 55% casualty and 45% property, and if you took a look at us in 2007, its probably flipped around where we were 55% property and 45% casualty, as we have seen more opportunities in the U.S. property side and less opportunities in the U.S. casualty. Given the market dynamic, I would believe that our reinsurance operation with probably casualty operation would probably be down again next year. As I said we're finding more competition there in terms of lower insurance rates and usually the reinsurance sides supports the bigger, tougher risks that ceding companies have and again those at the large premium risk, those are the ones that are seeing the most rate decline. So we will be disciplined there. Likely that will lead to less volume in the U.S. casualty reinsurance. Property reinsurance, it's unclear. We are very pleased with the portfolio. We hope we can maintain it into 2008. Lot of business renewed in the middle of the year. So that means that it goes for the six months in 2008. If I had to get into guessing, it may be leveled. As far as the insurance operation in the U.S, which is mainly casualty business, I still believe that we can grow there. So when you start putting all of that together, I'm not sure the mix of 45:55 would change substantially going into 2008. But as always, we will grow where the opportunities are, where the rates allow U.S. and we will move away from the areas that we can no longer achieve the ROEs that we need to achieve.
Vinay Misquith - Credit Suisse, North America: Thank you.
Operator: We will go next to Matthew Heimermann with JP Morgan.
Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan: Good morning everyone.
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Good morning.
Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan: Craig, quick question and Joe may be you could have a point on this as well but, when you think about the reserve study that's undergoing right now; from an outsider's perspective, is it fair to think of I mean your direct operation has... you are in there, you are in the weeds, you have a better sense of the right reserve number is, the consequences, the survival ratio is pretty low? But, as you're looking at your reinsurance reserves, as an outsider is that is fair for us to look at some of the bigger primary companies in the states and their survival ratios are indicative of where you think you might need to get going forward?
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: That's not... it may or may not be indicative, I think is the best think for me to say. I think you can look at that and think of it as you will. We're unique situation having been in a fairly near window and as I said we're just, we are responding what we're seeing and where we come out on the continuum of survival ratio's is I think where we come out as a result of the study.
Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan: Is it fair to say though given that this seems to be a new reported trend kind of looking at three years lagging page probably under states?
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: We're not under states where the ratio needs to be. I don't think I draw that conclusion. We're not fond of [ph] for me to really apply on that but I think it's risky to draw that conclusion.
Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan: Okay, and I guess the last thing was you said you're going to do this internally. Is there a parallel we can make with asbestos vis-‡-vis Eccentric where that was an internal review but the last time you looked at it, I guess what I'd say as you took a much more conservative view of ultimately where the trends are going to converge to and the consequence was a much higher reserve than you would have taken even using your internal metrics relative to the past. Is there a parallel we can draw with this?
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I'd say not I mean the situation with Eccentric is we were attempting to develop an ultimate loss with faulty and incomplete data, and as a consequence we missed it the first time through. I think we're in very good shape with that at this point. So when we had enough information we were able to analyze it carefully. I think we came to a really good place. This is different than that. I mean we've had these liabilities in these ceding companies for years and years. We know our book of business. We know the ceding companies and know what we've seen as Joe indicated is an increase in reported losses and so we need to respond to that. So I would say no that's not a parallel.
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I'm saying the only thing you would take away is once surprised by Eccentrics, we went in and really brought to their older resources in the organization to look at it as fairly from as many different angles as we could and yes you are correct that we've been posted additional reserves and those reserves have looked and continued to look quite solid which is why you've heard no more mention with regard to Eccentrics. So similarly here we got some reports from outsiders that we had to bump up the reserves and we have this quarter and in prior quarters but it's going to cost us to bring increased focus on this as well.
Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan: Okay. On a different note, do you see any changes in the environment with respect to ceding company retentions going forward? Do you feel like companies have set a threshold where they don't want to take them any higher? Or do you expect that trend potentially to increase as we go through '08?
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: We are still seeing...it may change but we are still seeing companies looking to keep more net. And you know it kind of comes from the fact that they are having a difficulty growing with rates going down, and I'm talking primarily about the casualty - by the way on the Cat side there's still limits as to what people can keep net. Going forward may be it will start to level out but I think most recently we've seen that trend continuing. Let me say this, that who knows what may happen on forward, there is an upside on the thought of the ceiling companies, and as Joe indicated, the primary sector is still having a fair amount of competition, particularly in the U.S. so to keep their premiums level they would have to keep a higher retention.
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: There are some pockets where rates have decreased to the point where it's not really problematic for us that they are keeping it net. We are not particularly thrilled to take it on especially when they want more favorable reinsurance terms.
Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan: That's fair enough. I guess the last question is, you've seen an appetite by some other companies to do deals where they are acquiring also brokers' MGAs and rather than just being a capacity for those companies being the owners. Is that something that has any interest... is that something you are interested in at all?
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes it actually is something that we are interested in with the right people and the right book of business. If it's business that really fits into our insurance operation where it's again specialized niche business that we think is somewhat insulated from the softening that's taking place in the marketplace and if we like the people and if the chemistry is good, that is a situation that would be of interest and we would check out.
Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan: Okay. I Appreciate it. Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to David Small with Bear Sterns.
David Small - Bear Sterns & Co.: Yes. Good morning. Just going back to your capital base for a second, so we can understand better how much capital you need to operate the business. I mean this year if you look at it your premiums were essentially flat quarter-over-quarter and your earnings were about the same, but obviously the ROE was down. I just want to figure out how much more capital do you think you need to keep now, versus last year, now that the new model's are fully in place to rating it. You know what the rating agency requirements are and of course as you talked here before you have more Cat in the book of business.
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Where we stand at this point, I mean the capital base is up almost $600 million for the year. We're very, very comfortable where we are relative to the rating agencies. We've been through reviews with A.M Best and Moody's, we're in process with S&P. And where we were, as we had a redundancy as of last year end, nothing much has really changed relative to our Cat exposures or other capital needs to support our enterprise risks generally. So, we are quite comfortable from a capital position and I would say any earnings that we generate potentially we can use in capital management endeavors.
David Small - Bear Sterns & Co.: Okay. And then could you just give us... Joe you mentioned the three new programs, could you maybe just give us a little more detail there?
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I'll ask Tom to do that.
Thomas J. Gallagher - President and Chief Operating Officer: Sure, we have, I had mentioned it before, we have three new programs that were initiated this year. One was the FX71 [ph] which was a program which is possibly about $40 million. It is a combination of agricultural logging and moving resource. Number two program is one that took effect in October, is chipsets. That is a tow truck and [ph] operation and lastly, which is probably about $49 as well on annualized basis, and the last one is the Brownstone program which is a just as it says, it's a Brownstone program, it's a commercial package policy covering buildings in New York, Boston and Chicago. Estimated premium is probably on an annualized basis somewhere in the neighborhood of about $16 million and that will take effect as on '11.
David Small - Bear Sterns & Co.: Okay, great. Thanks.
Operator: We'll go next to Jay Gelb with Lehman Brothers.
Jay H. Gelb - Lehman Brothers: Thank you. I just want to get a sense perhaps on the timing of the release of the results of the PACIS review, would you anticipate putting that out in conjunction with first quarter earnings results or if it's done earlier would you put it out before year end separately?
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: No. It's our hope that we will complete it earlier and be able to make a release later on in the fourth quarter ahead of our earnings release for the year.
Jay H. Gelb - Lehman Brothers: Okay. And do you anticipate the buying back stocks in the fourth quarter, given you are going through the review?
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: No. We take a lot of things into consideration; our overall capital position, market conditions, etcetera, etcetera. And we purchase stock when we think it makes sense so we may or may not be in the market just depending on overall assessment. It's very difficult for us to commit ahead of time.
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: And we haven't, we haven't offered guidance on stock buyback and we really will not be offering the guidance. We'd like the flexibility of taking a look each quarter if not each month, in what are the business opportunities and what are the capital needs.
Jay H. Gelb - Lehman Brothers: Okay. Next issue on the investment side the other... the partnership income as you pointed out has been quite strong, is that reported on a current quarter basis or is that lagged, and given the issues that you are all capital markets dealt with in the third quarter do you anticipate being able to maintain that run rate?
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: It is reported on a one-quarter lag. Most of our limited partnerships are not public equity market-related. They are generally early-stage capital or specifically oriented to real estate, power plants, healthcare, etcetera, etcetera. So it's difficult for me to comment on what the return might be in the fourth quarter. I did indicate I think we thought the third quarter was a little above our expectations but we're not aware of any significant issues with respect to the limited partnership portfolio as a result of the turmoil in the third quarter apparently continuing.
Jay H. Gelb - Lehman Brothers: Okay good. And then on the tax rate, you said 17% to 18% for the fourth quarter is that a good run rate expectation for 2008 as well?
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I think all other things being equal, yes. And that is, our underwriting profitability, the percentage of our portfolio that's invested in tax exempts, etcetera, etcetera. So underwriting income really and how much of it is onshore, how much of it is really offshore, is really significant driver of the tax rates so it... I think at this point I think it's fair to assume a continuation at about the current rate.
Jay H. Gelb - Lehman Brothers: Okay. And then finally on the capital side, debt-to-capital is going to go down quite a bit after you redeem your trust preferred. Do you have any sense of whether you might re-lever, given whether the stocks multiple is and how much excess capital you're driving?
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: That's something that we continually look at. As you know we've indicated that we are focused on capital management activities, so that fits in the overall mix depending upon what we might do in terms of shrinking our equity base, returning capital to shareholders in that manner that would all fit into our talks about what we want do in that side.
Jay H. Gelb - Lehman Brothers: Great. Thanks for the answers.
Operator: We'll go next to Bill Wilt with Morgan Stanley.
William Wilt - Morgan Stanley: Hi. Good morning. I can't resist a few more asbestos questions. They're with me. Craig, in your prepared remarks, you quantified the acceleration in the reported losses but I missed it I thought it was $75 million but if that's the right number I might have missed the time frame?
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Right. It was $75 million over the last four quarters, and in fact we had nothing in the first quarter of this year.
William Wilt - Morgan Stanley: Okay. That's helpful, thanks. Related to it, I may be behind the times here, but I think your chief actuary left a couple of months ago. Any relationship between this study and that is end to or anything you can add on and who'll be leading the study internally?
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: There is no connection whatsoever with those two events and it's going to be a joint effort using our actuaries claims people, underwriters and auditors. And so I'll sit very carefully, very tightly on top of it and I'll be involved.
William Wilt - Morgan Stanley: Understood. Have you named a new chief actuary yet or not?
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: No. We have not. You know I'm really happy with the people that we have on staff in each of the disciplines in our chief reserving actuary, my chief pricing actuary any other people on staff, so well at some point we certainly intend to, refill the position. At this point I think we can work fine with the people we have on staff.
William Wilt - Morgan Stanley: Helpful. Thanks. Two more quick ones if I may. First on the wildfires; past practice or industry convention, maybe just an education here, multiple fires, different locations from a reinsurance perspective is that typically considered multiple events or is there any industry convention that would be helpful?
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: There is no industry convention. Right now there are twelve wild fires. Whether that would be considered one event or twelve events is really based on a contract and I don't know if you could pick any convention that would be perfect. And then the same question arose with the UK storms.
William Wilt - Morgan Stanley: Sure. Okay, understood. Thanks. And then Joe, you had mentioned in the prepared remarks that there was some modest deterioration in the reinsurance terms and conditions, if that's the correct characterization could you maybe give a few specific examples?
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well, you see some of the obvious things like request for higher ceding commissions, but when you actually get to some of the other terms that just get into nitty-gritty of how contracts are going to be handled if you get into arbitrations or all the other issues. There has really been a push for the ceding companies to make the conditions better for them and consequently more difficult for reinsurance, so there's an awful lot of discussion that's been going on in the last few months on treaty terms, as well as the economics like ceding commission.
William Wilt - Morgan Stanley: Okay. Thanks very much.
Operator: We will go next to Mark Serafin with Citadel.
Mark Serafin - Citadel Investments: Thank you. First just to clarify, there are no reserve changes for the one-off credit program in the quarter?
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: No.
Mark Serafin - Citadel Investments: So as the odd alone credit environment continues to deteriorate, there is no way to cross having increased exposures.
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: No that's the one-off book of business and we are continuing to see a run-off well within our range of expected loss.
Mark Serafin - Citadel Investments: Okay. And then regarding the additional tax provision in the quarter; is this a current quarter issue, or is this something the IRS is concerned with over past financials?
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: This has to deal with the examination of our 2004 return.
Mark Serafin - Citadel Investments: Okay. So the provision in the current quarter, is there an attempt to avoid restating historicals or --?
Craig E. Eisenacher - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: No. It doesn't have anything to do with restatement. We followed a methodology for foreign exchange that historically going back years and years, they have accepted. This examination team has decided not to accept it, and so what we've done is not only have we put a provision, if you will, for the 2004 year, but for the 2005 and 2006 years. And this basically a FIN 48 requirement that we do this; it doesn't mean that we will lose on the issue when we get into appeals, but given the accounting requirements we are mandated, we're required to put the reserve up, so we did.
Mark Serafin - Citadel Investments: Thank you.
Operator: And due to time constraints, we we'll take our final question from Kevin O'Donoghue with Banc of America Securities.
Kevin O'Donoghue - Banc of America Securities: Thanks. Good morning. You mentioned that in Florida primary companies not being required to reduce rates beyond what's justified by the changes to the Florida Cat front. But now that we have the OIR issuing Sapina's rejecting rate increases by some primary companies and reaching settlements for others. I'm wondering if you see the possibility that that could change and if it could affect demand or reinsurance in Florida?
Thomas J. Gallagher - President and Chief Operating Officer: Well again I will just repeat that are our clients have been really been able to try the rates that they believe proper and adequate for their homeowner business and there was a serious concern a year ago that it would be mandated, that they have to come up with rates that were going to be inappropriate and too low and that just hasn't come to be case. So I am expecting this year and going forward that they will still be allowed to charge a proper rate, in terms of weather or not they want more or less reinsurance certainly for the last year or two, many of these companies that are not big companies with lot of surplus have needed reinsurance to support their operation. So they've made plenty of money last year and hopefully there's no more storms this year and they make plenty of money along with us this year and into next, and so that would mean growing surplus it might be on the back of that they need less reinsurance going forward. But getting back to the rate environment, it's been what it should be and I believe it will stay that way.
Kevin O'Donoghue - Banc of America Securities: Okay thanks. And the fact I'll ask one follow up about Florida; I think you mentioned that are you saw some decline in your Florida property business in the insurance segment and I'm wondering if you're referring to your excess and surplus lines program down there and if so, if you found that business in many way disappointing in sort of where the prospect for this going forward.?
Thomas J. Gallagher - President and Chief Operating Officer: That has been I'd say... that is exactly what we were I think Craig was referring to earlier is the commercial business not the homeowner business but the commercial business that we do on an insurance basis has been disappointing. I think we went into that market a year a year and a half ago, we really thought their would be a big need a shortage of companies like ourselves are providing capacity but more company have come in it and provided capacity in the commercial property world and we believe what happened at that stage of the game. So we are still in the market and we are still writing business but there are plenty of other people in the market too, and we have not seen the demands or the rates to be what we originally hoped they would be.
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes and we only do a small book of business there. I suspect at this point of time, by year end we will probably do about $25 million for the property business... commercial property business in Florida
Kevin O'Donoghue - Banc of America Securities: Okay that's very helpful. Thank you very much.
Joseph V. Taranto - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well thank you for joining us on the call, and as I said we are pleased with the nine months results and we expect to have a terrific 2007, and are very optimistic about 2008. Thank you.
Operator: This does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.
