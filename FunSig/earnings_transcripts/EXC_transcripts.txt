===== 2025 Q1  (2025-05-01 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to Exelon's First Quarter Earnings Call. My name is Lateef, and I will be your event specialist today. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. Please note that today's webcast is being recorded. During the presentation, we'll have a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. It is now my pleasure to turn today's program over to Andrew Plenge, Vice President of Investor Relations. The floor is yours.
Andrew Plenge: Thank you, Lateef. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our 2025 first quarter earnings call. Leading the call today are Calvin Butler, Exelon's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jeanne Jones, Exelon's Chief Financial Officer. Other members of Exelon's senior management team are also with us today, and they will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. Today's presentation, along with our earnings release and other financial information can be found in the Investor Relations section of Exelon's website. We would also like to remind you that today's presentation and the associated earnings release materials contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. You can find the cautionary statements on these risks on Slide 2 of today's presentation or in our SEC filings. In addition, today's presentation includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations between these measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of our presentation and in our earnings release. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Calvin Butler, Exelon's President and CEO.
Calvin Butler: Thank you, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for our first quarter earnings call. 2025 is off to a good start. We're reporting operating earnings of $0.92 per share, representing strong growth over the first quarter of 2024, and ahead of expectations, which keeps us on track to deliver on our 2025 operating earnings guidance range. Reliability and safety performance continues to be very strong as well despite a number of high wind events throughout the winter months that challenged our operators who remain the best in the business. ComEd and Pepco Holdings are projecting top decile outage frequency and duration performance while BGE and PECO are in top quartile. We have a relatively lower level of base rate case activity this year and our two open rate cases remain on track at Atlantic City Electric and Delmarva Power, which Jeanne will cover in her remarks. We have also been actively engaging in a variety of legislative and regulatory reforms to ensure energy policy keeps pace with the industry and broader economic trends. Ensuring reliable and affordable energy for all customers is critical to our jurisdictions and the nation as a whole as they work to realize their economic and energy policy ambitions. The first quarter of 2025 has already seen great progress on that front. In Maryland, the legislature passed several energy bills that take important steps around energy security, including prescribing a competitive process to procure new dispatchable resources and capacity while providing a path for alternative approaches should they be needed. They also lay out ambitious goals around developing battery storage at both the distribution and transmission level, offering us and developers further opportunity to shore up the state's energy supply. And the state also outlined for the first time in law the recognition of multi-year plan construct, prompting a robust discussion that highlighted its merits of increased transparency, planning, and alignment while giving stakeholders a greater say in how much and where their dollars should be invested. We now look to the commission to conclude its multi-year plan lessons learned process, so we can move the state forward with confidence in meeting its energy and economic goals. Our other states are also considering legislation to address elements of energy policy, including a focus on the energy security and cost allocation implications of large load growth. We expect to have more to share on those sessions as the year advances. There has been significant activity at the regional and federal level as well. First, PJM has made considerable progress to address suboptimal outcomes in its capacity market construct. We have been pleased to see that FERC approved a number of solutions put forward by PJM via 205 filings, including its temporary price collar and refinement to its deactivation process. We are also encouraged to see the response to its reliability response initiative, which has generated applications worth almost 27 gigawatts worth of nameplate capacity. In February, FERC initiated a 206 proceeding requesting that PJM and its transmission owners investigate whether the tariff remains just and reasonable in rates, terms, and conditions of service that apply to colocated arrangements. We are pleased with the leadership shown by FERC in working to resolve this issue in a timely manner, along with PJM's efforts to meet the aggressive timeline to address a very complicated topic. We're also encouraged by the consensus that PJM transmission owners were able to reach on a complex topic in such a short period, and we look forward to assisting the industry in aligning on a policy that equitably supports the national crisis critical issues of energy security and economic development. More details on the progress we're making across these forms can be found in our appendix. Maintaining momentum across these policy arenas is key to meeting the task ahead of us and we see no abatement in our opportunity for new large loads in our territories. The 17 gigawatt pipeline of opportunity that we communicated in our fourth quarter earnings call remains fully intact. We are also conducting advanced studies on an additional 16 gigawatts of high density load, which we anticipate will result in significant incremental commitments from customers upon aligning on investment needs and timing. We continue to focus on ways to enhance our process to ensure we are offering unparalleled service to new customers in our territories while continuing to ensure existing customers are protected and benefit from the new load. And the pace of new business seeking to connect to the grid makes it even more critical for stakeholders to collaborate actively and with urgency on policy that balances the common goals of reliability, affordability, and progress toward a cleaner energy future. We look forward to providing further updates on our new business prospects in future quarters. As a reminder, this is just one of the elements that contributes to our visibility into $10 billion to $15 billion of transmission opportunity beyond our plan. As we laid out in our fourth quarter call, the need for investment in our high voltage network is real and growing. We are proud to have Carim Khouzami now leading those efforts with his extensive background in commercial, regulatory and operational roles ideally suited to industry tailwinds and our unique transmission assets and capabilities. I also want to congratulate Tamla Olivier, for her promotion to BGE President and CEO. Her effectiveness leading increasingly large organizations during her 15-year career here will continue to ensure BGE's 2 million electric and gas customers receive high value service. Congratulations to you both. Lastly, I'll remind you of our expectations for our four-year outlook. We reaffirm our plan to invest $38 billion over the next four years for the benefit of our customers that will drive 7.4% rate based growth and be financed with a balanced mix of debt and equity. In fact, we have been able to de-risk a large portion of our financing needs for the year with all of our planned corporate debt issuances completed and 60% of our $700 million annualized equity need priced. By earning a fair return on that investment plan, we expect to deliver annualized earnings growth of 5% to 7% through 2028, generating consistent growth and long-term value. I'll now turn it to Jeanne to discuss our financial performance and provide further details on our rate case activity.
Jeanne Jones: Thank you, Calvin, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover our first quarter financial update and progress on our 2025 regulatory activity. Starting on Slide 5, we present our quarter-over-quarter adjusted operating earnings block. Exelon earned $0.92 per share in the first quarter of 2025, compared to $0.68 per share in the same period in 2024, reflecting higher results of $0.24 per share over the same period. Earnings are higher in the first quarter relative to the same period last year, primarily driven by $0.14 of new distribution and transmission rates in effect across our jurisdictions, $0.03 of favorable weather at PECO and $0.02 of tax repairs timing partially offset by $0.03 of higher interest expense due to higher levels of debt at increased interest rates. As anticipated, results are also impacted by timing at ComEd, which totaled $0.09 for the quarter and includes $0.02 due to the lower revenue recognition in 2024, as we awaited updated rates from the rehearing order and eventual approval of our refiled grid plan. The remaining $0.07 is due to year-over-year revenue shaping and O&M timing including higher storm and IT project related spend in the first quarter of 2024. We expect the revenue shaping and O&M timing to reverse in the balance of the year. These results are slightly ahead of our indications on the fourth quarter call primarily due to this timing of O&Ms as well as timing of tax repairs. As we look ahead, our second quarter earnings are expected to be approximately 14% of the midpoint of our projected full year earnings guidance range, which contemplates partial reversal of the ComEd timing along with normal weather and storm activity. In combination with Q1 results, this would result in recognizing 48% of projected full year earnings in the first half of the year, consistent with seasonal shaping in prior years, allowing us to remain on track for full year operating earnings of $2.64 to $2.74 per share with the goal to be at the midpoint or better. Finally, we are reaffirming our annualized earnings growth rate of 5% to 7% through 2028 with the expectation to be at the midpoint or better of that range. Turning to Slide 6, we currently have two base rate cases open at Pepco Holdings. The Delmarva Power gas distribution rate case filed last September remains on track with interim rates, which went into effect on April 20 subject to refund. The rate case seeks to recover continued reliability investments such as aging piping upgrades and upgrades to its LNG plant, which helps protect customers from supply price volatility during peak periods. It will be open for intervener and rebuttal testimony in July and September before evidentiary hearings are convened in November. An order is expected in the first quarter of 2026. Our second open base rate case is at Atlantic City Electric where we are seeking recovery of grid improvement and modernization efforts in line with New Jersey's Energy Master Plan and the Clean Energy Act. The proposed procedural schedule was approved by the judge in March with settlement discussion set for late April to early May. Evidentiary hearings are scheduled to begin in late July and continue into early August with an order expected by the end of the year. ACE is also anticipated to implement interim rates on August 21 subject to refund. In Maryland, we continue to work to close out our final reconciliations from the first BGE and Pepco Maryland multi-year plans and remain engaged in the lessons learned process as we approach our next rate case filings. We are encouraged that the legislature recognized the multi-year construct in the recently passed next-generation act. This legislation provides greater direction and alignment between all stakeholders on the future investments needed to support our customers. Now that we are on our second NYP at BGE and our fourth one in Maryland, we feel better prepared to support a multi-year investment plan without a reconciliation and we look forward to working with the commission and our stakeholders to continue to demonstrate customer benefits in future multi-year plan filings. We steadfastly believe that forward-looking plans are the most planful and cost effective way to ensure the reliability and resiliency of the system while meeting the state's energy and economic goals. We await the commission's comments on the lessons learned to fully ensure our next filing aligns with the PSC's recommendations that accommodate the new legislation and the lessons learned proceedings. Finally, in Illinois, ComEd filed its annual performance evaluation and request for annual adjustment under 2024 base distribution rates on April 29. The requested adjustment of $268 million is primarily driven by operating under lower revenue requirements throughout 2024 relative to the final approved order and it includes the revenue impact of achieving a performance metrics adder of over 5 basis points. ComEd's actual revenue requirement in 2024 closely aligns with the final revenue requirement approved in December 2024. Direct and rebuttal testimony is expected to occur throughout the summer at hearings and an ALJ proposed order in the fall. A final order on ComEd's reconciliation is expected in December. Turning to Slide 7, I will conclude with a review of our balance sheet activity. From a financing perspective, we took advantage of the favorable market conditions in the first quarter and made substantial progress on our 2025 capital needs. First, we have completed nearly 50% of our planned long-term debt financing transactions, having successfully raised $650 million for the Pepco Holdings utilities and all of our $2 billion of debt financing needs at corporate, including $1 billion of hybrid debt. The strong investor demand and attractive pricing for our debt securities continue to be a testament to the strength of our balance sheet and to our value proposition, positioning us well as we seek to finance the energy transformation in the most cost effective way for our customers and our investors. We also continue to execute on our pre-assurance hedging strategy implemented in 2022 to further protect us from interest rate volatility. As it pertains to equity, as a reminder, in our last guidance update, we estimated we would finance 40% of our incremental capital investment with equity, resulting in total equity needs of $2.8 billion over the four-year plan and implying approximately $700 million of equity on an annual basis. For 2025, we successfully de-risked nearly 60% of our annualized needs be our ATM issuing approximately $175 million worth of shares and pricing an additional $250 million under forward agreements for issuance later in the year. As you heard on our last earnings call, we project to continue to have 100 basis points to 200 basis points of financial flexibility on average over the plan for our consolidated corporate metrics above the Moody's downgrade threshold of 12% approaching 14% at the end of our guidance period. We continue to advocate for language that incorporates repairs for calculating the corporate alternative minimum tax and we are encouraged by the recent bipartisan legislation introduced in the U.S. House to advocate for this change, which will lower energy costs for our customers. However, we will remind you that our plan assumes that the final regulations will not allow for repairs, favorably addressing repairs in the minimum tax calculation would result in an increase of approximately 50 basis points to our consolidated metrics on average over the plan. Thank you. I'll now turn the call back to Calvin for his closing remarks.
Calvin Butler: Thank you, Jeanne. In closing on Slide 8, I'll reconfirm our focus as we look to add another year of execution to our track record as a premier utility. Our talented and dedicated employees will continue to deliver operational excellence investing $9.1 billion in the system to deliver high reliability service to our customers. We are also constantly working to find the right rate making mechanisms that allow us to fulfill our responsibility and privilege to serve the 10.7 million customers that count on us for their energy needs. Those mechanisms need to provide accurate compensation for our investors while allowing for the critical feedback and collaboration necessary to ensure we are only investing where our jurisdictions want us to invest. We recognize some of our customers are broadly struggling with economic uncertainty as we all navigate updated tariff policies, federal budget reprioritization, and increased energy supply costs. Weather extremes like our first cold winter in years only exasperated those pressures. We do feel that we are relatively well-positioned to protect our customers as it pertains to the proposed tariff policy with approximately 90% of our supplies sourced domestically, we have estimated the impact to be around 1.5% of our four-year capital and O&M investment plan before any mitigating efforts with the majority impacting capital. The impacts will also be delayed as a result of our inventory levels and long lead time requirements. With our size, scale, and deconcentrated investment plan and the culture of cost discipline, we expect to be able to manage any tariff-related impacts highlighting the value of Exelon's platform. And while we are advocating for the continuance of the tax credits under the IRA law, we are not directly exposed to any reductions in those nor to any transferability restrictions. As Jeanne mentioned, we remain committed that we will be able to improve our position with respect to the corporate alternative minimum tax associated with that law. We will continue to leverage a variety of tools to assist customers including deferred payment plans as well as suspended disconnections and associated fees and we are advertising budget building options throughout community forums in custom and community engagement events. Additionally, our policy advocacy has focused on solutions that enable PJM and our states to acquire new power supply as cost effectively as possible while serving large new loads equitably. As I noted earlier, we have made good progress thus far in legislative and regulatory forms. Finally, we also stress the degree to which we try and maximize the dollars that we need to invest in the grid to serve our customers. We focus on forward-looking recovery mechanisms because it allows us to collaboratively determine where best to invest their dollar and do it efficiently. In fact, over the last five years, over 98% of the net profits we earn at our utilities, all of which are established and reviewed through rigorous regulatory proceedings, we have been reinvested back into the business for our customers. And for every $1 million of capital investment we make at our utilities, it supports eight jobs or $1.6 million in economic output. So customer affordability continues to be a big part of our focus this year, which complements our efforts to drive economic development to further benefit our jurisdictions. And of course, as always, you can count on our continued discipline in executing our financial plan, earning a consolidated ROE of 9% to 10%, maintaining a strong balance sheet and reported earnings within our guidance range of $2.64 to $2.74 per share. We look forward to making 2025 our 25th anniversary of Exelon, another year where you can count on us to deliver consistent growth and long-term value. Lateef, we can now open it up for any questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Nick Campanella of Barclays. Please go ahead, Nick.
Calvin Butler: Good morning, Nick.
Jeanne Jones: Hey, Nick.
Nick Campanella: Hey, good morning, everyone. Hope everyone's well. So I guess, just you have this new Maryland legislation that's out there. It does prohibit reconciliations after Jan 1, 2025. And I'm just wondering if you can maybe kind of talk about how you think that could impact the outcomes in the BGE or the Pepco reconciliations. And if an order were to kind of go against you there, is the guidance resilient to that and maybe you can kind of give some more color on that. Thanks.
Calvin Butler: Yes. Nick, let me just say this. First, thank you for the question. And to your direct point, I think Jeanne, hit it well, is that we do expect the reconciliation to come forward in short order and our plan is solidified and ready to operate as we considered all alternatives. There's nothing on here that we believe that will prevent us from meeting our objectives. That's one. But let me turn it also, Nick, to where we see Maryland going. As you know better than most that Maryland this year had legislation passed. And I think there's -- it's important to focus on five key areas I'll point out. One, for the first time it provides language that NYP can be approved and as you talked about, it doesn't have reconciliations. But we've kind of gone through this process a couple of times now. I think Jeanne said we're in our fourth one in Maryland, so we know how to build this up and know how to work collaboratively with the stakeholders to ensure we spend on the right things. And I'm very comfortable that we will meet the budget for future NYPs. Second, specific language in the legislation this year stated on the large load colocation issue which was very important. It has provisions in there that requires that any load that for infrastructure upgrades and other reasonable costs behind the meter, it's balanced and it does not shift the cost to other customers on the system. That's very important and that would apply to any load over 100 megawatts with greater -- with 80% or greater capacity factor. So that's just very important. And it's important to note that we continue to drive this on an affordability front within our jurisdictions and Maryland has codified it. The next piece is that battery storage was a big item within the Maryland legislation. It directed that the Public Service Commission establish and solicit 150 megawatts of distribution battery storage from each electric utility with a target of 70% owned by the utility and 30% owned by third-parties. It also requires that the PSC start a procurement solicitation of 1.6 gigawatts of transmission battery storage by January 26. Again, all indications that they recognize the issues and they're driving the state of Maryland forward. And I just want to also give kudos and just acknowledge the two new commissioners that have been appointed. They are -- they have a strong track record of regulatory experience and I think they will continue to be vital voices in Maryland as we move forward. So long answer, but to your direct question, we are not concerned about the reconciliation pull out of the legislation and we feel very confident that we will work with the state to meet the needs going forward.
Nick Campanella: Hey, thanks for all that color. I appreciate that. And then maybe on the FERC 206 obviously there's been some requests to settle by the power companies and that was put forward a week or two ago. And I'm just curious what your response would be as a T&D, do you think or are you open to resolving this colocation issue via settlement perhaps and -- or does this kind of need to go the full distance at FERC? Any comments there would be helpful. Thanks.
Calvin Butler: Thank you, Nick. I would say, we're always open to discussions and have been from the very beginning and that hasn't changed. We continue to move forward as a T&D to meet our customers' expectations. We talk about the 17 gigawatts and another 16 that we're considered. So our process is continuing. I think the transmission owners coming together and putting forth this statement, EEI putting a transmission owner unified statement to FERC goes a long way. So our principals have not changed one bit, Nick. And we are right there and in having discussions with the IPPs, we're open and we're open to make sure that we get this done quickly and equitably for all of our customers and that has not changed.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Kennedy of Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open, James.
Calvin Butler: Hello, James.
James Kennedy: Good morning. So one of your peers has been talking recently about the introduction of legislation in Pennsylvania to support potentially regulated generation. I guess, what's your degree of involvement in that process and any views on REG generation versus potential long-term PPAs and other mechanisms? Thanks.
Calvin Butler: I would tell you that anything that is good for our customers to address the issue of resource adequacy and affordability, we will support. As you can appreciate, James, our teams are actively involved in those discussions at the legislative front and even having the discussions at the regulatory side. So we just need it to be balanced and we need to ensure that the recovery of us getting into that. I will quote my CFO is that we need to have a very straightforward approach and that it is recover -- recoverability is very clear and outlined in legislation. So our -- we know what we're getting into and we're partnering with the state to meet those needs. But it's all about the customers in terms of affordability and energy security and adequacy.
James Kennedy: Okay, perfect. And then just on the data center side, thanks for the incremental color in the appendix slides on the phases. Is there like a rule of thumb that we should be thinking about for how you convert between the phases and ultimately shift into the capital plan? Just any kind of timeline considerations. Thanks.
Jeanne Jones: Yes. Hey, James, yes, we don't really have a rule of thumb because every project is different and we always start with how do we be most cost efficient for all of our customers. And so as you can imagine, therefore it depends. But what I will say is that the $38 billion that we have in the plan, $5 billion of that is for new business. And when I look back to our last four-year plan that was an increase of $900 million. So we can expect to continue to see more incremental capital necessary to accommodate the new load. As we outlined in our fourth quarter call that $10 billion to $15 billion beyond the planning period, at least $1 billion is related to this new business. So as we know, the investment is needed, we build it into the plan. But as you also know, we don't put anything in that isn't certain. So of the $38 billion, $5 billion related to new business and that's at least a $900 million increase from our last four-year period and we expect that to continue.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Calvin Butler: Hey, Julien.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning, team. Nicely done, guys. Hey, thank you again for your time.
Calvin Butler: Thank you for that.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Absolutely. Just following-up on some of the last questions, if I can press a little bit further, if you don't mind. First, on the data center front, I mean, you all are framing these as 80% and 50% probability. They're fairly high numbers in isolation. How do you think about the timing here and how that it perhaps is juxtaposed against the backdrop of this FERC ongoing process? Again, I think we all take it for granted that maybe one sort of precludes the other. But how do you think about it? 80% probability is non-trivial, particularly given the metric that you define them as being having already achieved.
Jeanne Jones: Yes, I would say -- well, I would start with saying that none of this as a reminder is dependent on that colocated FERC 206. This is all front of the meter full T&D typical sort of customers that we have in our service territory. So none of that is dependent on that process. And in fact, we're not seeing any slowdown as we work through that process. So we've got -- we announced the 16 gigs on Q4 of 2024. Those 16 gigs remain very solid, high probability. And we've even given more color in terms of Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 for those 16 gigs. What we did a little bit different this time is also give you insight into what's around the corner. And we have another 16 gigs. So sorry to confuse you, but they're both the same number, but it's another 16 gigs. 12 of that is a cluster study. The second cluster study we're doing in ComEd service territory and then four of it is just spread across the East Coast utility. So continued momentum all in front of the meter, not dependent on this process. But as you heard from Calvin, we continue to work that process in parallel because we want to meet all -- any and all types of customers. As we think about the buckets, you can see again Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3, I would say 70% is probably Phase 1, another 20% Phase 2 and 10% in Phase 3. We feel very confident in the other 16 gig. And I think you can kind of think of them roughly in the Phase 1 time period too. But we wanted to be clear about how we're thinking about those. And the fact that we're moving more -- because of the demand we're seeing more of a cluster study approach where we're looking at customers together, so that we can give them better insights into time and cost and things like that. So continuing to evolve our customer service there. But as that cluster study is completed, as we work the other 4 gigs, you can expect us to kind of move that 16 gigs into the other phases as we continue to update you on a quarterly basis.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: All right, excellent. Thank you for clarifying that, it remains distinct and separate. I appreciate that. And then related just not to nitpick too much on the prepared comments, but just curious, when you talk about assisting the industry with respect to the backdrop here on leadership at FERC, how do you think about what that timeline looks like and what that settlement process could be? I know that there's several different forms where you could have another PJM stakeholder process, that there could be more of a FERC oriented process here. How do you think about potentially finding a joint arrangement or settlement here amongst a litany of different parties?
Colette Honorable: Good morning, Julien. It's Colette Honorable. How are you today?
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Great. Thank you.
Colette Honorable: Julien, can you hear me? Okay, good. Let me get to your question. One, let's take a look at the docket itself. We really see quite a bit of consensus in the docket. Calvin referenced the filing by EEI, which represents a majority of the industry, the NERC filing, the filing from the Independent Market Monitor, and then the United Transmission owner group really demonstrate to FERC that there is a record and a consensus about how to treat this load. We -- when Calvin said we appreciated the commission's efforts here, it is to move quickly, so that we can all have the clarity that we need. That's where we started in this matter. And so we're not surprised at all by how the docket is progressing. As Calvin mentioned, we will be open to having discussions of any sort, but what we really want is for FERC to issue a decision quickly, so that we can all have the clarity, so that we can support the large load that Jeanne described as well as going back to Calvin's point, ensuring affordability and energy security for all of our customers.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. So looking for FERC to take action principally before anything else with a firm decision?
Colette Honorable: We think there is a record before them to do so. As Calvin mentioned, should the commission determine that settlement discussions are appropriate, we would be more than willing to participate in that exercise as we have been very constructive partners in the past. If you look back at our record here, we were the ones that really started in the forefront of this issue. So we've demonstrated that we will be constructive and collaborative partners, but we're ready to continue supporting this moment in time.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. Thank you all very much. See you soon. Cheers.
Calvin Butler: Thank you, Julien. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Arcaro of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, David.
Calvin Butler: Good morning, David.
David Arcaro: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Morning. Maybe a quick follow-up on the data center side of things. Could you give a sense as to the timing of when that load looks to be ramping up within your forecast period? And I guess, from your -- I'm also thinking in the context of your infrastructure and any limitations there, when can you connect in new large loads at this point, given such a big pipeline?
Jeanne Jones: Yes. So as we think about the 16 gigs that we have on the slide, we think about 10% of the load will be on by 2028, another a third of it by 2030, we have three-fourth of it by 2034, and then the remainder beyond that. So that kind of gives you an insight into the view as we see the load coming on. And then your second question again, it depends on the customer, I mean, I think there's at times where it's 36 months, we're always trying to push to be faster for our customers. Other times it can be a little bit longer. But in all of our discussions, the most important thing we hear from our customers is just understanding the timeline and being upfront with that, which is why these studies are so important. So I think…
Calvin Butler: Let me add there, Jeanne. David, also I think it was last year we talked about how we restructured our customer strategy organization and we created a centralized group to talk with the data center developers and really to understand what their needs were. And by strategically working with them ahead of time, what we found is that we can meet their needs and understanding how much they need to ramp up in a timely fashion and also determine appropriate sites where they can connect quicker onto the system where the infrastructure was already there or in large part there, so it required less. And that's the partnership. Give you an example, just about a month ago, we had a EEI hosted and we hosted with them a large a key account meeting in Chicago. And we had sidebars with all the large data center developers to talk about their needs and where they were going. And we looked at all of our six jurisdictions to say if this is what you need, here are sites that we've identified and that's that partnership. So to Jeanne's point, all very different, but it's a very collaborative approach in how we're targeting it.
David Arcaro: Okay, excellent. Thanks for that. And wanted to touch on affordability. We've seen some states may be louder than others, but seeing with the impact of PJM capacity, pricing increases, an increased focus in affordability, wondering how you're kind of approaching that, getting ahead of that and managing affordability challenges and concerns broadly across your portfolio.
Calvin Butler: No, you nailed it. It has become the primary topic of discussion this past winter. As I talked about in my prepared remarks, this was the first cold winter we've had in several years. And as an example, BGE bills were up approximately 50%, with 80% of that increase due to weather, commodities and just legislative changes that were made. Our Delmarva Power & Light, DPL had no real changes in gas distribution rates, but equally high increases. We continue to see weather volatility and supply costs, which are the primary challenges we are working to address and mitigate for customers. And as I talked about, what we're doing proactively, we're helping our customers manage the cost. We're talking about energy efficiency. We're going out to customers, homes and small business, really driving what they can take action on to mitigate some of those. We're deploying our tools to assist customers. We've already suspended disconnections. We've delayed or extended payment plans, removed any additional charges. And I think the biggest piece for us is that we're out in our communities at a robust level, holding community forums and connecting with them and ensuring that the assistance that may be available at the state and local level, we're connecting them with that. So that is the key. Are we done? Absolutely not. Do we recognize the hardship that many of our customers are facing? Yes. As I always say to my team here, $1 increase for some of our customers is $1 too much. So we're not taking it lightly. And so we're having conversations at the state and local level about how to partner. And I think a good scenario that you can think about the Maryland legislation that I was talking to Nick about earlier, they allocated $200 million from a fund that they had established. And I think that fund was called, it was Strategic Energy Infrastructure Fund directed at companies and it had about $300 million in. They took $200 million of those dollars to help people with paying their bills. Now how can we partner with them to let those dollars go further? And we're having those discussions. So you're right. Key issue, the key issue, and we're meeting those challenges.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Appicelli of UBS. Please go ahead, Bill.
Calvin Butler: Hey Bill.
Jeanne Jones: Hey Bill.
Bill Appicelli: Hey, good morning. Just wanted to go back to Maryland for a second. Maybe on the lessons learned docket, can you just remind us on the timeline and maybe what's the range of outcomes there? Given the legislative development, is there any concern around not continuing the NYPs, beyond the current plan or what sort of is maybe a range of scenarios that we could look to there?
Calvin Butler: I would tell you that the fact in the debate this year around NYPs, the state, the legislature did a wonderful job at understanding the value of NYPs. But we do have the discretion to your point on whether we do. We do believe that that multi-year collaborative process, the engagement with stakeholders forward-looking is the most productive. So I don't see anything to-date that would take us away from that. And I am pleased that the commission did embark on the lessons learned process. So it extended into this year, likely delaying the timing. But we believe that this legislative session that we just had will spark a ruling very soon. As you may recall, we went through an extensive process to determine that it was the best option. And so I think we will have a -- I'm looking at Carim and Tamla here. We will have a decision in the short order. We anticipated by the end of the second quarter that we will have a decision on the lessons learned and we continue to involve in those debates. Everyone has submitted their comments, everyone has engaged in the process from the Office of People Counsel to the large industrials to residential customers. So everyone's voice has been heard, which is what we wanted and that's what we were driving to.
Bill Appicelli: Okay, great. And then just going back a little bit to the resource adequacy debate. You're indicating an ever increasing amount of load that's interested in coming on. The queue, I think for new capacity additions remains pretty small. I think there's only about 6 gigawatts of gas in the queue for PJM. I guess, the FERC is going to be having this technical conference here in June. But I guess where do you guys stand in terms of addressing the resource adequacy concerns as you look out to the amount of load that wants to come on over the next, call it five to seven years?
Calvin Butler: We do believe it's a portfolio approach, meaning that there's an approach that PJM and all of our states can take that we can't limit how we get the generation resources to the table. We should be looking at everything. And if it's a delay of closings of certain plants is it's allowing gas to come in and build. And we talked about this, utilities, owning, generation, all of that needs to be on the table because as you just said, we see we're at a critical time in this industry where we have to meet the need. Having said that, it has to be a very balanced approach and you have to balance it with the affordability issue. And I think that's why it's all coming to the table right now. So our discussions is portfolio approach. Let's be open to it and get it done sooner rather than later. And also put the right policies around it where you don't shift the cost from one customer group to another because we're running too fast.
Jeanne Jones: Yes. And I think to add to that portfolio approach just a focus on energy efficiency, distributed resources, demand response, and engaging with our states there to say, how can they happen, those programs, whether we have them today and we expand upon them or can we implement new programs to continue to add to that portfolio approach.
Calvin Butler: And part of our challenge, and we've been saying this for a while now is some jurisdictions are using, let's call it outdated rules. Outdated rules to address modern issues. And we need to keep the policies updated to address the needs of tomorrow and that's what we're working on. And I'll just -- yes, it's very, it takes some time to move regulatory bodies forward in a timely manner to meet the needs up to mark. And that's what we've really been putting our attention towards.
Jeanne Jones: And I think one of the slides we talked about, to Calvin's point, about the portfolio approach, right? We're active at FERC, active at PJM, pleased to see PJM putting forth proposals on the capacity auction. FERC already approving some of them. But then also, to Calvin's point, working with our states, Maryland has already made progress here in the first legislative session with the outlining a competitive procurement process for 3 gigawatts of in-state generation. So I think we're pleased to see all of our stakeholders working with a sense of urgency, and we're right there at the table to help drive those solutions.
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference back to Calvin Butler for closing remarks. Sir?
Calvin Butler: Thank you. Thank you, Lateef. And let me just say to everyone, thank you for your interest and support of Exelon. I hope as we continue to move these things forward, we're providing you with valuable information, and we appreciate you all taking the time to join us today and for your support. Lateef that concludes our call.
Operator: Thanks to all our participants for joining us today. This concludes our presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.

===== 2024 Q4  (2025-02-12 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Other financial information can be found in the investor relations section of Exelon Corporation's website. We would also like to remind you that today's presentation and the associated earnings release materials contain forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. You can find the cautionary statements on these risks on slide two of today's presentation or in our SEC filings. In addition, today's presentation includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations between these measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of our presentation and in our earnings release. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Calvin Butler, Exelon Corporation's President and CEO.
Calvin Butler: Thank you, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to have you with us for our fourth quarter earnings call, closing out another successful year for Exelon Corporation. We are entering our twenty-fifth year as a company since the historic merger of Commonwealth Edison and Philadelphia Electric Company in 2000. Fly Eagles Fly. The industry and the company have seen a tremendous amount of change during that time, not unlike the years over the century plus that shaped ComEd and PECO since their origins in 1881. But some threads indelibly run through that history, including most importantly, a commitment to excellence and service to our customers. That commitment inspired Samuel Insull in Chicago, whose vision made electricity more accessible to all customers. And it continues to inspire us today, which shows in the results we are reporting and where our focus will be in the years ahead. It was another year of excellent operating performance. All four of Exelon Utilities achieved top quartile for reliability, with three of our utilities ranking in the top five among our peer benchmark and all four utilities performing in the top eight.
Calvin Butler: It was also another year of excellent financial performance. We reported GAAP earnings for 2024 of $2.45 per share and adjusted operating earnings of $2.50 per share, making it our third straight year as a pure T&D company of meeting the midpoint or better of guidance. In fact, when you look back at the earnings path we laid out when announcing our separation, in our Q4 2021 earnings call, the midpoint of our 2024 guidance was $2.50. When you think of all the change Exelon Corporation has managed during that time, separating the company, generationally high inflation and interest rates, transitioning to the new ComEd rate structure, it is remarkable to think that we maintained our trajectory. That is who we are. A company that our customers, employees, policymakers, and investors count on to deliver. On the regulatory front, we successfully closed out a very busy year for rate cases. As we will discuss further, this puts us on very strong footing to serve our customers and focus on expanding ways to support the energy transformation in the years ahead. These include ensuring our jurisdiction can continue to participate in the exciting growth of artificial intelligence powered by data centers that can foster economic development. And as Jean will discuss, there are other significant potential transmission opportunities as well, such as the MISO Tranche 2.1 work that are not currently in our guidance but which will require an additional $10 billion to $15 billion of investment to serve our customers in the coming five to ten years. Those opportunities illustrate why our updated four-year plan continues to reflect the steady investment growth that you should expect from a company that serves more customers than any other in the US in some of the most critical regions for the economy. We now expect to invest $38 billion from 2025 to 2028 to support customer needs. No single project will be more than 3% of that plan. And of that $3.5 billion in capital growth, more than 80% is attributable to transmission. This type of investment ensures that our utilities remain a key engine of our jurisdictions' economies. Not only do our investments create good local jobs, estimated 70,000 plus, and not only do they ensure the spending stays local with more than $4 billion of our supplier spend sourced from our jurisdictions. Most importantly, it ensures reliability. Which when the economy increasingly counts on access to reliable resilient power can really multiply the power of our impact. The growth in our high-density load pipeline by over two and a half times in the last year is evidence of that. ComEd alone won fifteen major projects, bringing in an estimated $17 billion of projected capital investments from other companies and creating over 1,000 jobs in Northern Illinois. And with this development comes increased load and we are seeing 1% to 2% load growth over our four-year period. Allowing us to distribute the cost of the grid over more usage. To fund these investments in a disciplined manner, we are maintaining a balanced funding strategy. Financing the growth with 40% equity and building on a solid trajectory to sustaining and improving our credit metrics over the plan. This commitment to balance sheet strength is evidenced by an upgrade to Exelon Corporation's credit rating by S&P last week. With continued returns on equity in the 9% to 10% range, we expect annualized earnings growth of 5% to 7% through 2028 with the expectation of being at the midpoint or better of that range. For 2025, we are initiating operating earnings guidance of $2.64 to $2.74 per share. And we are increasing our dividend to $1.60 per share, keeping our payout ratio in line with the 60% we have communicated as part of our capital allocation policy. The top-line results make it clear 2024 was a successful year. In slide five, more extensively highlights all of the ways in which our execution set us up for continued service to our customers, communities, and stakeholders, checking all of the boxes that we laid out this time last year. For instance, we invested $7.5 billion of capital executing within 1% of our guidance even with substantial reductions at ComEd as we work to gain approval of our refiled. We are earning 9.1% return on equity despite a large portion of our rate base awaiting updated rate recovery and significant storm and weather headwinds. We executed on our financing plan and continued to see strong. This year, as you will hear more from Jean, our organization remained laser-focused on cost. Having identified dozens of initiatives that support $100 million of sustainable savings and many more that we continue to pursue with our dedicated team. It is a key contributor to our year-over-year growth in O&M of just half a percent. But beyond managing our costs, affordability remains a top priority into 2025, and our customers anchor our focus as we engage with policymakers. I will return to this topic in my closing remarks. I am so proud of all that our 20,000 employees were able to accomplish this year. And I thank them for their commitment no matter the circumstances. And that starts with job one, of safely keeping the lights on and the gas flowing. Which I will cover on the next slide. Now, as I mentioned, was another top decile year for ComEd and Pepco Holdings, from an outage frequency and outage duration perspective. And BGE and PECO also attained top quartile. This was no small feat. And particularly at ComEd, which faced an unprecedented set of storms in July that produced 43 tornadoes. More than that region sees in an entire year. While also receiving the Reliability One Award for outstanding performance in the Midwest. On the gas side, our hardworking employees at BGE, PECO, and Pepco Holdings also delivered top decile performance across the board for the entirety of 2024. The fourth year in a row that all three have achieved top decile. This sustained operational excellence is where our investments translate to real customer value. Importantly, our employees achieved these results with a strong focus on safety. Ending the year with top quartile performance on serious injury incident rate. Now any safety incident is one too many. So we continue to build out our observational tools and procedures to improve. Lastly, our customer satisfaction scores remain consistent with the levels seen throughout the third quarter with ComEd and PECO in the first quartile and BGE and Pepco Holdings in the second quartile. With the onset of our first colder than normal winter, in a number of years, at higher energy supply costs, we recognize that affordability remains a critical aspect of the customer experience. To further improve performance at BGE and Pepco Holdings, they are expanding efforts to enhance customer support in partnership with our communities. BGE and Pepco Holdings are waiving late payment fees in the winter months and suspending non-payment disconnects, extending the length of payment arrangements where needed. We are also continuing to focus on empowering our customers to access digital tools and strategies to conserve energy during high usage months. Now we took similar actions during the pandemic. Our customers can count on us to proactively take measures when needed to balance affordability while ensuring a safe, reliable, resilient grid is critical to our communities and our economy. We look forward to continuing to collaborate with our stakeholders to expand our solution set for customers. I will now turn the call to Jean to recap our 2024 financial performance and provide details on our updated long-term plan. Jean?
Jean: Thank you, Calvin, and good morning, everyone. I want to shout out our PECO employees and all Eagle fans as well, and I will just say go birds. But with that being said, today, I will cover our fourth quarter and full-year results, key regulatory developments, and updates to our financial disclosures, including 2025. Starting on Slide seven, as Calvin noted, we delivered strong financial results for the third year in a row, earning $2.45 per share on a GAAP basis and $2.50 per share on a non-GAAP basis. Results that are at the top end of our guidance range and result in 6% growth off the midpoint of our guidance range for 2023. For the quarter, Exelon Corporation earned $0.64 per share on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Year earnings benefited from ComEd's rehearing order we received in April. We also managed costs across the platform well, as we offset another year of mild winter weather and higher storm activity while ensuring we could accommodate a range of outcomes. Quarter-to-date and year-to-date drivers relative to the prior year can be found on appendix slides thirty-five and thirty-six.
Jean: Turning to our outlook for 2025 on slide eight. We are initiating operating earnings guidance of $2.64 to $2.74 per share. With new rates in effect across nearly all of our jurisdictions, furthering continued investment for our customers, 2025 earnings growth relative to the midpoint of our 2024 estimated guidance range is in line with previous disclosures. We look ahead to the first quarter, we expect the relative EPS contribution to full-year earnings to be higher than historical patterns, approximately 33% of the midpoint of our projected full-year earnings guidance range. This accounts for the cold starts of the year, new rates in effect, anticipated shaping of costs and ComEd revenue timing, and assumes normal weather and storm conditions for the balance of the quarter. Turning to slide nine, as Calvin mentioned, we successfully closed out a busy regulatory calendar in 2024. Reaching final resolution on key rate cases that provide supportive cost recovery for the next several years. Starting with Pepco, on November 26th, the DC Public Service Commission issued a final order on Pepco's climate-ready pathway DC multiyear plan. Providing for $123.4 million incremental revenue requirement and a 9.5% ROE through 2026. Advancing the shared interest in supporting the district's energy goals. As part of the order, the commission initiated a lessons learned process to evaluate the learnings from DC's experience with multiyear plans thus far and to formalize the adoption of regulations for alternative forms of rate making. We are looking forward to participating in the process, which your final work group report for the first phase is due by the end of 2025. Moving on to PECO, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved the joint petitions for settlement in PECO's electric and gas rate cases on December 12th. The approved settlements allow for a $354 million electric revenue requirement increase, excluding a one-time credit of $64 million in 2025, and a $78 million gas revenue requirement increase in 2025. Providing the funding necessary to further enhance reliability, enable cleaner energy options, and improve the level of service customers have come to expect. Last, on December 19th, the Illinois Commerce Commission approved ComEd's refiled grid plan and rate plan adjustments. Providing recovery for a level of investment that will allow us to serve customers safely and reliably while making progress on the goals of Cijia. Relative to 2023 rates in effect, the final order provides for an approximate revenue requirement increase of $1 billion from 2024 through 2027, inclusive of the increases that were approved in the December 2023 order. As a reminder, the construct allows for the recovery of prudently incurred investment expenses of up to 105% of the approved revenue requirement. Certain investment categories, such as storms and new business, recoverable independent of the 105% threshold. With these final orders, close to 90% of our rate base has established rate mechanisms in place through 2026 or 2027, allowing us to focus on plan execution and the strategic engagement necessary to support growing electrification needs and promote expansion of reliable generation in our states. There are currently two Pepco Holdings base rate cases open. Delmarva Power filed its gas distribution base rate case in the third quarter. Seeking to recover continued reliability investments, including pipeline integrity management, aging pipe upgrades, and upgrades to its LNG plant. With the expectation of implementing interim rates on April 20th subject to refund. Atlantic City Electric also filed its base distribution rate case on November 21st. Seeking recovery for grid improvement and modernization work supporting New Jersey's energy mass act. ACE has requested an increase of $108.9 million with the expectation of implementing interim rates on August 21st subject to refund. Finally, in Maryland, we continue to work to close out open reconciliations from our first BGE and Pepco Maryland multiyear plan. And we remain engaged in the lessons learned process for multiyear plans as we approach our next rate case filings in Maryland. For our final briefs in December, we continue to advocate for multiyear plans as the appropriate rate structure to direct the increasing investment needed to support a reliable twenty-first-century grid while offering specific options to address stakeholder feedback on ways to improve upon the first set of multiyear plans. Moving to Slide ten, we provide our updated utility CapEx and rate-based outlook through 2028. We plan to spend approximately $9.1 billion in 2025 and a total of $38 billion over the next four years. An increase of $3.5 billion from the prior four-year planning period which reflects greater investments to support our jurisdictions and updates to align with recently approved rate cases and jurisdictional priorities.
Jean: Of the overall increase, over 80% is attributable to incremental transmission capital. Such investment is driven by the structural trends that underpin the energy transformation in our jurisdiction and increased demand for high voltage investments to support high-density load growth, expanding and modernizing generation supply stack, and the reliability and resiliency needs of grid customers. Over $1 billion of that transmission increase is projected at ComEd where we see continued commitments from data centers and other high-density load customers and interest continues to grow in our other jurisdictions as well. Serving this new business will also require additional investment in the distribution network. The balance of the additional transmission relates to continued capacity expansion across our platform, including an additional year of investment in our two largest transmission projects. One, supporting the retirement of the Brandon Shores coal plant and the other, the Tri-County line, to address reliability needs due to load growth in the region. As a reminder, the Brandon Shores project is expected to go into service in 2028, while the Tri-County will go into service at various points in 2029 and 2030. As we continue to allocate relatively more spend to longer-dated transmission projects, our annualized rate base growth of 7.4% over the next four years remains fairly consistent plan over plan. With the projected addition of nearly $20 billion from 2024 to 2028.
Jean: As the next slide shows, we feel confident about our ability to meet economic and energy goals, which rely more than ever on a safe, secure, and resilient grid. As you will see on slide eleven, Exelon Corporation has an unmatched platform to meet the clear need for transmission investment. The proliferation of high-density load, increased. We serve more customers than anyone else, and we are one of the largest investors in transmission among our peers. With award-winning reliability, our utilities are uniquely positioned to capitalize on the transmission opportunities beyond our existing 11,000 miles today. Beyond the $12.6 billion transmission capital in our plan, we estimate $10 billion to $15 billion of transmission opportunity within our footprint in the next five to ten years. This includes over $1 billion of additional investment to support new high-density load which is in our pipeline but not yet in our guidance. Due to its earlier stages of design and planning or estimated online dates. This website also includes investments to address teams between PJM and other regions such as the work associated with MISO Tranche 2.1. Which we are optimistic will result in at least $1 billion of spend in our ComEd service territory through PJM's supplemental spending process. Our involvement in those projects also creates opportunity to be a part of the competitive processes for the $6 billion of work MISO estimates it will bid out. And we continue to see more of a need than ever for new generation particularly to ensure our states can meet their policy goals. Transmission interconnections are needed to deliver that power to customers. No matter where it is situated or how it is generated. In fact, achieving CJIS goals amid growing economic development in Illinois will likely require significant transmission investment. All of this work complements the continued need for reliability and resilience investment in our existing infrastructure to modernize aging lines, ensure better security, and harden critical infrastructure. In 2019, PJM found that two-thirds of the transmission system in its footprint were over forty years old, with one-third exceeding fifty years and some lower voltage transmission assets nearing ninety years. It is clear that there is no shortage of need to invest to serve our customers and communities well beyond our four-year plan. With some of the best-run utilities in the country, we are well-positioned to execute these opportunities while prioritizing reliability, resiliency, and affordability. Moving to slide twelve, our dedication to operational excellence encompasses a commitment to customer affordability, ensuring we deliver above value at the low average rate. Ability to deploy $38 billion of capital for the benefit of our customers over the next four years. This focus is saving our customers approximately five fifty standard inflation level over the last decade. And we feel confident we can continue to keep our expense growth similarly limited over a planning horizon with an institutionalized team and culture committed to delivering value even when our jurisdictions look to expand ways in which we can support them. As we have mentioned, we have taken advantage of our exclusive focus on energy delivery to standardize and streamline our organizational structure and operations. In 2024, this has resulted in approximately $100 million in executed sustainable savings initiatives with line of sight to many more opportunities to ensure we can keep raising the bar for the value we provide our customers. Operating as one Exelon Corporation has helped to identify unique and impactful opportunities. Like our cross-company project to identify best practices amongst our frontline distribution employees. This discipline further enhances the value of our investments. Which have improved reliability by 35% since 2016. Achieving some of the best reliability metrics in the industry while also maintaining bill metrics that are 19% to 21% below US averages makes it clear we are delivering above-average performance at below-average rates. Turning to slide thirteen, with $38 billion of projected capital spend driving 7.4% rate base growth, along with earning ROEs of 9% to 10%, we are projecting compounded annual earnings growth of 5% to 7% from our 2024 guidance midpoint of $2.45 per share. Maintaining our commitment to transparency, we have provided assumptions associated with our expected annual growth and earnings through 2028 on appendix slide eighteen. As you can see on the slide, after 2024, we expect to deliver each year within the 5% to 7% range. Keeping us on track to deliver at midpoint or better of our 5% to 7% annualized growth rate from 2025 to 2028.
Jean: We also continue to project an approximate 60% dividend payout of operating earnings with the dividend now projected to grow in the lower end of our long-term earnings target as we retain more of our capital to invest more efficiently for our customers. For 2025, we anticipate paying out a dividend of $1.60 per share representing 5.2% growth over last year. Finally, I will conclude with a review of our balance sheet and financing expectations on slide fourteen. Maintaining a strong balance sheet continues to be core to our strategy and we closed out another year with average credit metrics comfortably exceeding our downgrade thresholds of 12% at Moody's and S&P. We are pleased to receive an upgrade from S&P last week which takes Exelon Corporation's corporate credit rating up to triple B plus from triple B. We have updated our slides to reflect this improvement along with the revised downgrade threshold of 13% at S&P that is reflective of the higher credit rating. With most investment plans and recovery mechanisms established over the next two to three years, our balanced funding strategy in place we anticipate our metrics approaching 14% by the end of our forecast. Demonstrating our commitment to maintaining a strong balance sheet. As a reminder, we continue to advocate for language that incorporates repairs for calculating the corporate alternative minimum tax in the final treasury regulations. So our plan incorporates the assumption that the final regulations will not allow for repairs. Implemented in a way that mitigates the cash impact, we would expect an increase of approximately fifty basis points to our consolidated metrics on average over the plan. From a financing perspective, we expect the $38 billion capital plan to be supported by $20 billion of internally generated cash flow, $12 billion of debt at the utilities, and $3 billion of debt at the holding company, with the balance funded with a modest amount of equity. Specifically, we expect 40% of our incremental capital will be funded with equity, bringing our total equity needs to $2.8 billion over the four-year plan. Implying approximately $700 million of equity per year.
Jean: Our financial plan has also been designed to accommodate the use of other fixed concert securities that receive equity credit in place of senior debt at our holding company. In addition to other credit-supported internal levers, these instruments provide a more efficient means of building additional financial flexibility while ensuring we deliver at the midpoint or better of our 5% to 7% annualized earning growth rate range through 2028. I want to close by reiterating our confidence not only in the plan we have laid out but in the broader opportunity we have to deliver value for our customers and our shareholders. Not just now, but in the decades to come. Thank you. I will now turn the call back to Calvin for his closing remarks.
Calvin Butler: Thank you, Jean. I will review our focus areas in 2025 before stepping back and reminding you what makes Exelon Corporation unique. As a key partner in our jurisdictions, as an employer, and as an investment. As I mentioned when I started the call, this business has always been about our customers. It was when Rembrandt Peale lit the first gas lamp in the streets of Baltimore in 1816. Ultimately, incorporating what became BGE, our nation's first gas company. It was when Exelon Corporation was formed twenty-five years ago, creating the foundation for the network of wires and pipes that now delivers energy to more than 10.7 million customers today. So you can expect us to continue to focus on an equitable and balanced energy transition. For the first time in decades, we have an opportunity to serve a growing load base for which we have already seen our jurisdictions compete successfully. But the magnitude of load growth we are seeing requires us to think differently about our approach to energy supply. Over a period of limited load growth, competitive markets have been able to save customers billions of dollars annually while delivering adequate supply. However, it is clear as we face rapid and significant load growth we need enhanced solutions at PJM. And we also need other approaches complementary to PJM that meet those evolving customer needs as cost-effectively as possible. We have been actively working with stakeholders on solutions to the higher energy supply prices that they face. Slide twenty-one in the appendix outlines our positions and priorities as we work actively with policymakers at the federal, RTO, and state levels. Indeed, we are consulting with stakeholders on no less than forty-five bills across our jurisdictions that impact supply or demand-side solutions in some way. Regardless, it is clear that states are and should be proactively involved in supply solutions that complement the markets. Not to mention pursuing policies that enable more demand-side solutions. There is no single answer to meeting the levels of load growth that are anticipated. But instead, a variety of solutions across regulated and merchant participants is necessary. We are committed to working collaboratively to support policies that ensure energy security as quickly and cost-effectively as possible. And in the meantime, we remain highly focused on all of the other ways in which we support customer affordability, areas in which we have and will continue to excel. This includes continued vigilance on cost, with our size, scale, and culture keeping cost growth well below inflation. It includes ENERGY STAR award-winning efficiency programs which save customers an estimated $18 per month in 2024. Third, our robust efforts to connect distributed resources allowing customers an opportunity to generate their own power and save money from 4.2 gigawatts of generation. And finally, our innovative tools and processes to connect customers to low-income energy assistance, which totaled $500 million in 2024. These efforts only increased the value of our product. Which we are delivering at top quartile or better levels and which we can only achieve with an employee base that can count on us to engage them. In doing all of this right, develop them, and send them home safely. We will execute on our financial plan deploying $9.1 billion this year to support our customers that will earn a consolidated 9% to 10% operating return on equity from fair rate case outcomes that align with our stakeholders on how we invest customer dollars. Dollars which flow right back into their communities to drive increased economic opportunity. We expect to deliver on our operating earnings guidance of $2.64 to $2.74 per share as always with the goal of being the midpoint and better. And lastly, we will execute on the financing plan that we laid out. Allowing us to maintain a strong balance sheet and support the grid our customers expect and deserve. These priorities are aligned with the pillars of our value prop which we use as our north stars to ensure that the entire Exelon Corporation organization is working together to create value for customers, employees, and shareholders. You can see we already lead the industry in so many ways across these areas, whether it is the number of customers served, the award-winning and innovative service we provide them, or the consistent top quartile reliability. Or the innumerable recognitions we receive as an employer of choice.
Calvin Butler: And we are a company that does what it says. Consistently delivering against our financial commitments in a manner that reflects strong alignment between our customers, policymakers, and shareholders on the value created by our investments. With these investments delivering 5% to 7% annualized growth, and a dividend yield of around 4%, we offer an extremely attractive risk-adjusted return of 9% to 11% which translates to consistent growth long-term value. Michelle, we can now open it up for questions.
Operator: Thank you. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one one on your telephone keypad. And our first question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore. Your line is open.
Durgesh Chopra: Good morning, guys. Hello. Good morning.
Calvin Butler: Good morning, Calvin. Ginkgo Burks. Goldberg.
Durgesh Chopra: Hey. Listen. So just I had a couple of questions.
Durgesh Chopra: First, just in Maryland, a little bit more color there. So what are you expecting out of the reconciliation decision? How is that going to impact your future rate case filings? And then implications to your financial plan. We are getting a lot of questions around that. So maybe just a little bit more color as to how you are thinking about.
Calvin Butler: Yeah. Absolutely, Trish. Let me first take it, and then I will also offer it up to Mike or Jean if they have any color to add. Let me be very clear that we believe the process is moving forward at a decent pace. What has been very evident is that we have shared with the commission and all stakeholders that we do believe that the costs that were incurred were prudent. And we are provided evidence and supporting that effort. And if you even look at what others have come forward and saying, I do not think there is anyone questioning those costs of what has been incurred. Now we are just moving forward in the process and the evidence being done and letting it play out, but it has been a very collaborative process to date. Mike, anything to add there?
Mike Innocenzo: Then we I would just say that we firmly believe that we have offered a structure that gives predictability to customers, helps us lower costs for customers, and gives a good solid financial return for our shareholders as well.
Jean: Yeah. And I will just add, I guess, you know, on the reconciliation the procedural schedule takes us, you know, probably first half of this year. So in the first quarter or second quarter, we expect an outcome there. As Calvin mentioned, Yep. All prudent, reasonable cost. You know, when we have first initial rounds of testimony, proposals from staff and others were in line with prior reconciliations. And much of that reconciliation was actual structural issues, things that we saw in the first two reconciliations. So continue to move that forward. And then on the lessons learned, I think just reiterating what Mike and Calvin said, but also, you know, the multiyear plans, what we highlighted from our perspective is that you know, multiyear plans have provided you know, strong alignment with state policy and alignment of what we are investing while also keeping our distribution rates in the first quartile. So it has been a good mechanism in terms of delivering, but also keeping the distribution rates competitive. And multiyear plans are not unique to Maryland. Two-thirds of jurisdictions use them or some similar type of sharing mechanism. We like the three-year time frame, but are flexible on that. And I think there is a lot to be said about historic Tish years, you know, honestly creating more work and being less effective on the cost control. And that is the piece that I think is so important right now. If you think about affordability, if you think about delivering value for the cost customers, when you have a forward-looking plan, the ability to lock in long-term contracts. The ability to align your workforce, the ability to plan ahead, is what allows a company like Exelon Corporation to deliver that O&M growth rate of two to two and a half percent in a period of rising inflation. So we think these types of mechanisms provide a lot of benefits, which is what we continue to highlight in that lesson learned. We also expect the lessons learned to be completed in the first half of this year, and then we would, you know, kind of have that clarity moving forward for our next rate.
Durgesh Chopra: That is very helpful. We will look for those data points in the first half. Thank you. Then just switching gears, a lot of focus also on the two zero five with FERC. Are there any discussions with maybe just update us when your what your latest costs are with stakeholders and what to expect as, you know, the twenty-fourth, the February twenty-fourth data soon approaching?
Calvin Butler: Absolutely. I have Colette Honorable, who is our chief legal officer. Here with us. Colette, if you would like to lean into that.
Colette Honorable: Thank you, and thank you for the question. As you may be aware, we are still awaiting a decision. And to your point, we continue to talk with a number of stakeholders, including PJM, to find forward-looking solutions that work well for our customers and for investors. We are awaiting a decision in the two zero five docket and we hope to get a good result. We have been a leader on these issues and bringing issues around resource adequacy and energy security to the forefront. We appreciate the leadership from our states, from our governors. We appreciate the way that PJM has been leaning in with a number of proposals and reforms. And if I might mention for your edification, we received a word from FERC of two approvals of reform efforts. One relating to shovel-ready projects that is in docket ER twenty-five seven twelve. Really making sure that objects that are shovel-ready are moving to the forefront. We were very supportive of that reform. And then in ER twenty-five seven seventy-eight, the surplus interconnection service docket, which really helps to ensure that it is easier to add more generation to existing sites for generators. That one was approved as well. So we are seeing FERC being helpful here. We are going to continue to lean in and lead and we are hopeful about a positive result in the two zero five and are also at the same time continuing to work to engage with stakeholders. These customers are presenting us. If you heard from Calvin and Jean, with unprecedented load growth needs, and that creates unprecedented opportunity. So we will continue to work with all involved in a way that meets the needs of our customers, focuses on energy security and affordability while protecting the interest of investors.
Durgesh Chopra: Got it. Thank you, though. Great. Thank you. Yep. Thanks so much. Appreciate the time.
Calvin Butler: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Nicholas Campanella with Barclays. Your line is open.
Nicholas Campanella: Good morning. Thank you. Morning. Everyone is doing well. So hey, just one quick clarification. Slide eighteen, just when we think about the growth into twenty-seven, that just year over year of prior year twenty-six midpoint? Is that the way to think about that? You could comment on that? Yep. Yeah. That is the way to think about it.
Jean: We just we try to give you kind of the year over year. We always go back to the midpoint of guidance. So if you are thinking about this slide in totality, right, this is really about how do you grow, how does that fund grow from 2024 midpoint of $2.45 through 2028 on a year-by-year basis such that we get to that midpoint or better of the 5% to 7% over that four-year period.
Nicholas Campanella: Thank you very much. And then I know legislation has been kind of a priority in Maryland from stakeholders, and I was wondering if you can kind of comment on what you would kind of expect there, but also just your expectations in Pennsylvania as it relates to, you know, solving for, you know, a generation and rate-based solution or some type of other capacity arrangement with the state that could alleviate the congestion there. Thank you.
Calvin Butler: Yeah. No problem, Nick. I will start off, and then I with me Karim Kusami, who is the CEO of BGE. And, of course, we have Dave Velasquez with us as well who is the CEO of PECO that can add on. But let me just share with you, as I said in my opening statement, we have over forty-five bills that we are actively working across all of our jurisdictions. All with the focus on ensuring affordability energy security, and adequate generation. I mean, that is resource adequacy in those lines. Is first and foremost. Having said that, several pieces of legislation propose changes to regulatory and planning process including implementing distributed distribution planning, expedited review of certain clean energy generation, and creating a new integrated resource planning office. And by our footprint, we are looking at best practices that are being suggested in one jurisdiction, and how do we employ that or share that information with our other jurisdictions. So I am going to stop there and let Kareem talk about what is happening in Maryland, where I think there are over twenty bills to date that you are tracking.
Karim Kusami: There it is, Calvin, and thank you, and good morning, everyone. I would just echo what Calvin said. Right now, Indianapolis here in Maryland, there is a lot of attention being made on how do we deal with the resource adequacy issue energy security issue here in Maryland. As a reminder, Maryland currently imports about forty percent of its power from out of state. That is something that the legislation, the governor, and many others are very focused on trying to see what we can do to incent generation to be built in-state. The approach that is being taken is more of an all-of-the-above approach. They are looking at various different fuel types, various different ways to incent, to try to get generation built here in the next few years, that we can increase the amount of in-state capacity. As BGE and Pepco Holdings, we are very involved in all those discussions. We are very supportive. We agree with the state that we need to build more in-state generation to relieve some of the pressures that we have from on the supply side of the bill. So, again, that is something that we are looking at tracking closely and working closely with all stakeholders. And if you also asked about Pennsylvania, I know there are two active bills currently addressing the resource adequacy. Issue. And Dave Velasquez, you want to share your thoughts?
Dave Velasquez: Yes. This is Dave. Good morning, everybody. PA at like other states like Maryland, has been very active. You have seen that PUC sell technical conferences on this issue. As you know, Governor Shapiro has been very active in working with PJM to address this issue and all the companies. In Pennsylvania as well have been active in trying to work with all the stakeholders to come up with I will say, alternatives if necessary to the PJM capacity markets to ensure that you know, we continue to have adequate generation. And you know, some of the things that have been mentioned do include longer-term contracts, they include utility build. Some of those things will require legislation. And I think it will be an active session legislatively around those issues as well as both in the house and senate, lawmakers are concerned about some of the same issues.
Nicholas Campanella: Got it. Okay. More to come there. Really appreciate it. Thank you.
Calvin Butler: No problem, Nick. Thank you. Thanks.
Operator: And our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey. Good morning, team. Good catch. I appreciate it. Hey.
Calvin Butler: Appreciate it. Go birds there. Just coming back a couple of different things here real quickly. Absolutely. Hey. Just with respect to the I know your guest trying to get at this a second ago about the prospects, but just to say it explicitly, how do you think about settlement abilities here? I mean, I know there are a few different dockets few different, efforts afoot with respect to teaching policy and colocation. Is there an ability to settle that out and kind of sidestep maybe a more protracted effort considering that that, you know, there is all this discussion about the time of the hour? And then related to I will sort it in the same time tied to data centers. How do you think about these deposits here in as much as that seems like a wider industry trend and certainly as an offset to rate base growth and certainly could accelerate through the course of this year. So is there any kind of heuristic you would offer as you could see some developments on data centers and how much that could.
Calvin Butler: Thank you, Julian. Let me make sure I captured the essence of the two-part question. One was talking about settlements as it relates to activity that may be going on at for the FERC level and so forth. And the second was really focusing in on deposits that customers are giving around data center growth and if can that spur additional development and growth moving forward. On the first piece, let me just share, and then I am going to turn this to Jean, is that we always are looking out for the best interest of our customers and having active discussions with all parties involved. We are never going to believe that we always are sitting back and cannot come to some type of resolution. And keep moving it forward. But we have some tenants that we are holding on to because it is around affordability for our customers and that the grid is being shared by everyone, so everyone should bear some of those. So having said that, I am going to turn it to Jean to give you any additional insight.
Jean: Yeah. I think on the first one, Julian, I was just you know, like, you the word settlement is used, but I think of it more as, like, do we partner with stakeholders? Absolutely. So all you know, the two o fives were about seeking clarity in a point where there were differing views on network load and other things. And so getting those two o fives was about getting clarity while this concept is discussed. Right? And so do we want to work with stakeholders in thinking about what is the right tariff, whether it is the state or federal level. Sure. But the two o fives are around seeking clarity and getting certainty. So that if someone was looking for certainty today, that is the fastest path. Right? While that is being discussed at PJM or with our states as it relates to large load. And then on the deposits, yeah, we are seeing meaningful deposits come in as we see meaningful load growth. You look at ComEd, for example, in our drivers tables, you can see large our large consumer or our C and I class growing 4% of weather normal year over year. It is real. Right? And so as that load comes into the service territory, driving up capital investment, but also we get those deposits to protect our other customers, to make sure that the load shows up. When you look at twenty-four rate bases to give you a sort of size of impact, our 2024 rate base was around $400 million lower, so relative to our last disclosure. The large majority of that was deposits. And so to your point, it does reduce rate base, but that but it is all a good thing. Right? It is good for our customers that we are protecting them with the deposit, and it is a signal that there is more investment that we need to do to accommodate this new load which is really exciting. Right? We also added a disclosure in the back that shows our historical load while growth was growing our net load was declining due to energy efficiency and solar, you know, things and investments. Now you look forward, our gross end net load is growing somewhere between 1% to 2%. So exciting development in terms of economic development, but the deposits, that is how they show up and that is kind of the order of magnitude we saw in twenty-four as an example.
Calvin Butler: And, Julian, if I can add something to Jean, we shared with you on our last call that we do not even put anything into our LRPRR forecast. Until certain actions are taken by these developers. One, we look at the purchase of real estate. Two, we look at, hey, are you putting in in the game in terms of developing plans? Or three, putting down a deposit. And then and only then do you see us actively start integrating this into our plan. And that is why you see the load growth that we have projected to you, that we have shown on the slides really adding up, because once they put those take some action actionable steps, we then include it into our plan.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Right. They basically said, for as much as you might see an acceleration in these deposits over the course of this year as some of this load materializes. You may very well see a corresponding increase or even net increase through the forward forecast period. As that loan, but this is it is subsequently incorporated in your forecast. So no net decline here. You are actually including the future CapEx opportunity in parallel with those deposits. So you should not necessarily see this being any kind of reduction to the course here. You have not gotten ahead of yourself in including that load. It will happen in parallel. Mhmm. Okay. Excellent.
Jean: Awesome. And does it speak to any greater confidence of these data points that you are again, I know that there have not been any kind of flashy, you know, data center press release, shall we say. But these deposits presumably bode well and favorably for ongoing activities here. Should we expect any kind of more explicit disclosures as we go work our way through the course of this year, especially given some of these, as you say, fruitful deposits here.
Jean: Yeah. We do have one side where we try to put, you know, kind of our recent wins. So at slide nineteen, in the appendix where you can see some of the recently announced data center projects. That, you know, typically the operating company or the company does do a press release on. But we tried to give you some insight here. You can see we have over two hundred online data centers today. I talked about ComEd year-over-year growth. But if you look at the chart on that slide and the top left, you can also see just in the last couple of years, we have had a 24% CAGR over the last couple of years in terms of megawatts online. So it is real in terms of the number of data centers online in our territories. Real when you look at the load year over year on a weather normal basis. And it is real when you look at the pipeline that we see growing and it is Calvin mentioned, it is a pipeline that we only talk about you know, ones that are what we would consult call greater than 80% probable because of the financial commitments that they have made. So it is an exciting time. I think it is we see this trend continuing. But I think, you know, we are going to be prudent about it and always focus on affordability and think about our other ten and a half million customers too, and that is where something like the deposits, you know, shows up and our activity at FERC as we think about just an equitable transition to this higher load growth as well.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Thank you guys very much. See you soon.
Operator: Thank you, sir. And our next question will come from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe. Your line is open.
Steve Fleishman: Hey, Steve. Yeah. Hey. Thanks. Hi. Good morning. So just maybe following up on that last topic a little bit. The I guess, specifically, this is a topic in the Illinois grid plan on large loads. Could you give us and I think they kind of pulled out the capital for that. But what you are expecting, can you give us maybe some info on what you have for the Illinois large loads in the capital plan? And then related, yes, go with that first here.
Jean: Oh, sure. Okay. So yeah. So on the group plan, all distribution, and what we had there about four hundred a little over four hundred million of capital that was not approved. But in the remarks on the grid plan, you know, they commented, right, that this can be fully reconcilable through the annual reconciliation should ComEd forecast be correct, which we believe it is. And so that is sort of the magnitude on the district distribution side. And then when you look at on the transmission side, ComEd was up about a billion dollars plan over plan on the transmission side relative, and it is really driven by this high dense load and the megawatts that we see coming online in the service territory.
Steve Fleishman: And is there a way to related to that, is there a way to take some of the data center gigawatt data that you are giving and tie it into some level of CapEx take a water. I know that is everything is different, but just is there some.
Jean: Yeah. It is in to your point because every project is different. Of course, we always try to do it in the most efficient way. So we work with our customers to say, how much do you need? Where do we have capacity? And so there could be very minimal investment need as we work to sort of find those sweet spots for our customers when we think about our entire customer base. And then, you know, there are others that depending on their ramp and how much they need and where they want to be located. There could be, you know, capital investment needed. So hard to do a rule of thumb. I would say, again, that is why we kind of always point back to just the percentage of transmission as we think about the four-year plan and how that shows up. And, again, you know, three and a half billion for this four-year period, 80% of that is transmission. Really driven by these high-density load centers coming in and the economic development we are seeing across the territories.
Steve Fleishman: Okay. One last question. Just the new FERC chair Christie was, I think, quoted last week saying you would have more clarity on their policy on the colocation in the near future. Do you think that will be in your two zero five case or what of the several cases is the likely forum to have clarity?
Calvin Butler: Yes, Steve. And to your point, I think clarity is the keyword there and what we are driving for and seeking. And Colette and her team are working regularly with her and others. So Colette, would you like to elaborate?
Colette Honorable: Thank you. Good morning, Steve. We too are interested in this clarity, so we are pleased to see the chairman now and, you know, a month plus in the role. Really focusing on this. Look, the great news is that we are all focused on this issue. We all recognize this time we are in, and we all want to be prepared to meet the demands of our customers and the needs of all of our customers as quickly as we can. So as we mentioned earlier, the decision on the two zero five could be anytime, but by February twenty-fourth, so it could be as soon as that. And there could be some decision on any of the other pending documents. We are looking forward to getting the clarity, and more importantly, you can count on us to continue engaging. This is an exciting time. And we look forward to supporting our customers, all of them, today and in the future.
Steve Fleishman: Great. Thank you very much.
Calvin Butler: Thank you, Steve.
Operator: And our last question will come from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open.
Shar Pourreza: Hey, guys. Good morning. Morning, Calvin. Just look like I am hey, Jean. Just real quick. I know there is a lot going on this morning, but just a question on CMC and the status of it. Is there any sort of progress of conversations with IPA and other stakeholders on manage that roll-off? Anything we should be watching, I guess, in the coming months from the public side that could indicate progress, legislative solution, as the governor involved, etcetera. Thanks. Team, please. Yeah. I think, you know, Illinois is just like all of our other.
Jean: States. Right? As they think about energy security, you know, the CMCs are a unique thing for sure. Right? And they go through twenty-seven, which has actually quite nice when you think about the next capacity auction being coming in prior to that. But, you know, the CMCs are not a perfect hedge either. Right? They are more so on the energy side and less on the capacity. So our customers in ComEd are already seeing some of that capacity increase. During this time period. But I guess, you know, from our perspective, perspective, we look at it no different than any of our states and how we are leaning into the energy legislation to provide solutions. You know, Illinois is unique in that they have the IPA, and so they will do their thing, and they will think about how they want to procure. But we will be there to, you know, help support from a customer lens perspective and do all, you know, everything we can to ensure that you know, what we are looking for, what our customers need is definitely, you know, the reliable generation but stable and predictable energy and capacity prices that allow them, you know, to run their businesses and meet their homes and family needs. So I guess we just you know, Illinois is no different than the other states that we are working with. We have got to find solutions at PJM on the capacity market. Colette talked about that. We are very supportive of some of the solutions that they provided and pleased to see that FERC has already approved a couple of them. But we are also supporting our states, Illinois included, that are looking at a variety of options. It could be you know, looking at capacity obligation for a large load. It could be looking at state for procurement. It could be looking at you know, state integrated resource plans. So a lot of options on the table. But what we are most pleased about is those options are being considered and states are moving with a sense of urgency. And so Illinois, no different than the other states focused on this.
Shar Pourreza: Got it. And then just lastly, guys, thanks for fitting me in. We have not had an update on artificial island discussions with PSEG or CEG. Have you done any work on bill impact if artificial island went behind the meter for Atlantic City Electric customers? And if it is a side of the meter deal or a quasi front of the meter deal, how should we think about how quickly a DC can connect to that system? Thanks.
Jean: Yeah. I was we have not, you know, think in our two o fives, we had some examples of what the impact could be in terms of a cost allocation, and so I would just point to that. But at the end of the day, I will just reiterate we are not against per location. We are what we have always said is that the principles are we believe it is network load and that the right cost allocation should be in place. So not against it. It is not something that you know, as long as it is network load and we have the right cost allocation, you know, we are bringing, you know, some economic development to our service territory is always something we are supportive of.
Shar Pourreza: Got it. So I guess, Gina, the question is can you connect the DC pretty quickly on the Atlantic City Electric system. Is there any speed to market issues? Is there capacity there? Or do they have to sit on a long interconnection queue? Thanks. Like yeah. I mean, I would say I mean, it is specifically, it really depends upon what they are able to locate there. I think for all of our for all of our connections, wherever we are talking, whether it is artificial island or any with our system, we certainly look for where there is capacity look for the ramp up. We look to make sure that we do our studies as accelerated as possible to make sure that we understand the impacts. I would say in most, I will say more in general, in almost all of our discussions with our different customers that are coming to look to update decision we are almost always able to find a way that meets their time needs. Again, a lot of it gets into how much load, how quickly would they want to ramp up. And finding ways to work creatively with them and accommodate that.
Shar Pourreza: Fantastic. Thank you guys so much. Congrats, Calvin and Jean, on the results. Very good results.
Jean: Thank you, sir.
Operator: At this time, I would now like to turn the call back to Calvin Butler for closing remarks.
Calvin Butler: Thank you all again for your steady support of Exelon Corporation. I think Sharon captioned it when he congratulated Gina and I. Let me just congratulate the twenty thousand plus Exelon Corporation employees. Because of all the hard work you put in. 2024 was a successful year. We are very excited about the year ahead, which brings unprecedented opportunity for us to continue to lead this energy transformation with our jurisdictions and continue to provide long-term value for all stakeholders. We look forward to engaging with you in the months ahead. And, Michelle, that concludes our call.
Operator: Thanks to all of our participants for joining us today. This concludes our presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-10-30 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello and welcome to Exelon’s Third Quarter Earnings Call. My name is Gigi and I’ll be your event specialist today. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn today’s program over to Andrew Plenge, Vice President of Investor Relations. The floor is yours.
Andrew Plenge: Thank you, Gigi. Good morning, everyone. We’re pleased to have you with us for our 2024 third quarter earnings call. Leading the call today are Calvin Butler, Exelon’s President and Chief Executive Officer and Jeanne Jones, Exelon’s Chief Financial Officer. Other members of Exelon’s senior management team are also with us today, and they will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. Today’s presentation, along with our earnings release and other financial information can be found in the Investor Relations section of Exelon’s website. We would also like to remind you that today’s presentation and the associated earnings release materials contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. You can find the cautionary statements on these risks on Slide 2 of today’s presentation or in our SEC filings. In addition, today’s presentation includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations between these measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of our presentation and in our earnings release. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Calvin Butler, Exelon’s President and CEO.
Calvin Butler: Thank you, Andrew and good morning everyone. We appreciate you joining us for the call and are pleased to be reporting a solid quarter of earnings and operational performance, keeping us on track for another year of consistent and stable performance. We reported GAAP earnings of $0.70 per share and operating earnings of $0.71 per share, above the expectations shared on our second quarter call. We delivered another strong quarter of operations despite significant storm activity in July, with top quartile or better outage performance across the board. We have also made considerable progress on our 2024 regulatory calendar since the second quarter call. First, ComEd has now received its proposed order and its refiled multiyear rate plan. The order serves as another positive data point that ComEd has filed a compliant plan that appropriately balances the state’s desire to continue to deliver reliable and affordable power while making progress on its ambitious energy goals. We now await the commission’s final order and we look forward to regaining the momentum in establishing Illinois as a clear leader in the energy transition. We also reached settlements with key parties in our PECO gas and electric rate cases, which were recommended for approval by the administrative law judges presiding over this case. We appreciate the party’s interest in advancing the critical investments needed to maintain and improve safe and reliable service for PECO’s customers, playing a key role in the state’s economic development efforts. In the District of Columbia, we continue to anticipate an order by the end of the year, laying the groundwork for continued investment to support a climate-ready grid and the district’s clean energy goals. Finally, in September, Maryland initiated a lessons learned proceeding on multiyear plans, completing its hearings earlier this month. In those hearings, each of our Maryland utilities provided an extensive record of the ways in which multiyear rate plans are able to address the demands of a 21st century grid. And we are appreciative that a number of stakeholders, including large customers, chambers of commerce and contractors filed their support of the construct. But we also acknowledge ways in which we can address certain stakeholder concerns with the goal of continuously improving on the foundation of transparency and accountability on which the framework is built. A grid of the future cannot rely on the rate making of the past and ensuring we have alignment and transparency around our investment plans is critical to meeting our state’s energy goals, allowing us to execute as efficiently and effectively as possible on behalf of all of our customers. We remain optimistic that we’ll find alignment on a solution that can give us all the confidence to keep Maryland moving forward. Let me now turn to our operating highlights for the quarter. On Slide 5, you can see that we are achieving first quartile performance across most of our key indicators for safety, reliability and customer satisfaction. In both outage frequency and outage duration, ComEd and Pepco Holdings continued to perform at top decile levels. And that’s despite the powerful storms that swept the Chicago area in July and the significant mutual assistance extended throughout the quarter for Hurricanes Beryl and Helene with Hurricane Milton following directly afterwards. The storms that hit Illinois were record-breaking by a variety of measures. In just 2 days, the Chicago land area experienced double the number of tornadoes that it sees in an average year. And then some of those same crews, along with those at BGE, PECO and our Pepco Holdings utilities were part of more than 500 field and support personnel to aid in restoring service to customers in Florida, Georgia and West Virginia after a very challenging hurricane season. I do want to take a moment to personally thank our employees for their continued focus and dedication. The ability of our utilities to keep pace with the increasing severity and frequency of extreme weather events can only happen with the dedication of some of the best in the business and with the support of our jurisdictions, for the critical investments needed to maintain reliability and resiliency. As it pertains to safety, after three quarters of benchmarking against serious injury performance we now have all 4 utility operating companies in top quartile. The safety of our employees, contractors and customers is always our highest priority. Finally, on customer satisfaction, performance has improved since last quarter, with BGE now operating in second quartile alongside Pepco Holdings. Both utilities remain focused on initiatives to further improve performance, including enhancing customer communications, streamlining new business processes and additional customer service representative trainings. Now it’s my pleasure to turn the call over to Jeanne to cover our financial and regulatory update. Jeanne?
Jeanne Jones: Thank you, Calvin and good morning everyone. Today, I will cover our third quarter financial update along with our financial and regulatory outlook for the remainder of 2024. I will also spend some time highlighting a transmission project at Delmarva Power, which is helping to modernize the grid and accelerate an opportunity to save money for our customers. Starting on Slide 6, we present our quarter-over-quarter adjusted operating earnings block. For the third quarter of 2024, Exelon earned $0.71 per share compared to $0.67 per share in the third quarter of 2023 reflecting higher results of $0.04 per share over the same period. Earnings are higher in the third quarter relative to the same period last year, driven primarily by $0.04 of timing at ComEd on its distribution earnings. After removing the timing at ComEd across Exelon, we earned $0.03 of higher distribution and transmission rates net of associated depreciation, which was offset by $0.03 of higher interest expense. After accounting for the timing of ComEd driven in part by expensive mutual assistance provided to non-Exelon utilities, we delivered earnings results in line with the guidance we provided in our prior quarter call. Our year-to-date performance underscores our ability to deliver strong financial results despite mild weather and heightened storm activity throughout the year. As we close out the year in the fourth quarter, we remain on track to achieve operating earnings of $2.40 to $2.50 per share. Our fourth quarter guidance assumes a reversal of common distribution earnings timing, fair and reasonable outcomes for Pepco DC’s multiyear rate case as well as the BGE and ComEd reconciliations and normal weather and storm activity. In addition, we reaffirm our long-term annualized operating earnings per share guidance range of 5% to 7% through 2027 with the expectation to be at the midpoint or better of that growth range. Turning to Slide 7. As Calvin highlighted, we have made meaningful progress in our distribution rate cases across our jurisdictions, approaching the final milestones for ComEd’s, PECO’s and Pepco DCs open rate cases. We also filed a historical test year gas distribution rate case in Delaware. I’ll begin my remarks by providing an update on this most recent filing followed by status updates on the remaining rate cases anticipated to reach resolution this year. On September 20, Delmarva Power filed its gas distribution rate case seeking approval of a proposed $35.6 million revenue increase, exclusive of the transfer of $6.4 million of the distribution system improvement charges. The filing represents Delmarva Power’s work since its last gas rate adjustment filing in 2022 and reflects investments that help ensure customer reliability and improve service and safety, including work to inspect and proactively maintain natural gas mains, replacing aging cast iron and bare steel pipe and replace and upgrade equipment at our Wilmington LNG facility. The filing also requests the adoption of a weather normalization rider, which will offer customers more bill predictability as seasonal temperatures grow increasingly volatile. Continuing with Pepco Holdings on August 30, Pepco and other parties filed final brief on Pepco’s climate ready pathway DC multiyear plan, which outlays the investments we will make to support a climate-ready grid and enable cleaner energy programs and technologies. The plan also enhances the reliability, resiliency, and security of the local energy grid and expands affordability assistance for Pepco’s customers across the District of Columbia. We now await the DC Public Service Commission’s final order, which we anticipate before the end of the year and look forward to continuing the important work needed to enhance customer reliability, advancing economic and work development and further supporting the district goals to be carbon neutral by 2045. Turning to Pennsylvania. Administrative law judges have issued recommended decisions in the PECO gas and electric rate cases and we are pleased with the recommendation that the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission accept both settlements filed in August. The proposal for PECO’s electric rate case allows for a $354 million revenue requirement increase, excluding a one-time credit of $64 million in 2025. On the gas side, the ALJ proposed a $78 million revenue requirement increase in 2025. While the ALJ has ruled against the addition of a weather normalization adjustment, we have filed an exception to address the adjustment, which will now go for commission review and consideration. The adjustment, which has been approved for all other major Pennsylvania gas utilities, is intended to reduce the inherent volatility in customer bills and PECO’s recovery of distribution revenue. We expect the commission to issue its final orders by the end of December. Lastly, at ComEd, on October 18, the administrative law judge presiding over the case issued a proposed order on the revised grid plan for which we expect a final order from the Illinois Commerce Commission in December. The proposed order recommends the commission approved the revised grid plan and associated adjusted revenue requirements for 2024 through 2027 with a $637 million revenue requirement increase and a $3.9 billion rate base increase with the new rates in effect in January 2025. As a reminder, this construct allows for the recovery of prudently incurred investments up to 105% of the approved revenue requirement and provides that certain investment categories such as storms and new business are excluded from the 105% threshold. We are appreciative of the hard work put in by all parties to craft a compliant and balanced credit plan, which has resulted in strong alignment up through the proposed order and we look forward to the commission setting the path for the next 3 years of investments during a critical time in the industry. With final orders anticipated to be issued for ComEd, PECO and Pepco DC by year-end, approximately 90% of our rate base will have established rates for known rate mechanisms in place through 2026 or 2027, allowing us to focus on planned execution and the strategic discussions required to support growing electrification needs and the necessary expansion of clean, reliable generation in our states. As always, additional details on the rate cases can be found on Slides 20 to 30 of the appendix. That brings me to Slide 8, where I want to take a moment to highlight an example of the work we’ve been doing to modernize the transmission system. Earlier this year, Delmarva Power began work to rebuild the Vienna to Nelson 138 kV transmission line, a 14-mile circuit that extends from the Vienna substation in Dorchester County, Maryland to the Nelson substation in Sussex County, Delaware. The project replaces over 100 wooden 60-year-old structures with steel poles and upgrades our equipment to 230 kV standards. The new infrastructure will also be able to withstand wins over 110 miles per hour, is constructed above flood zones and includes an underground transmission lead-in, enhancing overall system resilience. Currently, the project is on track to be placed in service nearly 2 years ahead of schedule in December. Completion of the project will enable the Indian River 410-megawatt coal vile generating unit to retire, eliminating the collection of the RMR and saving nearly $100 million across 551,000 customers in that 2 years, which is over 1.5x greater than the installed cost of the project that will be collected over decades. Alongside lower bills, these customers will also experience better system reliability and resiliency from the elimination of capacity constraints. The project also emphasizes our commitment to workforce development with $13.5 million of the spend on the project with diverse suppliers, supporting local economic growth and partnership with the jurisdiction we serve. These efforts highlight our dedication to enhancing customer value while fostering local economic growth and they are a testament to our strategic efforts to maximize the impact of our investments, modernizing the energy grid, while mitigating resource adequacy constraints and supporting state goals to decarbonize, the project also highlights the power of our platform to efficiently execute on capital plans for the benefit of our customers. This is just one example of the $9.7 billion we have in our capital plan for electric transmission investment through 2027, and it highlights why transmission will continue to be an area of significant opportunity to support our customers going forward. Finally, I will conclude with updates on our financing activity on Slide 10. We continue to project a cushion of approximately 100 basis points on average over the planning period for our consolidated corporate credit metrics above the downgrade threshold of 12% specified by S&P and Moody’s, demonstrating our commitment to maintaining a strong balance sheet. And while we continue to advocate for language that incorporates – the corporate alternative minimum tax and the final treasury regulations, recall that our plan incorporates the assumption that the final regulations will not allow for repairs, consistent with the proposed guidance released in September. It’s implemented in a way that mitigates the cash impact we’d expect an increase of approximately 50 basis points to our consolidated metrics on average over the plan, putting us at the higher end of our targeted 100 to 200 basis points of cushion over the planning period. From a financing perspective, we have successfully completed all of our planned long-term debt financing needs for the year with PECO raising $575 million in the third quarter. The strong investor demand we continue to see for our debt offerings is supported by the strength of our balance sheet, combined the lowest attributes of our platform. Investor confidence in our offerings, along with our pre-issuance hedging program positions us well as we continue to seek out the most efficient ways to finance the energy transformation for our customers and investors. We’ve also successfully completed our planned $150 million of equity issuances for 2024 via our ATM. There has been no change in our guidance to issue a total of $1.6 billion of equity from 2024 to 2027 to fund our current $34.5 billion capital plan with the remaining balance expected to be issued ratably from 2025 to 2027, approximating $475 million on an annual basis. Thank you. And I’ll now turn the call back to Calvin for his closing remarks.
Calvin Butler: Thank you, Jeanne. As you can see, we’ve come a long way toward delivering on our priorities and commitments for 2024 with the team highly focused on continued execution and operational excellence as we approach the final months of the year. We have maintained top quartile performance despite a tremendous amount of storm activity this year. The bar keeps getting set higher and we keep meeting it. We are approaching final orders for ComEd and PECO with path towards reasonable supportive outcomes in both covering approximately 50% of our rate base with another approximately 40% covered by known or established ratemaking processes as far out as 2027. And we appreciate Maryland acting quickly to address its lessons learned process so that we can agree on an approach that allows all stakeholders input into how customer dollar should be invested to meet the state’s energy goals. We are on track to invest $7.4 billion of capital in 2024 for the benefit of our customers and earn a fair return on equity in our targeted 9% to 10% range, with our planned financings for the year already complete. This will allow us to deliver in the $2.40 and $2.50 operating earnings guidance range that we laid out at the beginning of the year. And most importantly, we have maintained our steadfast commitment to customer affordability both through cost and vigilance in developing and adopting cost-saving measures as well as in our legislative and regulatory efficacy during a very dynamic time in the industry. As the largest utility by customer count, serving some of the largest cities in this country, our primary mission is to provide reliable, resilient and affordable power to everyone equitably. The ability to invest in the grid is integral to that mission. It, of course, supports reliability, where demands continue to increase due to more severe weather, increased electrification and an evolving generation supply mix. And those demands have only been amplified by the growth of artificial intelligence. At the beginning of the year, we indicated that we had 6-gigawatts of high-probability data center load in our territories. That’s now at 11-gigawatts, which is indicative of the incredible opportunity this sector has ahead. But investing in the grid can also contribute to affordability as well. The transmission project that Jeanne highlighted is just one example of many where our grid investments can create savings for our customers. The importance of the grid reinforces the value of coordinated, thoughtful and efficient investment and thus, the benefit of transparent, forward-looking planning and rate making. It also underpins our policy advocacy. It has driven our focus to ensure co-located load arrangements do not compromise reliability or avoid the cost of relying on the grid. And it’s why we are actively engaging with peers and policymakers on how our state and PJM can ensure generation continues to be as reliable and as affordable as possible. All of our actions are focused on enabling the necessary investment in a grid that we all rely on and that is indispensable to the economic vitality of our jurisdictions and the impact of that partnership is clear. In September, Site Selection Magazine named ComEd and PECO who are the top 20 utilities in economic development in the country, their 10th and 14th time, receiving that award respectively. Two weeks ago, the District of Columbia’s Chamber of Commerce named Pepco its business of the year. And Exelon Utilities were just named as recipient of three more awards under the DOE’s grid resilience and innovation partnership program, bringing our total direct funding under that program to $330 million. Again, we have the honor and the privilege to serve over 10.5 million customers and they are counting on us to dependently deliver safe, resilient and affordable power during this energy transformation. Gigi, we are now ready for any questions from the audience.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nick Campanella from Barclays.
Nick Campanella: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.
Calvin Butler: Good morning, Nick.
Nick Campanella: I just wanted to address upfront because I know we’ve gotten some questions. Just you previously said midpoint or above for ‘24. Is that kind of still the case today? And how should we kind of think about that?
Jeanne Jones: Yes, Nick, good question. So we started that language as part of our long-term guidance when we were trying to show 5 to 7 and the combination of the years may be different, and we give you where we end up in the year. But that – over that time period, right, as always, we aim for midpoint or better. And I would say for the current year, that also continues to be our goal, right? When we give you a guidance range, our goal is always to be at the midpoint or better. And so I just – yes, that’s how we’re still thinking about it and what we’re still working towards the last 2 years, that’s what we’ve done and we’re working hard to make sure that we continue that trend.
Nick Campanella: Okay, great. Thanks for that clarification. So it’s been a few months since we’ve had the PJM auction. I’m sure you’ve had some more kind of time to digest it. There has been kind of discussion potentially in the legislative arena to address solutions for new generation. So as you kind of flip the script into ‘25, I heard your comments on focusing more on strategic initiatives. Just how does this kind of play out in your mind? What will you be kind of advocating for specifically to fix the bill issue that’s kind of growing at PJM? Thank you.
Calvin Butler: Hi, Nick. Thank you. This is Calvin. Let me just – I’ll approach this a couple of ways, Nick. And you – make sure you let me know if I get directly to your question. First off, I do believe – we believe that PJM’s request to delay the capacity option does reinforce the concerns over whether increasing prices are efficiently addressing our electricity demand needs and sends a clear message that reform is definitely needed. So that was the first step and an acknowledgment that something has to be different. And I do appreciate PJM’s leadership to put forward interconnection and various capacity and market reforms. And it’s just another example that the PJM stakeholder process is just not working. And we will continue to support them as well as other federal and regional agencies to get that done. So that’s first and foremost. It would not surprise you that as a Tandy only company not owning generation, our voice is unique in this discussion. And we’ve been working with all of our governors and regulatory bodies on how to address this issue and what needs to be done. And I think you’ve seen the magnification of this issue, Nick, with the letter that the governors most recently fit to page PJM statin, that something needs to be done not tomorrow but today. And we want to be part of that solution, and we will be part of that solution. And one of the things we are always focused on and I think we start with this, Nick, it’s all about reliable, resilient and affordable energy. What can we do to be part of that mix to ensure that takes place, and as I said in my opening remarks, everything we do is about providing that in an equitable manner to all of our customers across the footprint. And we will continue to work with that and I think you’re seeing that momentum going. Now people are talking about whether we’re regulating generation and so forth. If that’s part of the solution, we’ll be at the table figuring how that happens, but we’re not advocating for that. What we’re advocating for is reliable and affordable energy. And that’s our foundation of what we’re talking about.
Nick Campanella: I certainly appreciate that. And I think that’s just the direction that we all want to see it going. But I guess people just – I think we all acknowledge it takes a long time to facilitate this new build that could potentially supplement this higher demand outlook. And I guess, just as you look at the build trajectory, do you still kind of feel comfortable with the rate base growth that you’ve outlined across your jurisdictions specifically in some of those ones like BGE and otherwise? Thank you.
Calvin Butler: I do. I do. Because if you want to accomplish that goal of what we were just talking about, reliable resilient and affordable, you can’t do without investing in the grid. A matter of fact, Nick, I would tell you that there’s a cost of not making these investments because all of our jurisdictions have a clean decarbonization goal to it. And, you can’t get there without investing smartly in transmission. And you’ve seen the weather conditions that all of our jurisdictions are facing. I talked about Illinois with a number of tornadoes. If you even take a look at what James transmission project that she highlighted. It’s the conversion of wind pools to steel poles because of the wind pressures that all of our systems under. So you can’t get there without the investment. What we have to do is make sure it’s smart investment because I believe the cost of not doing it is far outweighs the cost of just systematically doing it. But that goes into how we work with those regulatory bodies and ensuring that the conversations are happening upfront and not after the fact. And that’s why I’m leaning into the multiyear plans because whether you like them or not, if you not having thoughtful and proactive conversations, it becomes more expensive on the back end. So to your direct question, yes, the grid investments are needed. And yes, they will need to continue. We just have to work with everyone to make sure we’re doing it in the right way. Colette, do you have anything you’d like to add to this?
Colette Honorable: Thank you, Calvin and Nick, good morning, Colette Honorable on EVP of Public Policy and Chief External Affairs Officer. I would add to Calvin’s comments that – and you heard him allude to the fact that we are unique. We are the nation’s largest utility. We are a pure transmission and distribution energy delivery company, and that gives us a lot of optionality. It gives us the ability to be strong partners with policymakers, with members of the legislature, with our regulators to help find and support the solutions that our customers need. So while we will continue to be focused on the fundamentals: reliability, affordability, resilience and being a leader in the clean energy transformation, we also are leaning into PJM, for instance, on fashioning solutions that help us do this work more efficiently and more quickly. For instance, PJM has been focused on ways to find reform to help us either get more generation, more transmission. We support a shovel-ready construct where we are looking at how we can move these projects through the queue more quickly to help with the addition of new generation. We will also continue to be a leader in the PJM stakeholder process on a number of pricing reforms. So we applied the effort of the governors in elevating the capacity action issue as one that needs attention from everyone right now, and we’ll continue to be a leader in that regard.
Calvin Butler: Thank you, Colette. And I think, Nick, to your direct question on how we’re engaged with PJM Today, all of our CEOs of our operating companies are participating in the PJM meeting that’s taking place right now. And they’re engaged in that because we know that their voice matters, and they’re sitting there representing their jurisdictions in a very proactive way.
Nick Campanella: Hey, thanks for all those thoughts and we’ll see you in Florida here shortly. Thank you again.
Calvin Butler: We’re looking forward to it.
Colette Honorable: Thank you, Nick.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Jefferies LLC.
Calvin Butler: Julien, good morning.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning. Thank you too. Thank you, operator. Appreciate it. So a couple of things real quickly here. First off, starting with Maryland here. I mean I know you gave some commentaries in the prepared remarks, but just at the end of the day, even if you didn’t have an additional multiyear plan as it’s structured today, I mean, how would that change your plan, right? I mean, it just ultimately falls back to more discrete spending plans, but does that change anything in aggregate, if you will?
Calvin Butler: Yes. Let me jump in there first, Julien and then I’ll turn it over to Jeanne. Let me just be very clear. The multiyear plan was only implemented, I think, in 2020. So we’ve been operating in Maryland with traditional rate making well beyond before then. And the organization was doing well when I was CEO of BGE, we were filing annual rate cases and we were being effective in getting it done. What we have shared, and I continue to share is that the MYP is the best way to go because the transparency and the affordability piece because what we do we effectively build things and keep things in line and working with the stakeholder process in a collaborative manner allows that to happen and ensures everyone’s goals are met. So to your direct question, we will continue to advocate for it, but we know how to move forward on traditional rate making, if that’s what they require. It would not be something that we would ever say is the best thing for that state to do. But it is something that we’re prepared to do. And we will reallocate our capital when it comes to other jurisdictions because we have to continue moving forward. So we’re not going to miss a beat, but it will require us to reassess where we go and how we invest capital across our systems. We’ve demonstrated that we know how to do that. When you look at what happened in Illinois in 30 days, we’ve reallocated capital to other parts of the system. And we’ll continue to look at those issues. Jeanne?
Jeanne Jones: Yes. So I think that’s right. I mean I think if you look at all of these proceedings coming to a conclusion here in the fourth quarter, whether it’s ComEd’s print plan, the Maryland lessons learned. We’re getting our DC order. That’s the benefit of having the size and scale, right? We get to then reflect kind of the new investments related to those orders, but then also layering capital where we know we need to invest. When you saw our last 4-year update, we went up $3 billion over a 4-year period. I think 90% of that was transmission. There’s a lot of transmission work we need to do. So we’ll manage all of that. We’ll manage the portfolio and we’ll meet our jurisdictions where they are.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes, absolutely. Thank you guys so much for the detail there. Appreciate it. And Calvin, can you speak a little bit to the transmission backdrop? I mean, you referenced in the remarks again, this 9 7 number. But as I look at it, clearly, it seems like there’s a number of leading indicators that would suggest that number could go materially higher, right? We’ve seen some sense of the PGM thus far related. We’ve also got MISO really pushing a much more expensive program conceivably that can weave into your plan as well, Pennsylvania also. Do you want to speak a little bit on each one of those and just how that fits against what you have at least currently stated as last updated at 9 7?
Jeanne Jones: Yes. I think at a high level, right, you’re going to see that trend continue, the increasing need for more transmission investment. I think there’s at least 3-themes there, probably several more, but there is just core work across our jurisdictions that we need to do for reliability, resiliency. We talked about and Calvin reiterated, right, that even in the Delmarva project we just talked about, the system needs to be modernized against the increasingly volatile weather. So whether it’s wood to steel poles, elevating substations for flooding, making sure they can withstand hurricane Category four winds, all of that. Security is becoming increasingly important for substations. So that’s just or work across our four operating companies, we know we have to do. And that’s continuing to increase. I would say a second key theme is the changing generation mix. You’ve got retirements. We talked about the Indian River RMR today. That transmission was to replace that and save our customers’ money. Brand insurers is another one. And so you’ve got retiring generation, which needs to have investment in transmission to accommodate that. But then you’ve got new generation. When you look at the Mid-Atlantic, right, Maryland, New Jersey, Delaware, you add up the goals in the states there, you’re looking at maybe 20-gigawatts of offshore wind. We’re not going to build that offshore wind, but we will build the transmission to support that new generation and we’re excited about that, right? We all know we need more generation, and we need all types of generation. So that’s another key theme, the changing generation mix and then, of course, right, the theme of new load. When we updated that capital plan that I mentioned, the $3 billion, 90% of it was transmission, $700 million was in ComEd, right? And ComEd is where we are increasingly seeing that data center growth. You heard Calvin talk about going from 6-gigawatts of high probability to 11-gigawatts just this year alone. The work we need to do to accommodate that high-density load continues, not only in ComEd, but across PJM, right? Last year, we talked about the $1 billion for the ARTECH window three, are related to Northern Virginia data centers. So I think that increasingly becomes a trend. What’s not in our plan, you mentioned PJM’s window one this year. We think there’s opportunity there, probably more in the couple of hundred million size. But then outside of PJM, MISO is doing its tranche two. That is another potential opportunity for us that’s not in the plan. There are pieces of the solutions that cross in our territory, and MISO has indicated willingness to work with PJM operators. So I think no shortage of opportunities, a lot of strong themes, which just kind of continue to build that momentum for more investments. And what we love about them is often those investments help save our customer money when you think about the alternatives.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Completely appreciate it guys. Thank you so much.
Calvin Butler: Thank you, Julien.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners.
Calvin Butler: Good morning, Shar.
Shar Pourreza: Good morning.
Jeanne Jones: Hey, Shar.
Shar Pourreza: Morning. So Calvin, you guys made a series of 205 filings in late August sort of seeking to clarify the tariff treatment of network load. Can you just talk a little bit more to what specifically drove those filings within your service territories and what you see as kind of the pathway forward? Procedurally, what are the pathways?
Calvin Butler: Yes, absolutely. So, let me just be very concise, try to anyway, because there has been a lot of activity and to frame it on the why and the what, right. So, first off, as you know, the regulatory conversation was initiated when AEP and ourselves really jumped in and protest the Talen ISA, which is in its most recent amendment was the first time deceleration that the co-located load was not network low, which implies that it will bear no share of the cost of service associated with be part of the grid. Now, we are happy that FERC stepped in and really initiated a technical conference with the Commissioner. So, as you know, Shar, which will begin on November 1st. And so that’s a big step because we do not believe that policy should be determined by one-off contracts. And therefore, our voice, even though it was not in our service territory, we saw some things beginning and we needed to say, we have questions and we need to get clarity. We filed our 205s for each of our utilities with the goal of having guidance from FERC by early December so that the rules of the road going forward are clear. And we needed that because we were being asked to do things that were contrary to the support and the reliability of the grid. And we cannot have the cost, the potential cost shifting to other customers. So, what we were doing in those 205s are saying, hey, give us clarity, answer the questions sooner rather than later, so we know how to proceed. And that was the purpose of them, and that’s why we did them. And Colette, please.
Colette Honorable: Thank you. And Shar, to your question about the 205, so following the intervention and the Talen ISA docket and now that FERC has set the technical conference, as Calvin said, we certainly applied that. It’s a welcome development. But the upcoming and timing of the process is still uncertain. So, we don’t know what will happen as a result of the technical conference, and we still need clarity as we engage with a number of our large load customers and to be clear, as Calvin mentioned, comment in PECO in particular. At two of the site selection utilities, we are seeing a lot of activity. And so we need clarity sooner rather than later that will aid us and moving ahead with confidence, and so that all of the parties know the rules of the road. So, we filed those 205s in each – for each of our utilities with the goal of having guidance from FERC early December.
Calvin Butler: And as you know – thank you, Colette. As you know, in the technical conference, Shar, FERC did not have a timeline in which they must act. So, this asking for the some ruling by December, early December was really the catalyst to say, look, let’s get that clarity, so we can all move forward.
Shar Pourreza: Got it. Yes, you press it a little bit. Okay. Got it. And then just any work in Illinois regarding the CMC roll off. The curves have come off a bit, which is good. But I guess is the ITA kind of taking the lead here?
Calvin Butler: So, I will turn it over to Jeanne, is the former CFO of ComEd, and because she is intimately involved with this. Jeanne?
Jeanne Jones: I mean I would just bucket it in the same way I think about all of our jurisdictions, right. The sooner we can get to solutions around securing reliable generation at affordable prices, the better. And so I think what’s been while the affordability issues from the capacity auction are a bad thing, right, the good thing is that the conversations are starting earlier because of that, right. There is a recognition across all of our states including Illinois that we need to come up with solutions to address that. So, we have those through ‘27, as you mentioned, but those conversations are starting now to make sure that customers have safe, reliable and affordable generation in the State of Illinois.
Shar Pourreza: Got it. And just a real quick one is just on the resource adequacy side, Calvin. I mean all the wireless companies are kind of highlighting this consensus that there is resource adequacy issues. But I don’t know if there is a lot of alignment on how to solve it. Your peers – I mean your one peer just a minute ago, talked about jet regulated generation. Your other Pennsylvania peers talking about regulated generation. They have been talking about it for months, but you are not advocating for it. So, I guess timing is kind of tight to get something solved. It doesn’t appear there is a lot of alignment. I guess are you aligned with the other wireless companies, or is there different pathways?
Calvin Butler: No. Great question, Shar, and I would tell you, there is alignment around reliability and resiliency and affordability. So, resource adequacy, in my view is a subset of that, because what we are all focused on, we wouldn’t be having this conversation if we weren’t concerned about the reliability of the grid overall, because when you have a breakdown and enough generation to provide power on the cold states [ph] and the hottest state that is the reliable of the system and what we talk about in terms of the buyer companies is that, we are going to be the ones that our regulators and our legislatures come to and say, what’s going on. So, we are happy to answer that question. So therefore, when you look at potential solutions, as I stated earlier, is that a possibility, sure it is. But we are having those conversations. And I am not saying that that’s – I don’t believe that’s the only solution. And we will work with our stakeholders to figure out what the options are and what can we do sooner rather than later to ensure that the system uphold its obligations performing at the peak demands that is required, and that’s how we are approaching. So, we are aligned, that it’s an issue, there is multiple scenarios in which you could play out, but we are part of that discussion as an industry, and we are approaching it with all of our stakeholders. And just to let you know, at ADI, we have created a working group to really address this issue across the country, because of different jurisdictions, it’s different. And I can even look at our six jurisdictions, they all have different needs and I can’t pretend that one solution will solve all of their needs. But we have to be at the table and we are.
Shar Pourreza: Got it. Perfect. Thanks guys. I will see you in a little bit. Appreciate it.
Calvin Butler: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman from Wolfe.
Calvin Butler: Hi Steve. Good morning.
Steve Fleishman: Yes. Hi. Good morning. Thanks. So, just – I guess just kind of following-up on a little bit of the co-location debate. So, the Governor of Pennsylvania seems pretty proud of both the Three Mile Island and the co-location deal with Susquehanna when they filed – highlighted that when they filed the letter at the FERC. And so I guess just do you have a sense where the Governor of Pennsylvania is on the issue? And I guess bringing up governors kind of Illinois too on this issue and where they lay out and what happens once we get an outcome?
Calvin Butler: Okay. I will jump in here, Steve. Thank you. And then I have Mike Innocenzo, who is our Chief Operating Officer, is former CEO of PECO, if Mike once willing as well. I will never pretend to speak for either of our governors, Governor Shapiro, Governor Pritzker, but I can’t tell you the conversations that have been had. I think both of them go into reliability and affordability is the utmost concern they have for their states, that’s one. Two, when you look at the three months, should be proud of that. We are bringing new generation into the mix to serve within PJM. And I think that is a wonderful example of how we can move forward and looking at data center load, bringing that online, bringing new generation online is a wonderful mix. But he is also – I have heard him say is that, he is very excited about the economic development and the jobs that will be created from the Susquehanna deal. Is he concerned about the cost shifting and the affordability piece for everyone else, absolutely. And what he is saying and what I have conveyed to him, and I have shared with you is that, we are not against co-location. We just believe everyone should pay their fair share of utilizing the grid. And therefore, we believe it’s not that they shouldn’t do it, it’s how they do it, that matters. And that is where our conversations was leaning in with each of our governors. But I do know what the premise of them. They want economic development. They want reliable power and they want affordable power for everyone. So, now we get into the details and that’s what we have committed to working with everyone to ensure that it happens. Mike, anything you would like to add?
Mike Innocenzo: I think you said it well. I would just – there is nothing in our position that is close to where our commentary is on that. I think everything that we have done with our position on co-location, our investment in the grid is supported where he is on safety, reliability and economic development.
Steve Fleishman: Okay. Thank you. One other question just on the PJM transmission, Jeanne, I think you mentioned maybe a couple of hundred million incremental opportunities from the pending, I guess the filings recently made. Is it – was that…
Jeanne Jones: Yes, we are talking about the…
Steve Fleishman: Yes. Is it – and there were – there was a group of utilities that made filings together. I mean obviously you have a huge footprint, so maybe that is not really needed given your scale. But just did you consider that as well?
Jeanne Jones: Yes, sure. We always do, right. We are always looking at what is the best way, right. You go back to the pinnacles that Calvin talked about reliable, resilient, affordable. If there is a way to partner with other utilities to do that for our customers, we are always open to that, so.
Steve Fleishman: Okay. Thank you.
Calvin Butler: Thank you, Steve.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Ross Fowler from Bank of America.
Calvin Butler: Good morning Ross.
Ross Fowler: Good morning Calvin. Good morning Jeanne. Just a couple for me, not to beat the dead horse here, but to go back to PJM capacity for a second. Obviously, a lot of stakeholder discussions are happening now. PJM, presumably, they have asked to away the auction until next June. We will see what FERC says to that. Is there enough discussion going on right now? I mean a lot of the solutions that are being talked about would require legislative change in various states within PJM. Should we – or are we at the point – I mean from my perspective, time is of the essence, but are we at the point in those discussions where we should see legislative efforts push forward in the 2025 legislative sessions, or are we not quite there yet?
Calvin Butler: I think the governor’s letters identify what’s the sense of urgency that needs to take place. And I think this, the call today and what happens, I think from now to the end of the year, will be a key indicator of what the states may take on for the 2025 legislative session. I don’t think – I think it’s too early to say to what and how. But I do believe fire has been lit. And I do believe these discussions over the next 60 days are going to be key as to how these governors continue to lean in on this very important issue.
Ross Fowler: Thank you for that Calvin. And then back to the ISA, obviously, now we are going to process at FERC. We will see what they say as you move this forward to the 205s. But I guess the way I see it, there is two issues, right? One is cost allocation, which I think you have been pretty clear about in your filings. The other is reliability. So, as you said, you don’t – you are not protesting the ability to do it. It’s just how and where and why like to put the mechanics of it. So, maybe give us a little color on what those mechanics look like. Is that – is cost allocation really just about paying for grid upgrades around substations and other things to actually co-locate something somewhere, or is it more an argument that they really are on the grid and they need to pay some sort of ancillary services to the grid? And then the second one, part of the question is for PJM, they don’t – in my mind, they don’t really do a reliability study, right? They do a capacity study to make sure that if you co-locate something somewhere, the average in voltage of the grids can stay up, so it still works, but that’s not the same thing as reliability. So, is there a push in these discussions from your perspective to add something around reliability because if we keep taking plants off the grid one, two, three, four, five, there is a reliability issue that is out there somewhere as we continue to do this. So, maybe contextualize that for us.
Calvin Butler: Yes. So, let me just say this, Ross. I think you said it well. But I am going to turn it over to Mike Innocenzo, our Chief Operating Officer, and then he and Jeanne will answer to some more depth for you.
Mike Innocenzo: Yes. I think you captured it really well. I mean it really falls in three buckets. It’s reliability, that’s resource adequacy and it’s rate design. These investments, whether you put them before the meter or you put them behind the meter, you are going to have an impact on the grid. They are going to take ancillary services off the grid. They are going to potentially require upgrades for the existing facility. And they are certainly going to have an impact on – as they take power off the grid, they are going to certainly put themselves in a situation where it may require future upgrades to the grid. Our whole position has just been – if they can co-locate, if they can get in there quick and get in there doing what they want to do, w e support that. We just want to make sure that it has the appropriate transparency on what they are doing. We want to make sure that we have the appropriate studies done to make sure that we are addressing resource and reliability and adequacy currently, and we also want appropriate rate design to be able to cover for those costs, either now or in the future.
Jeanne Jones: I mean I would just reiterate that. And this is what we have laid out, right. We laid it out in the proceedings, our position hasn’t changed. We have never been against co-location. We are excited about the opportunity for all of this growth in our sector. It’s reliability, should be studied the same way any other large loads are or loss of generation, right. All of that gets studied for reliability of the grid. Rate design, we have already laid out the cost associated. It’s not zero, right. It’s not zero, so that’s clear. And so getting clarity at FERC, working with our states, we have riders today we could use, for high-density load that could be used tomorrow. So – and then the third is resource adequacy, which again, it doesn’t matter where it’s located, right. We all know we need more generation, and we need more transmission to accommodate all this new load. But we are ready to move forward. We have processes today that address all of those three buckets. Let’s use those processes, let’s move forward and that continue to grow this economy and grow jobs and let’s move forward. That’s what we are looking to do.
Calvin Butler: And Ross, it’s important to note that we have conversations on a daily, if not weekly basis with all the largest data center developers. And to a T [ph], they have said it’s been very important to work with our utilities across the country, to put mechanisms in place to ensure reliability and resiliency of the grid. No one has said anything about that. And I just wanted to let you know and others know that we are continuing to have those conversations and work to remove barriers to ensure the economic development in our jurisdictions occur. And the fact that we have been recognized for that, and we have 6 gigawatts now, potentially 11 gigawatts in Illinois and across our jurisdiction [ph] – is an indicator that we are on the forefront of making this a reality. So, I appreciate the question.
Ross Fowler: I appreciate that, Calvin. And then just maybe one on the sort of jurisdictional stuff here. Clearly, FERC has a just and reasonable rates mandate, which gets into the cost allocation discussion. But we have gotten a lot of questions around reliability is ultimately PJM’s responsibility. So, how does that interplay of reliability work between FERC and PJM as we walk through the ISA filings?
Calvin Butler: Yes. Colette, please.
Colette Honorable: Thank you. And Ross, thanks for the question. And forgive me if I am going to sound like a lawyer and technical person here. Under the Federal Power Act, FERC has the mandate to oversee the reliability of the grid. And we think about PJM, they are like the air traffic controller for this region. Yes, they oversee that reliability function. But reliability, we are frontline on reliability and that’s why you have seen us really owning our duty here and stepping into lead on these critical issues of policy. We are in an unprecedented time in this sector. So, FERC has a duty in particular, as it relates to wholesale matters, transmission matters and FERC has the sole jurisdiction over generation interconnection service agreement. So, what’s interesting about our framework in the U.S. is there are some aspects of this work and reliability that resides with the Federal Government and some of that reside with the State. So, we need this policy setting from FERC. And then as you heard Jeanne mention, where this is going to play out, is at the retail level. Generation is actually regulated at the State level, and when Jeanne referenced riders that we have, we already are using those with large load customers. We already have riders that are utilized for large industrial and commercial customers to take into account their uniqueness and how they utilize the services of the grid. But to Jeanne’s point, they are not paying zero because they are connected to the grid and rely on the grid. I hope that wasn’t too much in the weeds for you.
Ross Fowler: No, that’s fine. So, basically, we are dealing with three layers here for test to set sort of a overall policy position. PJM has to sort out what that means in context and then we are going down to redesign at the State level to finally sort it out, if that makes sense.
Colette Honorable: Exactly.
Ross Fowler: Perfect. Okay. Thank you.
Calvin Butler: Appreciate your answer.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, I would now like to turn the conference back to Calvin Butler for closing remarks.
Calvin Butler: Thank you, Gigi. And just let me begin by just thanking everyone for all of your questions and your interest in Exelon and also your support. I can’t recall a more exciting time in this sector. And I am just pleased to say that the Exelon team is leading the way, investing capital in a way that meets all of our stakeholders shared interest, including yours as investors. We look forward to seeing all of you and just many of you at EEI in a couple of weeks and look forward to having more in-depth discussions on where we are going and why we are taking the positions we are and how we are leading this energy transformation. Gigi, with that, that concludes the call.
Operator: Thanks to all our participants for joining us today. This concludes our presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-08-01 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to Exelon's Second Quarter Earnings Call. My name is Gigi, and I'll be your event specialist today. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. Please note that today's webcast is being recorded. During the presentation, we will have a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn today's program over to Andrew Plenge, Vice President of Investor Relations. The floor is yours.
Andrew Plenge: Thank you, Gigi. Good morning, everyone. We're pleased to have you with us for our 2024 second quarter earnings call. Leading the call today are Calvin Butler, Exelon's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jeanne Jones, Exelon's Chief Financial Officer. Other members of Exelon's senior management team are also with us today, and they will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. Today's presentation, along with our earnings release and other financial information can be found in the Investor Relations section of Exelon's website. We would also like to remind you that today's presentation and the associated earnings release materials contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. You can find the cautionary statements on these risks on Slide 2 of today's presentation or in our SEC filings. In addition, today's presentation includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations between these measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of our presentation and in our earnings release. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Calvin Butler, Exelon's President and CEO.
Calvin Butler: Thank you, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for the call and are pleased to be reporting a solid second quarter earnings and operational performance, keeping us on track to deliver consistent and stable performance once again. We expect to deliver within our guidance range of $2.40 to $2.50 with the goal of being at the midpoint or better, and we are reaffirming all of our long-term guidance. That includes investing $34.5 billion to grow rate base at 7.5%, resulting in annualized earnings growth of 5% to 7%. For the quarter, we delivered $0.47 per share of adjusted operating earnings, above our expectations, driven primarily by favorable weather in our non-decoupled jurisdictions, along with timing of spend and ComEd distribution revenues. We also performed at operationally high levels, achieving top quartile or top decile reliability performance across the board. We have also continued to make progress on the regulatory front. Our revised Grid Plan process in Illinois is on track and approval by the end of the year is a top priority. Since our last earnings call, we are through two rounds of testimony from staff and intervenors, and we have narrowed open issues with many interveners and staff. We will continue to work with parties to address open items in advance of the evidentiary hearings. We are encouraged that we've been able to reach agreements with key parties like the City of Chicago, the Building Owners and Management Association and the environmental coalition, JNGO [ph]. Each has recognized the progress made in our revised plan and its compliance with the Climate Equitable and Jobs Act, a key focus of the commission. These affirmations are good examples of what differentiates the process this year. Approval of the plan will ensure that Northern Illinois will receive the investment needed to maintain an affordable, resilient, reliable and clean grid for its customers and will support the state's success in attracting new business. In addition, the process for our PECO rate cases remain on track for orders by the end of the year, and Pepco DC's rate case continues, where we await a final decision in its second multiyear plan upon completion of the briefing schedule on August 30. Finally, we received an order in PECO Maryland's second multiyear plan rate case filing, which adopted a one year framework, with the ability to refile for new rates while we await the outcome of a lessons learned process in the state. Now the short rate plan maintains some of the positive elements of multiyear rate making, such as a reconciliation and the ability to update rates next spring offers an opportunity to keep rates more current with cost. All stakeholders, including Exelon, are interested in making sure the investments we make keep us on track to meet the goals of Maryland's Climate Solutions Now Act while appropriately balancing interest across stakeholders, all stakeholders, which includes customers, policymakers and regulators. There are many ways to strike that balance and rate-making constructs are a key tool to do that. We think multiyear plans provide a great foundation offering unparalleled transparency, accountability and alignment, including a reconciliation process that allows all stakeholders to understand how we performed against the approved plan. But alignment on an agreed-upon path forward that works for everyone is critical, particularly since the need to invest in the grid is only growing with increased electrification, diverse and sophisticated power supply and demand technologies and the increased strain on our grid caused by severe weather. The broken investment has only accelerated as the proliferation of artificial intelligence has significantly boosted data center development, as Jeanne will discuss in her remarks. The states are simply too high to lack confidence that we are prioritizing the investments most important to our customers, multiyear plans can provide that confidence and transparency to customers and when done right, ensure alignment with all stakeholders. We are refining our regulatory strategy to follow the lead provided in the final quarter. And more important, we stand ready to engage in a lessons-learned process to ensure we can find common ground on any adjustments to address stakeholders' areas of focus. In the meantime, given the deviation from the approach used by the commission since 2021, we are taking action on the current order and seeking more clarity, as Jeanne will discuss in her remarks. Now turning to our operational performance on Slide 5, you can see that our performance through the first half of the year remained strong. ComEd and PECO Holdings are performing at top decile levels despite ComEd experiencing four times the amount of storm activity in the second quarter versus last year. I just want to pause and say how incredibly grateful I am for the committed employees that serve on the front lines during these increasingly challenging storm seasons. Just in the past few weeks, our ComEd crews headed down to the Gulf region to provide mutual assistance after Hurricane Beryl, only to come back to respond to four ways of back-to-back storms in Illinois, in which there were 41 confirmed tornadoes, impacting 500,000 customers. ComEd experienced the most severe storm in its territory in more than 15 years. And yet, within two days, we had restored 80% of the impacted customers, which is a true testament to the importance of prudent grid investment and our employees’ relentless dedication to our customers. We can’t thank our employees and those providing mutual assistance enough for their commitment to serving all of our customers. This operational excellence is matched on the gas side as well. Now on the safety front, I’m pleased to report that BGE, PECO and Pepco Holdings are all now top decile, with PECO improving from second quartile into the first quartile. Our utilities continue to leverage our new safety observation platform to take action before an incident occurs with over 1,000 supervisors and safety professionals trained on our new tools. ComEd is continuing to build upon this focus with the goal of moving into the top quartile, and we look forward to sharing more on its progress on our next earnings call. Lastly, our customer satisfaction scores remained consistent with prior quarter with ComEd and PECO in the top quartile, Pepco Holdings in the second quartile and BGE in the third quartile. Pepco Holdings and BGE have both made progress toward improving their performances, implementing actions based on the findings from their customer experience, working groups and data analytics. ComEd actions to improve performance include: enhanced accuracy for time to restore communications, greater self-service options for new business and interconnections and customer assistance campaigns targeted at newer groups such as moderate income customers. We look forward to the second half of the year, bringing continued operational excellence and delivering industry-leading value to our customers. I will now turn the call over to Jeanne to cover our financial and regulatory update. Jeanne?
Jeanne Jones: Thank you, Calvin. And good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover our second quarter financial update, along with the outlook for the second half of 2024 and our progress on the rate schedule and highlight two projects that demonstrate the breadth of our opportunities associated with growing load and infrastructure demand. Starting on Slide 6, we show our quarter-over-quarter adjusted operating earnings lock. As Calvin mentioned, Exelon earned $0.47 per share in the second quarter of 2024 versus $0.41 in the second quarter of 2023, reflecting higher results of $0.06 per share over the same period. Earnings are higher in the second quarter relative to the same period last year, driven primarily by $0.06 of higher distribution and transmission rates associated with incremental investments and completed rate cases net of associated depreciation. And $0.03 of favorable weather, partially offset by $0.03 of higher interest expense due to higher levels of debt at increased interest rates. As Calvin mentioned, we delivered earnings results above the guidance we provided in our prior quarter call due to favorable weather conditions, early execution of our weather and storm recovery plan and timing of ComEd’s distribution revenues. Operating earnings of $1.16 per share through the first quarter of 2024 reflects 47% projected full year earnings, which is in line with how we’ve affirmed through the first half of 2023. As we look ahead to next quarter, we expect a relative EPS contribution in the third quarter to be largely in line with prior year at approximately 27% of the midpoint of our projected full year earnings guidance range. Our outlook for the second half of 2024 assumes fair and reasonable outcome for Pepco DC’s multiyear plan rate case and the BGE and ComEd reconciliation, and it incorporates July weather and storm activity with the same geothermal conditions for the balance of the year. On a full year basis, we remain on track for operating earnings of $2.40 to $2.50 per share in 2024, and we reaffirm our long-term annualized operating earnings per share guidance range of 5% to 7% and through 2027 with the expectation to be at the midpoint or better of that growth range. Turning to Slide 7, as Calvin highlighted, there have been some important regulatory developments across our utilities that I will review, beginning with ComEd. Coming out of two rounds of staff and intervener testimony, we are encouraged by the support that ComEd revised grid plan is compliant with the requirements of the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act. And that it represents an appropriate balance between affordability and supporting the state’s clean energy goals. With our proposal representing an average annual increase to the total residential customer bill of only 1.8% through 2027 relative to December’s final order. ComEd filed its Solar Parties [ph] testimony with the Illinois Commerce Commission on July 31, marking the end of rebuttal [ph] testimony and another key milestone in the procedural process. The company and parties to the case had into evidentiary hearings in mid-August, followed by the briefing process in September and a proposed ALJ order in mid-October. A final order is expected in December 2024 for rates that will go in effect by the start of 2025. Turning to Pennsylvania, on July 16, PECO filed its rebuttal testimony with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission in support of both its electric and gas distribution rate cases ahead of the hearings in early August. The cases are following the expected schedule with orders anticipated from the PAPUC before the end of 2024. Moving on to Pepco Holdings on July 30 to DC Public Service Commission held legislative style of hearing to re-hear oral arguments from key stakeholders and Pepco DC on its pending multiyear re-plan filing. We are committed to working with DC towards their goals to meet their energy transformation aspirations, having at the commission’s direction provided an extensive lessons learned from the first MYP and supplemental testimony detailing each of the benefits as well as enhancements and modifications to improve the MYP framework. Based on the latest procedural schedule, which concludes with the post-hearing brief in late August, we anticipate a final order in the fourth quarter of this year. I'll close by providing an update on the Pepco Maryland final order we received on June 10, which adopted a one-year plan with a total revenue increase of $44.6 million and a 9.5% ROE. We appreciate the ability to file for new rates effective at the end of the one-year plan and the ability to reconcile eligible costs in excess of those approved. And while we were disappointed not to receive rates over the full period requested, we remain committed to engaging with the Maryland Public Service Commission on its lessons learned process, which we anticipate will commence next year. As Calvin noted, we believe strongly in the merits of the multiyear plan framework, and we embrace the opportunity to discuss ours and other stakeholders' learnings after 3.5 years operating under that construct, where we've consistently delivered above average reliability under below average rate. In the meantime, Pepco is requesting that the commission rehear and reconsider certain aspects of their decision, including some of that Fed proposed for removal from the plant. As always, we advocate for transparency, accountability and alignment in the rate making constructs in our jurisdictions and are prepared to work with each to ensure just and equitable energy transformation for all. More details on the rate cases can be found on Slides 20 to 30 of the appendix. On Slide 8, we highlight two projects that showcase the power of our footprint and platform to attract and meet a variety of low growth opportunities. This growth is driven by continued momentum around AI-driven data center demand, onshoring of energy intensity industries and overarching economic development, electrification and decarbonization trends. In June, ComEd joined Compass Datacenters to launch one of the largest ever Illinois data center projects, bringing over 1,000 construction jobs to the nearly 200-acre former Sears headquarters campus. The project helps ComEd further advance economic development in the area and is a great illustration of why Northern Illinois ranks within the top five in the nation for data centers and is a top attraction for other high-density load customers. With ComEd having 25 years of experience working with data center customers and recognized for its best nation reliability last year, companies in energy-intensive industries are drawn to the region due to strong infrastructure, ideal climate conditions, access to talent and affordable rates for all customers, supported by our ability to deploy investment in an efficient manner. This growth in high-density load, not just in data centers, but also in solar panel production, EV battery manufacturing, hydrogen production, quantum computing and other industries is one of several drivers for why our transmission spend increased by 45% in our four-year plan as discussed in the Q4 call and shown again on Slide 13 of the appendix. It also drove a significant update in new business in our refiled grid plan, with final spend eligible for full reconciliation under the multiyear plan framework. Supporting this development ensures the economic vibrancy of our communities. As last year alone, ComEd was part of securing 15 new commercial projects that are set to add over 4,000 jobs and more than $8.6 billion of local investments. Shifting the focus to Maryland, BGE is playing a crucial role in transforming the Baltimore Peninsula into the city's newest and largest mixed-use community. The area which will benefit from multiple new or rebuilt substations will help to release capacity constraints and provide grid resilience to both new and existing customers. Accommodating 100 megawatts of load and supporting the connection of distributed solar and EV charging stations. The 235-acre project will result in new and redeveloped mixed-use and residential buildings and host the new Under Armour global headquarters, playing a central role in the revitalization of South Baltimore. As the largest transmission and distribution utility in the country by customer account, we are an integral partner to areas like Baltimore City for revitalization and economic development, addressing aging infrastructure challenges, the need for new development and electrification and the capacity constraints from increased load. At these two projects highlights, we are uniquely positioned to support our jurisdictions to meet load growth demands in an equitable manner, no matter where the load is located. We operate in six utilities across seven jurisdictions, including FERC, are a leader and operator in the sector and provide a world-class customer experience with bills and rates below national averages. Beyond our size, scale and operational excellence, we have one Exelon platform to unify our utilities that allows us to support customers at a national level, identifying attractive locations to support incremental load in states of progressive clean energy policies. The momentum around new business in our jurisdictions continues to be very strong, a testament to the power of Exelon's platform. I will conclude with a review of our balance sheet activity on Slide 9. As a reminder, we continue to project to have approximately 100 basis points of cushion on average for our consolidated corporate credit metrics above the downgrade thresholds of 12% specified by S&P and Moody's, demonstrating our commitment to maintaining a strong balance sheet. And while we await specific guidance on implementation of the corporate alternative minimum tax, I'll remind you that our plan incorporates the assumption that the regulations will not allow for repairs. If implemented in a way that mitigates the cash impact, we'd expect an increase of approximately 50 basis points to our consolidated credit metrics on average over the plan, likely putting us in the higher end of our targeted 100 to 200 basis points of cushion. From a financing perspective, we successfully raised $1.6 billion for ComEd and BGE in the second quarter, now having completed 90% of our planned long-term debt financing needs for the year. The activity to-date, along with our pre-issuance hedging program, positions us well for the balance of the year and beyond. We continue to see strong investor demand for our debt relative to the sector, which is proof of the strength of our balance sheet and our value proposition as the premier T&D utility with low-risk attributes. There has been no change in our guidance to issue $1.6 billion of equity from 2024 to 2027 to fund our estimated $34.5 billion capital plan in a balanced manner. We continue to expect to issue approximately $150 million this year, and the balance rapidly over 2025 to 2027, approximating $475 million annually. We will update you as we make progress on that plan. Thank you. I’ll now turn the call back to Calvin for his closing remarks.
Calvin Butler: Thank you, Jeanne. I’ll conclude by bringing it back to our priorities this year listed on Slide 10. As always, safely achieving industry-leading operational excellence is our first priority. Keeping customers online, no matter the weather is increasingly important. We also remain highly focused on being responsive to our customers’ increasing engagement with the grid, whether it’s accommodating new solar performing efficiency audits are supporting their transition to electric vehicles, reaching fair and balanced rate case outcomes that allow us to invest with the benefit of our customers is another critical focus. As you heard from Jeanne, we have a number of proceedings we expect to conclude in the second half of the year, and we’re optimistic about the clarity that will bring for the next several years of our plan. Building a reliable and modern grid requires reliable and modern rate making, and we’ll continue to work with stakeholders to ensure that we are all aligned as we work to meet each state energy goals. Next, we are focused on executing on the financial guidance we laid out, including investing $7.4 billion of capital with a balanced funding strategy and earning a consolidated 9% to 10% return on equity allowing us to deliver in our earnings guidance range of $2.40 to $2.50 per share. And as always, we’re focused on ensuring all customers are benefiting from the generational energy transformation that’s just getting underway. In late June, many of you saw that we joined a FERC proceeding to raise concerns about the way co-located customers share some of the cost of the grid that they can rely on. Exelon and AEP may have been the first to share those concerns, but many others have now echoed similar perspectives. There’s no question that co-location offers a unique opportunity for our jurisdictions to attract business in an exciting emerging industry, and we welcome supporting our customers in this work. Serving more customers than any other utility in some of the largest, most critical cities in the country, we are a leader in investing in the energy transformation and supporting economic development. As Jeanne shared, there is no shortage of work that the energy transformation requires of the grid, regardless of where the load shows up of what sort of generation serves it. In fact, just a week ago, PsiQuantum announced a partnership with the State of Illinois, the County and the City of Chicago to be the anchor tenant in the massive quantum computing development, the first of its kind in the nation, housing a utility-scale quantum computer in an operation center, the size of five football fields. So we will lead in investments, but we will also lead in affordability, with rates and bills that are currently below national averages, and we’re committed to continue to do so to ensure we can maintain the service our customers expect while making the necessary progress in the energy transformation. Accordingly, you can expect us to advocate for policies that continue to support investment in a grid that we all rely on and that ensure these investments can be made as affordably and equitably as possible. We will continue to monitor the FERC ISA proceeding in which action by the commission is expected by August 3 and stand ready to help advance solutions to the benefit of all customers. Gigi, we are now ready for any questions from the audience.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners.
Calvin Butler: Good morning, Shar.
Shar Pourreza: Good morning, Calvin. Hey, Jeanne. Good morning, Jeanne. So Calvin, just coming off sort of this blowout PJM capacity print, we’ve heard some of your peers yesterday kind of highlighting that they’re talking to their state policymakers on solving this kind of resource adequacy issue. I guess, what conversations are you having either in Illinois, Maryland or Pennsylvania on the backdrop at this point? And do you think we can see merchant new entry all states have to step in? Thanks.
Calvin Butler: Thank you, Shar. And as you know, we’ve had this discussion in previous settings around resource adequacy, but let me assure you that we, PJM and a number of other stakeholders have been signaling concerns about resource adequacy for some time. Policy has continued to drive a turnover in the generation stack as you know with base load replaced by renewables. And in the past, it has brought huge advances in the power requirements with AI-driven data centers. Onshore of intensive manufacturing has further contributed to the pressures. But this, of course, poses real challenges around providing reliable, resilient and affordable power. It goes to my comments that I made is that we have to ensure that the new rate making – this rate-making systems align with the new constraints being put on the energy that’s being provided for all customers. The price signals that we saw this we clearly indicate a need for infrastructure investments in our footprint, particularly in BGE, both generation and transmission. Obviously, we’re already doing that today, including the work we’re doing on brand insurance retirement meant to address exactly the types of price pressures that this auction showed. We’re already engaged regularly in meetings and you should be assured that we’re not going to step away from this. And it’s an industry-wide issue because at the end of the day, what they’re going to look to utilities is for reliable – reliability and a resilient grid. All the other stuff is fine, but if those lights don’t come on, that’s when they’re going to turn to us, and we’re focused on that each and every day. I’ll now turn it to Jeanne to just see if you have any further.
Jeanne Jones: Yes. No, I think I’d just reiterate, right, it obviously signals to your point, Shar the need for more generation. We’ll see what happens on the merchant side, but there’s also the need for more transmission. Calvin talked about the work we’re doing on the brand insurers. We’re going to continue to lean in on that, we think there are some cost-effective solutions there. But there’s also an expansion of kind of what we do today in terms of things to help our customers manage their affordability. So for example, energy efficiency. We’ve been doing energy efficiency in ComEd in 2008, and we hit a milestone this year where we marked $9 billion in customer savings, since 2008. That's remarkable, right? That work needs to continue to expand and get smarter and better as more demand comes on the grid, and we're leaning into that. We also hit a milestone of hitting a 1 gigawatt of distributed generation under our rebate program in Illinois this year. So we're going to continue, as you mentioned, having those discussions with our policy makers, what else can we do there, good for customers, good for investment, brings down and addresses the competing demand because we want to bring that demand, right? We want that demand to come. We just need to manage the other side of it, which we're excited to do, and we've done before, and we'll keep doing. And then on top of that, we're going to continue to focus on what we can control, and that includes our O&M, continuing to manage that historically been at that 2%, projecting to be at that 2% when – our customers are facing power price increases went well above that and then just normal inflation. So we're doing a good job there. We'll continue to lean in there. But I think, look, it's meaningful and I think it opens up opportunities to provide solutions, and we look forward to doing that.
Calvin Butler: And Shar, if I can add on to what Jeanne just adding. The question in Jeanne's comments recognize that none of this operates in a silo. It's all connected. So when you see once a lever being pulled, you can't ignore the other pieces and which is why the ratemaking process is so critical and the transparency and the discussions have to continue and be ongoing throughout.
Shar Pourreza: Got it. And then I think some of us have covered the space long enough to kind of remember LCAP, MCAP, 11 years ago, 12 years ago. And that obviously was struck down by the courts. Are you looking at a state mechanism to potentially own like peaking assets in rates? Is that what you're referring to?
Calvin Butler: I would tell you that we're working with our commissions on all type of scenarios that we shouldn't take anything off the table because we need to address this issue and ensure affordability and equity is at the forefront of all discussions.
Shar Pourreza: Okay. Perfect. And then just on the Susquehanna protest, just lastly here. It's obviously a focus, FERC is slated to act shortly. I guess, assuming the amendment is not set for paper hearing. How do you want FERC to resolve kind of the broader issue, kick it back to the RTO, start an NOI for an eventual [indiscernible] just any thoughts there? Appreciate it.
Calvin Butler: Yes. Let me just tell you and thank you for the question. I know this issue has gotten a lot of attention and for some reasons rightly, so we're on the cusp of major new source of load, and it's a critical emerging industry that holds a lot of promise for us in the U.S. economy. But let me add a bit of additional color on my prepared remarks, though I'm mindful that we do have an open proceeding and with FERC, and we should learn more by the end of this week, as you know. Our protest to the Talent ISA because – it's not because we're against co-location. We stated very clearly in the initial protest that we are not. We do believe that co-location offer some benefits and allows our jurisdictions to compete successfully for this business. And as I talked about, we have clearly proven that we're an attractive partner for data centers. As evidenced by Chicago being the top five market in this area for economic development. As evidence that our participation in the accept Window 3at $850 million were received because of data center growth in Northern Virginia. For us, Shar, this is about rate design. Users of the grid should pay their fair share. And while there may be unique opportunities to leverage land and equipment at generation plants to get data centers online quickly, they are still connected to the grid and are benefiting from a host of services that the grid provides to serve all of the load connected to it. You should expect us to continue to remain focused on economic development and yes, affordability. We have to do that on behalf of our customers, and that's what you should expect from a world-class utility. That we can do both and really drive growth as we're doing across our jurisdictions, but not forego that for one customer over the other. That's why we're putting this in. Policy should not be determined in one-off basis, and we will continue to see what FERC says and then determine next steps.
Shar Pourreza: Got it. All right, perfect. Thank you guys. Much appreciate it. Talk to you soon.
Calvin Butler: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of David Arcaro from Morgan Stanley.
Calvin Butler: Good morning, David.
David Arcaro: Hey, good morning. Hey, thanks for taking my questions. Wondering if you could give a broad perspective on what you're seeing in terms of state support for attracting data centers. It sounds like you had some encouraging things to say. Just are you seeing any evidence of pushback in any areas or the opposite? Are there incremental signs that some of the key states, I'm thinking Illinois, Pennsylvania continue to be supportive of bringing that industry to the state.
Calvin Butler: Yes, David, this is Calvin. What I'll do – direct to your question, we're seeing a lot of momentum. And matter of fact, in our states, they have passed legislation to provide tax benefits to attract data centers. And Mike Innocenzo, our COO, works across all of our jurisdictions with each of the CEOs to ensure from an operation standpoint, we're set up to meet the demand have expectations of those customers. Mike, do you have anything you'd like to add?
Mike Innocenzo: Yes. I think we've seen no shift. I think our states and across all of our jurisdictions continue to see the opportunities created by data centers. for jobs, economic development and continue to be very supportive, but also continue to be very engaged in the process to make sure that it's done in a thoughtful way where it's fair and equitable cross.
David Arcaro: Okay. Excellent. I appreciate that color. And then in terms of the – maybe your specific kind of pipeline of data center projects, could you give additional color on what you've been seeing in terms of that momentum? Has it been largely focused in your ComEd service territory, what are you seeing in other states at the moment?
Calvin Butler: Not to tell you what I have our CEO, and what I'm going to do is ask because I think we see the most activity right now, as you alluded to, it's happening in Illinois. I'm going to ask Gil Quiniones, he's ComEd President and CEO, to provide more color. And then for Carim, and/or David Velazquez, Tyler Anthony, if you guys have anything to add, please don't hesitate. Gil?
Gil Quiniones: Thank you, Calvin. It's been a robust market for data centers here in Illinois. We have over 5 gigawatts in what we call engineering phase where data centers have paid us to start engineering their projects. Some of them actually have made deposits so that we can order large equipment like transformers and breakers. And then behind that, we have another 13 gigawatts in what we call prospects. So they're not yet in engineering. But they are knocking on our doors, making inquiries very interested in coming to our jurisdiction. And we're one of the states where there is a specific tax extensive passed in 2019 to support the development and location of data centers in our state.
Calvin Butler: Any other CEOs have anything you'd like to add?
Unidentified Company Representative: And Maryland, Calvin, I'll just add. We remain committed to supporting data centers as they come. To date, we have seen a number of data centers that are actually up and operational, not the hyperscale that many are talking about today, but we still remain committed to helping drive that if the data centers to come to Maryland.
Calvin Butler: Yes.
Tyler Anthony: Yes. Tyler Anthony for Pepco Holdings to three utilities. I would say the same, whether it's New [ph] Jersey, Delaware, or the District of Columbia and our portion of Maryland with Carim, interest level has been significant with all the major players doing different assessments of different sites and criteria, Calvin.
Dave Velazquez: And Dave Velazquez for PECO in Pennsylvania, is beginning to see increased interest whether there are a couple of hundred to several hundred megawatts and a number of those are in engineering studies already and probably the next few months have had a few more entering engineering studies as well.
Calvin Butler: So David, what you hear from the team is that we're actively engaged in that process. And to date, we continue to ensure that from an operational and reliability standpoint, we're ready to meet the expectations of those large customers.
David Arcaro: Okay, great. Thanks for the input across the board. Very helpful.
Calvin Butler: You’re welcome.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman from Wolfe.
Calvin Butler: Good morning, Steve
Steve Fleishman: Hey good morning, thanks. So just on – I guess, first on Illinois. The – you mentioned these agreements with some parties in the grid plan. Could you talk to kind of what parts of the grid plan they've been – they've kind of agreed to. And also just I guess the difference between – what we've seen is the commission kind of ignore staff and ALJs and other things, but does it make a difference if there's actually like settlements as opposed to just views – yes. Thanks.
Calvin Butler: No, Steve, thank you for the question. And as you and I spoke about it, and we've shared very publicly when we got that order in December, it's important to level set. At that point in December, we had not had a chance to engage with these new commissioners about whether expectations were. And as you laid out, we have been actively engaged with staff and others and stakeholders up to that point. And we thought we had at that about 85% to 90% agreement on what we were going to do. And then the commission came in and said, it's not what we were looking for. So since that time, the engagement with the commission, we took their feedback and went directly to those stakeholders and said, "Hey, if this is what the commission is wanting, how can we develop a plan to achieve that with the grid plan that will be recognized and also meet the expectations of view as a stakeholder." So the difference here is that it's with commission input with staff working in alignment with the commission and these stakeholders. Now to your point, the commission will have the final say but these agreements are key because it's done in alignment with what they told us that they want. And it's just another marker along the way to show that we're making progress. So it's much different now when you present something to the commission because they've already given input. Gil, anything you'd like to add there?
Gil Quiniones: No, I think that – you've said it correctly that these agreements signify progress towards the specific items that the commissioners cited in their final order. So there are two areas. One area is compliance and policy issues, and these agreements basically codify alignment in those policy and compliance issues. Now the rate case really is more on investments and cost benefit, and we're narrowing our differences in that area, too, leading up to the evidentiary hearing, as Jeanne mentioned, which will be on August 14 to August 16.
Calvin Butler: And Steve, I'll end with this, is that we much have – much rather have an agreement than not agreement with them. as we proceed and go forward. So to me, that's a significant step in the process.
Steve Fleishman: Okay. Just one clarification. So I think there's – I don't know there's like 11 metrics that need to be met. So could you just maybe tie in the answer of what's agreed upon to those metrics? Like there’s an agreement on the 11 metrics? Or – is it kind of more of a broad – yes.
Jeanne Jones: Yes, you're talking about the commission's point at the point of compliance, Steve?
Steve Fleishman: Yes.
Calvin Butler: Yes. So we actually created a very specific chapter in our refile grid plan to make sure that each of those areas where they cited a gap or deficiency for us to explain how we're meeting each of one of those that they've cited in the final order. On top of that, we've also engaged each of the of staff and stakeholders to make sure that what they're looking for when it comes to compliance and policy requirements are also achieved. So we – in a way, if you read our refiled grid plan. We actually previewed the chapters with all of the stakeholders before we file it, but we rearranged it in a way so that it's easier and clearer for the commissioners to see how we address those 11 gaps or deficiencies that they have identified.
Steve Fleishman: Okay. And I guess one other question related to the – I guess, co-location issue. Some of the other distribution utilities, including PPL itself obviously support the filing as it is. And PPL, I guess, found it in the interest of their customers, the update. So I guess I would be interested in did you pursue kind of trying to resolve this issue directly before you made this filing, to see if there was a win-win. Yes.
Calvin Butler: Yes. So for us, Steve, when we found out about the issue out in Pennsylvania. It was a matter of public policy. We didn't have anything in front of us in terms of do you have an opportunity to enter into a higher say or so forth. What our issue came down to public policy, and that's why we intervened to understand what was going on and to give FERC an opportunity to opine. So to your point, we didn't have a specific Exelon utility contract for us to come to an agreement on. Once we've made – once we did our filing, that's when we found out other things were happening within hard jurisdictions that were taking place. And we are looking to have those discussions. And like I said, we will work with anyone to get these things done. And my piece on this is that if we can understand and fully grasp what the costs are, and the benefits and how they're going to be allocated. We will have those discussions with anyone at any time. So for us, on the PPL was about public policy and what's taking place. When you read PPL’s opinion are intervening back into the process. What they said was that this wasn't the form for Exelon, AEP discussion, although they recognize significant issues need to be addressed. And someone needs to address them. Colette, do you have anything you'd like to add there?
Colette Honorable: Thank you. Colette Honorable, I'm EVP of Public Policy and Chief External Affairs Officer. Steve, I appreciate the question. I will partly add to Calvin's comments. We are very open to working with anyone on these ratemaking issues. And this is what we are speaking about. We appreciate that PPL has a different perspective here. The reason we got involved was because of the broader policy implications. And we need to prefer to provide that guidance through policy. That will help all of us. And most importantly, it will help us understand the impacts of these sorts of transactions on all PJM customers. And so we look forward to the dialogue and discussion will continue to remain engage at FERC with all stakeholders and most of all, our customers because as it has been demonstrated here this morning, we will continue to provide strong solutions for our large load customers, but that work has to be done in consideration of the cost impact, the affordability impacts for all customers and then ultimately, reliability.
Steve Fleishman: Okay. Thank you.
Calvin Butler: Thank you, Steve.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul A. Zimbardo from Jefferies.
Calvin Butler: Good morning, Paul.
Jeanne Jones: Hey, Paul.
Paul A. Zimbardo: Hi. Good morning, team. And thank you for focusing so much on affordability. I want to continue that a little bit. Just after the PJM auction, if you have a rough view on what the customer bill impacts could be across the footprint, like BGE, in particular. And if you're going to kind of use this to advocate for acceleration of transmission procurement in the region?
Jeanne Jones: Hey, Paul. It's Jeanne. We are still buttoning up [ph] of all the calculations, but you can think of it in some of our jurisdictions, including BGE, it's going to be double-digit increases year-over-year. It depends on our jurisdiction in terms of the current capacity constraints in terms of other contracts that are based, but that's how we're thinking about it. It's meaningful and probably double digits in BGE in some of our other jurisdictions. But you're absolutely right. We are going to – this just – we've already been leaning in to the affordability discussion, and I think this just accelerates the solutioning for that, which is that we need to get to a solution. Whether it's more generation, whether it's more transmission, which we see I'm ready to do and are already proactively doing that. And then I mentioned an expansion of the current programs that we have today that help our customers through our investments and connecting them to different resources in BGE space to help them manage their bills. So we look forward to that. And I think just reiterating right, what Calvin said, policy is important. This energy transformation we have always said from the beginning is going to be expensive. And the ones that do it affordably, we'll do it sustainably. And that's why we're focused on making sure that every dollar goes as far as they can.
Paul A. Zimbardo: Okay. Great. And I know everyone's focused on for [indiscernible]. I was hoping the related but different topic in Maryland, like Senate Bill 1, the co-location study. Just what are your legislative priorities there? And if you could give any additional context. I know there's been some strong comments filed by parties? Thanks.
Calvin Butler: Yes. Hey, this is Calvin. I would say on the Senate Bill 1, it's all about we will lean into the affordability discussion and what takes place and the impact on all the customers. So again, we think the process in which the general assembly is laid out in working with and saying we're going to have a very public process and hearing, to have all stakeholders engaged in it, is what we want. We will adhere to what the regulatory body or the general assembly lays out. We just want all customers to have a voice in that process because otherwise we as the utility will be the ones looking back and saying, where were you at in that discussion and representing us. And that's important because if you do this, Paul, and you know this, if you do this in a vacuum, then you have to react to the things that have happened already. And it's very difficult to it’s actually good policy when you're trying to recover from something that's already occurred. And that is what I think the working group in SB1 will adhere to, and we will be involved in that process with everyone else.
Paul A. Zimbardo: Great. No, thank you very much and thank you for keeping us all on the edge of our seats in the Dog Days of the summer.
Calvin Butler: You’re welcome. That’s right.
Jeanne Jones: Welcome back, Paul.
Paul A. Zimbardo: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Crowdell from Mizuho.
Calvin Butler: Good morning, Anthony.
Anthony Crowdell: Hey, good morning, team. Just a couple quick ones, I guess. If I could follow up on Steve's question on the FERC, the ISA proceeding, and just one is, do you have any idea if the commission wanted to hold hearings, the timing that would occur before a decision?
Colette Honorable: Hi, Anthony, it's Colette Honorable again, FERC has a number of options in terms of how to address the issues raised, quite frankly, by a number of stakeholders in that docket. As you've mentioned, one could be to set this matter for hearing should it find that there are outstanding issues of fact or law that should be resolved before ruling. Should it go to hearing. It could take a year and so that would allow for an administrative lodged to hear the various perspectives of the parties that are allowed to intervene and to consider them and make a ruling.
Anthony Crowdell: Got it. And then the filing was made in conjunction with AEP. I'm curious on how do you, or how just how did they get, or how did they sign on? Did you solicit other utilities? And some decide, AEP decided to sign on and others did not. Or I'm just curious, I understand that this is not about co-location, it's about rate design. It was actually struck me that more utilities than sign on. And I guess that's the root of my question.
Colette Honorable: Yes. I think at the end of the day, there's a timeline by which you can respond. Right. And so we responded quickly because, as we said, we're going to be a leader in investment. We're going to be a leader in affordability. And there's key questions here. Look, this demand is coming either way, right whether it's co-located or not, that's going to require investment. And our focus is making sure the investment gets done for the needs of our customers and that everyone has a fair and equitable allocation of the cost of using the grid. And I think that's the bottom line.
Anthony Crowdell: Great. And switching gears, my last question refers to Slide 8, and you talk about all the opportunity in Illinois. I guess, given the low ROE that you received from the last rate case, would most of your investment or all your investment be focused on transmission, like, I guess, is there reluctance to maybe do distribution investment Illinois, given the lower returns that they're awarding?
Colette Honorable: Yes, some of its Ds and some of its Ts [ph]. So there's a mix there and the more high-density months. We're seeing more on the T side. And you saw that in our update on the Q4 call. We added a lot of transmission to accommodate that high-density load as it relates to the distribution. We have an obligation to serve those new customers. And so while it is a low ROE, we've got to manage that, get that work done. And at the end of the day, that demand coming in. Right. Helps from an affordability and spreading the cost of the grid. So, the only other thing I'll mention is new business on the multiyear plan is outside of the cost, is the $1.05 [ph] cap on the distribution reconciliation. So again, we need to get that work done and hook up those customers. It's for the benefit of all of us, but it is a mix of D&T and a lot more. We see more T coming.
Anthony Crowdell: Great. Thanks for taking my questions.
Calvin Butler: Thank you, Anthony.
Jeanne Jones: Thank you, Anthony.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, I would now like to turn the conference back over to Calvin Butler for closing remarks.
Calvin Butler: Thank you, Gigi. And as always, thank you guys for your interest and participation in our earnings call. As always, we remain open to answer any questions and just get feedback with you throughout the day or follow-up to this. So I just wanted to say how much appreciation from the team at Exelon. We appreciate your interest in the company and just engaging with us. So with that, Gigi, this concludes the call.
Operator: Thanks to all our participants for joining us today. This concludes our presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a good day

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-05-02 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to Exelon's First Quarter Earnings Call. My name is Gigi, and I'll be your event specialist today. [Operator Instructions] Please note that today's webcast is being recorded. [Operator Instructions].
 It is now my pleasure to turn today's program over to Andrew Plenge, Vice President of Investor Relations. The floor is yours. 
Andrew Plenge: Thank you, Gigi, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to have you with us for our 2024 first quarter earnings call. Leading the call today are Calvin Butler, Exelon's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jeanne Jones, Exelon's Chief Financial Officer. Other members of Exelon senior management team are also with us today and they will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks.
 Today's presentation, along with our earnings release and other financial information can be found in the Investor Relations section of Exelon's website. We'd also like to remind you that today's presentation and the associated earnings release materials contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. You can find the cautionary statements on these risks on Slide 2 of today's presentation or in our SEC filings.
 In addition, today's presentation includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations between these measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of our presentation and in our earnings release.
 It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Calvin Butler, Exelon's President and CEO. 
Calvin Butler: Thank you, Andrew, and happy birthday. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for our first quarter earnings call. We continue our focus on strong execution. We have started the year with solid operational performance and are on track to meet our financial expectations, and we are making good progress on the regulatory front having concluded ComEd's rehearing process almost 2 months ahead of schedule.
 But before I get into the details of today's call, I want to start by acknowledging all of the thoughtful outreach we received on the passing of my predecessor, Chris Crane. Exelon and really the energy industry wouldn't be what it is today without his leadership. All 20,000 of our employees are committed to furthering the legacy of the platform he established and the culture of operational excellence he promoted permeates all aspects of the performance you see today.
 Beginning with our key messages on Slide 4. We earned $0.66 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.68 per share on a non-GAAP basis. We again faced well-below-normal weather across our jurisdictions, along with significant storm activity, but having approximately 3/4 of our revenues decoupled from load, balanced cost recovery mechanisms and strong operating earnings guidance of $2.40 to $2.50 per share. We are on track to deliver that.
 We also continue to perform in the top quartile operationally across all of our operating company utilities. On the regulatory front, we have continued to make good progress. As laid out in our fourth quarter call, a key goal this year is to improve our regulatory outlook in Illinois. We took a large step forward on March 13 when we filed our updated grid plan with the Illinois Commerce Commission. Upon hearing from the Commission in December, the ComEd team got to work the day after the order and worked tirelessly with key stakeholders over the next 90 days to create an updated grid plan that addressed the Commission's feedback.
 I am so proud of the ComEd team for their efforts to refile an updated grid plan that is thoroughly responsive to the ICC's direction, and we look forward to a final order, which the Commission has stated should be received by the end of the year for rates effective at the beginning of next year.
 And in the meantime, we are pleased that the commission approved an updated revenue requirement for ComEd in its rehearing almost 2 months ahead of the statutory deadline, which recognizes the investments made last year and the prudent expectations for continued investment in new business in Illinois.
 We also filed electric and gas rate cases at PECO in late March. These rate cases will support PECO's expanded investment in infrastructure, and they will enhance programs and services for customers, including assistance for low-income customers and support for customers embracing cleaner energy options.
 And lastly, the Delaware Public Service Commission approved a settlement in Delmarva Power & Light's electric distribution rate case, supporting continued investment in the reliability and resiliency of its grid. Jeanne will review more details around our regulatory activity shortly.
 Finally, we continue to reaffirm all of our long-term guidance, including an expected 5% to 7% annualized operating earnings growth going forward. This will be driven by the significant investment needed to support our jurisdiction's energy goals, which we are committed to doing as affordably and equitably as possible.
 Turning to Slide 5. Our streak of operational excellence continues despite the significant storm activity we saw across our territories in the first quarter. In both outage frequency and outage duration, ComEd and Pepco Holdings achieved top decile performance, while BGE and PECO achieved top quartile performance. This also includes extremely high performance on the gas side of the business, where gas odor response rates were perfect at both BGE and PECO.
 We also maintained strong performance in our customer satisfaction scores at ComEd and PECO with ComEd achieving top decile. In light of its lower performance at the start of the year, BGE has created several working groups to identify and address customer pain points highlighted in customer surveys and direct interactions with 10 initiatives underway that include enhanced community outreach for energy efficiency programs, especially targeted towards limited and moderate-income customers and a continuous improvement plan for new business. Results are trending favorably in the second quarter.
 Lastly, I'll spend some time speaking about our safety culture and performance. We achieved top decile performance on our metric through the first quarter at BGE and Pepco Holdings, while ComEd and PECO sit in the second quartile. As many are familiar, the measure we have historically used for safety has been OSHA recordables in line with the industry standard. This metric has been in place for decades, resulting from legislation passed over 50 years ago.
 While OSHA recordable served as a useful starting point to drive safe behaviors and accountability, it has limitations in its ability to focus efforts on the most critical areas. While the total injury rate for the industry has declined, the most severe outcomes, fatalities have not. The power sector occupies a unique space in today's economy and the nature of our work entails significant physical risk, more than most other business sectors.
 In our efforts to advance our capabilities as a learning organization we have worked with the industry to adopt a more targeted and comprehensive framework to monitor high safety risk situations to harness key learnings and further engage our employees. Such a framework is better suited for our industry to drive safety performance to the next level.
 And this approach not only better ensures our efforts are focused on the highest potential risk but also helps measure the success of those efforts, evaluating the presence of safeguards as opposed to the absence of injuries. In alignment with this strategy to focus on the highest risk safety situations, we are now reporting on our safety performance through the serious injury incident rate or SIIR.
 Given this safety metric now measures serious injuries, we're more focused than ever on doing as much as we can to operate at industry-leading levels and any incidents are unacceptable. Based on performance to date, ComEd is refreshing all employees on serious injury prevention tools, including recognition of their empowerment to stop work if a situation is deemed unsafe.
 And PECO is focused on strategies to improve safety performance around motor vehicles, including a copilot program to identify and communicate passenger responsibilities for safe driving. I am very proud of our operations team for its industry leadership on an issue as paramount as safety, and I look forward to driving continuous improvement in this area.
 Jeanne, I'll now turn it over to you to cover our financial and regulatory update. 
Jeanne Jones: Thank you, Calvin, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover our first quarter financial update and progress on our 2024 rate case schedule, including key developments in Illinois.
 Starting on Slide 6, we show our quarter-over-quarter adjusted operating earnings [ log. ] As Calvin mentioned, Exelon earned $0.68 per share in the first quarter of 2024 versus $0.70 in the first quarter of 2023, reflecting lower results of $0.02 per share over the same period. Earnings are lower in the first quarter relative to last year driven primarily by $0.04 of higher interest expense due to the rise in interest rates and higher levels of debt at the holding company and at some of our utilities. $0.03 of higher restoration and damage repair costs associated with the challenging storm season across the Mid-Atlantic and $0.02 of lower return on ComEd's distribution investments, including no return on its pension asset resulting from the December rate order.
 This was partially offset by $0.07 of higher distribution rates at our other utilities associated with incremental investments net of other expenses. Results of $0.68 per share in the first quarter represents an approximate 28% contribution of the midpoint of our projected 2024 operating earnings guidance range, which is right in line with historical patterns, but slightly behind where we expected to be for Q1.
 This is a direct result of the continued warmer-than-normal temperatures in our non-decoupled jurisdictions, and the challenging storm activity experienced throughout the first 3 months of 2024. As we look ahead to the next quarter, the relative EPS contribution is expected to be approximately 15% of the midpoint of our projected full year earnings guidance range, which contemplates the update to ComEd's revenue requirement approved by the Illinois Commerce Commission to go into effect in May bills.
 In combination with Q1 results, this would result in recognizing 43% of projected full year earnings which is slightly behind how we have performed historically, but in line with our latest outlook, given various new rates expected to go into effect towards the second half of the year across several jurisdictions.
 As we demonstrated in 2023, weather-related volatility is a risk we expect to manage alongside other changes in the plan. The ComEd rehearing provides for incremental revenue relief relative to the final order, which underpinned our base case for the year. As we progress through the year, you can expect us to balance this opportunity with management of our costs and utility work plans, regulatory outcomes and weather over the remaining quarters to deliver against the expectations laid out for the year.
 We remain on track for full year operating earnings of $2.40 to $2.50 per share in 2024 with the goal of being at midpoint or better of that range. Lastly, we are reaffirming the fully regulated operating EPS compounded annual growth target of 5% to 7% from the 2023 guidance midpoint through 2027 with the expectation to be at the midpoint or better of that growth range.
 Moving to Slide 7. There are several positive developments to highlight in the ongoing regulatory matters in Illinois. Starting with the most recent on April 18, the ICC issued an order on the rehearing of ComEd's December MYP order that reset rates, which went into effect in May, providing for an increase of $150 million in 2024 relative to the December 2023 order.
 The order also increased the 2025 to 2027 revenue requirements over the approved revenue requirements in those years. While we are encouraged the revenue requirements on rehearing were largely uncontested and the rehearing process was completed nearly 2 months ahead of schedule. Obtaining approval of the refiled grid plan remains top priority.
 That leads me to the next key development. After 3 months of robust stakeholder engagement to address feedback from the commission in which ComEd hosted 2 public meetings and a series of 6 workshops on 10 different topics, the revised grid plan was filed with the ICC on March 13.
 Based on this engagement, ComEd have made a number of changes to the original grid plan, including the following: First, we reduced overall investment levels and bill impacts by up to 30% to better ensure affordability for customers. We also included additional affordability analysis anchored around energy burden, which is the total home energy cost as a percentage of household income, and we demonstrated that new rates under the proposed grid plan result in electric bills at levels well less than half the threshold considered to be energy burdened. And third, we outlined in detail how every customer and community benefits from the clean energy transition. Specifically, through focused grid investments in disadvantaged communities, more than 40% of the benefits of grid modernization and clean energy have been demonstrated to support equity investment eligible communities customers.
 Lastly, we enhanced our support for the value of grid investments to ComEd customers through a new cost effectiveness framework. ComEd's analysis details the present value benefits of grid plan investments totaling over $7 billion as compared to the present value of the revenue requirements of $4.4 billion. These quantifiable benefits driven largely by reliability and emissions reductions do not capture other qualitative value like cybersecurity protection, safety, customer engagement, low-income customer assistance and health improvements from improved air quality.
 The refiled grid plan not only satisfies all statutory requirements and supports the achievement of statutory objectives, it also represents a collaboration among ComEd, Commission staff and other stakeholders on implementation of the groundbreaking Climate and Equitable Jobs Act. CEJA has put the state of Illinois on a path to advance ambitious plans to combat climate change, a goal that is equally important to policymakers and utilities alike.
 In support of these objectives, on March 7, the Commission issued an order that a procedural schedule to be adopted for the grid and rate plan proceeding that will allow the commission to issue a final order in December 2024 and implement rates that will go into effect by the start of 2025. The administrative law judges subsequently adopted a proposed procedural schedule in line with this timing.
 ComEd also filed its final distribution formula rate reconciliation with the ICC on April 26, seeking a onetime recovery of $627 million in rates effective January 1, 2025. A key driver of the increase includes the impact of U.S. treasury yields that increased in 2023 relative to the prior year.
 As a reminder, the formula rate construct was historical and that it set rates based on prior year expenditures. As such, in addition to collecting actual costs from 2023, trued up from '21 and '22 costs, the reconciliation reflects higher O&M expenses due in part to the inclusion of beneficial electrification and credit card convenience fees required by CEJA as well as additional investments in infrastructure to support safe, reliable service for customers and growth of new business in the state supported by its economic development policies. Storm recovery was also a material driver of the under-recovery, per statute an order is expected on the reconciliation in December.
 As I mentioned, obtaining approval of ComEd's refiled grid plan is our priority early approval of the rehearing, coupled with the adoption of a procedural schedule for an order on the refiled grid plan before the end of 2024 are the first steps to getting Illinois back on track to achieve its clean energy goals.
 Turning to Slide 8. As Calvin mentioned, there have been some important developments on the regulatory front for our East Coast jurisdictions since the beginning of the year. Let me begin with the most recent filing. On March 28, PECO filed both electric and gas distribution rate cases with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission. In its electric rate case, PECO is requesting a $399 million net revenue increase by 2025 to support significant investments in infrastructure to maintain and improve safety, reliability and customer service for its customers. To reduce the impacts of severe weather, PECO has proposed a storm reserve mechanism designed to defer storm cost variances to the balance sheet to be collected or refunded in the next base rate case.
 Additionally, PECO is seeking to recover $111 million in its gas distribution rate case to support continued replacement of existing natural gas mains and service lines, with new plastic pipe intended to enhance safety, improve service and reduce methane emissions. As part of the case, PECO has requested a weather normalization adjustment designed to adjust customers' gas bills for actual versus normal weather on each individual customer bill when bills are issued.
 Both the proposed storm reserve and weather normalization adjustments would reduce the variability of revenues relative to our costs and at the same time, benefit customers by ensuring that they only pay for actual storm costs and by making their gas bills more predictable. Further strengthening the experience for our customers are the planned infrastructure investments to modernize the electric grid, make it stronger, more weather resistant and less vulnerable to storm damage.
 Despite the impacts of several severe storms in 2023, PECO customers experienced the lowest power outage in company history with 86% of PECO customers experiencing 0 or 1 outage in 2023. PECO's investment plans outlined in the electric and gas rate cases are designed to build upon this strong foundation, delivering enhanced reliability performance to its customers. Orders are expected from the PAPUC for both rate cases before the end of 2024.
 On April 18, the Delaware Public Service Commission unanimously approved Delmarva Power settlement agreement with modification for its electric distribution rate case. The settlement was for a $42 million gross increase in distribution rates premised on an ROE of 9.6%. The decision improves recovery of investments in infrastructure to mean safety and reliability and improved service for our customers. It also helps better align revenues with costs, specifically high storm expenses through a newly established rider that allows for deferral of storms exceeding $5 million. As permitted by Delaware Law, Delmarva Power implemented full allowable rates on July 15, 2023, subject to refund.
 I'll close with an update on the progress in Pepco's electric distribution rate cases in Washington, D.C. and Maryland. The procedural schedule and Pepco DC's multiyear rate plan filing has been adjusted to accommodate an intervenor's request for additional time to review the rebuttal testimony from Pepco. Pepco anticipates D.C.'s Commission to issue a subsequent order with an updated hearing and briefing schedule in the coming weeks. A final order is expected by the third quarter.
 Additionally, in Maryland, evidentiary hearings were conducted, and brief filed in March and April, respectively, as part of Pepco's pending multiyear electric rate case. The hearings allowed Pepco Maryland, the opportunity to demonstrate the benefits afforded by a multiyear rate plan relative to traditional rate making. Multiyear plans in Maryland have enabled investments necessary to improve reliability and customer service, modernize the distribution system and support state environmental goals that have served our customers and community as well. We continue to believe Pepco's proposed investment plans are well suited for Maryland to meet its aggressive clean energy goals in an affordable manner. A final order is expected from the commission by June 10 per statute. More details on the rate cases can be found on Slides 19 through 29 of the appendix.
 I will conclude with a review of our balance sheet activity on Slide 9. As you heard on our last earnings call, we project to continue to have approximately 100 basis points of cushion on average for our consolidated corporate credit metrics above the threshold specified by the agencies. And while we continue to await specific guidance and implementation of the corporate alternative minimum tax, I'll remind you that our plan continues to incorporate the assumption that the regulations will not allow for repairs.
 It's implemented in a way that mitigates the cash impact, we'd expect an increase of approximately 50 basis points to our consolidated credit metrics on average over the plan putting us more on the higher end of our targeted 100 to 200 basis points of cushion. From a debt financing perspective, we successfully raised $1.7 billion at corporate and approximately $1 billion for the PHI entities in the first quarter.
 To date, we have completed 55% of our planned 2024 long-term debt financing needs, including all of our corporate needs, positioning us well for any market volatility in the balance of the year. As a reminder, we continue the pre-issuance hedging program that was initiated in 2022 to manage the ongoing interest rate volatility. In addition, we continuously monitor the capital markets and regularly assess our plans for future issuance timing, sizing, tenor and tranching strategy to ensure we achieve optimal outcomes. The strong investor demand for our debt offerings continues to be a testament to the strength of our balance sheet and to our value proposition as a premier T&D utility with a low-risk platform.
 To reiterate our equity needs, there has been no change in our guidance to issue $1.6 billion over the 2024 to 2027 period to fund the estimated $34.5 billion capital plan in a balanced manner. Specifically, we expect to issue $150 million of equity at the holding company in 2024 and the balance of approximately $475 million annually over 2025 through 2027. We will continue to update you as we make progress on that plan. Thank you.
 I'll now turn the call back to Calvin for his closing remarks. 
Calvin Butler: Thank you, Jeanne. I will close on Slide 10 by reminding you of your 2024 -- of our 2024 business priorities and commitments and the unique power of our platform.
 As always, we start with operational excellence, providing safe and reliable power to our customers as the demands on the grid continue to increase. We remain committed to achieving regulatory outflows and adequately balanced stakeholder interest, supporting the necessary progress on the energy transformation. This includes completing the ComEd grid plan process in a way that allows sufficient investment in the grid to support Illinois energy goals.
 We are focused on delivering on all of our financial commitments for the year, investing $7.4 billion of capital expenditures while earning a consolidated ROE of 9% to 10% and delivering operating earnings per share of $2.40 to $2.50 per share. And we expect to achieve this while executing on our financing plan to maintain a strong balance sheet.
 We continue our strong advocacy for equitable and balanced energy transition, taking advantage of the unprecedented federal support through IIJA for investment across the ecosystem while continuing our industry-leading efforts to strengthen our communities. As you may have seen, we are proud to partner with the Cal Ripken Sr. Foundation to open 81 STEM centers across various cities.
 We serve, including Atlantic City, Chicago, Philadelphia, Wilmington and Washington, D.C. We opened the very first of those in April in Lansdowne, Maryland, and we are excited give students an opportunity to gain hands-on knowledge, skills and confidence in areas like coding and engineering, which are indispensable in the energy industry.
 We also continue to focus on maintaining a long-term O&M trajectory that supports customer affordability while relentlessly pursuing opportunities to operate more efficiently as one Exelon. Executing against our established priorities and commitments year in and year out is what you would expect of a premier utility. In many ways, those priorities and commitments aren't new. The foundation of operational excellence and a commitment to values that support the diverse communities we have, the privilege and responsibility to serve was established long ago by Chris.
 He demanded continuous improvement from the businesses he ran while relentlessly advocating for sensible and long-sighted policies. And he was an equally strong champion of diversity and inclusion, including industry-leading efforts to advance equitable recruitment, retention and promotion of women along with award-winning programs in workforce development and supply diversity. Indeed, he laid the foundation for the STEM Academy initiative that I highlighted moments ago.
 We will all miss Chris, and we look forward to honoring his legacy by pushing Exelon to lead the energy transformation with the platform and culture that he helped establish. Gigi, that concludes our prepared remarks, and we welcome any questions from the audience. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan Securities, LLC. 
Aidan Kelly: This is actually Aidan Kelly on for Jeremy. Just looking at Pennsylvania, there appears to be an abundance of natural gas growth potential in the Marcellus and Utica if incremental demand materializes. Do you see this backdrop in ample reserve margin supporting data center development in the state? 
Calvin Butler: The short answer is yes. And I would tell you that we continue to see significant activity around high-density load growth in general. As we discussed in our -- as recently as our Q4 2023 earnings call, we have high probability of load growth, not only in Illinois, but Pennsylvania.
 And I have with me Dave Velazquez and both Mike Innocenzo, who can provide you further color. But the short answer is yes, and I'll turn it over to them to see if they want to add anything. 
David Velazquez: This is Dave. Just to add that we have continued to see different businesses, including some interest from data centers in the PECO territory and we have the infrastructure to be able to support that both on the generation side and also have the transmission infrastructure, again, would have to be reinforced in certain places to be able to serve those loads. 
Michael Innocenzo: Yes. And I would add, we've got -- we have a governor that's very aggressive around economic development. We're an energy exporter in Pennsylvania. So the ability to utilize that for all sorts of growth, I would say, in addition to data centers, we're seeing electrification, we're seeing development around the South Philadelphia area. So lots of opportunities for growth and all sorts of electrification. 
Calvin Butler: And the key to your question for me is that the utilities in all of our jurisdictions, we will be a partner in economic development, identifying areas and opportunities to put the assets of our jurisdictions in play. Thank you for the question. 
Aidan Kelly: Yes, that's super helpful. And then maybe just one follow-up, shifting to the PECO rate cases. Could you just talk more about the prospects of receiving approval for both the storm mechanism and weather normalization adjustment. Just curious, like have these been used before? Are they a first-time ask in front of the PUC. And just like any points of contention you would highlight there? 
Calvin Butler: Great question, and Dave is going to take that. 
David Velazquez: Now both those mechanisms have been used or are being used. So if you think of the weather normalization on the gas, 4 of the 6 gas utilities already have a weather normalization adjustment. And 1 of the 2 that doesn't, has applied as well for a weather normalization adjustment.
 And then on the storm reserve, 1 of the major electric companies in PA already has a storm reserve account similar to us and another of the major utilities for storms uses kind of a rider, which is kind of like an automatic add to the bill. So both are mechanisms that are known and have been approved in the past in PA. 
Operator: Our last question comes from the line of Carly Davenport from Goldman Sachs. 
Carly Davenport: Just wanted to ask on ComEd. Just as you think about getting the timing to getting clarity around the grid plan refiling? Obviously, the rehearing was resolved sooner than anticipated as you highlighted. Is there any potential for that refiling resolution to also come sooner? Or do you think it's really a December event? 
Calvin Butler: I do, Carly, this is Calvin. I do believe it's a December event. We continue to work the process. And I would tell you, the fact that we did get the other ruling prior to the statutory deadline was very -- was a positive outcome, but we are -- continue to work with all the stakeholders to drive this process to conclusion. And if we get those rates into effect prior to the beginning of -- at the beginning of the next year, that lays the foundation for us to continue to work with the Illinois Commission and the government to achieve the results of the -- one out of the Climate Equitable and Jobs Act, but I do not see it any sooner than that, Gil, you have anything you'd like to add? 
Gil Quiniones: No. I think -- just a couple of important things to note. On its own accord, the ICC voted on an interim order to say that they will decide on this by December. And subsequent to that, the administrative law judge on April 11, set forth the procedural schedule to guide it for a decision in December of this year. 
Carly Davenport: Great. And then I know that you've gotten a lot of the year's financing needs done during the first quarter. But just as you think about the rest of the year there, do you expect there to be any sort of impact relative to your base plan just given the move that we've seen in rates here year-to-date? 
Jeanne Jones: Carly. No, I think getting that corporate financing done was important, and we had also pre-issuance hedge, a significant portion of that as we always do heading into the year. So that's why we give you the sensitivity on an open year, it's about $0.01 absent any hedges. So we've really -- we work hard leading into the year to mitigate it and then getting it done early in the year, leaves -- any amount that isn't hedged sort of takes that risk off the table.
 The other thing I'll note is coming out of the separation, we were holding a little bit more short-term debt than we normally do. As part of that financing in the first quarter, we termed out all about $500 million. So that's all we carry in short-term debt, and that's typically what we would normally carry. So also completed that.
 And then in our operating companies, for the most part, interest expenses are covered, whether immediately through sort of reconciliations or over time as we capture them in new rate cases. So it's really the corporate exposure that we continue to manage. 
Operator: I would now like to turn the conference back over to Exelon's President and CEO, Calvin Butler for closing remarks. 
Calvin Butler: Let me just always say thank you for joining today and for your interest in Exelon. Always appreciated you taking the time and asking questions, and we look forward to connecting with all of you over the next several months. And with that, Gigi, that concludes today's call. 
Operator: Thanks to all our participants for joining us today. This concludes our presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.

===== 2023 Q4  (2024-02-21 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to Exelon's Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. My name is Gigi, and I'll be your event specialist today. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. Please note that today's webcast is being recorded. During the presentation, we'll have a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn today's program over to Andrew Plenge, Vice President of Investor Relations. The floor is yours.
Andrew Plenge : Thank you, Gigi, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to have you with us for our 2023 fourth quarter earnings call. Leading the call today are Calvin Butler, Exelon's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jeanne Jones, Exelon's Chief Financial Officer. Other members of Exelon senior management team are also with us today, and they will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. Today's presentation, along with our earnings release and other financial information can be found in the Investor Relations section of Exelon's website. We'd also like to remind you that today's presentation and the associated earnings release materials contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. You can find the cautionary statements on these risks on Slide 2 of today's presentation or in our SEC filings. In addition, today's presentation includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations between these measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of our presentation and in our earnings release. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Calvin Butler, Exelon's President and CEO.
Calvin Butler: Thank you, Andy, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. On Slide 4, we have laid out our key messages for today's call. First, we are pleased to share that final results for 2023 exceeded the midpoint of our narrowed guidance, delivering $2.38 per share of operating earnings, or almost 6% growth off of last year's guidance midpoint. This is the second year in our two years as a purely regulated T&D utility that we have delivered results in the top half of guidance. And that is despite historically mild weather in the Mid-Atlantic where PECO experienced its mildest year in the 50 years we have on record. We also executed exactly as expected on our financing plan, including issuing one-third of our original $425 million equity commitment. Operationally, we continue to set the bar for the industry. We closed out another year with leading performance setting records for performance at multiple utilities. As it pertains to our regulatory activity, we completed three rate cases last year and continue to make progress on the three others at Delmarva Power Delaware, Pepco Maryland and Pepco DC. We received the final order in BGE's second multiyear plan filing for rates effective 2024 to 2026. We were encouraged to receive an order that recognized the importance of investment in support of Maryland's energy goals and a thoughtful path towards decarbonization. We also reached a constructive settlement in Atlantic City Electric rate case. The increased revenue requirement will support its smart meter rollout, its EV smart program for easy and cost-efficient charger installation, and other investments to maintain safety and reliability, as well as improved service for our customers in New Jersey. Last, we received an order in ComEd's first multiyear rate plan, and it was a disappointing outcome. First, the order failed to recognize the financial cost of ComEd's investment, despite nation-leading reliability and low customer rates. It adopted a significantly below average ROE, refused to reflect in rates the prudent share of equity and removed any return on our pension asset despite that asset delivering over $1 billion in customer and counting. But more importantly, it rejected our grid plan which was carefully developed over almost two years through dozens of stakeholder workshops and presentations reaching over 1,000 people and bolstered by voluminous support in the rate case process. Support for the investment plan was very strong, up through the administrative law judge's proposed order. It's important to all of us that are working to meet our state's goals and serving our customers that we have a stable and certain regulatory environments, and we'll work with all of our stakeholders to achieve such an environment and ensure that Illinois is a state that investors are comfortable committing to. As such, a key focus of this team for 2024 will be regaining momentum in Illinois and resolving some of this uncertainty. It is in no one's interest, particularly those in the Illinois communities we serve and live in for the state to lose further ground in its opportunity to lead the energy transformation and forgo significant economic opportunity. We will be working diligently with stakeholders to get it back on track. Jeanne will cover more of the detail around Illinois shortly, and additional details on other rate cases can be found in the appendix. Our last key message pertains to our projected outlook. Consistent with past practice, we have rolled forward our disclosures after adding a year to our guidance window with our guidance running from 2024 through 2027. You'll see that we have added $3.2 billion of capital to our four-year outlook, growing from $31.3 billion over the 2023 to 2026 guidance period to $34.5 billion over 2024 to 2027, an increase of over 10%. This reflects a number of updates across the platform to meet customer needs and jurisdictional goals. Including the addition of transmission investments assigned from the brand insurer's retirement and awarded in PJM's 3 RTEP reliability window to resolve reliability issues from data center growth in the region. These additions are partially offset by the reduction of approximately $1.25 billion in ComEd distribution spend. While we are working to finalize the revised grid plan for our March filing, we believe our plan appropriately accounts for the uncertain regulatory outlook while ensuring customers continue to receive safe and adequate service, and we meet the basic requirements laid out under the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act. This increase in capital expenditures result in rate base growth of 7.5% from 2023 to 2027. And as a result of the significant increase in investment, we have included in our four-year projections incremental equity of $1.3 billion, which represents approximately 40% of the net incremental capital and ensures we maintain a strong balance sheet as we lead the energy transformation. In addition, despite below average returns we are receiving at ComEd, we continue to expect to realize a consolidated ROE in the 9% to 10% range. The result of the plan is an annualized operating earnings growth target of 5% to 7% through 2027 from our 2023 guidance midpoint of $2.36 per share. Now lowering our earnings growth outlook is not a change we took lightly, particularly given the amount of investment needed for this multi-decade energy transformation and our unique scale and platform to lead that work. Reducing investment in ComEd as a result of the final quarter lowered our expected rate base growth, but it also provided us an additional opportunity to deploy capital in other parts of the system across our seven jurisdictions to serve our customers, particularly in transmission. I'll note that the financial benefits of these investments do take longer to play out. Given the larger scale and scope of transmission projects, they require more time to generate cash and earnings relative to the distribution investments they are replacing. But we are confident that we can deliver at the midpoint or better of our annualized growth rating -- growth rate change of 5% to 7% over the 2023 to 2027 horizon and beyond, even after accounting for the potential that the uncertain process in Illinois may require significant further adjustments. And once again, Jeanne will speak more to these updates to our long-term outlook shortly. Lastly, for 2024, we are initiating our projected operating earnings guidance at $2.40 to $2.50 per share. This range gives us confidence that we can accommodate a variety of outcomes through the ComEd rehearing and grid plan processes, along with our typical risk and opportunities we see across our platform. We have also announced an annualized dividend of $1.52 per share in 2024, reflecting 5.5% growth off of our $1.44 dividend per share in 2023, in line with our long-term earnings growth and approximately 60% payout ratio. Moving to slide 5. I will review the 2023 commitments and priorities that we initiated on last year's fourth quarter call and recognize the significant progress we made across all of the areas that we prioritize as a pure-play transmission and distribution utility, which is leading the energy transformation. First, it was another tremendous year operationally. You can see this not only in our scorecard, but the industry recognizes it as well. As we mentioned in our last call, ComEd won, PA Consulting's ReliabilityOne Award as the country's most reliable utility. The best ever performance at ComEd and Pepco Holdings speaks to the high quality of our workforce and our efforts to attract, engage and retain talent. We also met all of our financial goals. We invested $7.3 billion of capital to serve our customers. We earned a 9.3% return on equity, well within the targeted range of 9% to 10% that we target earnings on a consolidated basis. And as I mentioned, we delivered earnings in the upper half of our guidance range. We executed as promised on our strategy to maintain a healthy and strong balance sheet. We issued one-third of our existing equity commitment, raised debt at attractive interest rates at both our operating companies and holding company, and we took advantage of a variety of hedging instruments. We were very active and extremely successful in securing grants enabled by the infrastructure, investment and Jobs Act, securing close to $200 million in awards to support grid resiliency and modernization, at BGE, PECO and ComEd that will make our jurisdictions progress on their energy goals more affordable and equitable. And further, to the focus on customer affordability, we again helped secure $550 million of federal, state and local support for low-income customers that need assistance in paying their energy bills. We also made significant progress in our efforts to maximize value for our customers, institutionalizing a permanent team to discover and execute on opportunities to deliver industry-leading operational excellence for our customers at lower cost, which you'll hear more about from Jeanne. Lastly, we executed on a busy regulatory calendar, setting a rate case -- settling a rate case at ACE concluding another successful multiyear plan for BGE's electric and gas customers that aligns on an appropriate investment strategy for the next three years, and making substantial progress in our Delmarva Power electric rate case and Pepco multiyear plans. As we talked about, while we completed our ComEd rate case, it was a disappointing outcome for all parties. But we've already begun to establish and execute on a path forward, and that's become our top priority in 2024. I will now turn to slide 6 to review how we closed out 2023 from an operational perspective. Starting first with reliability. We again kept outage frequency and duration at top quartile levels or above. ComEd and Pepco Holdings operated at best on record levels in both categories. Performance like this is not something that can be turned on and off overnight. First, it takes a talented and trained workforce. As I mentioned earlier, and we thank the teams that show up each and every day no matter the conditions to compete the lights on and the gas flowing as they did during the severe storms and brutal cold snap that struck in January. Across ComEd, PECO and PHI, over 500,000 customers were impacted, and it takes investment. The demands placed on our system by more severe weather by an increasingly distributed and non-dispatchable generation fleet and by an economy that's more and more reliant on electricity, they all require investment. That's why it's so important to us to have stable and certain regulatory environments. It gives us the confidence to execute on forward-looking planning to manage the pace of investment for the energy transformation and ensure the reliability that all customers deserve and rightly expect. On safety, performance will continue to be a critical area of attention for us in 2024. Our OSHA performance was lacking in 2023 and we remain highly focused on understanding and correcting drivers of underperformance at each of our utility operating companies. The biggest drivers across all of our utilities continue to remain in the day-to-day basics like ergonomics and vehicle-related incidents not the high energy events that truly differentiate utility work and demand particular focus. But this substandard performance even in the lower impact areas is not acceptable, and I expect us to do better in 2024. Customer satisfaction almost universally improved in the fourth quarter with ComEd rising into the first quartile. We are pleased that our efforts to ensure our customers see value in the service we provide are paying off, and we look forward to continuing this progress well into 2024. And finally, gas odor response remained at the dollar levels. And we continue to deliver on what we have here, and I'm so proud of the BGE and PECO, Pepco team -- and Delmarva teams. There was a lot for our employees to be proud of in 2023. We know we have what it takes to be a premier utility and we execute it like one. I will now turn it over to Jeanne to speak more about our financial and regulatory update. With that, Jeanne?
Jeanne Jones: Thank you, Calvin and good morning everyone. Today, I will cover our fourth quarter and full year results, key regulatory developments in Illinois and across the platform, and provide annual updates to our financial disclosures, including 2024 guidance. Starting on Slide 7. As Calvin noted, we delivered strong financial results for the second year in a row despite the historically mild weather impacting our non-decoupled jurisdictions. For the fourth quarter, Exelon earned $0.62 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.60 per share on a non-GAAP basis. For the full year 2023, we earned $2.34 per share on a GAAP basis and $2.38 per share on a non-GAAP basis, results that are at the top end of our narrowed guidance range, and represent almost 6% growth off the midpoint of the 2022 guidance range. Throughout the year, we benefited from a higher earned ROE at ComEd, primarily due to rising treasury rates, impacting ComEd's distribution ROE as well as favorable depreciation of PECO relative to expectations. Additionally, the ruling in December on BGE's reconciliation from its first multiyear plan approved recovery for over 90% of the requested 2021 and 2022 amounts and established a precedent to record a portion related to the 2023 reconciliation, which is expected to be determined in a future proceeding. These benefits, coupled with our ability to manage our plans across the platform, allowed us to mitigate nearly $140 million of weather and storm challenges relative to prior year, along with the labor strike in New Jersey that occurred late in the year, driving contracting costs up year-over-year. In a year in which we faced multiple headwinds, we delivered on our goal to achieve earnings in the top half of our guidance range. Quarter-to-date and year-to-date drivers relative to prior year are detailed in the appendix on Slides 30 and 31. Turning to our outlook for 2024, we are initiating adjusted operating earnings guidance of $2.40 to $2.50 per share, with BGE and PEPCO entering the next cycles of their multiyear plan, 2024 earnings are expected to grow approximately 4% relative to the midpoint of our 2023 original guidance range. Compared to our last update, the reduction in expected year-over-year earnings growth is driven solely by the December 14th rate order issued by the Illinois Commerce Commission and ComEd multiyear rate plan. which we were only able to partially mitigate in 2024 with cost management, redirected investment to serve our customers, and margin we had built up in the plan. Outright rejection of the grid plan, the challenging financial support for our net distribution investment in the December order, and uncertainty around the amount of spend ComEd will be able to recover has caused us to dramatically reduce the originally planned level of distribution investment in Illinois this year. Until there is resolution on the grid plan, our 2024 plan has been risk-adjusted for the overall uncertainty and prudently assumes earnings at ComEd consistent with the December rate order. While the rehearing on the interim revenue requirement is expected to provide additional cost recovery and so grid plan approval, we have not assumed this as our base case. Therefore, despite the uncertainty that remains at ComEd, we expect our 2024 range to cover a range of possible outcomes, from not receiving any rate relief relative to the final order to the prospect that we receive an approval of our revised grid plan. The uncertainty in Illinois will further cause volatile quarterly earnings shaping in 2024, both due to the significant rework of ComEd's operational plan in 2024, as well as due to the fact of the prospects for the rehearing and revised grid plan processes to impact ComEd expected revenue requirements. We currently expect to realize approximately 29% of full year earnings in the first quarter, which accounts for the December rate order ComEd, seasonal weather patterns and the completed rate cases at our other utilities. Moving to Slide 9. I would like to take a moment to step through the regulatory developments in Illinois since receipt of the ITC's final order in mid-December. First, starting with the application for rehearing on December 22, and ComEd acted swiftly to request the commission correct fundamental, legal and evidentiary errors around four primary issues with the final order. Return on equity, capital structure, return on pension assets and the basis of the ordered revenue requirement across all test years that was adopted absent an approved grid plan. At an open meeting on January 10, the ICC granted one portion of ComEd's application. Directing that 150-day rehearing process reconsider the year-over-year revenue requirement increases absent an approved grid plan. While ComEd anticipates that the revenue requirements will be further updated upon approval of our revised grid plan, the rehearing order due on June 10 is expected to reset interim rates for 2024 at the discretion of the commission. Immediately following the open meeting on January 10, ComEd filed with the Third District of Appellate Court, and appeal of the three other elements of the ICC's final order on which rehearing was denied. While there is no set schedule or deadline for an appeal conclusion, we will seek to move expeditiously through the core process. Separately, as directed in the final order, ComEd will file a revised grid plan by March 13. ComEd has fully reengaged staff and all parties to the proceeding to align on the appropriate adjustments to the revised grid plan to fully address the concerns expressed by the commission. We continue to believe significant investment is needed to support Illinois' clean energy goals and desire to promote economic element in the state, a fact acknowledged by all stakeholders. But the revised grid plan we expect to file will reflect the significantly below average financial support provided in the final order and address the commission's feedback to further prioritize affordability. We simply cannot invest at the same pace under an ROE that does not fairly recognize ComEd's cost of financing to do so, especially in the current interest rate and inflation environment. There is no statutory deadline action on the revised grid plan. However, final order stated that the commission appreciates urgency of having a compliant grid plan in place, and is eager to move forward with the grid plan that satisfies the statutory requirements for approval. And so we are optimistic for resolution by year-end. In response to the challenging rate order, our long-term guidance reflects a $1.25 billion reduction in ComEd distribution capital expenditures over the three-year period spanning 2024 to 2026 relative to our Q4 2022 disclosure update. This updated investment outlook for ComEd distribution business includes reductions agreed to with stakeholders, leading up to last October's per quarter. Along with additional reductions to result in a plan that further balances priorities across our stakeholders. As I will discuss later, around our long-term outlook, our guidance has accounted for the possibility that substantially more capital is removed from the plan as a result of the process, despite significant broad-reaching support for our investment strategy. On Slide 10, we provide our updated outlook for CapEx and rate base, covering 2024 to 2027. We plan to invest $7.4 billion in 2024 and a total of $34.5 billion over the next four years, an increase of $3.2 billion or over 10% from the prior planning period. So we reduced ComEd's distribution capital plan by over 18% in response to the final order, the multi-decade energy transformation continues to gain momentum, and we see no shortage of needs to invest for our customers across all of our service territories and an ability to do so at a reasonable cost. We are the largest transmission and distribution utility in the country by customer count, and we have the privilege and responsibility to serve many major densely populated areas. We operate six utilities across seven jurisdictions, including FERC. And beyond our industry-leading size and scale, we are also one of the best operators in this sector, providing a world-class customer experience for reliability at very competitive rates. Given the power of this platform, our updated four-year capital plan includes $3.2 billion of additional capital, net of the adjustments to common distribution to serve our customers. Included in that increase is $1.5 billion of incremental transmission capital over the 2023 to 2026 period, since our last disclosure update. Addressing the significant need for high-voltage investments to support federal, state and customer goals on renewable energy and electrification. $725 million of that increase is projected at ComEd for data center and other high intense new load growth, along with increasing renewables and retirements of older fossil fuel generation is driving increased transmission investment needs. The balance of the additional transmission largely relates to the two large transmission projects discussed on prior earnings calls. The RTEP reliability Window 3 projects awarded by PJM to mitigate reliability challenges driven by incremental data center demand in the region and the other assigned due to the retirement of the brand insurance coal plant. While some of the transmission capital at ComEd is expected to go in service during the guidance period, very little of the transmission spend for the large East Coast project is reflected in the updated rate base outlook. Brand Insurance is expected to go into service in 2028, while the RTEP Window 3 project will be in service closer to 2030, providing line of sight to strong rate base growth beyond the current guidance window. We continue to expect there will be transmission opportunity across our service territories, associated with the same drivers underpinning these projects, high-density, localized load growth, traditional fossil fuel plant retirements increased renewables, not to mention from our extremely well-positioned footprint on the Mid-Atlantic Coast for offshore wind interconnection. To further put our competitive position into perspective, all but one mile of those two large transmission projects is expected to occur on our existing rightways. We expect to remain active in seeking additional opportunities to lead in this space. And as always, we will only include spend in our plan that is identified and expected to proceed tied to the needs of our jurisdictions. In total, our capital plan updates are expected to result in an increase to rate base of 7.5% over the next four years on a compound annual growth basis to $74 billion. This growth adds approximately $18.5 billion to rate base from 2024 through 2027 and reflects a shift in the mix of our total capital growth portfolio by 2% from distribution to transmission since the last disclosure update despite a significant portion of the transmission capital added, not yet placed in service. Exelon's transmission rate base growth recovered through FERC formula rate provides a stable and predictable financial profile. As clean energy and electrification continue to grow, our transmission strategy is designed to adapt to this new paradigm, while continuing to operate the transmission system at world class levels. Moving to slide 11. One way to ensure sustainability of our capital growth profile is to continue delivering superior value as efficiently as possible to our customers and communities. And as one Exelon, we are building from a strong foundation. Our history of steady cost discipline, while delivering a premier experience for our customers has positioned us very well, as you can see in the chart on the right. Exelon's investment in grid modernization has enabled an approximate 40% increase in reliability performance across the platform, whether based on outage frequency or outage duration, while maintaining average electric rates 17% below the top 20 metropolitan cities in the United States. More simply put, when a dollar is placed in our hands to invest, our customers entrust us to create value through reliable, affordable service. Had our adjusted O&M costs growing in line with historical annualized inflation rate of 3.5% from 2016 through 2024, they would have increased by approximately $1.2 billion. Instead, we are projecting a 2.4% CAGR for the same period, eliminating $400 million of customer rate increases that would have occurred without our intentional focus on driving efficiencies. And while 2024 is expected to grow at a higher rate, one key driver is the number of significant back office and operational IT system investments whose savings will be monetized over a longer period of time, as I'll discuss in a minute. In addition, upon aligning with several of our jurisdictions on the spending programs associated with advancing their state's energy goals and priorities, through the recently approved rate cases, we are anticipating some catch up to meet the levels of service and investment agreed upon with our jurisdictions. However, we expect to maintain an annualized growth rate of approximately 2% through 2027, a below inflation level that is expected to result in – to our customers over $400 million lower than they otherwise would have been. Our expectation is to limit the annualized O&M growth rate to approximately 2% over the long-term and maintain our competitive position with rates among those that are the lowest in the nation will improve our customers' experiences. In fact, our multiyear plan rate structures allow us to quickly flow any benefits back to customers. Let me take a moment to highlight a few ways in which we continue delivering value for our customers. First, as Calvin mentioned, a permanent team has established in 2023 to continue efforts to standardize and streamline the structure and operations of the organization. Ensuring all of our efforts are coordinated with the sole purpose of serving our customers and communities in an efficient and superior manner. Second, we have several initiatives underway to upgrade major enterprise resource planning, customer billing and automated work order systems expected to create work efficiencies, some of which I mentioned are driving our spend in 2024. Third, we are standardizing storm response protocol to increase rolled transparency and accountability and emergency events, mitigating cost risk and improving restoration performance in the future. Fourth, we are delivering a framework to migrate from a preventive maintenance, asset management strategy to an automated condition-based maintenance strategy in our transmission operations. And lastly, we are streamlining processes and leveraging technology, particularly in the call center and field for increased efficiency and responsiveness to our customers. To ensure that R&R remain strong and we can invest at the levels our jurisdictions want, we are committed to leveraging our size and scale as one Exelon to manage costs across our operating companies and deliver affordable rates for our customers. Turning to slide 12. With $34.5 billion of projected capital spend driving 7.5% rate base growth and with continued focus on earning ROEs of 9% to 10%. We are initiating an annualized operating earnings growth target of 5% to 7% through 2027 from our 2023 guidance midpoint of $2.36 per share. The lower growth outlook from what we previously laid out is not a decision we took lightly, but as a result of the challenging rate case outcomes and decelerated piece of investment in Illinois. As you heard from Calvin, Illinois is only one jurisdiction in which we operate. We are continuing momentum in our other jurisdictions as the second multiyear plans at Pepco progressed in line with our expectations, as PECO anticipates filing in the first half of this year, consistent with our general two to three-year rate case cadence and does all of our utilities execute on the robust transmission strategy and cost management initiatives outlined on the prior slide. Accordingly, we are confident that our earnings CAGR will be at midpoint or better of the 5% to 7% range over the 2023 to 2027 period and in future updates. Even with the process in Illinois remaining uncertain, our earnings growth guidance is resilient and account for the possibility that limited progress is made in Illinois, and we need to significantly reduce investment in common distribution further. We also continue to project an approximate 60% dividend payout ratio of operating earnings, with the dividend growing in line with our long-term earnings target. We announced today an expected annualized dividend of $1.52 per share in 2024 which is over 5.5% higher than the 23% dividends. Maintaining our commitment to transparency and predictability, we have provided year-over-year drivers contributing to the expected annual growth in our earnings through 2027 on slide 13. While there is variability in the year-over-year growth over the four year time period, the business drivers provide transparency into our expected 5% to 7% growth through 2027. Including an expectation to deliver every year after 2024 within the 5% to 7% range, if not above. I will conclude with a review of our balance sheet activity on slide 14. As you have heard from us before, maintaining a strong balance sheet is core to our strategy, and we closed out another year with credit metrics comfortably exceeding S&P and Moody's downgrade thresholds of 12%. Similar to the first two years since operation, over the guidance period, we project to continue to have approximately 100 basis points of cushion on average for our consolidated corporate credit metrics above the threshold specified by the agencies. While the final rate order issued by the commission in Illinois negatively impacted our future cash flow outlook, we have largely mitigated those impacts through cost management and curtailment of distribution capital spend at ComEd, while ensuring we maintain a safe, reliable growth for customers. As we identify new investments in the plan, we are funding in a prudent manner by incorporating an incremental $1.3 billion of equity to ensure we maintain our previous commitment on pushing and keep us on a path to 13% to 14% consolidated credit metrics over time. As our consolidated spend profile has shifted more towards transmission, the cash generated from these longer-dated investments is expected to follow the earnings largely beyond the guidance period and further strengthen our credit metrics over time. Additionally, I'd remind you that our plan continues to incorporate the assumption that the corporate alternative minimum tax will not allow for repairs. If implemented in a way that mitigates the cash impact, we'd expect an increase of approximately 50 basis points to our consolidated credit metrics average on average over the plan, which would provide incremental cushion. From a financing perspective, we expect the $34.5 billion capital plan to be supported by $19 billion of internally generated cash flow. $10 billion of debt at the utilities and $3 billion of debt at the holding company with the balance funded with a modest amount of equity. In the fourth quarter of 2023, we completed $142 million of equity via our ATM and expect $150 million to be issued in 2024. And as mentioned, to fund the robust $3.2 billion of incremental capital opportunities while maintaining a strong balance sheet, our financing plan includes $1.3 billion of additional equity that we expect to issue over the 2025 through 2027 period. The incremental equity funds 40% of the incremental capital investments over the four-year plan and represent slightly more than 1% per year of Exelon current market cap. As we work with our jurisdictions and identify needs for further investment of utilities, we anticipate that any incremental capital investment will be funded by no more than approximately 40% equity. I want to close by reiterating our confidence in investing an estimated $35 billion of capital across our diversified platform from 2024 to 2027, driving 5% to 7% earnings growth from 2023 to 2027 with an expectation of midpoint or better and maintaining a strong balance sheet while doing so. Thank you. I'll now turn the call back to Calvin for his closing remarks.
Calvin Butler: Thank you, Jeanne. I'd like to conclude with our priorities and commitments for this year and remind you of Exelon's unique value proposition for their jurisdictions it serves and its investors. As you'll see, they're very consistent with our focus areas for 2024, a good reminder that we aim to reliably deliver against a predictable and consistent strategy, as you'd expect from a premier utility. First, you can count on us to prioritize operational excellence and safety in service of our customers. As you may have seen, once the creation of a Chief Operating Officer position and named Mike Innocenzo, the CEO of PECO to that role. Mike will build on the top-tier performance level customers have come to expect. And in succeeding him, Dave Velazquez, will bring his wealth of experience and strong leadership to PECO. Both moves are a testament to the unparalleled bench strength that Exelon enjoys. And our Chief Human Resource Officer, Amy Best, has been instrumental in building that advantage. We wish her all the best in her next chapter and look forward to Denise Galambos' leadership as Exelon's new Head of HR. Second, we expect to deliver on the prudent financial plan that we have laid out. Spending $7.4 billion less in the grid on behalf of our customers and communities, earning a consolidated return on equity in the 9% to 10% range, consistent with the cost of investing in the grid, and delivering earnings in the range of $2.40 and $2.50 per share, while maintaining a strong balance sheet in executing our financing strategy. Next, we expect to reach collaborative and constructive outcome of the rate cases we have underway, along with the ones we expect to initiate in 2024 to ensure we can continue to deliver safe, reliable, and affordable energy to our customers and help the states make their desired progress on their energy goals. And we will continue our efforts to ensure the energy transformation is as equitable and affordable as possible. Building on our success in 2023 in mid-January, we submitted seven concept papers for the next $3.9 billion that the Department of Energy's grid deployment office is making available under its GRIP program enabled by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. With proposals ranging from software across the enterprise to enable increasing levels of distributed renewable energy sources to target an investment at Pepco Holdings to combat coastal impacts of climate change they highlight our creative and far-reaching efforts to partner with our jurisdictions and creatively line local state and federal policy. And beyond accessing these funding sources, as Jeanne highlighted, we will continue our efforts to standardize and simplify our operations to manage the increases in costs associated with the expanding needs of the grid, while delivering premium for customers. Lastly, what's distinct this year is a recognition that last December's final order in the ComEd multiyear plan did not bring the resolution on how to invest over the coming years in the first rate case process undertaken by the approach laid out in the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act. But while we are disappointed, we are not deterred. We are committed to finding a path forward with stakeholders that restore certainty for our customers, employees and investors. We believe everyone wants a level of investment that can deliver on the promise of seizure and positions us to lead the energy transformation. And so will we be working toward that outcome while preparing to pivot if that's not the case. Delivering against these priorities while continuing to establish our position as a premier T&D utility, and Slide 16 reinforces that value that we offer. Exelon's platform is incredibly unique. We have the privilege and responsibility serving some of the nation's greatest cities with jurisdictions that recognize the unique opportunity they have to lead the energy transformation. Our asset footprint, the transmission and distribution network that is the lifeblood of making that transformation happen for our jurisdictions is unmatched. As is our scale with over 10.5 million customers across our seven ratemaking jurisdictions. We have been setting the bar for operational performance for years and our ability to invest to support that performance is backed by strong forward-looking and predictable regulatory mechanisms. With our dividend yield at 4.5% and a 5% to 7% annualized earnings growth rate that we have a strong conviction in achieving, we are offering investors total shareholder returns in the 9.5% to 11.5% range and extremely attracted risk-adjusted proposition. I am so proud of this team for the commitments made and kept in 2023, and we look forward to doing the same in 2024. As always, thank you for your time and support, and we'll now take your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners.
Shar Pourreza : Hey guys. Good morning.
Calvin Butler : Good morning, Shar.
Jeanne Jones : Hey, good morning.
Shar Pourreza : Good morning. Calvin, starting with Illinois, I mean the team has had a few months now to digest the order. You're not alone in facing sort of that disorder from the ICC. I mean, both the electric and gas guys have throttled investments and they've laid off workers. I guess what did you guys miss heading into that final order? But really more importantly, why is this current distribution spend now appropriate? Is it a floor kind of positioned for upside in Jeanne's comments for 2024 kind of broad with upside and downside. So just trying to handicap the path forward with this new guidance. Thanks.
Calvin Butler: Yes. Thank you, Shar. And as both Jeanne and I expressed, disappointment with the outcome. And the disappointment, I'll frame it first, that despite the high level of engagement with stakeholders, and the administration around the state's policy and alignment. And with the passage of the Climate Equitable and Jobs Act, the work that the team put in, and I need to give credit to Joe Jonas and his team for the amount of effort that they put in. Let me take a moment to remind you of the steps that we're taking leading up to that final order, and we were tracking. Leading up January 2023 filing, Shar, we participated in 15 ICC led workshops with hundreds of participants. We responded to more than 10,000 data requests during that 11-month rate process, and we ended up with a proposed order that granted almost 80% -- 79% or so of our revenue requirement ask with only a $350 million gap in rate base or about 2% by 2027. But part of that process with all those stakeholders, the one group that we hadn't heard from was the Illinois Commerce Commission themselves. Well, now we have. And our job is to align with what they are requesting. And we jumped right back in, as Jeanne outlined, into that stakeholder process. Jill and his team are meeting on a regular basis with those stakeholders to lay it out and to meet the objectives that seizure requires and what the commissioners want. And they outlined affordability, reliability, which their common goals. Now it's just a matter of how do we get there. So to your question, what confidence do we have? We are building a plan to achieve those goals, and we will continue to talk with those stakeholders. But as Jeanne also laid out, we are ready to pivot if required. What I can tell you with assurance is that this 5% to 7% earnings growth is premised on multiple outcomes. We're taking those things into consideration, and we'll be able to make those adjustments. But we're going to put together and are putting together a plan to meet all of those objectives. But let me just be very clear. Our priorities are the following: provides safe and reliable electricity for the citizens of Illinois and maintain a healthy, financially strong company. In that partnership, we think we can achieve there. We can achieve those goals. And we don't believe those goals are any different than the Illinois Commerce Commission. We heard their voice, and now we're leaning into that discussion. Jeanne, anything you'd like to add?
Jeanne Jones: Yes. I'll just update. I think I'll address Shar's second part of that question. So 2024 to your point, Shar, we've provided a guidance range with a midpoint that assumes the 12-14-2023 order. We have the rehearing process going on, which is about an interim revenue requirement while the grid plan is being approved. And then we have the grid plan process, which will kick off and we filed that on March 13. Depending on those outcomes, there could be upside to the 2024, if we get an interim revenue requirement or a grid plan move, but the midpoint assumes the December order. Now beyond 2024, we did approve the -- or sorry, we did assume that the grid plan would be approved. It is a great plan that, as Calvin mentioned, is focused on safe, reliable operations and alignment on the progress in CEJA it's lower, right? We're not going to be able to make as much progress on CEJA just given the unfavorable economics. But we do want to make progress and we will. Now there is not a set time line for the commission to opine on the grid plan. But we are, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are optimistic it gets done this year. The commission stated that in their order in December that they understand the sense of urgency. And so while it does assume that the grid plan is approved, 2025 to 2027, we are prepared if we cannot get alignment to make further reductions and still deliver.
Shar Pourreza: Perfect. I appreciate it. Let me leave at that. Thank you guys.
Calvin Butler: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Nicholas Campanella from Barclays.
Nicholas Campanella: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. So I guess just to, kind of, clarify on the CapEx plan. I mean the plan is $3 billion can change higher, to your point. I guess your 2026 rate base does seem like it is lower, though plan-over-plan. So I guess, could you just help us clarify what's maybe driving that? I know there's probably some moving pieces in the starting point for ComEd rate base, but yes.
Jeanne Jones: Yeah, it's really the difference between the distribution. So pulling back on the distribution investments and then replacing it with transmission. We talked about it in the prepared remarks. There's kind of two slices of it. There's the awards we've been talking about, the brand insurers and the ARTEP window, where, those projects will close in 2028 and at the end of 2028 for brand insurers and then 2030 for the ARTEP window. And so those will go into rate base outside of the planning period. And so as we move distribution out and layer those in, you're not seeing the 1:1 offset rate base. We do have other transmission that will close within the period, but it is back-end loaded. And as you know, transmission doesn't have, even if it's closed within that you're right, it doesn't have the same impact of distribution. So it's really just the shift that we made from D2C.
Nicholas Campanella: That's helpful. I appreciate that. And then, I guess, maybe you can help us understand on the financing, really not much equity to do in 2024. Just where does your balance sheet stand for 2024 relative to the agency minimums? And just what's the feedback been from the agencies on this new plan and maintaining the stable outlook? Thanks.
Jeanne Jones: Yeah. Yeah, no problem. So I think the message is consistent with how we talked about it last year. So we had said over the planning period, we expect to be at 100 basis points of cushion absent CMT. And if we get the corporate alternative tax alleviated, we'd be back into the middle of that range. Obviously, a couple of things happened since we last spoken, first, the ComEd order. And with that order, we did see an impact to our balance sheet. We then mitigated that impact largely, not one-for-one, but we had a substantial mitigation through the reduction of the distribution spend as well as O&M reductions and looking at pension contributions and other things to pull all the things we could to make sure we got back up and mitigate as much as we could, a large portion of that ComEd order. The other piece was layering in the new capital. As we layered in that new capital and funding it with about 40% equity, we were able to maintain that cushion that we wanted, right, that 100 basis. Now if you think about it from a year-over-year perspective, as we've also talked about in the past, I think we expect the front-end of the plan to be a little bit lower, particularly on the Moody's side, still about the threshold. But lower in 2024 and getting better over the planning period, mostly due to some of the cash recovery regulatory mechanisms like the formula rate true-up for 2023 that will come in 2025. And then -- so that kind of -- that's why we show you that average but at the average of 13%. And then again, I would say the impact of the equity starts to sort of build on itself. And so as you get to the back end of the planning period and beyond, that is helpful in terms of continuing to bolster that cushion. But then also as those transmission projects close, the cash flows, they are also beneficial to the metrics. Yeah. Okay. Thanks, Nick.
Nicholas Campanella: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for next question. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research.
Calvin Butler: Hey, Steve.
Steve Fleishman: Excuse me. Hi. Good morning. So just I know you're engaging with a lot of the parties, as you said, in Illinois. Just -- is there any chance you could settle some of these issues? Or do we need to just let the commission kind of on everything? And is there any -- beyond just the order they gave, is there any opportunity to get better sense from them, the commission level, what they want, are we just going to have to kind of wait for a fine water, again?
Calvin Butler: Yes. No, thank you, Steve. I'll start with this, and then I have with me Gil Quiniones, who's the CEO of ComEd to really be in here as well. My view on this settlement, as I mentioned, Gil and his team are engaged with the stakeholders. We may read some settlement in discussions with stakeholders about what they're looking for, and we would submit it to the commission. But I think overall, a settlement in principle on the rate case, I think, is unlikely. The process will continue to play out. And the fact that, we are in the midst of a pending proceeding, we cannot speak directly nor should we, with the commissioners themselves. So our view of what they -- where they stand came in the form of their December 14 order, and we have a clear understanding. But what we can do and what we are doing is engaging with staff. Consistently talking again as we did for the last two years. We're back reengaged in that process. And what we are providing them and sharing with them and then I'll turn it over to Gil is under the tenets of the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act. The need to align policy and practice, what the law says and what we need to do to carry it out seek some alignment between the legislative body and the commission to accomplish the shared goals of all of us. And that is our conversation from day one, and that will continue to be based on the feedback that they've given. Gil, anything you want to add?
Gil Quiniones: Yeah. Calvin, and Steve, what's different now is that it's very clear in the final order what they identified as things that complied with the law and things that the commission things there are gaps. So one-by-one, we are making sure that we're addressing those gaps in the final order. Second, as Calvin said, we're working very closely with staff and each of the intervenors in this case to make sure that we have alignment. In some cases, some intervenors have very specific areas that they would like for us to address. And as Calvin said, in those cases, we may have alignment where we can stipulate in our testimony that we have arrived at an agreement with those specific issues. So, we're making sure that we are addressing what the final order set, where the gaps are. We're working very closely with staff to make sure we have alignment with them. and then we're working with each of the intervenors in the case for their very specific issues that they want included in our grid plan.
Steve Fleishman: Okay, great. Thank you.
Calvin Butler: Thank you, Steve.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. 
Calvin Butler: Hey Julien.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey good morning team. Hey great. Appreciate it. Just wanted to follow-up real quickly on some of the Nick's cash questions real quickly. Can you guys comment a little bit? I mean, FFO looking through the four-year window here, a little bit better than the prior plan. And that's in spite of obviously some of the rate base dynamics, et cetera, but it looks like a $2 billion bump to CFO there helps the balance sheet. But can you talk about that a little bit further here? And then also maybe if you can to elaborate on some of the earlier questions, I mean, where do you guys overall within the plan? I know that you articulated here given years up and down. But overall, are you in the lower end or the midpoint, if you will, of the updated EPS?
Calvin Butler: So, let me take the last part first, and then I'll turn it over to Jeanne. So, as we talk about the 5% to 7% earnings growth, we are committed to midpoint or better. And I think Jeanne even referenced at least, right? So, this is a plan that we've put together that's very prudent and our ability to achieve it. And we've demonstrated as an organization, we can take on headwind and continue to meet the target. As I said, Julien, I'm so proud of the team and the commitments made and commitments kept, right? And we will continue to do that. You think about what we had to overcome in 2023 to deliver in excess of our midpoint to $2.38. So, that's the commitment there. And I'll let Jeanne talk about the additional equity and balance sheet and so forth.
Jeanne Jones: Yes. And then Julien -- we do also continue to show you, Julien, in the year-by-year, which gets you to that midpoint or better. So, again, there will still be some years above the range, years within the range, all within the range, but some different points to get you to that mid-screen or better, as Calvin mentioned, that side continues in the deck. On the balance sheet, I guess, I would characterize a little bit different. I think we're consistent with where we were. So, we had expected to be at the 100 basis points of cushion. We expect to continue to contain that 100 basis points. We largely mitigated the ComEd order through our own internal levers. And then as we layered in the capital to maintain that cushion, we funded it in a balanced way by layering in that 40% of every new dollar of equity.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. And through the plan, you're assuming consistent authorized equity ratios and returns to get to that midpoint or better?
Jeanne Jones: We are assuming the authorized, yes, for each of the jurisdictions on the cap structure.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes, cap structure and ROE, yes, indeed. Excellent. Well, I will leave it there guys. Thank you very much.
Calvin Butler: Thank you, Julien.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our last question comes from the line of Ross Fowler from UBS.
Ross Fowler : Good morning, Calvin. Good morning, Jeanne. So I want to acknowledge before I ask my question, that there is upside to the unit process, but I wanted to spend a minute on, Jeanne, I think what you talked about is the downside to the forecast and the risks in Illinois versus the plan. You did a great job mitigating some of that today with the transmission CapEx to replace sort of the distribution CapEx. But that was a lot of brownfield transmission that we've been talking about for a while and even that is sort of back-end loaded in the forecast and greenfield would presumably take even longer. So maybe you can continue to do that if there's downside to distribution CapEx in that ComEd in the plan, but what are the other levers that you could pull here? Is that lower equity as CapEx declines? Is that lower O&M? How do I think about what levers you have at your disposal to sort of offset that downside risk should that be out coming Illinois?
Jeanne Jones : Yes. I think I get a couple of parts there. I would say, one, for every plan that we put forth always prudently include some sort of for lack of a better word, cushion, right? So we're not -- we've got a bunch of scenarios that we're modeling and we're making sure that we can deliver regardless of where the final grid plan comes out. I would say at the low ROEs, right? It takes a lot of capital at ComEd, to make it on the distribution side to make it a meaningful impact up or down, and we're prepared to pull back if we need to. And to your point then, that could have further impacts from a financing savings and other things. Obviously, we would always look for O&M levers as well as we have done in the past. I would say we -- portion of the transmission that we added, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, was not what we had talked about, it was new opportunities that we had on the list at ComEd related to the high-density localized low growth there on the data centers, continuing to modernize that portion of the grid. So these are needs that need to be addressed on our system. The other thing I would say is, as we talked about before, while we have the two opportunities that we mentioned, we continue to see where we operate in our jurisdiction potential for further transmission related to interconnection of offshore wind, whether it's the Maryland executive orders, the New Jersey executive orders. As those projects are built, given our footprint, we stand to be competitive for that. So I think there's other opportunities that exist. And the plan reflects the upside from continuing to execute on the grid plan, but also the ability to pull back. We also don't assume any of the performance metrics, right? I think we're going to make sure our growth plan is also set up to be able to capture some of those. Obviously, that's a metric, but we're going to do a work real hard to get some of that, and that's not included in the plan either.
Calvin Butler : Yes. And if I can just add, Ross, I think on what's critical, what Jeanne has said is that understanding Illinois is just one of our many jurisdictions in which we operate and what we continue to demonstrate in terms of the value of Exelon is our scale and size and the jurisdictions and the opportunities that exist across our platform. We always talk about the power of the platform, and you saw it flexed in 2023, and you'll see it flexed over our long-range plan from 2024 to 2027. So Illinois is a focal area. And as I shared with you, it's a priority for all of us. I know Gil and his team are fixed on it, but we have other businesses that we will continue to run and as always, manage our costs and to ensure that we do it in a very pragmatic basis. Thank you for the question.
Ross Fowler: Sure. Thanks, Calvin. Appreciate it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, I would now like to turn the conference back over to Calvin Butler, Exelon's President and CEO, for closing remarks.
Calvin Butler: Gigi, thank you very much. And more importantly, thank you to everyone for joining today's call. We look forward to seeing many of you in 2024 and as committed for the upcoming spring conferences, Jeanne and I and Andy, the IR team will be on the road. They promised me that we'd be doing that. So thank you, and I look forward to engaging with all of you. But more importantly, I just want to say to the 19,500 employees here at Exelon. Thank you for everything that you guys do each and every day. So proud of the performance that we delivered in 2023, and I know we're just getting started. So with that, Gigi, that concludes today's call.
Operator: Thanks to all our participants for joining us today. This concludes our presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-11-02 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to Exelon's Third Quarter Earnings Call. My name is Gigi, and I'll be your event specialist today. [Operator Instructions]. It is now my pleasure to turn today's program over to Andrew Plunge, Vice President of Investor Relations. The floor is yours.
Andrew Plenge: Thank you, Gigi, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to have you with us for our 2023 third quarter earnings call. Leading the call today are in Calvin Butler, Exelon's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jeanne Jones, Exelon's Chief Financial Officer. Other members of Exelon's senior management team are also with us today and they will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks.  Today's presentation, along with our earnings release and other financial information can be found in the Investor Relations section of Exelon's website. We would also like to remind you that today's presentation and the associated earnings release materials contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. You can find the cautionary statements on these risks on Slide 2 of today's presentation or in our SEC filings.  In addition, today's presentation includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. between these measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of our presentation and in our earnings release. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Calvin Butler, Exelon's President and CEO.
Calvin Butler: Thank you, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you listening to our third quarter earnings call. Despite historically mild first 9 months of the year and pressures from storms in August and September, we delivered earnings right in line with the expectations laid out in our last earnings call. For the quarter, as you can see on Slide 4, we we earned $0.70 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.67 per share a non-GAAP basis. With the critical summer season behind us, we have narrowed our guidance range to $2.32 to to $2.40 per share for 2023. Jeanne will talk more about our results for the quarter and expected financial performance for the balance of the year. Operational performance across the platform remained very strong in the third quarter. With storms that brought 110-mile per hour wind gust and 29 major event days that impacted almost 1.3 million customers, we not only kept our financial plan on track but we also continued our track record of top quartile reliability performance, and we continue to make progress in safety and customer satisfaction.  The third quarter also brought continued execution of key milestones in our 6 active base rate cases underway in Illinois, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey and the District of Columbia. Beginning with ComEd, we received a proposed order from the ALJ on its multiyear rate and grid plan on October '23. We're encouraged that the proposed order recognizes that meeting the ambitious electrification and decarbonization goals set by Illinois groundbreaking Climate and Equitable Jobs Act will require ComEd to make significant investments and it largely follows an investment plan that has alignment across a broad group of stakeholders. But the order does not recognize a fair cost of financing that investment. It provides a return on equity that is well below the national average. It does not recognize the significant investment we have made in our pension which supports ComEd's employees and has saved customers almost $1 billion to date with its returns and continues to generate savings for our customers. And it does not allow for a prudent capitalization of the business, has equity ratios below an appropriate level. So we are disappointed with elements of the proposed order, but we expect the commission will consider the full record developed when writing its final order. And we continue to make our case with stakeholders.  As a reminder, we expect to receive the final order in mid-December. As it pertains to BGE, all parties have filed their briefs and we now await a final order from the Maryland Public Service Commission expected on December 14. We have put forward a strong investment plan to address the needs of our customers that is aligned with the state's ambitious goals to advance the energy transformation. We remain optimistic that the commission will reach a constructive outcome that appropriately supports our customers and the state's goals laid out in the Climate Solutions Now Act.  As you will hear from Jeanne, we also made progress in the Atlantic City Electric rate case, where a stipulation of settlement awaits final approval. The Delmarva Power and Electric rate case is progressing as well. along with the Pepco DC and Pepco Maryland multiyear rate plans. On our longer-term outlook, we continue to reaffirm our existing guidance. We expect to be at the midpoint or better of our 6% to 8% annualized earnings growth ranges and to grow the dividend in line with those earnings. The capital we are investing across our jurisdictions to support the needs of our customers in their energy transformation is what drives that growth.  On Tuesday, PJM selected project proposal submitted for the competitive transmission proposal Window 3. Exelon's proposed transmission projects were among a set of solutions to maintain reliability in the Maryland, Pennsylvania and Virginia areas, driven by significant load increases in Northern Virginia. Specifically, PJM has recommended a suite of solutions that include a scope of work for Exelon that is estimated to cost approximately $850 million, with portions assigned to BGE and PECO, Pepco and Delmarva Power. As this spend is weighted toward the back end of the decade with expected completion dates of 2029 and 2030, that extend beyond the current guidance range, it provides another good indication of the trends in place and degree of work that the grid will require well into the future.  I'll also note 2 additional exciting developments this quarter that support our jurisdictions energy goals. First, ComEd, PECO and Pepco were part of 2 coalitions receiving hydrogen hub awards in our service territories. These projects will go a long way toward accelerating access to clean and affordable hydrogen to meet the nation's ambitious carbon reduction goals and creating thousands of clean energy jobs in Exelon service territories. Second, the U.S. Department of Energy recommended 2 of Exelon submissions in the grid resiliency and innovation partnership program for negotiation of a final award, totaling $150 million across our ComEd and PECO utilities. ComEd will direct its $50 million award to enable customers and partners to deploy next-generation technologies for growing solar installations and electric vehicles. And PECO is leveraging its $100 million award to enhance resiliency in vulnerable areas of PECO service territory that are susceptible to severe weather events. When combined with the middle mile grants that BGE and ComEd were awarded by the National Telecom and Information Administration, Exelon Utilities are approaching $200 million in total a federally funded IIJA grant awards this year, not to mention the amount directed towards its jurisdictions through vehicles like the EPA's Clean School Bus program.  The federal support is critical to supporting an affordable and equitable transition. The need transmission expansion, the investment in new energy supply and the ever-increasing need for a more resilient grid all highlight the impact that an economy that is increasingly dependent on electricity will have on our investment plan. The energy transformation will last decades not years, which is why we're confident that investment opportunities will continue to strengthen and lengthen our rate base growth. We look forward to incorporating these updates into our annual financial update on the fourth quarter earnings call next February.  I'll now speak to our operating performance in the third quarter on Slide 5. Reliability remains outstanding. All 4 utility operating companies had top quartile performance in both reduced outage frequency and shortened ops duration. COMED operated in the top decile for both metrics. In fact, ComEd and PHI again, achieved best on-record outage frequency and duration performance, which makes for the third quarter in a row for those 2 operating companies. Performance like this is particularly impressive when you consider the level of storm activity we experienced this quarter, which is a testament to the investments we're making in the system and the talented, dedicated employees working this system.  As an example, in just one damaging storm, BGE crews replaced 32 miles of wire and 82 transformers, and they did it 36 hours faster than historical models predicted was possible. That commitment to operational excellence across the Exelon franchise is a key part of what makes us who we are. And our gas operations are keeping pace. All 3 gas utility operating companies, again continued to perform at top decile levels for gas response. And as it pertains to customer satisfaction, while 3 of our utility operating companies continue to benchmark in the second quartile, PECO has progressed to the first quartile. Our improved benchmarking performance at PECO reflects the benefits of those efforts, and all utility operating companies did see increases in their scores. But as we have mentioned, overall satisfaction has been affected by inflation and sunsetting pandemic era relief relative to the benchmark year.  The headwinds facing our customers are real, which is why we are focused on ensuring customers are aware of their options to manage their energy use and reduce their bills. We look to build on increasing satisfaction levels into 2024.  Last, we saw improvement in our safety performance benchmark at PHI versus the second quarter. We continue to focus on the areas of underperformance and implement utility-specific action plans to address the higher OSHA rates. And you can see that with PHI scores, where our efforts to reinforce procedures, situation awareness and crew communication has yielded results. And we are also continuing in partnership with the industry to drive a more sophisticated discussion and set of tools around safety to focus employees on which behaviors will most impactfully improve safety and ensure we do our most important job, making sure each employee returns home safely after every shift. I assure you that we will continue to push for excellence across all areas of our operations as we close out 2023.  I will now turn it to Jeanne to review our financial performance and regulatory updates.
Jeanne Jones: Thank you, Calvin, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover our third quarter financial update, along with the outlook for the balance of 2023 and our progress on the 2023 rate case schedule. I will also highlight a recently completed transmission rebuild project by Delmarva Power & Light designed to further improve reliability for our customers in Eastern Maryland.  Starting on Slide 6, we show our quarter-over-quarter adjusted operating earnings. As Calvin mentioned, Exelon earned $0.67 per share in the third quarter of 2023 versus $0.75 in the third quarter of 2022, reflecting lower results of $0.08 per share over the same period. Results of $0.67 in the third quarter represent 28% of our expected full year earnings, which is right in line with the expectations provided on the prior earnings call.  Earnings are lower in the third quarter relative to the same period last year, driven primarily by $0.07 from the impact of weather and storms and summer activity returning to normal in '23, $0.04 of higher interest expense due to the rise in interest rates and higher levels of debt at the holding company and at some of our utilities and $0.03 of O&M tax and distribution formula rate timing expected to reverse in the fourth quarter. This was partially offset by $0.05 of higher distribution in transmission rates associated with incremental investments, net of depreciation as well as the $0.01 up carrying costs related to the carbon mitigation credit balance at ComEd.  Despite the summer storms and mild weather impacting our nondecoupled jurisdictions, we have delivered year-to-date earnings each quarter in line with indications and we continue to offset the weather headwinds with a combination of O&M levers across the platform, higher treasury rates impacting ComEd's distribution ROE, favorable depreciation of PECO and the full year earnings impact of the carrying costs associated with the CMC regulatory asset balance.  With one quarter remaining in the year, we are narrowing our 2023 EPS guidance range to $2.32 to $2.40 per share from $2.30 to $2.42 per share. Our full year guidance accounts for the absence of proactive derisking that occurred in the fourth quarter of '22, the reversal of year-to-date O&M tax and distribution formula rate timing and the anticipated onetime impact in December of BGE's reconciliation for the 2021 and 2022 under recovery. Through continued increase in rate base as we deploy capital for the benefit of our customers, along with managing work plans across the platform, we remain on track to deliver earnings within expectations. Recall, our goal is the way to achieve the midpoint or better of the guidance range. Lastly, we are reaffirming the fully regulated operating EPS compounded annual growth target of 6% to 8% from 2021 and 2022 guidance and plans through 2025 and 2026, respectively. Again, our expectation is to be at the midpoint or better of that growth range.  Turning to Slide 7. As Calvin mentioned, we continue to execute in all 6 open distribution rate case proceedings this quarter, in line with the established procedural federal. Each rate case remains on track, and we are approaching the final key milestones in December, ComEd and BGE's multiyear rate plan rate cases.  Let me begin with key developments since the last call. First, DPL Delaware received intermediary testimony and filed a rebuttal supporting the key elements of the company's proposed electric distribution revenue requirement increase of $39.3 million. DPL Delaware will continue to establish that the proposed plan is necessary to continue providing safe and reliable service, meet customer expectations and support Delaware clean energy goals while balancing customer affordability. A final order is expected in the second quarter of 2024.  Second, we are pleased with the progress in Atlantic City Electric's distribution rate case with the stipulation of settlement in place, the procedural schedule was suspended in early September. On October 21, ACE filed a stipulation of settlement with the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities. And on October 24, the administrative law judge presiding over the case recommended the settlement with all parties be approved. ACE anticipates final approval of the settlement from the BPU in the fourth quarter.  Next, the procedural schedule in Pepco's DC multiyear rate plan filing has been adjusted to accommodate the commission's request for supplemental testimony from Pepco. Similar to the commission's request from its personal plan, this directive provides Pepco the opportunity to demonstrate the benefits afforded by multiyear rate plans relative to traditional rate making. Pepco now expects to receive intervenor testimony on December 11, and evidentiary hearings will take place in March 2024, with the final order expected from the Public Service Commission of the District of Columbia by mid-2024. While still in the discovery phase of its second multiyear rate plan filing, Pepco Maryland continues to detail for its proposed investment plan designed to advance the state's climate and clean energy goals. Upcoming milestones include intervenor testimony expected to be filed by the Maryland Public Service Commission staff on December 15 and the evidentiary hearing set to begin in March 2024. Briefs will be filed in April of '24, and and we expect a final order by June of 2024.  Additionally, in Maryland, evidentiary hearings were conducted and brief filed in September and October, respectively, as part of BGE's pending multiyear electric and gas rate case. The hearings allow parties to share perspectives on the proposed investments, their alignment with the goals of the state and how best to balance the state's goals around the energy transformation, affordability and customers' interest. As expected, the Maryland Commission continues to prioritize safety, reliability and affordability. And it is also focused on addressing the goals of the Climate Solutions Now Act. We continue to believe BGE's proposed investment plans are well suited for Maryland to meet its aggressive clean energy goals in an affordable manner. The proceeding is expected to run its full course with the final order expected from the commission by December 14.  Moving on to ComEd's multiyear rate plan proceeding. As you heard from Calvin, the administrative law judges presiding over a case issued a proposed order on October 23. While the ALJ's proposed order recognizes that ComEd must undertake significant infrastructure investments to meet the state's clean energy goals, it does not fairly recognize ComEd's cost of financing to do so, especially in the current interest rate environment. We continue to believe the evidence on record supports ComEd's requests on ROE, capital structure and a return on its pension assets, among other factors, to provide a clear path in achieving a cleaner energy future for our customers and communities in Illinois.  But while we are disappointed in the proposal, let me remind you that this is just another data point in the process and is nonbinding on the commission. Given the number of variables that play in the transition to a multiyear plan, our current plan contemplates a range of fair and reasonable scenarios in the final order to achieve the state's aggressive decarbonization and electrification goals. We look forward to the remaining steps in the process, including filing briefed on exception by November 8, reply briefs on exception by November 20 and participating in oral arguments, which we anticipate will occur in late November. Each of these avenues will provide ComEd the opportunity to demonstrate the facts on key elements that are supported on the record and advocate for our position, which we continue to believe are in the best interest of customers and aligned with the state's energy policy goals. A final order is expected at the last scheduled ICC meeting of the year on December 14, but due no later than December 20.  Relationships across our jurisdictions remain constructive, and we remain steadfast in our engagement with key stakeholders across the regulatory bodies, the state legislators and the communities to support our shared interest in the energy transformation. As a reminder, by next year, we expect to have a resolution on all 4 of the ongoing multiyear rate plans in Illinois, Maryland and D.C., which will support their respective clean energy and climate goals while balancing customer affordability and equity. More details on the rate cases can be found on Slides 20 to 26 of the appendix.  Moving to Slide 8. During the third quarter, we continue to deploy capital for the benefit of our customers and are on track to invest $7.2 billion expected for 2023. These investments are designed to deliver answers to an expanding set of needs for tomorrow's spread: enhance customer value, adapt to climate change, meet heightened resilience and reliability challenges and modernize outmoded systems and equipment just to mention a few. These also support our communities. Today, I specifically would like to highlight how Delmarva Power's recently completed East New Market to Cambridge, transmission upgrade project in Maryland is meeting those needs.  Construction to rebuild the transmission equipment began in late fall of 2021. This $40 million project included upgrading more than 11 miles of existing transmission line with new wire and installing 189 galvanized steel poles, replacing wood poles is new, longer-lasting steel utility poles, strengthens the local energy grid and reduces the number of transmission poles along the route. These more reliable structures are also designed to withstand severe weather conditions, a vital design element as climate changes contributed to the increased intensity of coastal storms. For perspective, steel poles can withstand 120-mile power hurricane force winds in blizzard conditions, an increase of up to 20% compared to wood poles. Together, these important upgrades, which were placed in service in May 2023, are expected to help prevent outages and enhance overall reliability for more than 13,000 residents of SirkCounty, Maryland. Projects such as this transmission rebuild contributed to the nearly 30% decrease in electric outage frequency, our DPL Maryland customers have experienced over the last 5 years.  The East New market to Cambridge project is just 1 example of our broader strategic effort to strengthen and modernize the energy grid across all of our service areas. We continue to see significant need for transmission investments to support state and customer goals on renewable energy and electrification. This demand supplements more traditional transmission expansion needs, including congestion relief, operational performance requirements, infrastructure resilience, equipment, material condition and customer service. As Calvin mentioned, we look forward to providing our annual financial update, inclusive of the newly awarded transmission upgrade spend from PJM as well as the final rate orders in Illinois and Maryland on the fourth quarter earnings call in February 2024.  I will conclude with a review of our balance sheet activity on Slide 9. As a reminder, we continue to project a 100 to 200 basis points of cushion on average of our guidance period for our consolidated corporate credit metrics above S&P and Moody's downgrade thresholds of 12%, demonstrating our commitment to maintaining a strong balance sheet. If the corporate alternative minimum tax is not mitigated through an inclusion of repairs in its calculation, we anticipate being at 100 basis points or at the lower end of that range. While our plan incorporates the assumption that the corporate alternative minimum tax will not allow for repairs, we remain optimistic that it will be implemented in a way that mitigates the cash impact. We continue to anticipate the treasury will issue more guidance on the corporate alternative minimum tax before year-end.  From a financing perspective, I will remind you that we completed all our planned debt financing needs for 2023 as of the second quarter call, reducing earnings volatility in the second half of the year. In managing the interest rate volatility, we continue the pre-issuance hedging and floating rate cap programs that were initiated last year. In addition, we continuously monitor the capital markets and regularly assess our plans for future issuance timing, sizing, tenor and tranching strategy to ensure we always achieve optimal outcomes. Additional detail on our earnings sensitivities reflective of our hedging activity to date is provided on Slide 18 in the appendix.  Lastly, there have been no changes in our guidance to issue $425 million of equity at the holding company by 2025. As we work with our jurisdictions and identify needs for further investment at the utilities, including those assigned by PJM, we will continue and ensure that we maintain a strong balance sheet, consistent with the expectations of a premium T&D company while supporting our 6% to 8% annualized earnings growth rate. Thank you. I'll now turn the call back to Calvin for his closing remarks.
Calvin Butler: Thank you, Jeanne. With just a couple of months left to go in 2023, I'll conclude with a reminder of our goals and priorities for the year. First, our foundation is operational excellence, which benefits our customers and communities. As I mentioned, our employees rose to the challenges they always do for our summer storms, but we're ready to close out the year strong to prove we have the best operators in the business. Indeed, PA Consulting just awarded ComEd with its 2022 Reliability One National Reliability Award, one of the most prestigious honors in the electric utility industry, recognizing it for sustained leadership, innovation and achievement in the area of electric reliability. This award highlights the value of a committed operating team executing on a sophisticated operating plan and investment strategy provides the customers the grid that they deserve.  I now want to take a moment to just recognize Terry Donnelley, COO of ComEd. Terry will be retiring at the end of this year after almost 12 years in that position. Terry thank you for his continued steadfast leadership and also the selection between him and Gil Kionas of David Perez, who is stepping in as a longtime Senior VP into the role of Chief Operating Officer. We have high expectations of date that they will continue to deliver on the operational performance that Illinois customers have come to expect.  We are also focused on completing a number of the rate cases we have underway, including BGE's multiyear plan for its gas and electric systems as well as ComEd's multiyear rate and grid investment plans. We continue to believe that parties in both cases have a shared interest in reaching outcomes that align with the state's energy policy and equity goals while ensuring we have the certainty and confidence to make the investments needed to serve our customers reliably. The Climate and Equitable Jobs Act was passed in 2021, with the promise of making Illinois a leader in the energy transformation. The approval of these first electric multiyear plans are a key moment for the state to advance its clean energy goals and follow the thoughtful ambitious plan and process the state laid out in the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act. We are optimistic that the state of Illinois will seize the opportunity.  Third, we will finish out the year meeting our financial guidance, narrowing our guidance range to $2.32 to $2.40 per share demonstrates the confidence we have in executing despite the historically mild weather this year, and we remain on track to invest $7.2 billion of capital and earned consolidated ROE in the 9% to 10% range. Lastly, we never want to lose sight of our responsibility to our customers and communities as the premier transmission distribution utility. Just this past quarter, ComEd and PECO were 2 of only 6 utilities to partner with local governments and community-based groups to win DOE support from its Clean Energy to Communities program. Through this program, ComEd will help explore low carbon transportation technologies for Chicago, like freight travel electrification, while PECO will assist in creating a regional hub to streamline procurement of the most impactful clean energy technologies for the Delaware Valley region. BGE awarded grants to 41 nonprofit organizations in Maryland to support environmental stewardship programs. And Pepco energized the first of 3 substations as part of its capital grid project which is Pepco's forward-looking plan to upgrade or add substations and underground transmission cable to modernize and strengthen our nation capitals grid. In doing so, Pepco was able to provide $29 million to local suppliers and $30 million to diverse suppliers as part of the work to complete that substation. And those examples show whether it's providing direct support to our customers, our community organizations, facilitating access to support from federal or national organizations or ensuring our work on the grid benefits our jurisdictions end-to-end, the Exelon team is focused on ensuring all of its actions are intentional in serving the greater purpose of leading the energy transformation.  These goals are what make for premier T&D utility, one that embraces the opportunity to lead the energy transformation partners with its jurisdictions to achieve their goals, uplift its communities and meets the expectations laid out for the investment community, offering a total shareholder return of 9% to 11%.  Thank you, as always, for your interest. I'll now turn it to Gigi for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of James Kennedy from Guggenheim Partners.
James Kennedy: So starting off, I guess, with the ALJ order in Illinois. Calvin, you mentioned your expectations that the commission will consider the full record, I guess, is the draft the final order. I realized you've been in a formula construct for a while, but is there any prior precedent for the ICC to make those kind of departures from the ALJ? Just trying to understand the prospects here for vision and your confidence level.
Calvin Butler: Yes. First off, James, thank you for your question. And there is precedent. The record is going to be considered by the full commission. But the commission definitely has leeway to look at the record separately, taking an advisement what the ALJ has said. But also keep in mind, this is the first time that this commission has come together under a multiyear rate plan and grid plan to consider how ComEd's proposals meet the state's goals. So I do -- they do know there's a difference in opinion on how to approach this. And I think they will take that all in consideration because we have 3 new commissioners And they will lean into this discussion and look at what they need to do to achieve the state's goals, which are very specific. And I have Gil Ciona, the CEO comment with me. Gil, anything you'd like to add?
Unidentified Company Representative: Yes. I think it's also important to note that this is really -- it's a key milestone in the process, but there are 4 other milestones coming up as both Calvin and Jeanne mentioned, the briefs to the commission and exceptions, replies to those briefs and oral arguments before the final order. As Calvin said, we feel strong conviction that the evidence on record supports ComEd's requests. And based on what the commissioners have done in the past, we anticipate that they will make adjustments and corrections before they issue a final order. We expect the commission will not only consider post order, but the entirety of the record in the case and the policies of the state. It is an historic once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and we believe the commission will meet the moment in advancing the ambitious goals of the Climate Equitable Jobs Act and the state's economic development aspirations.
Jeanne Jones: Does that answer your question, James?
James Kennedy: Yes. And then just, maybe one for Jeanne. Just -- on the remaining equity need in the current plan, I guess, if you don't get the minimum tax clarity you're looking for from the IRS, would you need to accelerate the need into '24? Or does '25 mean '25? Just any additional color on timing?
Jeanne Jones: Yes. No, everything we've given you assumes that we pay, the corporate alternative minimum tax. And so regardless of how that turns out, our commitment is to do the 425 million between now and 2025. So that doesn't change regardless of the outcome here.
James Kennedy: Okay. And then just real quickly, the transition spend today, that is purely incremental to the 870 you debuted on the last call related to stores, right?
Jeanne Jones: Yes. There are two similar numbers, but two different projects.
Operator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of David Arcaro from Morgan Stanley.
David Arcaro: Maybe on that same topic, with the transmission projects that has selected. Could you elaborate a bit on which year the CapEx would start to flow into the spending plan? And also, just as you think about PJM and potential competitive opportunities going forward, are there future opportunities that you plan to bid into also?
Calvin Butler: Yes, David. I'll start, but then I'll turn it over to David Velazquez, who's here with me that has our transmission strategy group reporting up to him and working with all the opcos. As I mentioned, I believe our transmission buildout has tremendous opportunity to not only strengthen what we're doing but also lengthen our earnings growth and doing it in a way that ensures not only reliability but the ability to connect renewables to the grid. And David and his team have put together a robust plan, and I'll let him take a moment to walk you through.
David Velazquez: So David, this is Dave So on the transmission projects, like, to give you a sense, we have brand insurers, which was the project we talked about by last quarter, which has an in-service date in the end of 2028. So you think about cash flows there, and again, you have to recognize we're in preliminary engineering yet, so this is liable to move a little bit. But I figure typically like in the last couple of years, '27, '28, you spent somewhere around 40% to 50% of that expenditure. And then leading up to it starting next year, you'd slowly ramp into it. In the first 3 years, you'd spend somewhere again between 50% and 60% of the project. And the Dominion, which has an in-service date part of it in '29, part of it is '30, I think you'd see a similar profile where in the last couple of years, you probably see around 40% to 50% of the expenditures and 3 or 4 years leading up to that. So some of this will be within the current period and some of it will be after the current period. And I think on the broader question, as Calvin has said, there's a lot of opportunities out there. We look at every single competitive window that PJM puts out there and make decisions whether we think we can add value for our customers by presenting proposals and we will continue to do that. I think also there's other opportunities out there. Offshore wind is one. In Maryland, the commission has to issue a solicitation to help bring on some of the additional megawatts by July of next year. We continue to see a lot of load growth in our regions around data centers. There's also some hydrogen hubs that have been awarded grants from the federal government in our territories. We also continue to see some generation retirements PJM recently announced retirement of a Wagner unit -- large Wagner unit in BGE's territory. So there's a lot of different opportunities that we're looking at out there to continue to, again, for our customers and for public policy goals continue to invest in transmission.
David Arcaro: Excellent. That's really helpful. And I guess as you think about some of this incremental upside CapEx, it sounds like some of which would hit the current plan, but then also looking ahead to the next 5-year CapEx plan, how do you think about financing the next year of kind of higher CapEx growth and rate base growth, specifically thinking about how you're thinking about equity needs from here?
Jeanne Jones: Yes, it's Jeanne. I think it's how we've always thought about it. We rolled out the $31 billion on our last call. We talked about financing in a balanced approach with internal cash flows and a mix of debt and equity. And so I think to the extent we continue to see more and more work, which we know there will be. We'll finance it in a way that maintains that cushion on the balance sheet that we target, but also ensures that we meet our 6% to 8% earnings growth.
Operator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Zimbardo from Bank of America.
Paul Zimbardo: And thank you for laying out all those transmission opportunities. Just as we think about the roll forward, not the current plan, you've been very clear, but the roll forward with these incremental opportunities, is there a good way to think about financing those incremental CapEx? Is it kind of like a 50-50 mix? Or should we be thinking of something different?
Jeanne Jones: Yes. I think as I mentioned with David's earlier question, we'll do it in a balanced way. I think we've got a lot that we're pulling together here. We've got some really exciting incremental transmission opportunities. We have incremental investments from the new rate cases that we've been filing. So we're going to pull all that together as we always do in the fourth quarter and give you a full update when all of that is final. We should have some more information again at the end of the year by the corporate alternative minimum tax. We'll embed any additional cost savings that we're finding as we continue to get further out of separation. So we'll -- as I mentioned, we'll fund any new incremental capital with a mix of internal cash flows reinvesting back into the business that and to the extent necessary do what we need to do to make sure we maintain that cushion on the balance sheet but always also hit our earnings target of 6% to 8%. So we'll do it in that balance, thoughtful way.
Paul Zimbardo: Okay. Understood. And then shifting topics a little bit. Do you have an estimate for what the Illinois ComEd customer bill CAGR is like the next 5 years -- for your rate case and then I know there's the carbon mitigation credit that rolls off. So just curious how the bill trajectory is.
Jeanne Jones: Yes. On the ask, I believe it was just -- somewhere between 4% and 5% on the bill CAGR that was on ask call. And then the second part of your question was -- what was the second part on the -- as the CMCs roll off?
Paul Zimbardo: Yes. Just overall, like, again, you're only part of the bill, like what an overall ComEd customer bill trajectory looks like over the next 5 years?
Jeanne Jones: Yes. Over the next 5 -- again, on the rate case ask, it was, I think, around 4.5%, 5%.
Calvin Butler: But it's important to note, Paul, that ComEd starts below the national average in terms of overall rates. So as I like to think of the headroom within that utility to invest and move the state forward exists. One, because of the carbon mitigation credits, but also because they start from a position of strength and having some of the lowest rates in the country. I think it's roughly 23% below large city national average. That's where ComEd's in
Operator: Our last question -- one moment for our next question. Our last question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan Securities, LLC.
Aidan Kelly: It is actually Aidan Kelly on for Jeremy. Just one quick question going back to ComEd. Curious how do you reconcile the differences between the ALJ's 9.28% ROE and staff's 8.91% ROE as well as the proposed equity ratio? And then could you just talk more about where the ultimate return on pension assets debate stands?
Calvin Butler: Yes. I would tell you that, as we talked about, I'll first start with 1 step, and this is just another step in the process, as Gil laid out, coming off the world series, I think we're in the sixth inning, right? We're in the sixth inning of a long game. And that's just -- it's 1 step. Staff was one, and you saw they came in at 8.9%, talking about the formula rate, and then we get the ALJ, we were able to respond, then we get the ALJ's ruling of 9.28, so we will continue to respond to the evidence as presented and present additional data for this commission to work with. And that includes not only ROE, that includes return on pension assets. As I talked about in my statement, it warrants a return, and we have even come to an agreement with the Attorney General of Illinois, where a minimal getting a debt return. And so we continue to move forward and present the why. And I think that's the powerful part of this, Jeremy, is that when we can articulate the why and frame how it's beneficial for all customers and moving -- having a productive and efficient company that's moving the state's goals, we'll get there. So to get into the details of this -- of any other piece of this early in the process, I think we'd be inserting ourselves deeper before the full commission has a chance to hear the evidence. As Gil has laid out, we have when our next filing deal that we're presenting to them. The brief on exceptions will be on November 8, November 8. And we'll lay it out all fully Jeremy, on November 8 as to the what and the why.
Aidan Kelly: Appreciate the color there. And then just 1 quick question unrelated on the $425 million equity, would you consider ATM or follow-on there?
Jeanne Jones: We have $1 billion ATM in place. And so we can always just leverage that in kind of dollar cost average in as needed.
Operator: I would now like to turn the conference back to Calvin Butler, President and CEO, for closing remarks.
Calvin Butler: CJ, as always, thank you very much, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. We look forward to seeing many of you at the EEI Financial Conference in a week. Jeanne and the team and I, we're looking forward to just engaging with you in a more robust and deep manner at that conference. And with that, that concludes our call. Thank you very much. Have a great day.
Operator: Thanks to all our participants for joining us today. This concludes our presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-08-02 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello and welcome to Exelon’s Second Quarter Earnings Call. My name is Gigi and I’ll be your event specialist today. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn today’s program over to Andy Plenge, Vice President of Investor Relations. The floor is yours.
Andy Plenge: Thank you, Gigi and good morning everyone. We are pleased to have you with us for our 2023 second quarter earnings call. Leading the call today are Calvin Butler, Exelon’s President and Chief Executive Officer and Jeanne Jones, Exelon’s Chief Financial Officer. Other members of Exelon senior management team are also with us today and they will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. Today’s presentation, along with our earnings release and other financial information can be found in the Investor Relations section of Exelon’s website. We would also like to remind you that today’s presentation and the associated earnings release materials contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. You can find the cautionary statements on these risks on Slide 2 of today’s presentation or in our SEC filings. In addition, today’s presentation includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations between these measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of our presentation and in our earnings release. It’s now my pleasure to turn the call over to Calvin Butler, Exelon’s President and CEO.
Calvin Butler: Thank you, Andy. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. We continue delivering on our plan as expected, which is a testament of all of the work put in by our dedicated employees. But before we get into our results and business updates, I’d like to first start by acknowledging a key milestone. In July, ComEd reached the end of the 3-year term of the deferred prosecution agreement with the Department of Justice. At the court status hearing, the government moved to dismiss the charge, noting the company fully complied with the DPA, which the court granted in the hearing. We remain committed at all levels of the company to the highest standards of integrity and ethical behavior and we look forward to building on the trust of our customers as we continue to move forward. In that spirit, I am pleased to welcome Anna Richo to our Board of Directors. Anna is the General Counsel, Chief Compliance Officer and Corporate Secretary for Cargill and she brings highly complementary experience as an attorney and business leader. Her commitment to operational excellence and compliance will provide invaluable oversight. Now turning to the results for the quarter. As you can see on Slide 4, we earned $0.34 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.41 per share on a non-GAAP basis. These results are right in line with what we expected this quarter, and we remain on track to earn within our guidance range of $2.30 to $2.42 per share for 2023. We continue performing operationally at a very high level. Three of our four utilities had best on-record performance in outage frequency and outage duration, which I will touch on more on our next slide. We have also continued to progress through our rate case calendar with 6 active base rate cases underway in Illinois, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey and the District of Columbia. Most recently, on May 16, we filed our second multiyear plan for Pepco Maryland, the climate ready pathway plan. The filing outlines Pepco’s near-term proposal to advance the state’s climate and clean energy goals while taking steps to mitigate the impact of these efforts on customers’ bills. The proposal includes over $150 million of climate solution programs to help Maryland meet its goals in the areas of transportation electrification, building decarbonization, beneficial electrification and distributed energy integration. It also includes a proposed performance incentive mechanism to focus on reliability, greenhouse gas emission reductions and removal of equipment posing health and environmental risk. We look forward to working through the process with stakeholders and the commission staff toward rates effective in the second quarter of 2024. Beyond Pepco Maryland, we have now received intervenor testimony in our BGE and ComEd multiyear rate plans and filed our rebuttals, and additional milestones await us in those cases in August, along with activity for Delmarva Delaware and Atlantic City Electric. The Public Service Commission of the District of Columbia has also set its schedule for the Pepco D.C. multiyear plan. You will hear more from Jeanne about all the work underway to align with our regulatory stakeholders. Now looking past 2023, we’ll also remind you of the guidance we’ve previously provided on our long-term outlook. We expect to be at the midpoint or better of our 2021 to 2025 and 2022 to 2026 6% to 8% annualized earnings growth ranges and to grow the dividend in line with those earnings. Over the next 4 years, we anticipate investing over $31 billion to support the energy transformation, which is what’s driving that growth. And I’ll remind you that we continue finding opportunities to further support the transformation, whether it’s increasing affordability for customers or strengthening the durability of our long-term investment plans. For instance, we have talked about our efforts pursuing grants under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which support the investment programs we have laid out for the commissions. And we recently announced winning approximately $30 million of grant funding for middle mile broadband investments at BGE and ComEd. Additionally, you may have also seen that PJM recently voted to proceed with transmission upgrades to address reliability challenges associated with the retirement of the brand insurers coal plant in Eastern Maryland with over $850 million of work assigned to our utilities. Now, while most of the incremental spend for that investment occurs beyond our current guidance window, it’s a great illustration of how we continue to have opportunities to strengthen and lengthen our expected rate base growth as the largest pure T&D utility in the United States. Our transmission upgrades ensure customers are able to buy cleaner generation and that they can depend on a reliable, resilient grid to deliver that power. Before I move on to operations, I want to mention that we published our latest Exelon Sustainability Report in mid-July. This is the 12th report in our company’s history. We are incredibly proud of the work our organization puts into ensuring we are leading the energy transformation in an affordable and equitable manner. Our purpose, powering a cleaner and brighter future for our customers and communities, really shines through that report. And the progress we continue to make in fulfilling that purpose is meaningful. Here are a few examples. We have connected over 200,000 customers with over 3 gigawatts of renewable energy resources, a 16% increase over 2021. We saved close to 25 million megawatt hours in 2022 with our award-winning energy efficiency programs, a 9% increase that avoided 9.5 million metric tons of greenhouse gases and saved customers over $30 million at our average retail rate. Our support for diverse suppliers is now up more than 56% from 2018 levels, having spent $2.9 billion with such suppliers in 2022. Additionally, 62% of our $7.5 billion total supplier spend is with companies in the communities we serve. Our annual sustainability report illustrates all the ways in which our more than 19,000 employees ensure our communities greatly benefit from the work we are doing to support their energy transformation goals. Turning to Slide 5. I’ll provide an update on our operating performance for the first half of the year. As it pertains to reliability, we continue setting the bar for performance. All 4 utilities operated in at least the top quartile, and ComEd, PECO and PHI achieved best on record outage frequency performance. That makes it the second quarter in a row for ComEd and PHI for best on record performance. Those 3 utilities also happen to achieve best on record system outage duration performance, and BGE continues to operate in the top quartile. Their performance illustrates that the investments we are making in the grid provide the footing for this operational excellence. And then it is up to our employees to rise to the challenge of keeping customers online or getting them back online as quickly as possible when outages do occur. Now that job is getting harder to do with storms growing more frequent and severe. But it’s increasingly important to do as society depends more and more on electricity. Nationally, we expect to see 50% annual growth in electric cars and 12% annual growth in data centers. And ComEd particularly, is already seeing sizable opportunity in data centers. The data center growth will only strengthen as industries increasingly rely on cloud services and AI. As the nation’s largest T&D company, we must rise to the challenge of meeting these incremental demands on the grid. This operational performance was matched on the gas side, with all 3 utilities continuing to perform at top decile levels for gas odor response. Our customer satisfaction scores remain in line with those reported in our first quarter call. Our utilities are performing in the second quartile versus the 2021 benchmark when costs across the board were lower, pandemic relief had not yet rolled off and customers had not yet been impacted by the escalating interest rates and commodity prices. We are working every day to ensure customers are aware of the options they have to manage their costs, and we have seen increased engagement by our customers through these efforts. In fact, ComEd announced just 2 weeks ago that it won several recognitions in the 20th Annual Best Practices awards by Chartwell. These annual Chartwell awards recognize excellence among electric and gas utilities with respect to customer-oriented projects, programs and service initiatives. One of these awards included recognition for ComEd’s community energy assistance ambassador program. This program originally launched in 2020 in response to the economic impact of the pandemic. It was designed with a community-based organization to increase education and access to financial assistance options that can help income eligible customers pay their electric bills while creating local employment opportunities for the same vulnerable population. But it is a constant reminder of the importance of focusing on value for our customers as well as affordability, and we are continuously seeking to reduce our own operating costs in addition to pursuing the customer-focused initiatives we have discussed. I will conclude by discussing our safety performance, where we lost ground at 3 of our 4 utilities. Ensuring our employees and contractors operate in a safe environment is of paramount importance. Lower performance this quarter largely resulted from low-impact OSHA recordables like slips and falls and minor vehicle-related incidents. As a result, each of our operating companies have action plans underway to address areas of needed improvement to ensuring that we are operating at our standards. This includes revisiting our safety plans for the year to ensure they are adequately addressing the issues we have observed year-to-date. Other examples include facility reviews to enhance safety and expanding our simulation-based training to offer more opportunities for employees. We are working hard to drive safety performance to the levels that we expect. I will now turn it over to Jeanne to discuss our financial performance and provide additional color on our regulatory activity in the second quarter. Jeanne?
Jeanne Jones: Thank you, Calvin, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover our second quarter financial update along with the outlook for the second half of 2023, our progress on the 23 rate case schedule, and I’ll also highlight an ongoing project that exemplifies our commitment to delivering sustainable value as the premier T&D energy company by modernizing critical infrastructure in the Philadelphia area. Starting on Slide 6, we show our quarter-over-quarter adjusted operating earnings. As Calvin mentioned, Exelon earned $0.41 per share in the second quarter of 2023 versus $0.44 in the second quarter of 2022, reflecting lower results of $0.03 per share over the same period. Results of $0.41 in the second quarter were right in line with the expectations provided in the prior earnings call. Earnings are lower in the second quarter relative to the same period last year, driven primarily by $0.04 of higher interest expense due to the rise in interest rates and higher levels of debt at the holding company and at some of our utilities as well as $0.03 of unfavorable weather at PECO. This was partially offset by $0.03 of higher distribution and transmission rates associated with incremental investments net of depreciation as well as a $0.01 of carrying costs related to the carbon mitigation credit balance at ComEd. Despite another quarter of mild weather impacting our non-decoupled jurisdictions, we delivered earnings results exactly where we said. Through the first half of 2023, operating earnings are $1.11 per share, reflecting 47% of the projected full year earnings. This is in line with how we performed through the first half of 2022. Looking ahead to next quarter, we expect a relative EPS contribution in the third quarter to be approximately 28% of the midpoint of our projected 2023 operating earnings guidance range. Recall that Q3 2022 saw strong growth from $0.04 of higher rates and effect with PECO’s electric rate case in year one of its current rate cycle as well as $0.03 of realized 30-year treasury rate uplift on ComEd’s formula rate distribution ROE and another $0.03 of distribution formula rate timing at ComEd. While the fundamentals underpinning the earnings remaining this year, we expect third quarter ‘23 results to be lower. Net distribution and transmission growth will be offset by higher interest and we also expect some timing of O&M and taxes. For the fourth quarter of ‘23, we expect year-over-year earnings growth to benefit from the absence of proactive derisking that occurred in the fourth quarter of ‘22, the expected reversal of the O&M and tax timing and the anticipated onetime impact of BGE’s reconciliation for the ‘21 and ‘22 under recovery of its first multiyear plan. As we do not receive the final order on the reconciliation for BGE until December of ‘23, we cannot record BGE’s earnings associated with the reconciliation until that time. In line with discussion on the first quarter earnings call, we expect the $0.07 of unfavorable weather experienced year-to-date to be offset with the combination of O&M levers across the platform, favorable depreciation at PECO and the full year earnings impact of the carrying costs associated with the CMC regulatory asset balance. On a full year basis, we continue to reaffirm our 2023 EPS guidance range of $2.30 to $2.42 per share. Through a continued increase in rate base as we deploy capital for the benefit of our customers and strong cost control across the platform, we remain on track to deliver earnings at the midpoint or better of our guidance range. With several months of weather and storm exposure remaining, you can expect we will manage utility work plans to deliver earnings within expectations. Lastly, we are reaffirming the fully regulated operating EPS compounded annual growth target of 68% from 2021’s and 2022 guidance midpoint through 2025 and 2026, respectively, with the expectation to be at the midpoint or better of that growth range. Turning to Slide 7. As Calvin mentioned, there have been some important developments on the regulatory front. Since the last earnings call, there was one new rate case filed, so I’ll provide a status update on each of the six current open proceedings, starting with the most recent filing. On May 16, Pepco Maryland submitted its climate ready pathway, a 3-year multiyear plan application to the Maryland Public Service Commission. Pepco is requesting a $213.6 million revenue increase over the April 2024 and to December 2027 period, inclusive of a proposed 9-month extension reflecting an ROE of 10.5%. The filing outlines investments the company expects to make to support a climate-ready grid and enable cleaner energy programs and technologies that support Maryland’s goal to reach net zero emissions by 2045. As an example of the $150 million of climate solution programs that Calvin mentioned are included in Pepco’s proposed plan, more than half are dedicated to incentive for approximately 10,000 equipment electrification conversions for customers transitioning to cleaner technologies like heat pumps in the building sector. Another key category of spend is dedicated to enhancing reliability, resiliency and grid security through the installation of more modernized equipment that automatically detect system issues, reinforces the grid against more severe weather and protects the grid from potential physical or cyber threats. Overall, these investments are anticipated to inject more than $1.42 billion into the local economy and support more than 11,000 full-time jobs. For the last 3 years, spanning 2020 to 2022, Pepco has reported the best reliability performance of any electric distribution utility in the state of Maryland, a true testament to the company’s commitment of powering a cleaner and brighter future for its customers and communities. Equally as important as reliability, Pepco is focused on keeping affordability front and center for our customers. The multiyear plan includes the acceleration of tax benefits to serve as a bill offset as well as efforts to increase participation in energy assistance and energy efficiency programs, which in 2022 alone provided approximately $23 million to Pepco Maryland customers. An order is expected by June of 2024. Let me also remind you of the other electric distribution rate cases in progress. First, Delmarva Power Delaware has revised a revenue request for a $41.8 million increase based on an updated test period in the electric rate case and, as permitted by Delaware law, implemented full proposed rates on July 15 subject to refund. A decision is expected in the second quarter of 2024. Similarly, ACE revised their revenue request for a $93.6 million increase based on an updated test period, with the final order expected in the first quarter of ‘24. Additionally, after an 8-month receiving, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities approved a 4-year capital tracker at ACE called Powering the Future, which accelerates the portfolio of projects totaling $93 million designed to enhance reliability and resiliency for customers, advance New Jersey’s energy master plan goals and sustained economic growth in the region. Next, ComEd and BGE surpassed two key milestones in their multiyear plan rate cases, having received intervener testimony and filed their rebutals to support the key elements of the company’s initial proposals earlier this year. As discussed on prior earnings calls, both plans outline the investments needed to provide essential service to customers while meeting the clean energy and equity goals of their respective states. In both the ComEd and BGE multiyear plan rate cases, evidentiary hearings are scheduled to begin in late August with briefs to follow before final orders are expected in December. Lastly, Pepco received a procedural schedule from the Public Service Commission of the District of Columbia in its second multiyear rate plan filing. Upcoming milestones include intervenor testimony expected to be filed by the DC Public Service Commission staff on October 16 and evidentiary hearing set to begin in January of 2024 with final briefs in March of 24. Relationships across our jurisdictions remain constructive, and we are working together with our regulators, states and communities through every step of the process to reach our shared goals. As Calvin mentioned, by next year, we expect our resolution on all four of the ongoing multiyear rate plans in Illinois, Maryland and D.C. and a clear path forward to supporting clean energy and climate goals in an affordable and equitable manner. More details on the rate cases can be found on Slides 20 through 26 of the appendix. Moving to Slide 8. During the second quarter, we continued to invest capital for the benefit of our customers and are on track to meet our $7.2 billion guidance for 2023. These investments in energy infrastructure are vital to maintaining the high standard of service that we have in serving our customers while preparing the grid for the clean energy transformation and increasing levels of electrification. Today, I’ll talk about how PECO is partnering with the community to build a new 69-13kV substation in Philadelphia at the Civic Terminal Yard and neighboring property. PECO’s commitment to building for the new civic substation began in 2019. This $130 million project includes installation of insulated switchgear and modifications to 4 69-kV and transmission lines into civic substations that will allow for the retirement of 2 69-kV transmission lines currently running under the [indiscernible]. The new substation is expected to increase distribution and transmission reliability through the reconfiguration of the lines and increased flood resiliency in the low-lying areas surrounding the substations, where access has been restricted in the past following heavy thunderstorms. It will also enable PECO to relieve low constraints, supply additional capacity to the University City area and better serve critical customers on the west side of the river. Once it’s fully energized, which is expected by the second quarter of ‘24, the Civic substation will be PECO’s newest and most modern insulated substation. While traditional open-air substation construction would have required 5 to 7 acres of land, the upgraded electrical that meant associated with the insulated substation allows PECO to build on less than a 2-acre plot of land. That represents a 60% to 70% reduction in required land use. Since project inception, PECO has partnered with its customers, government agencies and other local utilities to ensure construction of the Civic substation has a minimal impact to the city of Philadelphia, the surrounding customers and on the environment, protecting the nearby waterway and riverbank. With vital customers in the area such as the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, the University of Pennsylvania Hospital and the Philadelphia Veteran Affairs Medical Center, operational excellence is imperative. As an Exelon utility, PECO is ready to deliver it. Turning to Slide 9. I will conclude with a review of our balance sheet activity. As a reminder, we continue to project 100 to 200 basis points of cushion on average over our guidance period for our consolidated corporate credit metrics above S&P and Moody’s downgrade thresholds of 12%, demonstrating our commitment to maintaining a strong balance sheet. If the corporate alternative minimum tax is not mitigated through an inclusion of repairs in its calculation, we anticipate being at 100 basis points or the lower end of that range. We continue to await specific guidance on the corporate alternative minimum tax implementation and are hopeful to have resolution by year-end. In the meantime, the Department of Treasury issued a notice granting deferral of estimated tax payments associated with the corporate alternative minimum tax until 2024, which points to the appreciation that more guidance is required for implementation. From a financing perspective, we successfully raised nearly $1.3 billion for BGE and PECO in the second quarter, which completes all of our planned debt financing needs for 2023. The strong investor demand we continue to see for our debt offerings is supported by the strength of our balance sheet and by the low-risk attributes of our platform. In line with the last earnings call, there has been no change in our guidance to issue $425 million of equity at the holding company by ‘25. We will continue to update you as we make progress on the plan. Thank you. And I’ll now turn the call back to Calvin for his closing remarks.
Calvin Butler: Thank you, Jeanne. I will once again remind the investment community of what we’re working to accomplish in 2023. We take great pride in our operational excellence, which our employees dedicate themselves to daily. Summer is when we see some of the most severe weather activity, and our teams embrace the challenge to get customers back online quickly and safely. As we proceed with our work of supporting the energy transformation in our ongoing rate cases, we are very focused on listening to our stakeholders. We want to ensure that we are delivering the right investment plans and the right services to support meeting their energy transformation and climate goals in an affordable and equitable manner. After this year, much of our path forward for the next several years will be established and clear. The team also understands it must deliver on our financial priorities and guidance. Efficiently investing $7.2 billion of capital and earning ROEs in the 9% to 10% range will support meeting our 2023 earnings guidance range of $2.30 to $2.42 per share and keeping our balance sheet strong. And finally, we’re continuing to look for innovative ways to support our customers and communities end-to-end throughout our business. In partnership with the Exelon Foundation, we are looking to place our next round of investments in the $20 million climate change investment initiative fund or 2c2i, an innovative way to advance solutions to the challenges brought by climate change, while improving the quality of life for residents of our cities. For this year, five companies were selected to receive investments, spanning areas like software analytics to track air quality, non-recyclable plastic reuse and novel EV charging solutions. Every day, we’re reminded that the energy transformation is happening, and we have to be a vital role in it. And we have a talented team that’s incredibly excited to play that role. We recently announced that Colette Honorable will be joining us as our Executive Vice President of Public Policy and Chief External Affairs Officer, as a renowned energy policy leader who brings expertise in areas like clean energy transformation and equable ratemaking, she will be an invaluable addition to our team. And she’ll help us build on the strong foundation we already have in place, built by the team that got us here. In particular, I want to recognize Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of our business services company, Bridget Reidy who is retiring in September and played an integral role in shaping our organizational commitment to excellence. She also made incredible strides in diversity, equity and inclusion across the wide variety of corporate support groups that she led like IT and supply. Thank you, Bridget, for your leadership. Our team’s commitment to leading the energy transformation is what makes us the premier transmission and distribution utility, one that lives by its values, supports its communities and offers a uniquely strong expected total shareholder return of 9% to 11%.  Thank you, as always, for your interest. I’ll now turn it to Gigi for your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of David Arcaro from Morgan Stanley.
David Arcaro: Hey, good morning. Thanks so much for taking my questions.
Calvin Butler: David, good morning.
David Arcaro: Let’s see, wondering if you could speak to the comment and BGE rate cases and how these have progressed so far relative to your expectations? Just when you look at the key intervener testimony that we’ve gotten so far, like staff in both cases, how have these shaped up overall in terms of the focus areas versus what you had expected?
Calvin Butler: Yes, David, thank you. This is Calvin. I would tell you that they are proceeding as planned. And the teams have provided their responses, and as Jeanne mentioned, we’re going through the process. But we have with us both Gil Quiniones, President and CEO of ComEd; and Carim Khouzami, President and CEO of BGE, who can – I will ask them to just kind of take your time and walk you through some of the highlights of each and what you can expect moving forward. I’ll start with Gil of ComEd.
Gil Quiniones: Yes. This is Gil from ComEd. The ICC staff and interveners in the aggregate did not waver from their initial positions filed in their direct testimony in May. They maintained their position in ROE and the pension asset. Their challenges on capital center on certain IT projects, our fiber and proposed private LTE communications network upgrades and systematic and programmatic spending. The rate case process still playing out, as Calvin mentioned, and we will continue to make our case for those capital investments. We continue to have regular meetings with staff and interveners to provide additional information, answer any of their questions and provide clarification.
Calvin Butler: Carim?
Carim Khouzami: Good morning. This is Carim Khouzami from BGE. As Calvin mentioned, the case is proceeding as expected. The staff has come in with a proposal of about 70% of our ask. As expected, some of the areas of debate surround ROE investments in our gas system and some building electrification programs that BG proposed for the first time to help the state meet its climate change goals. One of the things to point out, as you know, reconciliations of the first time it is being done in Maryland in a multiyear plan. Both staff and OPC and other intervening parties suggested about 90% of our requests. So again, that is proceeding well. So all in all, going well. As Calvin and Jeanne mentioned, we have more hearings at the end of August, early September with the final order expected in mid-December.
Calvin Butler: And David, I would just add to that, both plans were built on helping the states meet their environmental and climate goals as well as economic development and job creation opportunities. So the stakeholder process, I don’t want to underrepresent because both companies have been very engaged in that process and meeting with all stakeholders. So again, proceeding, it’s a process that will play itself out. But we expect orders for both companies by the end of the year.
David Arcaro: That’s really helpful color. Thanks for all that. And appreciating that there are new commissioners in both states, do you see an opportunity for settling on any issues, partial settlement, full settlement? Or is the expectation and strategy just kind of see this through kind of a fully litigated case more likely?
Calvin Butler: No, great question, David. We expect to see them both fully through and recognizing that, as Carim mentioned, first time for the reconciliation process in Maryland. And it’s the next 3 years, we will see it through and let it play out. And for Gil, moving from the formula rate to a 4-year multiyear plan, it’s important that everyone feels that they have had a chance to voice their opinions and that stakeholder process is critical to that. So we do see it playing out all the way to the end of the year.
David Arcaro: Got it. Okay, great. Thanks very much.
Calvin Butler: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of James Kennedy from Guggenheim Partners.
Calvin Butler: Good morning, James.
James Kennedy: Hi, guys. Good morning. How it going?
Calvin Butler: Good.
James Kennedy: So I guess I’ll start with the transmission announcement this morning, the $870 million for brand insurers. Is the portion that falls in the current plan, purely incremental? And secondly, any color on the potential quantum of other opportunities like these as we start to see other retirements in CMC and BGE?
Calvin Butler: Thank you, James. First off, it is all additive to the current plan. We do not have any of that, as we’ve conveyed to you previously, we were never going to put anything that we were striving to get until we want it. So that’s important. I have with us today David Velazquez, our EVP of Operations, to provide additional oversight or insight into this because David oversees our transmission strategy across Exelon. So David?
David Velazquez: Yes. Thank you, Calvin. And James, thanks for the question. Besides the brands insurers transmission reinforcements that are needed, you may be aware that PJM also has an open – what they call an open window to help transmission reinforcements needed for additional load growth in the Dominion territory. That is currently open. We have submitted four different proposals in that open window range from, I will say, smaller enhancements in the $300 million range to large projects that helped meet both short and longer term needs that are well over $1 billion. And PJM will provide an initial readout of their recommendations committee meetings in September-October timeframe with an expected decision from the PJM Board in December of this year. In addition to that, there are offshore – their transmission reinforcements needed for offshore wind, both in New Jersey and also in Maryland. And there is legislation in Maryland that requires the PSC by July 1st of next year to make a report back to the legislature and then to issue a solicitation for transmission reinforcements for offshore wind by July of ‘25. So, not just with the brand insurers retirement, but offshore wind, load growth, and again, cannot predict generation retirements, but if they occur, we are ready to do what we need to do to ensure the reliability of the grid.
Calvin Butler: Thank you, David.
James Kennedy: Excellent. And then just second question real quick. Can we get an update on the ComEd franchise agreement process?
Calvin Butler: Yes. Right now, it’s status quo. You can appreciate the team has been very involved in the franchise. And with the new Mayor coming in line, he is assembling his team. Gil and the ComEd team have been working very closely with him on several issues. And really, what we are talking about is that we had come to an agreement with the livelihood [ph] administration earlier this year, as you know, on that franchise. And the parameters of that proposal, we have discussed with you on previous calls. But at this time, the Mayor and I think the team is looking at those provisions and trying to make it his own, this administration’s own. Gil, would you have anything else you would like to add there?
Gil Quiniones: The only thing I want to add, Calvin, is that we have had initial conversations with them, and they had informed us when they are ready, we will engage and restart our negotiations for a new franchise in Chicago. But in the meantime, our existing franchise agreement continues.
Calvin Butler: And that’s very important for us. And in addition, I just want to recognize that Gil has been partnering with them. He was just recently named to the Environmental Justice Transition Subcommittee for this Mayor. So, the team has plugged in with the administration, and more of why that’s important is they are understanding what their priorities are as a new administration. And I think that will play directly into the new franchise agreement.
James Kennedy: Wonderful. Thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Paul Zimbardo from Bank of America.
Calvin Butler: Hi Paul.
Paul Zimbardo: Hi. Good morning team. Thank you for the time.
Calvin Butler: Good morning.
Paul Zimbardo: First, I just wanted to get a little bit more clarity. If you could briefly comment on that SEC matter that you disclosed in the earnings results that you just out, does this fully resolve that legacy SEC investigation?
Jeanne Jones: Hey, good morning Paul, it’s Jeanne. So, the SEC investigation is still ongoing, but we did reach a point where a loss contingency was probable. So, we did book that. You can see it’s treated similarly to how we had treated the initial DPA amount. It’s a non-operating one-time nonrecurring item that is in non-operating earnings. So, it’s continuing, but it is related to the investigation that began in 2019, so the same original investigation.
Paul Zimbardo: Okay. Great. Yes. I just wanted to clarify that’s original stream.
Jeanne Jones: Yes.
Paul Zimbardo: Okay. Great. And then second, just as we think about the long-term, I know you reaffirmed that expectation midpoint or better 2023 plus, just interest rates keep ticking up stubbornly like 50 basis points even since the last update. Could you discuss some of the areas of offsets, whether cost or otherwise, to kind of combat those higher parent costs? Thanks.
Calvin Butler: Yes. Well, I will start and then I will turn it over to Jeanne. As you have alluded to is that we are seeing – our customers aren’t immune to the higher-cost commodity prices that are going on across the country. But we have always, as a company, been very aggressive in managing our costs, and that didn’t change upon the separation. Our first and foremost priority was ensuring that our costs didn’t go up as a result of that separation. But let me tell you some of the things that we have done. We have realigned our real estate portfolio, creating flexible work arrangements to rationalize our office footprint. We have automated – we continue to look for ways to automate our work processes and really becoming more efficient and nimble in response to our customers’ needs. And we have centralized our transmission operations to harness best practices on organizational efficiencies. And it’s important to note that over the course of our – since 2016 with the course of our plan, our O&M CAGR has only gone up 1.7%. And the year-over growth is just over 1% in 2023. I say that to you to say that costs continue to be a primary focus of the organization and affordability for our customers. Having said that, we are not done. We are just scratching the surface as a leadership team to really look at how we are going to operate as one Exelon, as a pure transmission and distribution utility company. And we continue to focus on that. So, that is what our focus is on day-in and day-out. Jeanne?
Jeanne Jones: Yes, I think that’s well said and all of that helps to reduce the O&M and preserve the cash, which minimizes the amount also that we need to finance in terms of our investments, so getting that cash and redeploying it back into the business. The only other thing I will add is on the interest rates, how we do as a whole – at the operating companies, we are stepping into new – sort of new rate cases, so the ability to recover the incremental interest there is important. But at the parent company, we do engage in reinsurance hedging and so being able to lock in with certainty ahead of time heading into a year what that interest expense is, is important. So, we will continue those practices that helped us heading into ‘23, and you can expect us to do that for future issuances as well.
Paul Zimbardo: Okay. Great. Thank you for the color team. I appreciate it.
Calvin Butler: Thank you, Paul.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan Securities, LLC.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi. Good morning. This is actually David Kelly [ph] on for Jeremy. Just wondering, would you be able to outline your current credit metrics relative to thresholds and plan targets? And how could this ultimately contribute to your 425 remaining equity?
Jeanne Jones: Sure. It’s Jeanne. So, on the current credit metrics, I think S&P and Moody’s just recently published kind of the prior 12 months, those were at 13%. And as we show in our slides and as I talked about in the script, as we look at our ‘23 through ‘26 time period, we expect to be at that average of 13%. And as a reminder, our downgrade threshold is 12%. And that 12% is afforded to us and we don’t take it lightly, that’s why we have that cushion. But it’s a reflection of our low-risk platform, right, diversity, scale, forward-looking rate mechanisms, 75% decoupled revenues. So, all of that put together, no generation, all of that results in a very low risk profile. But we like to manage at that 100 basis points or 200 basis points above that. So, at the 13%, as the rate agencies just published, we expect to be at that 13%. If we get the corporate alternative minimum tax mitigated, we would be closer the mid-higher, like that 13.5%, 14%. And we are hopeful to know that final regulations or at least preliminary regulations by the end of the year. You asked how that relates to our equity. We have no change in plans related to the 425. So, said another way, if we got the corporate alternative minimum tax alleviated, we would still do that 425. And so you can expect us to do that sometime between now and 2025. The last thing I will say is just as it relates to Moody’s and S&P, there is a little bit of difference in the calculation. S&P will sort of trend at that 13% over that time horizon. Moody’s, however, because of the calculation, there is some cash timing differences. So, we expect to be sort of on the low end in ‘23, ‘24 and then on the higher end in the back end, such that you average 13%. And that’s really driven by some of the formula rate timing at ComEd with the true-up coming for ‘22 and ‘23 coming in, in ‘24 and ‘25. But that’s sort of – that’s why we give you the average because we want to sort of neutralize some of that cash flow timing as well.
Unidentified Analyst: Appreciate the color. I will leave it there. Thanks.
Calvin Butler: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Carly Davenport from Goldman Sachs.
Carly Davenport: Hey. Good morning.
Calvin Butler: Good morning.
Carly Davenport: Thanks so much for taking the questions. You had mentioned kind of O&M levers to offset mild weather this year. So could you just talk a little bit about how O&M costs have been tracking relative to your expectations? And then what you expect to see for the balance of the year from a rate of change perspective on O&M?
Calvin Butler: So initially, we have always maintained a philosophy that we will drive O&M costs below the rate of inflation. Now that was over the traditional rate of inflation that we have been experiencing over the last several years, keeping that around 2% to 2.5%. And as I mentioned, we are trending strong and keeping or meeting our objectives of doing so. And that has always been our benchmark. The CEOs who are sitting around the table, we talk about keeping our O&M flat and seeing what levers are driving it to possibly go up, which allows us that flexibility when you have unseasonally warm winters or anything else in PECO or the like, we got 75% of our rate base, our 73% is decoupled. So, a lot of the weather impacts that you are talking about really focus on PECO primarily as the largest utility that’s done. Having said that, we will continue to manage those costs. We never take our foot off the gas in doing so. Jeanne?
Jeanne Jones: Yes. And as it relates to the weather for ‘23, we had a combination of offsets across the platform, mostly at PECO, BGE and PHI given ComEd has the formula rate true-up on O&M. But across those three operating companies, we saw O&M levers, whether it was taking advantage of labor vacancies, lower T&E and contracting spend. And then in addition to that, PECO had some favorable depreciation. So, the combination of all that was probably around $0.04 of the $0.07 of weather, and then we had the ComEd carrying costs, which were a benefit this year. And it’s a benefit this year relative to last year because we did not have this large reg asset really sort of was built up at the back end of last year. And the interest deposit rate on that was zero for the commission. So, we weren’t getting an interest offset, even though we were incurring interest on that last year. However, now in this year is a benefit both to last year and to guidance because we have the larger reg asset this year. And while we are still incurring the carrying cost on that, the ICC reset the deposit rate at 5% this year. And so relative to guidance, we are now having an offset to that, that wasn’t baked into our plan. So, that’s probably about $0.03 of the $0.07. So, you put all that together, that’s how we are offsetting the $0.07 of weather. And to Calvin’s point, we just continue to focus on what else we can do to drive down those costs. And we are just starting to scratch the surface there.
Carly Davenport: Got it. That’s helpful. Thank you. And then just on the corporate minimum tax. I know you mentioned expecting to at least get kind of preliminary clarity there by the end of this year. But is there any color that you can share maybe from your discussions around the temperature on the tax repairs deduction and getting the gating factors to that being included?
Jeanne Jones: I would just say there is – it’s probably not much else to share. There are ongoing discussions. Their stakeholders remain receptive to the discussion and to the technical differences that the utility industry faces in being a very capital-intensive utility and some of the regulatory accounting that will release that capital-intensive nature of our industry. So, receptive discussions ongoing. And I did mention earlier in the script, we did see some guidance come out in June that basically said, hey, if you think you are subject to this tax, you won’t be penalized if you don’t pay it this year. We understand there is more sort of guidance and interpretation needed. And so that was just one other data point. But just ongoing discussions and we remain hopeful that we will have more clarity by the end of the year.
Carly Davenport: Awesome. Appreciate that. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra from Evercore ISI.
Durgesh Chopra: Hey guys. Good morning. We are close to the hour here. Thanks for giving me time.
Jeanne Jones: Good morning.
Calvin Butler: Good morning.
Durgesh Chopra: Good morning Calvin. Good morning Jeanne. So, I just want to go back to the ComEd rate case real quick. And some of us were expecting an update from staff on the ROE calculation and the output itself. It seems like they are kind of using the same methodology and using rates as of last year. Just how do you see that progressing? Any thoughts there would be appreciated. Thank you.
Jeanne Jones: Yes. I think as Gil mentioned, still more to come. We are still putting forth a strong argument around our proposed ROE. As you mentioned, they did not change their position. It appears to be sort of this continuation of the formula, which [indiscernible] was clear that the sunset of the formula rate was required. So, our filing offers an ROE that we feel appropriately reflects the actual cost of equity, taking into account the current market conditions. So, we will continue to work through that process. I think there is that data point and then there is the Electric Proxy Group, which is also another data point in the staff testimony. So, we will continue to work through that with them, but no changes as of this point.
Durgesh Chopra: Got it. Okay. It sounds like we will get an update here before the end of the year. Just switching gears, I have a question on supply chain, and Calvin or anybody else in the room, would love your views there. Just we have seen several media reports on transformer shortages. So, maybe broadly, can you comment, you have a sizable CapEx plan, obviously. But just broadly, can you comment on equipment shortages, labor shortages? And how is that tracking this year versus, let’s say, 12 months ago?
Calvin Butler: Yes. I would tell you that one of the, I would say, advantage is of being of our scale and our platform is that we are able to leverage the size to not only access our current suppliers, but identify new ones. So, directly to your question, we have not seen a shortage in our transformers. We have not seen a shortage in workforce or any other things that are impacting us executing on this capital plan. Now, what we do pay attention to, as new businesses coming online, our ability to give that online in the timeframe that some of our customers are looking for because that wasn’t part of that initial planned work. So, we stay on top of that and working with our supply organization. But to-date, we are not experiencing those same issues that others made.
Jeanne Jones: And I think one of the benefits of our profile rate of the $31 billion, as we have talked about before, not one project is greater than 1% of that spend. So, the ability to kind of manage that portfolio in bite sizes to the extent we do experience any issues allows us to be able to stay on track and deliver.
Durgesh Chopra: Got it. Thanks again guys.
Calvin Butler: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, I would now like to turn the conference back over to Calvin Butler, Exelon’s President and CEO, for closing remarks.
Calvin Butler: Gigi, thank you very much. And I just want to always thank you all for joining us today. From the comments made today by Jeanne and I and the leadership team around the table, you see that we are focused on delivering on plan. So, as always, appreciate your interest, and this concludes our call.
Operator: Thanks to all our participants for joining us today. This concludes our presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-05-03 15:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello and welcome to Exelon's First Quarter Earnings Call. My name is Gigi and I'll be your event specialist today. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. Please note that today's webcast is being recorded. During the presentation, we'll have a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn today's program over to Andy Plenge, Vice President of Investor Relations. The floor is yours.
Andrew Plenge: Thank you, Gigi. Good morning everyone. We are pleased to have you with us for our 2023 first quarter earnings call. Leading the call today are Calvin Butler, Exelon's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jeanne Jones, Exelon's Chief Financial Officer. Other members of Exelon's senior management team are also with us today and will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. You may have seen that we issued our earnings release this morning, our release along with the presentation being used for today's can be found in the Investor Relations section of Exelon's website. As a reminder, the earnings release and other matters that we will discuss during today's call, contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. As a result, actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today's material and comments made during this call. You can find in today's 8-K and Exelon's other SEC filings for discussions of risk factors and other factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts and expectations. In addition, today's presentation includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Both the appendix of our presentation and our earnings release contain information for reconciliations between the GAAP measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures. We've scheduled 45 minutes for today’s call. And it is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Calvin Butler, Exelon's President and CEO.
Calvin Butler: Thank you, Andy and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for our first quarter earnings call. Our team of 19,000-plus employees have entered this first full year of operations after the separation, excited to lead the energy transformation as a premier T&D utility, and it shows in our results. We are delivering our plan on course. I'll start on slide four, covering our key messages. We delivered strong year-over-year growth in the first quarter, earning $0.67 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.70 per share on a non-GAAP basis. These results keep us on track to deliver earnings within our guidance range of $2.30 to $2.42 per share for 2023. This is despite the impact of mild weather, which is a testament to the stability offered by the progressive, largely decoupled rate making mechanisms in our jurisdictions. Operationally, we had our best on record reliability performance at all four of our utilities, with ComEd continuing to operate in the top decile. As it pertains to our rate cases, we are well underway in a number of jurisdictions with three new filings initiated since the fourth quarter earnings call. Building a stronger, smarter, resilient, and cleaner grid requires investment, we are engaging with our stakeholders to align on our shared goals and ensure this investment is compensated fairly, as it is integral to our strategy. On February 15th, Atlantic City Electric filed a distribution base rate case with the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities to support investments in infrastructure to maintain safety, reliability, and customer service for our customers. It also includes initial recovery for ACE’s Smart Meter deployment, which brings a host of benefits that Jeanne will highlight shortly. BGE filed its second multi-year plan on February 17th and Pepco DC filed its second MYP on April 13th. Both NYP rate cases incorporate investments that enable the energy transformations guided by jurisdictional policy, whether it be the Climate Solutions Now Act in Maryland or DC's transformative energy policies like the DC Climate Action Plan. Finally, Pepco expects to file its second MYP, our final anticipated base rate filing for the year with the Maryland Public Service Commission later this month. Jeanne will take the time to highlight the next steps across our open rate cases and provide additional details on the regulatory calendar shortly. Now in working through these rate cases, we have several new commissioners expected across our jurisdictions, including new chairs in place or pending in Illinois, Maryland, and Pennsylvania, and new appointees in Illinois and Maryland. We appreciate the service of the outgoing commissioners and are excited to begin working with the newest members on this next phase of the energy transformation. Given this transformation will be measured in decades, it reinforces the importance of building a shared forward-looking understanding of priorities and needs across a variety of stakeholders, which is accomplished through transparency and collaboration. This kind of approach supports continuity through the inevitable evolution in legislative and regulatory bodies over time. Lastly, we continue to reaffirm our existing expectations to be at the midpoint or better of our 2021 to 2025 and 2022 to 2026, 6% to 8% annualized earnings growth ranges, with dividend growth to match underpinned by the investments we are making on behalf of customers and earning an annual consolidated ROE in the 9% to 10% range during that time. Our diverse deconcentrated capital expenditure plan and predictable investment recovery frameworks contribute to the compelling risk adjusted total shareholder return of 9% to 11% that we offer investors between our dividend and earnings growth through 2026. Our results are built on an operating philosophy that relentlessly pursues Exelon, as is highlighted on the next slide. Slide five reviews our operating performance for the start of 2023. Beginning first with reliability, you can see that our utilities continue to operate at industry leading levels, both in terms of outage frequency and outage duration. Both ComEd and PHI achieved best on record outage frequency performance, and all four utilities achieved best on record system outage duration performance. Now consistent with our focus on continually improving operations and customer value, we are now using total system outage time versus average customer outage duration as one of our reliability metrics. This refined metric better ensures we are comprehensively capturing the customer experience on an equitable basis in each of our service territories. This performance is a testament to the hard work that our employees put in each and every day. It also speaks to the effectiveness of the investments and reliability and resiliency that our utilities have made, providing a great foundation as we discuss with our stakeholders the next phase of investments to support their energy transformations. As it pertains to safety, PHI is now operating at top decile levels, and Pepco is in the top quartile, both up from the second quartile last year, while BGE improved the second quartile from third quartile. Now, while we are encouraged by the progress we have made on the safety front in the company, we have a safety focused zero tolerance culture. We are using targeted training at each of our utilities, such as ergonomics awareness training at ComEd, in light of its move out to second quartile to address the areas driving under performance. Gas order response continues its run of top decile performance with all three utilities performing at world class levels in 2023. PHI responded to all gas owners in less than an hour, achieving a perfect rating. Lastly, I want to spend a moment talking about customer satisfaction. As you can see, our four utilities are operating in the second quartile after three out of the four closed out 2022 in top quartile. While each operating company has unique areas to address, there are a few common trends. For instance, the bar for communicating with customers around outages and reliability continues to be raised as our customers increasingly rely on the grid, whether it be working remotely or charging their cars. They need access to information real time. We are excited about the investments we have made and the tools they already have at their disposal, such as mobile apps, and we will continue to invest and enhancements focused on improving communications. Although, another area of focus is new technology through upgrades to our customer care and billing software. These investments will allow us to provide more options to meet customer needs around billing and other services and enhance self-service options for those experiencing slower turnaround times. But perhaps the primary driver of lower customer satisfaction scores relative to the latest available benchmark as of 2021 is one that is not unique to Exelon. While the inflationary environment has shown signs of abetting recently, particularly around energy supply costs that are a pass-through for us, customers have been impacted by increased costs in many aspects of their lives and businesses. That's why we will continue to focus on maintaining more than average rates and overall bill levels. Again, rates in our cities are 23% below the average rate in the largest cities in the United States, and we have connected customers to increasing amounts of assistance as well, totaling over $1 billion the last two years. But we have to continue to articulate the value customers are receiving, and we will maintain focus on managing our own cost to deliver our products as efficiently as possible. We also address bill impacts and our approach to rate cases. Our proposed deferral of 35% of ComEd 2024 rate increase to 2026 is just one example, as is Pepco's DC proposed expansion of the residential aid and arrearage management programs. Ensure we are leading the industry and customer satisfaction remains a top priority for us. Now, Jeanne will provide an update on our financial performance for the first quarter. Jeanne?
Jeanne Jones: Thank you, Calvin and good morning, everyone. Today I will cover our first quarter financial updates and progress on our 2023 rate case schedule, and I'll also highlight the ways in which our utilities are advancing a smarter, stronger, and cleaner energy grid to better serve all customers. Starting on slide six, we show our quarter-over-quarter adjusted operating earnings plan [ph]. As Calvin mentioned, Exelon earned $0.70 per share in the first quarter of 2023 versus $0.64 in the first quarter of 2022, reflecting growth of $0.06 per share over the same period. Variance in [ph] growth was driven primarily by $0.10 of higher distribution and transmission rates associated with investments and completed rate cases, including the uplift from higher treasury rates, impacting ComEd's distribution hourly. We also benefited $.03 from the rehearsal of other one-time items from 2022, including the discontinued operations adjustment from the separation and the customer refund in Illinois. These items were partially offset by $0.05 of lower earnings due to the sustained warmer than normal temperatures throughout the winter, impacting our non-decoupled jurisdictions in Pennsylvania and Delaware, as well as $0.02 of higher interest expense due to the right interest rates and higher levels of debt at the holding company. There was also $0.70 per share in the first quarter reflects an approximate 30% contribution of the midpoint of our projected 2023 operating earnings guidance range. Historically, we have earned on average 28% of full year earnings in the first quarter. Heading into 2023, we expected Q1 to be a slightly ahead of historical pattern due to the completion of rate cases at PHI and Pepco, rising treasury rates impacting income as are we relative to 2022 and the absence of the one-time item from separation. However, we are also seeing -- we were also seeing the impact of unfavorable weather at Pepco and DPL Delaware. While the weather tempered some of that upside, we still delivered earnings ahead of expectations due to timing at PHI and the recognition of carrying costs related to the carbon mitigation credit balance by ComEd. Looking ahead to next quarter, after factoring in some PHI year-over-year timing items, the relatives EPS contribution in the second quarter is expected to moderate at approximately 17% of the midpoint of our projected full year earnings guidance range. The combination of Q1 and Q2 will result in achieving approximately 47% for projected full year earnings through the first half of 2023. This puts expected results for the first half of 2023 in line with how we performed last year, delivering 48% of our full year earnings in the first half of 2022. On a full year basis, we expect the $0.05 of unfavorable weather experience in the first quarter to be offset with a combination of O&M levers across the platform, favorable depreciation at Pepco, and the full year earnings impact of the carrying cost associated with the carbon mitigation credit regulatory asset balance. With this continued increase in rate base as we deploy capital for the benefit of our customers and our disciplined approach to cost management, we remain on track to deliver expected earned returns at the utilities within our 9% to 10% targeted range by year-end, and affirm our full year operating earnings guidance of $2.30 to $2.42 per share in 2023. In line with past practice, we would not expect to visit protected 2023 guidance until the third quarter and recall, our goal is always to achieve the midpoint or better of that range. Lastly, we are reaffirming the fully regulated operating EPS compounded annual growth target of 68% from 2021 and 2022 guidance midpoint through 2025 and 2026, respectively, with the expectation to be at the midpoint for better of that growth range. Turning to slide seven. As Calvin mentioned, there have been some important developments on the regulatory front since the last earnings call. Let me start by reminding you of two electric distribution rate cases in progress. First, Delmarva Power Delaware has revised a revenue request for a $47.8 million increase based on an updated test period in its electric distribution rate case, both full proposed rates going into effect on July 15th subject to refund. We expect a decision in the second quarter of 2024. Additionally, as discussed previously, ComEd filed its electric distribution multi-year rate plan in January, and we expect intervening testimony due from the Illinois Commerce Commission staff on May 22nd, and evidentiary hearing to be held in late August as the next key milestone. A final order in the ComEd will say [indiscernible] case is expected no later than December 20th. ComEd also filed its 2022 formula rate reconciliation seeking recovery of $247 million in rates effective January 1st, 2024. A key driver at the increase is the impact of US Treasury yields starting to increase from their depressed levels experience during the COVID-19 pandemic, which as you'll recall was reflected in 2022 earnings. First statute in order is expected on the reconciliation by December 17th. Since the last earnings call, there were three numerous cases were filed. First on February 15th, Atlantic City Electric filed a distribution based rate case with the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities seeking a revenue increase of $105 million, reflecting an RV of 10.5%. The filing supports critical investments to enhance service and deliver safe, reliable, and sustainable energy for customers through key programs, including the company's EV Smart Electric Vehicle Program and deployment of the Smart Energy Network Program, which I will highlight later in the presentation. Because of these sustained efforts to modernize the energy grid, eight customers experience the most reliable energy service ever in 2022 with the lowest frequency of electric outages on record. As permitted by New Jersey Law, ACE may implement full proposed rates on November 17th, subject to refund, and a final order is expected in the first quarter of 2024. Next, BGE filed its second multi-year plan with the Maryland Public Service Commission on February 17th, which we provided preview into on our fourth quarter earnings call. Covering the year 2024 through 2026, the multi-year plan details how BGE will invest nearly $2.3 billion annually in the electric grid and natural gas system and nearly $400 million total in electric vehicle and building efficiency programs. These investments will inject nearly $36 billion into the local economy and support an estimated 72,000 jobs as indicated in a study performed by Caldwell [ph] University. Importantly, BGE's infrastructure plan includes more than 300 projects and maintenance programs designed to continue meeting customers' needs, and lay the foundation for the state of Maryland to reach its goal of net-zero emissions by 2045 and order is expected on the proposed plan in December, 2023. As CF noticed, we also requested that the commission provide an order on the proposed reconciliation of 2021 and 2022 costs totaling $77 million of under recovery in parallel with the order on the second multi-year plan. That brings me to slide eight where I want to take a moment to highlight Pepco DC's Climate Ready Pathway multi-year plan that was filed with the Public Service Commission of the District of Columbia on April 13th. Pepco is requesting $190.7 million revenue increase over the 2024 to 2026 period to recover planned capital investments that are intended to enhance the reliability, resiliency, and security of the local energy grid, and to further support the district's goal to be carbon neutral by 2045, one of the most ambitious climate goals in the nation. Specifically, this will be done through investments in equipment and infrastructure that will enable the integration of more renewable energy, such as solar. They will also help customers access and adopt cleaner energy technologies like electric vehicles, and they will allow Pepco to manage load to ensure the electric service customers depend on is available when they need it. As the many maintenance programs included in Pepco's proposed multi-year plan, one involves replacing nearly 24 miles of aging power cables with newer and more modern cables so that all customers experience high quality of service and high reliability. It is the customers and communities that are at the forefront of Pepco's Climate Ready Pathways plan with a central focus on improving the social equity and advancement of affordability of electric service. As part of that commitment, the company is hoping the plan filing proposes several measures to address affordability, including expanding enrollment for the Residential Aid Discount program to include any customer who qualifies for any low income program in the district, as well as enhancing the Arrearage Management Program [ph]. Expansion of these programs would help to further extend the reach of valuable energy assistance, which in 2022 alone provided approximately $21 million to nearly 30,000 Pepco customers in DC or on average $700 per customer. Pepco's multi-year plan comprehensively work to keep service affordable, foster a cleaner energy future, and improve reliability, resiliency, and security through significant investments. This influx of resources directed toward accommodating the next phase of DC's energy transformation is expected to inject more than $580 million in the local economy and support more than 3,800 full-time jobs. An order is requested from the DCPSC by February, 2024, based on a proposed 10-month procedural schedule. All our ongoing rate cases are proceeding in line with expectations and you can find further detail on slide 20 through 24 of the appendix. Moving to slide nine. During the first quarter, we continued to invest capital for the benefit of our customers and are on track to meet our $7.2 billion commitment for 2023. These investments in energy infrastructure are vital to maintaining the high standard of service that we have in serving our customers while also preparing the grid for the clean energy transformation. Today, I would like to talk about how Atlantic City Electric is enhancing the customer experience in South Jersey through the Smart Energy Network program, the last major initial smart meter deployment program planned for Exelon utilities. Smart meters are foundational to a smarter power grid. They enable customers to better understand real-time energy usage in homes and businesses, and they provide enhanced information to make our systems more efficient and resilient. With a broad installation, beginning of September of 2022, ACE employees and their contract partners have been steadily upgrading approximately 30,000 meters per month, and all 568,000 meters are expected to be replaced by mid 2024. When fully installed and operational, the Smart Energy Network is expected to deliver $416 million in operational and customer benefits over the next 15 years. Most notably, these benefits include the ability to restore power faster and more efficiently. And they provide tools that help customers use less energy and save money, as well as a reduced need for estimated billing and the capability to provide more detailed outage information when outages occur. They also allow for better integration of new clean energy technologies, including solar, which has experienced the highest penetration in ACE's territory relative to all of our other jurisdictions at approximately 25% of net peak demand. To put a stand of benefits into perspective on an annual basis, ACE expect to eliminate 134,000 truck loads, reduce major store operations and cost by 10% and save $4.5 million in annual contracted meter reading costs. The Smart Energy Network is a critical step in advancing a cleaner energy future for South Jersey and helping the state meet its climate goals. Leveraging expertise from its sister utilities, ACE is committed to using its collective resources to ensure all customers realize the full benefits of this meter upgrade initiative. This is the power of Exelon platform. As shown [ph] a discussion on our balance sheet on slide 10, as you remember on our last earnings call, we project 100 to 200 basis points of cushion on average over our guidance period for our consolidated corporate credit metrics above S&P and Moody's downgrade thresholds of 12% over the guidance period, demonstrating our commitment to maintaining a strong balance sheet. If the corporate alternative minimum tax was not mitigated through an inclusion of repairs in its calculation, we anticipate being at the lower end of that 13% to 14%. We continue to await guidance from the treasury, which we are optimistic they will issue before year-end. And we remain encouraged by the engagement they have in understanding how its implementation can impact energy infrastructure providers like Exelon. From a financing perspective, we have successfully raised $2.5 billion at corporate and approximately $2 billion for ComEd and the PHI entities. Today we have completed over 80% of our planned 2023 long-term debt financing needs. This positions us well for any unexpected market volatility in the balance of the year. We continue to see strong investor demand for our debt offerings, which is a testament to the strength of our balance sheet and to our value proposition as a premier T&D utility with low risk attributes. To reiterate our equity needs, there has been no change in our guidance to issue $425 million of equity as a holding company by 2025. We'll continue to update you as we make progress on that plan. Thank you, and I'll now turn the call back to Calvin for his closing remarks.
Calvin Butler: Thank you, Jeanne. Let me conclude our prepared remarks with reminder of our priorities and commitments for 2023 as the premier T&D utility. It starts with operations. Operating safely and reliably is our core mission, and you can count on us to focus on that every hour of every day. Secondly, as you heard from Jeanne, we have a full set of rate case proceedings well underway that will set our path for the next three to four years, given our multi-year plan frameworks. The transformation of our energy system requires a lot of coordination and alignment, and we welcome the opportunities to engage with stakeholders on the most effective and efficient means to meet our jurisdictional goals. And third, we are focused on executing financially. We're looking to deploy $7.2 billion of capital this year, more than ever before, while maintaining earned ROEs in the 9% to 10% range and delivering on our 2023 earnings guidance range of $2.30 to $2.42 per share. We have made great progress on our financing plan for the year, while also laying groundwork for future financing needs, and we continue to focus on ensuring our balance sheet is strong. Last, we continue to focus on maximizing the value we provide our customs, and ensuring we are serving them in an equitable manner. As an example of how we are innovating to support a more affordable energy transformation, I'll point to BGE's recent partnership with the City of Baltimore. Specifically, BGE will share responsibility for improving the City's 700 mile conduit infrastructure, reducing the amount the City paid for maintenance capital improvements, and allowing BGE to take advantage of its contracting and construction efficiencies, all while ensuring a healthy conduit system to provide more reliable and affordable power. And beyond our direct operations, we will continue to support our communities beyond providing cleaner, more reliable energy, such as through our more than 75 workforce development programs across our six utilities. Indeed, investments like ACE's Smart Energy Network that Jeanne highlighted benefit greatly from those programs. In anticipation of this investment program, a six-year, 6.5 million job training program was established in 2018 to educate the workforce needed to fill the energy jobs of the future in New Jersey. 14 of our talented employees deploying the smart meter technology are graduates of that development program established five years ago. And we expect to hire more than 15 additional graduates by the end of June, reinforcing our vision of facilitating an energy transformation that will stretch over generations of thoughtful planning and coordination. We look forward to building on the progress made in these first three months and meeting our commitments in 2023. We are delivering on course. Thank you, and we welcome your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes to the line of Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim.
Shahriar Pourreza: Hey, good morning, guys.
Calvin Butler: Good morning, Shar.
Jeanne Jones: Good morning.
Shahriar Pourreza: Good morning. So, hey, guys. Just if we could maybe start with Illinois. I mean, we obviously saw the trial outcome last night. Realize you guys have taken a lot of steps since 2020 to improve, but any sort of high level read-throughs to the regulatory construct at this point, or anything remaining for ComEd from a legal or even judicial standpoint. Thanks.
Calvin Butler: Yeah. Thank you, Shar. So first from the start, as you know, Shar, we have cooperated fully with the investigations conducted by the government and our regulators. The deferred prosecution agreement signed in 2020 resolved the Justice Department's investigation into ComEd, but we want to be clear that we have done much more than that. We have made substantial changes to our contracting, lobbying and compliance operations to ensure that the conduct that was at issue in the trial does not happen again at all levels from my office and through -- throughout the leaders of the organization and the 6,300 employees who keep the lights on every day in Illinois. We are committed to the highest standards of integrity and ethical behavior for our business. We have the privilege and the responsibility of [technical difficulty] well over 10 million customers, and we do not take that lightly. But I want to have Jeanne spend some time talking about the other issues that have come as a result of this. And then I'm going to ask Gil, CEO of ComEd, to kind of walk through to your question, the regulatory and legislative proceedings as we move forward. Jeanne?
Jeanne Jones: Yeah. Thanks Calvin. And good morning, Shar. So, as Calvin mentioned, the deferred prosecution agreement, and this resolved our matter with the Department of Justice. But there have been a couple things that we've outlined in our 10-Ks and Qs that were legal matters surrounding the events leading to the DoJ [ph]. And I'll just touch briefly on those. And again, these will all be disclosed when the Q comes out and they continue to be updated and you'll see it when the Q comes out later today. But we did have a security suit derivatives and derivative suits and consumer fraud suits. And then, there was the FCC investigation, so just checking through those. The security suit was filed in 2019, and there's a next court status for that, that's late June. So based on recent development, we have booked a probable loss in this matter of $173 million, but that is expect to be fully recovered by insurance. So there's no earnings or cash impact from that. There are three derivative suits pending, including 1021, and there were a couple new ones filed in April and May of this year. They all assert similar claims and there's no updates from a financial perspective on those. But I would remind you that that one is a little bit different in that any amount recovered were resolved in cash receipt to the company and those types of lawsuits. And then there were three consumer fraud cases filed, two of which have been dismissed, and we just argued our motion to dismiss the remaining case in late April. And then lastly, the FCC investigation continues -- to continue to cooperate fully. But no update on that. And so, that's just kind of a status update, but again, we give kind of a play-by-play the Q for those. And so maybe I'll turn it over to Gil to talk through the multi-year plan.
Gil Quiniones: Yeah. Our proposed grid modernization plan and multi-year rate plan support in 100% alignment with the goals of the Climate Equitable JOBS Act and the Illinois energy policy -- energy and environmental policy goals of an orderly and equitable energy transition here in our state. It is a product of extensive stakeholder process with multiple parties, parties over the past couple of years. As you know, we filed our proposed rate case in January of this year, and we look forward to continue working with all parties openly and collaboratively. As Jeanne mentioned before, the interveners are scheduled to file their testimony this month. Hearings will be in August and the order in December of this year. So, Shar, we're on course and appreciate that question.
Shahriar Pourreza: Perfect. And then, just lastly, Maryland, obviously Calvin set a pretty aggressive offshore wind target last month, 8.5 gigs by 2031. As I guess as we look at the plan today, could we see incremental transmission opportunities at Delmarva, I guess put differently? What do you embed in plan at this point? Thanks guys.
Calvin Butler: So if I can, what you're asking is that from Maryland's offshore legislation that just recently passed, could that have a spillover that's happening along in Delmarva? Is that the question there, Shar?
Shahriar Pourreza: Perfect. And as we're thinking about transmission opportunities, yes, correct.
Calvin Butler: Yeah. I think first and foremost, Shar, the legislation does present an opportunity for Exelon to participate in transmission. The amend legislation, as you know, requires that PJM conduct a study of the transmission system and taking a more holistic approach with that. But it will -- what's nice about it, it will prioritize leveraging existing infrastructure, permitting risks and grid challenges, use of open access of collective transmission systems and avoiding any single contingency items. So this all goes to how Exelon can differentiate itself from others. And as you know, the state has a goal of reaching 8,500 megawatts of offshore wind energy capacity by 2031. And I think we are well positioned to be a part of that. And I have David Velazquez next to me who oversees our transmission. Dave, anything to add there?
David Velazquez: Shar, just to add. Yeah. We do think that there the potential for incremental opportunities on transmission there. We've not included anything in the current plan for opportunities that are there. And the way the legislation reads by the beginning of July in 2025, the JSC or the PSE will direct PJM to issue kind of a competitive transmission solicitation for the transmission that's needed to support the offshore wind.
Shahriar Pourreza: Terrific. Thank you guys so much. Appreciate it.
Calvin Butler: Thank you, Shar.
Jeanne Jones: Thanks Shar.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Zimbardo from Bank of America.
Paul Zimbardo: Hi. Good morning team. Thank you.
Calvin Butler: Good morning, Paul.
Paul Zimbardo: Great. If you could you discuss the O&M savings drivers you mentioned in the script and just at what segments you're expected to realize the offsets for unfavorable weather? I think you said across the platform, which sounds broader than I believe it's PECO and Pepco, where the impacts were from weather.
Jeanne Jones: Yeah. I'll hit on it. And then Calvin feel free to add too. So when you think about the $0.05, it's a combination of levers. And I'll start with what we did to sort of enter this year in a conservative and substantial matter. So we -- you may remember we had some weather and storm favorability last year and we did some derisking at the end of the year to help us in 2023 and beyond. And so that's helpful heading into the year. Second, if you think about where other volatility lies in interest rate exposure, we've really mitigated that risk by having completed our sole corporate financing in the first quarter. So locking that in, and you can see that in the sensitivities in our exact, we have no exposure really on that. And then as you talked about, right, we do have leverage across the business. It would be more focused on areas that hit the bottom line, but then remember at the corporate entity, dollar saved soldier down to all the areas as well. And so it'll be a combination across the platform. In addition to that, as I mentioned we do see some favorable depreciation at Pepco relative to expectations. And then finally, we had -- if you think about the $0.05 in totality, we had a penny of the favorability from the carbon mitigation credit deposit rate on that reg asset. On a full year basis, that's probably going to be about $0.03. So when you put all that together, pure line of sites offsetting the $0.05 and feeling good about the rest of the year and delivering in the range at midpoint or better.
Paul Zimbardo: Okay. Excellent. Thank you. And then changing topics. I saw the [technical difficulty] opportunity, could you quantify how much that could be? And just confirming if there's any offset to rate based, those kind of items are factored into the plan. Thank you.
Calvin Butler: Hey, Shar, you cut out midway through your question. Would you mind repeating that please? I mean, Paul.
Paul Zimbardo: Sure. I was asking about the IIJ, the Infrastructure and JOBS Act. Just I saw that headline during the quarter. If you could quantify what the opportunity could be for Exelon. And just if there are any offsets to rate based from kind of federal financing, if that's incorporated in the plan today.
Jeanne Jones: Yeah.
Calvin Butler: I'll let Jeanne take that and then we'll go from there, please.
Jeanne Jones: Yeah. Thanks Kelvin.
Paul Zimbardo: Thank you.
Jeanne Jones: So the $700 million is what we've applied for, so it's a really competitive process. So it's hard to estimate what portion of that we'll get, but what I can tell you is we haven't factored it in. So if there's -- we're not expecting any meaningful impact to rate base to finance needs, we're reaffirming everything. And then we'll continue to update that -- update you on that as that progresses.
Calvin Butler: And I would just add Paul, understanding, as we've said before, the IIJA and the IRA create tremendous opportunity for us as Exelon utilities specifically to partner with our jurisdictions and drive this energy transition faster. And it also goes to the affordability factor of what we do and how we do within our jurisdictions. So we're working it hard and we're partnering and looking for all the opportunities to really increase in our investments, but more importantly, partner with our communities in this endeavor.
Paul Zimbardo: Yes. No, I know you are. Thank you both very much. Appreciate it.
Jeanne Jones: Thanks Paul.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman from Wolfe.
Calvin Butler: Hey, Steve.
Steve Fleishman: Hey, good morning. Good morning, Calvin. So just on the Illinois, I guess we're going to get the recommendation soon on the multi-year, the new framework. So obviously, things like capital structure and ROEs and I assume rate base are the key variables. Are there any other -- and then I guess maybe incentives, are those kind of the key issues to monitor in the recommendations or any other things that we should be watching for?
Calvin Butler: Yeah. Thank you. I'm going to let Gil take that in because, he's been intimately involved in the process. Gil?
Gil Quiniones: I think you've pretty much captured. Those are the items that we anticipate. Parties are going to be to be interested in.
Steve Fleishman: Okay. And then I do -- I think there was a minimum capital structure allowed under the bill. Is that still…
Jeanne Jones: Yeah. It's kind of like true.
Steve Fleishman: … to 50%?
Jeanne Jones: Yeah.
Gil Quiniones: Harbor at 50%.
Steve Fleishman: Okay. And the -- I guess my other question, the carrying charge or recovery on the CMC deferral, this is just CMC cost that you're not yet recovering in rates that you're earning a carrying charge on?
Jeanne Jones: That's right. Yeah. It's -- it earns a customer deposit rate, which was zero in 2022 and then was reset at 5% at the end of last year, early part of this year. And so outside relative to expectations for this year. But that reg asset is expected to be collected and wind down by May of 2024. So it's not a future years earnings. But it is helpful this year.
Steve Fleishman: Okay. And then finally on the IRS implementation of IRA and the minimum tax, is there any -- has there been any developments or sense of outcome there? I guess on the -- I guess particularly the repair tax issue or just kind of sitting and waiting?
Jeanne Jones: Yeah. Same status. So still, about $200 million per year. We -- that's all reflected in our guidance and our -- so from an earnings and a credit metric forecast and we give you kind of the sensitivity of where we'll be if it isn't alleviated and where we'll be, if it is. Still, optimistically get regulations by the end of the year and still ongoing discussions with us EI, the industry and treasury on the repair deduction and in general, how the corporate alternative minimum impact energy providers like Exelon. And some further dialogue recently I would say about why the utility industry is different given the capital intensive nature of our business. And so just ongoing dialects, but no new changes to the assumptions or estimates.
Steve Fleishman: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Jeanne Jones: Thank you.
Calvin Butler: Thank you, Steve.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes on the line of David Arcaro from Morgan Stanley.
Calvin Butler: Morning, Dave.
David Arcaro: Hey, good morning. Good morning. Thanks so much for taking my question. There's a new chair in Illinois. I was just wondering if you had -- have had any initial dialogue or perspectives that you might offer? And how it might be to work together with the ICC going forward, especially given that it's such a busy regulatory year?
Calvin Butler: Yeah. David, thank you for the question. I think, as I said in my opening comments, the transition of leadership and commissioners is part of the process, and so we are really engaging with all stakeholders in a very collaborative process to move forward. But directly to your question, the Governor Pritzker did accept the resignation of Chair Solinsky [ph] and has nominated the incoming first Doug Scott, who as you know, used to be the former Chair of the commission and was very instrumental in the drafting and creating of the Climate Equitable and JOBS Act. And there has been communication, but the communications have been around moving the state's goals forward, and we have heard nothing to date that is taking, that are derailing those efforts. And as Gil alluded to earlier Jeanne, we're still expecting a final order on comments for your multi-year plan by December 20th. So also along with the new chair, they're getting a couple of new commissioners and again, that process continues to move forward.
David Arcaro: Okay. Great. Thanks. And I was also wondering with the ComEd and BGE reconciliations, I was -- I just wanted to check do those -- do there tend to be big swing factors in those regulatory processes, or are they pretty standardized just in terms of what costs fit in and are they smooth recovery processes typically?
Jeanne Jones: Yeah. So on the -- on ComEd, the reconciliation they filed is for the 2022 -- under the 2022 formula rate. So this is a reconciliation that has been going on for 10 years. So I think that that one is a little bit more straightforward. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, part of that is just the cash collection of the true up on the treasury rates under the formula rate. You set the rate based on prior year treasuries and then you can recognize it in earnings, but then you true it up in rates later. So that one's pretty standard in the sense that it's been going on and it's sort of clear. The BGE one though is the first reconciliation under multi-year plan in Maryland. And so this will be the first time we're going through it. But there's a framework there to work through. And so that's -- but that order will come in December of this year as well. And I think it's important for this year, but I think it's really important in terms of kind of what you mentioned, right, setting the precedent going forward so that we know what is recoverable, what's not. And you get into a place where you can say, okay, if there's a variance here, I can put up a receivable or reg asset or conversely, if we do well, we put up a liability and we'll get that back to customers. So I think going through that will be helpful as it has been. We've seen in ComEd, once you get through it the first time is very helpful going forward.
David Arcaro: Okay. Got it. That's helpful. Thanks so much.
Calvin Butler: Thank you, Dave.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question will be the last one coming from the line of Jeremy Tonet from JP Morgan Securities LLC.
Calvin Butler: Good morning, Jeremy.
Jeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning. Hi. Thanks.
Calvin Butler: Morning.
Jeremy Tonet: Just wanted to dial into Maryland, a little bit more if we could. We've seen changes in the commission and there are these kind of policy goals out there. Just wondering, how you see that affecting BGE, both the electric and gas side, or is that kind of offsetting over time or just wondering updated thoughts about the future of gas there and how the impacts Exelon?
Calvin Butler: Yeah. So great question. And with me, the room, I have Carim Khouzami who's the CEO of BGE. But let me take the initial piece and then I'll turn it over to Carim and see if he has any additional information. So just like Illinois, Jeremy, we're having a transition of a chair of our commission as well as a couple of Governor Moore appointees. Governor Moore has taken a very aggressive position to continue to push decarbonization and transportation electrification throughout the state of Maryland, really rivaling it with California and Illinois and alike and moving forward. Having said that, there is an alignment with the jurisdictional goals of what BGE is doing as well as Pepco Maryl. The gas portfolio within our business is -- we believe it's critical to the long-term decarbonization of the industries as we are going through the process of replacing the gas infrastructure within Maryland. We continue to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in that effort. And we've attacked it as a portfolio approach because reliability of the system and affordability for our customers is critical in our endeavors. So we have communicated that with the state. BGE has been very involved in those conversations, and I'll let Carim just take it a step further if he choose.
Carim Khouzami: Thank you Calvin, and good morning. I think you hit all good points. One of the key points to highlight is in last year's legislative session, the Climate Solutions Now Act, which set forth state goals for us to achieve as an economy wide, laid out a number of working groups where they would determine what is the right path for Maryland going forward. BGE and the other Maryland utilities are at the table with all the other interested parties, and we're working through those issues now, and that will be concluding at the end of this year with recommendations. As Calvin mentioned, there are a number of ways to get to the state goals. We see the pathway that is the most affordable, reliable, and resilient as being one that still includes gas as part of the infrastructure. And we're working with the groups to kind of talk through what is the right path for Maryland, and we do have confidence that will be part of the future.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. That's very helpful there. And then, just pivoting to results in, just a smaller question overall, but I was hoping you could illuminate a little bit of color on the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations there as far as the change in environmental liabilities and the change in perk audit liability, if just a little bit more color on what those items were.
Calvin Butler: Sure.
Jeanne Jones: Yeah. Sure. So on the environmental liabilities, that's a -- the PHI is a legacy issue where we continue to update estimates for remediation of that. So we just slightly increased the reserve there. On the ComEd item, ComEd and on the perk audit had an audit began in 2021. We got draft findings earlier this year. And just based on ongoing discussions, we booked about $15 million of a probable loss. So that's ongoing. But that's kind of the nature of the two. And infrequent unusual as we carver them out from an operating perspective.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. That makes sense. That's helpful. I'll leave it there.
Jeanne Jones: Thank you.
Calvin Butler: Thank you, Jeremy.
Operator: Thank you. At this time…
Calvin Butler: Is that the last question?
Operator: Yes, that was the last question. And at this time, I would like to turn the conference back over to Calvin Butler for closing remarks.
End of Q&A:
Calvin Butler: Thank you, Gigi. And I just want to take a moment to say thank you for joining us today. I appreciate your engagement and all your questions. And with that, it concludes the call. Have a great day.
Operator: Thanks to all our participants for joining us today. This concludes our presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.

===== 2022 Q4  (2023-02-14 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello and welcome to Exelon's Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. My name is Gigi and I'll be your event specialist today. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. Please note that today's webcast is being recorded. During the presentation, we'll have a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn today's program over to Andy Plenge, Vice President of Investor Relations. The floor is yours.
Andy Plenge: Thank you, Gigi. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining our fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Leading the call today are Calvin Butler, Exelon's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jeanne Jones, Exelon's Chief Financial Officer. They're joined by other members of Exelon's senior management team, who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. We issued our earnings release this morning along with the presentation, all of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of Exelon's website. The earnings release and other matters, which we will discuss during today's call, contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today's material and comments made during this call. Please refer to today's 8-K and Exelon's other SEC filings for discussions of risk factors and other factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts and expectations. Today's presentation also includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for reconciliations between the non-GAAP measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures. We've scheduled 60 minutes for today’s call. I'll now turn the call over to Calvin Butler, Exelon's President and CEO.
Calvin Butler: Thank you, Andy, and good morning everyone. I'm excited to be with you for my first earnings call as CEO of Exelon and one that concludes a very successful year for us. When I first joined ComEd in 2008, it was one of two utilities along with PECO under the Exelon umbrella. We recognized that we had an opportunity to take advantage of the power of the Exelon platform in a meaningful way. The company was already known for building world-class operations in the generation business commonly known as our management model. Over the course of the next 14 years, we applied the same principles of best practice sharing and accountability through performance measurement to our energy delivery business. We were building a standard of excellence to deliver improvements in reliability, safety, customer satisfaction and value. I was fortunate and privileged to be part of guiding this evolution first as the lead to ensure the Constellation merger crossed the finish line in 2012, then in my role as CEO of BGE and eventually as CEO of Exelon Utilities and COO of Exelon. In those positions, the leadership teams and I were able to challenge our talented employees to take our utilities to the next level. We sustained and expanded our operational excellence, improved customer satisfaction, enhanced team diversity and improved earned ROEs from mid single digits to our 9% to 10% target first at BGE and then at PHI. And as you'll hear today, 2022 gave us a chance to showcase what we've built, an ability to execute, push continuous improvement, and achieve a balanced outcome for our customers and investors. But as proud as I am about what our team has built, I'm more excited about what lies ahead and I want to layout our vision of who we are and what supports our value proposition. Exelon is the premier T&D company in the industry. Our platform is stable with sound fundamentals both operationally and financially. This platform positions us to support our jurisdictions through the multi-decade energy transition that is just starting. We can do it in a manner that supports affordability and equity while driving consistent stable growth for our shareholders, the type of performance that is a hallmark of a top tier utility. What makes our platform unique? Well, we have an extremely diversified investment plan in size, scope, and location. We have no generation. We have worked with our jurisdictions to operate under forward-looking rate mechanisms that provide value for our customers and predictable results for our investors and almost three quarters of our revenues are decoupled. This leads to a very compelling risk adjusted total return of 9% to 11% built on the foundation of an unmatched platform, operational excellence and strong partnerships with our jurisdictions and communities. The Exelon team has proven its ready to meet the challenge of leading the nation in its energy transformation, powering a cleaner and brighter future for our customers and our communities while creating value for our shareholders. I will now turn to Slide 5 and talk about our key messages for this call. I will start by recapping the strong performance in 2022. We executed right in line with our expectations, reporting operating earnings results of $2.27 per share. That exceeded the midpoint of guidance by $0.02 and represents 8.1% growth off of the 2021 guidance midpoint. We also had best on record operating performance at three of our four utilities. As for our rate case activity, we had four constructive distribution rate case outcomes, including two gas cases and two electric cases. We'll look to continue this progress in 2023 with several important rate cases this year. In January, ComEd filed with the Illinois Commerce Commission its first multiyear rate plan and grid plans under the framework established by the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act. The filing follows 15 stakeholder workshops, reaching more than 1,000 attendees as well as 45 stakeholder presentations. As Illinois progresses towards its decarbonization goals, ComEd is starting from an industry-leading position of strength. In fact, in 2022, ComEd was recognized with the Outstanding System Resiliency Award for U.S. utilities by PA Consulting while also maintaining an average bill that is lower than those in 47 of the 50 states. Beyond the rate case, ComEd and the City of Chicago announced a proposed Chicago franchise agreement and a related energy and equity agreement. Together, these agreements grant ComEd the right to continue providing electric utility services using public ways within Chicago and creates a new non-profit entity to advance energy and energy equity-related projects. These agreements build upon the century-long partnership we have had with the city and demonstrates our alignment around key energy and sustainability goals. Pending approval by the city and Exelon Board, ComEd continues to operate in the city under the prior franchise agreement. And later this month, BGE will be filing its second multiyear plan for its electric and gas businesses with Pepco D.C. and Pepco Maryland following later in the first half of the year. Like Illinois, Maryland's Climate Solutions Now Act has set aggressive climate and decarbonization targets, creating an environment where utility action and investment is a key priority and for which multiyear planned frameworks are particularly well suited. Jeanne will cover the rate cases and other regulatory activity in more detail shortly. As to our projected outlook, we have rolled forward our disclosures after adding a year to our guidance window. We are reaffirming our 2021 to 2025 target of 6% to 8% annualized earnings growth with the expectation that we will reach midpoint or better of that compounded annual growth rate. We are also initiating an identical target for 2022 through 2026 where we expect to deliver 6% to 8% annualized earnings growth over the four-year horizon with the same expectation that we will reach midpoint or better of that compounded annual growth rate by 2026. This is driven by the almost 8% rate base growth from 2022 through 2026, underpinned by deploying $31 billion of capital over 2023 to 2026. That's over $2 billion more than the prior four-year period. As we balance the required progress on the energy transition with customer affordability, we continue to challenge ourselves to deliver maximum customer value at the lowest cost possible. We continue to expect some variability in our growth rates from year-to-year, due to our regulatory calendar, but we have maintained the transparency provided in the third quarter around our path to achieving our CAGR commitment. For 2023, we are initiating our projected operating earnings guidance at $2.30 to $2.42 per share, with the midpoint that implies 5% growth off the midpoint of our 2022 guidance. Being slightly below the annualized earnings growth range is in line with the direction we provided on our third quarter call, but we do expect 2023 to be the exception. All other years are expected to grow within the range of 6% to 8%, if not above it. We remain confident in the earnings power of our business. We expect an annualized dividend of $1.44 per share in 2023, reflecting approximately 7% growth off of our $1.35 dividend per share in 2022. Jeanne will cover more of the specifics of our financial outlook. Moving to Slide 6, I want to spend a moment recognizing last year's accomplishments. Demonstrating the type of stable, predictable performance that our customers and shareholders expect us to deliver. First, we completed the separation from Constellation, which by any measure was a success and execute it in less than a year after our Board's decision to proceed. We did not miss a beat operationally, despite this separation. We invested more capital for the benefit of our customers than ever, while achieving the highest ROE since 2019. We were able to attract and retain a talented and diverse workforce in a difficult labor market, a testament to our culture of engaged and purpose-driven employees. And we didn't lose sight of the importance of supporting our communities through more than just the investments we're making in them. Our employees volunteered more than 126,000 hours and connected our customers to almost $600 million of energy assistance, an increase of over $100 million from 2021. We continued to build upon our history of workforce development, launching the Atlantic City Infrastructure Academy in the fall and graduating our first group of 26 students this month with the skills needed to succeed in careers in the energy industry. We achieved our highest percentage spend ever, 39% or $2.8 billion of total spend with diverse suppliers. We gave $22 million to support schools and students in our markets. These programs include learning energy basics in middle schools and our Exelon Foundation STEM Academy that inspires high school girls to pursue careers in the energy field. And we are doing our part to create a cleaner and brighter future for our customers, making good progress on our path to clean with 112 miles of gas pipe main replacement and 12% of our vehicle fleet now electrified. These are just a few examples of the type of work we do that has led to us being named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for 17 years running. Last, we delivered on our earnings commitment for the year. Ultimately, 2022 was about establishing and beginning to prove out the value proposition the new Exelon offers and our team executed well. Before I turn it over to Jeanne, I will review our operating performance for 2022 on Slide 7, which ended as strongly as it began. I'll start with reliability. We were top decile in outage frequency performance at three of our four utilities, and we were top quartile for outage duration across all utilities. Achieving performance like this requires sustained focus and effort across our business. First and foremost, it requires our team showing up 24/7, no matter the time or the conditions. For instance, Winter Storm Elliott struck our BGE service territory on December 23, taking out power to 112,000 customers. Our dedicated teams completed over 1,500 repair jobs in sub-zero temperatures and at times to bring just one or two customers back online to restore power completely without any injuries. And it wasn't just our BGE team. The power of the platform showed up in force with ComEd, PECO, and PHI supporting the restoration efforts. On behalf of the entire leadership team, we want to thank all of our employees on the front lines of storm duty for their dedication. We will not have this track record of excellence without their commitment. Operational excellence also requires smart and prudent investment that's compensated fairly, built around alignment with our jurisdictions on shared goals and priorities. Last year, we invested $7.2 billion of capital, earning that 9.4% ROE I mentioned. The ability to execute on this level of investment with the confidence that we're aligned with our jurisdictions is a key element of our success. We need to perform every day to maintain that trust. On safety, ComEd continues to maintain top quartile performance while we work to get our other three utilities up to our standards. Our efforts to reduce serious injuries have been successful, but we are also focused on implementing safety best practices at our utilities to avoid other incidents that have driven OSHA under performance in 2022. For the year, BGE, ComEd and PECO sustained top quartile customer satisfaction performance. This reflects our continued investment in technology to create a better customer experience, our top quartile reliability and our commitment to an affordable energy transition. And finally, gas odor response continues to be in the top decile across all three utilities, including with BGE completing the year with its best on record performance. We continue to accelerate the modernization and safety enhancements of the gas system while working with our customers and communities to live and work safely with gas. I will now ask Jeanne to review our financial update. Jeanne?
Jeanne Jones: Thank you, Calvin, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by sharing my own excitement about closing out our first year as the new Exelon. As proud as I am of what we accomplished in 2022, I'm even more excited about our future. Our utilities serve the homes of more than 10 million customers, customers that include our employees, our families, hospitals, schools, and businesses.
.: As I cover today’s updates, 2022 results, upcoming rate case activity and the roll forward of our financial disclosures, you will find that our focus on execution drives the results that customers and shareholders expect. Starting on Slide 8, we delivered strong financial results in our first year as a new company. For the fourth quarter, Exelon’s continuing operations earned $0.43 per share on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. For the full year 2022, we earned $2.08 per share on a GAAP basis and $2.27 per share on a non-GAAP basis. Results that are in the upper half of our narrowed guidance range and represent 8.1% growth of the $2.10 per share mid-point of our Analyst Day guidance range for 2021. Throughout the year, we benefited from rising treasury rates impacting ComEd’s distribution ROE as well as favorable weather and storm conditions. These benefits, along with strong cost control in our core operations, helped to offset higher interest expense at corporate and the businesses, along with the one-time items of discontinued operations and the voluntary customer refund in Illinois. That net favorability provided flexibility to reinvest back in the business and de-risk future years while ensuring we were meeting and exceeding our financial commitments. Quarter-to-date and year-to-date drivers relative to prior year are detailed in the appendix slides 32 and 33. Moving to Slide 9. Looking at our utility returns on a consolidated basis, we delivered within our 9% to 10% targeted range, with a 9.4% ROE for 2022. This is the highest our earned ROE has been since 2019 as we focused on mitigating inflationary pressures to ensure costs aligned with our allowed revenue. 30-year treasury rates improved as well, supporting ComEd’s distribution ROE. Looking forward, we remain focused on earning the allowed returns of the utilities, which we expect will keep Exelon in the 9% to 10% earned ROE range annually throughout the planning period, while investing to maintain reliability and keep pace with our jurisdictions energy transition. Turning to our outlook for 2023. We are initiating adjusted operating earnings guidance of $2.30 to $2.42 per share, reflecting a mid-point that is consistent with the directional guide provided in the third quarter. Relative to the midpoint of our 2022 estimated guidance range, the 5% year-over-year earnings growth is primarily driven by the continued increase in rate base as we deploy capital for the benefit of our customers as well as by increased revenues associated with completed rate cases. As a reminder, expected year-over-year growth in 2023 is slightly below the 6% to 8% range as PECO enters the second year with its current electric distribution rates and anticipates returning to normal weather and storm activity. 2023 also requires managing against cost increases in our multi-year plans out East as we await their first reconciliations, particularly at BGE and the end of the stay-out provision at Pepco DC. With the de-risking efforts we undertook in 2022, including initiating hedging programs for both our long and short-term debt as well as for Exelon’s exposure to the 30-year treasury, we are confident that our projected earnings will be within the range of $2.30 to $2.42 per share in 2023. Additional detail on our earnings sensitivities reflective of our hedging activity to date is provided on Slide 34 in the appendix. As you think about the shaping of 2023 quarterly earnings, I will remind you that, historically, we have realized approximately 28% of full year earnings in the first quarter, consistent with seasonal weather patterns at the utilities and the general cadence of completed rate cases. On Slide 11, we provide our updated outlook for utility CapEx and rate base, covering 2023 to 2026. We plan to invest $7.2 billion in 2023 and a total of $31.3 billion over the next four years, an increase of $2.3 billion from the prior four-year planning period. Since the Analyst Day disclosures for the 2023 through 2025 period, we have identified an additional $875 million of planned investments to serve our customers. Updates include refinements to ComEd’s distributional capital plan, which was developed as part of the multi-year integrated grid plans filed this January. The result is that over the next four years, our rate base is expected to increase 7.9% on a compound annual growth basis to $69.6 billion. This growth adds approximately $18.3 billion to rate base from 2023 through 2026, an amount roughly equal to the size of ComEd’s current rate base. With four multi-year plan rate filings planned for this year, I’d remind you that our capital forecast only reflects identified projects we expect to recover through our constructive recovery mechanisms. The plan reflects a disciplined prioritization of potential investments to balance interest, providing reliable service to our customers and progress on our jurisdictions energy goals while also maintaining affordability. Our plan remains free of any large speculative projects. In fact, the largest transmission and distribution project in our plan remains the $300 million multi-year Erdman to Summerfield Transmission Expansion project at BGE. This project represents only 1% of our total projected capital spend from 2023 to 2026. And the collective spend on the largest transmission and distribution projects at each of the four operating companies totals only 2.2% of our $31 billion plan. Turning to Slide 12, our ability to deploy $31 billion of capital for our customers over the next four years at affordable rates amidst persistent inflationary pressures would not be possible without a resolute focus on managing costs. At our adjusted O&M costs grown in line with average annual inflation of 3.2% from 2016 through 2023, they would’ve increased by approximately $1 billion. Instead, we are projecting a 1.7% CAGR for the same period, eliminating over $500 million of customer rate increases that would’ve occurred without our intentional focus on driving efficiencies. This includes leveraging our platform of four operating companies to share best practices and drive economies of scale. It also includes investing in innovative technology and processes such as a recent pilot to conduct vegetation management work with the help of specialized drones, reducing a two-day job for a human crew to 45 minutes of drone deployment. It also cut the material acquired by over 90%. We are particularly proud of keeping O&M growth low after the separation. We committed to our customers that they would not see increased costs because of the separation, and I’m proud to say we achieved that. From renegotiating key enterprise wide IT contracts to continually reoptimizing the organizational design for the services our utilities need. Our cost discipline culture ensured that we kept that commitment while executing operationally at top-notch levels and delivering earnings in the upper half of our guidance range. In 2023, adjusted O&M at our utilities is projected to be $4.2 billion, representing a 1% or $50 million increase from 2022, a rate well below the expected inflation rate of 4% in 2023 and building on our efficiency efforts in 2022. We will continue to ensure that our business is appropriately designed to efficiently deliver services as a transmission and distribution only energy delivery company. This study discipline around cost has positioned us very well. In the bottom chart, you can see Exelon’s average electric rates are 23% below the top 20 metropolitan cities in the United States. Beyond cost management, other unique factors contribute to lower bills for our customers, some of which Calvin discussed. But I’d like to highlight the benefit of the carbon mitigation contracts resulting from Illinois’s 2021 Climate and Equitable Jobs Act or CEJA. Based on energy forwards as of January 31, these credits are projected to protect ComEd customers from over $3 billion of additional energy charges between 2022 and 2027. That brings me to Slide 13, where I wanted to take a moment to highlight ComEd’s commitment to decarbonizing the communities in Illinois in the most efficient, affordable, and equitable manner possible. CEJA put Illinois on a path to a 100% decarbonized energy sector by 2045. It also provides a framework for ComEd to help support the state and make the grid investments necessary to support beneficial electrification, decarbonization, and the energy transformation. In one of its first steps to meeting the challenge of a clean energy economy, ComEd filed its multi-year integrated grid plan and multi-year rate plan covering 2024 through 2027 with the Illinois Commerce Commission. The proposed investment plan includes initiatives such as 4 kV to 12 kVconversions, bus reconfigurations, overhead and underground repairs and support for an anticipated 1 million electric vehicles by 2030. To smooth the transition for customers from the formula rate to the multi-year rate plan, ComEd has filed to defer collection of 35% of the 2024 increase until 2026. An order is expected from the ICC no later than December 20, 2023. Turning to Slide 14, as Calvin mentioned, BGE anticipates filing its second multi-year plan and first multi-year plan reconciliation with the Maryland Public Service Commission later this month. Proposed investments expected in the filing support the climate and decarbonization goals of Maryland’s Climate Solutions Now Act. As an example of how we are partnering with key stakeholders in Maryland consider the electric school bus program. The new law created a statewide electric school bus program through which BGE will be able to offer $50 million in incentives to school districts we serve to help cover the incremental cost of purchasing electric buses with a focus on access for low income and minority communities, plus BGE will also be able to call on those new electric fleets to provide grid resilient support through vehicle-to-grid technology. Those types of initiatives are what drive the local economic impact highlighted on the slide, including the support of over 72,000 jobs. BGE’s rate plan will cover electric and gas customer rates from 2024 through 2026 inclusive of a reconciliation on 2021 and 2022 cost from its original multi-year plan filing. Additional details will be available once BGE makes its filing later this month, with a final order expected by December 2023. With Delmarva Power Delaware’s ongoing electric distribution rate case, and Pepco D.C. and Pepco Maryland’s anticipated second multi-year plan filings, you can expect further discussion on these cases on future earnings calls. Turning to Slide 15, with $31 billion of projected capital spend, driving 7.9% rate base growth and with continued focus on earning ROEs of 9% to 10%, we are projecting compounded annual earnings growth of 6% to 8% through 2026 from our 2022 guidance midpoint of $2.25 per share. Maintaining our commitment to transparency from the third quarter earnings call, we have provided year-over-year drivers contributing to the expected annual growth in our earnings through 2026 on Slide 16. While there is variability in the year-over-year growth over the four-year time period, the business drivers provide transparency into our commitment of 6% to 8% through 2026. As you can see on the slide after 2023, we expect to deliver each year within the 6% to 8% range, if not above. We have reaffirmed our guidance for 2021 through 2025 of 6% to 8% with the expectation of being at midpoint or better. Similarly, we expect our four year CAGR from 2022 to 2026 will be at the midpoint or better of the 6% to 8% targeted growth range. We also continue to project an approximate 60% dividend pay-out ratio of operating earnings with a dividend growing in line with our long-term earnings. We anticipate an annualized dividend of $1.44 per share in 2023, which is 6.7% higher than the 2022 dividend. I will conclude with a discussion on our balance sheet on Slide 17. The attributes of our fully regulated transmission and distribution platform, including forward-looking recovery mechanisms, majority decoupled rates, de-concentrated investment risk and diversified jurisdictions will continue to provide flexibility going forward. Over our guidance period, we project 100 basis points to 200 basis points of cushion on average for our consolidated corporate credit metrics above Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s downgrade thresholds of 12%, demonstrating our commitment to maintaining a strong balance sheet. While the U.S. Treasury Department works towards implementing the Inflation Reduction Act legislation, our plan fully incorporates the impact of the corporate alternative minimum tax, including reflecting the results in deferred tax assets in each of the utilities rate bases, consistent with the recent rate case filings at ComEd and Delmarva Power. We have talked previously about how regulations and the inclusion of certain deductions would substantially mitigate the corporate alternative minimum tax impact. Without the ability to include certain deductions, we expect the cushion in our average credit metrics to be on the lower end of the 100 basis points to 200 basis points range. Our metrics would average closer to the higher end of the range over the guidance period if we were able to include those deductions. Consistent with our earnings profile, our credit metrics are expected to strengthen over time as we step into new multiyear plans and finalize the reconciliation processes. As we await clarity on the corporate alternative minimum tax, we continue to maintain the discipline approach to cost and cash management across all areas of the business, ensuring we maintain appropriate cushion above our downgrade threshold of 12%. I will close by reaffirming our financing plans with the holding company. We continue to affirm the remaining $425 million of our $1 billion equity commitment. We expect to issue this equity sometime between 2023 and 2025. As we work with our jurisdictions and find opportunities for further investment at the utilities, we’ll continue to ensure that our capital structure reflects a balanced funding strategy and a strong balance sheet consistent with the expectations of a premium, transmission and distribution company. Thank you. I’ll now turn the call back to Calvin for his closing remarks.
Calvin Butler: Thank you, Jeanne. Before turning it over for questions, I will end with the focus of what’s ahead for 2023. Operations and safety continue to be foundational. Maintaining reliability for our customers, while operating safely is non-negotiable. We’ll deploy $7.2 billion of capital, ensuring we make the necessary progress to meet the reliability and technology needs of tomorrow’s grid. Indeed, as many of you saw last week, the FBI announced it had interrupted a plot to damage Maryland’s power grid. The need to enhance the physical and cybersecurity of the grid has never been greater. The industry has made it a priority. The partnership between the industry and the government is key to our defences and on behalf of our employees and our customers we greatly appreciate the vigilance and dedication by the FBI and U.S. attorney for the District of Maryland in protecting our nation’s critical infrastructure. Thank you. Despite the urgency, investing capital efficiently will ensure we are making returns on our investments in line with those allowed by our jurisdictions, earning ROEs in the 9% to 10% range. As a result, we expect to deliver on our earnings guidance for 2023, maintain our focus on a strong balance sheet and execute on a number of rate cases this year to sustain operational and financial performance in the future. As we deliver on this plan, we will continue to focus on the value we are providing our customers. This includes not only continuing to advocate for policies that keep the customers as top priority, but also continuing to evaluate our own business to find efficiencies as a more focused transmission and distribution only utility. Like 2022, we have a lot we want to accomplish in 2023. But we again, expect to be successful because that’s what we do. And we know that’s what you expect from the premier, transmission and distribution company one that’s deploying $31 billion of capital for our customers with rate-based growth and ROEs resulting in 6% to 8% earnings and dividend growth and a total shareholder return of 9% to 11%. As always, thank you for your time and support. And we’ll now take your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nick Campanella from Credit Suisse.
Nick Campanella: Hey team. Thanks.
Calvin Butler: Good morning, Nick.
Nick Campanella: Thanks for taking my question here. Good morning. Good morning. I think in your prepared remarks, you said you’re going to include the CMAT as a deferred tax asset. And just – can you just give us more color on what’s informing your position on regulatory treatment here? And then separately, it sounds like the CMAT is not included in the FFO to debt metrics. You’re at the bottom of the 13% to 14%, but where did you kind of shake out in 2022? Thanks.
Calvin Butler: Sure, Nick. Thank you. I’ll start, and then as always, I turn to Jeanne because her team is leading this effort with treasury through the efforts of Rob with EEI. But as we continue to assume that the CMAT is implemented in a way that does not allow for repairs treatment, resulting in incremental cash taxes. As Jeanne talked about, we have fully incorporated into our guidance, including recording each utility CMAT on its balance sheet and as part of its rate base and the implied impact will move around as taxable income and book income change. That doesn’t mean that we’re not continuing to work with treasury to get those – that repairs language because we believe that is the best thing for our customers. In addition to that, Nick, as we’ve talked about, we have already taken that challenge and offset within our earnings, but we have pushed it down into the utilities where the income is earned and it will move around. But I’ll let Jeanne clarify, provide any additional information.
Jeanne Jones: Yes. No, I think that’s well said. As Calvin said, we’re still working on the tax repairs deduction and without specific language in the regulations, we continue to assume the higher cash tax burden, but you do – by having the deferred tax asset at the operating companies, you do earn on that in rate base. So that provides a little bit of sort of offset over time as that rate base builds. We also, so all of the cash taxes are included in our forward-looking guidance from both an EPS and a credit metric perspective. And we continue to reaffirm the 6% to 8% on the EPS side. And then as it relates to the balance sheet, we are still expecting to be at that 13% to 14%. And so with the inclusion of the higher cash taxes or said another way, without the repairs deduction, we expect to be closer to that 13%. If we are able to include the tax repairs deduction, we’d be at the higher end of that 13% to 14%. So, we’ll continue to work with treasury on that, and we’ll continue to focus on our cost management and cash management to continue to increase that cushion.
Nick Campanella: Got it. And then, sorry if I missed the disclosure, but where did you kind of end the year out on your credit for 2022?
Jeanne Jones: Yes. So we typically don’t give specific years. The rating agencies will publish that. We ended the year above our downgrade threshold. I think, as you think about credit metrics, the way we look at it and the way the agencies do is over a three-year, four-year time period because of the different moves in cash from a regulatory perspective. So, I’ll give you a couple of examples. While we’ve benefited from the higher ROEs [at ComEd] (ph) on the earnings side, we can recognize that the cash collections on that come through the reconciliation. So for example, in 2022, right, we had the higher earned ROEs, we won’t collect that until 2024. So it’s important for us to look at it on an average basis so that you capture those timing differences. The other aspect I’ll mention is, as I talked about in my prepared remarks, ComEd elected to defer some of the rate increase in 2024 to 2026. So again, looking on it over that time period is important because without it, you’re missing some of the cash timing. And that’s why we look at it on that average basis.
Nick Campanella: Thanks a lot for that. And then, I guess just, it’s nice to see that you bumped the CapEx program higher, and you’re not changing your kind of total equity needs in a five-year window here. Just of that remaining 425 equity, you guys did a block for the first piece. Just is it your intention to kind of dribble out the remaining here via an ATM or otherwise, any comments on that?
Jeanne Jones: Yes, we want to retain the flexibility just given varying market conditions, but we do still have our $1 billion ATM, so we can leverage that as needed to dribble it in as you suggest.
Nick Campanella: Really appreciate it. Thank you.
Calvin Butler: Thank you, Nick.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research.
Steven Fleishman: Yes, good morning. Thanks for all the…
Calvin Butler: Good morning.
Steven Fleishman: Good morning, Calvin. Jeanne, thanks for all the clarifications on guidances. Don’t have to ask all sorts of midpoint or median or other type questions this time.
Calvin Butler: Had to [Indiscernible].
Steven Fleishman: So just on Slide 16, I guess the one thing that’s interesting is just for PECO, in the 2023 kind of second year of a rate year, it was a – it’s a down versus 2022, but in 2026 second year it’s kind of more flattish or yellow arrow. Is that just that PECO had this return to normal weather and storms and other stuff that is an issue 2023 versus 2022, and that’s pretty much it, but like otherwise would be kind of the normal course.
Calvin Butler: Yes, you’re right on point, Steve. That’s exactly the reasoning.
Steven Fleishman: Okay. Okay. And then just on the topic of the – on Illinois, could you give us maybe some sense of when we’re going to get information on the process, on the recommendations and other stuff on the multiply year kind of timing?
Calvin Butler: Yes, and I do have with me Gil Quiniones, CEO of ComEd to really walk you through that process. So I’m going to turn to Gil to kind of walk you through the timing of how things are going to unfold. Gil?
Gil Quiniones: Hi, Steve. So there is a tentative schedule set. And in May, we expect the testimony of the interveners to be submitted in August, evidentiary hearings will commence. And again, the – after that all the way to the required schedule is for the ICCR regulators to make their final determination before December 20 of this year.
Steven Fleishman: Okay.
Calvin Butler: So that [Indiscernible] calendar, Steve, any additional questions on that?
Steven Fleishman: Well, just, is there, because this is first time, is it likely that this would go through a fully litigated process or should we think there might be opportunities to settle these cases?
Calvin Butler: No, I would anticipate on this - this would be fully litigated Steve, because, as we talked about, as I talked about in my comments, it’s been a very engaged stakeholder process. And if I was the commission in this, I would make sure that we have a forum for everyone to be heard and we wouldn’t rush to the final outcome because this will put Illinois on a path to decarbonize like no other state except for maybe California. And it’s in a very aggressive approach and the legislation is comprehensive and ComEd being the largest utility in the state I think they need to make sure that all voices are heard and the stakeholders are engaged throughout.
Steven Fleishman: Great. Thank you.
Calvin Butler: Thank you.
Jeanne Jones: Thanks, Steve.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of David Arcaro from – or Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
David Arcaro: Hi, good morning.
Calvin Butler: Good morning, David.
David Arcaro: Thanks for taking my question. Good morning. Maybe just a quick follow-up on the…
Jeanne Jones: Good morning.
David Arcaro: … PECO related question. I was just wondering, so you’ve got the one year in 2023 below the low end, but really back in the six to eight or above thereafter. And I was just wondering maybe more broadly or structurally like is the business now manageable within that 6% to 8% annual growth level year-to-year, even through some of the lumpier rate cases as you look forward?
Calvin Butler: No, if I understand the question, David, PECO is a very well run utility and operating at a high level. And because they have taken the option on the three-year forward-looking test year process, it is one that the regulatory agency understands, one with the company has deemed it is the best value for our customers. And although they have the option to file an additional alternative rate mechanism, we’ve stuck with this course. And we are also looking at to your point, how can we balance the earnings over the course of the three years where it’s more linear and process and the teams continue to work on that. We continue to look at other options, but have chosen to stay the course of where we are at the present time. And Mike Innocenzo, the CEO of PECO is here with us right now. Mike, would you have anything to add with that?
Mike Innocenzo: Again, I would just – I would echo that. In Pennsylvania, we do have the ability for three-year [ph] rate structure. We’ve continued to review this annually and believe that it’s the current course has been the best for balance between the shareholders and fair rates for our customers.
Jeanne Jones: David, I think the – so tapping off of that. On PECO, I would look you to Slide 16. So there is the second year of PECO in 2023. But to your point, beyond 2023, we expect to be within or above the range. And so, while you have PECO in 2023, there’s a couple other factors impacting 2023 that don’t carry forward. Unlike, our assumption that PECO continues on this three-year rate case cycle. There’s a couple other things that are unique to 2023 that I’ll just highlight. One is, as we’ve talked about, we’re not yet through the reconciliation processes in Maryland and D.C. for the first multi-year plans. Once we get through that, the alignment between rate-based and growth and earnings growth is strengthened. So that’s number one. The second is in 2023, we have the D.C. stay out provision. So they’re still on 2022 rates. And so as we get out of that and move towards 2024, you’re going to have new rate cases, new multi-year plans for 2024, 2025, 2026. Starting in 2024, so that starts again to strengthen the earnings power there. And then on top of that, ComEd is moving to its multiyear plan. And so as you go through 2024 you start to see again three of our four operating companies on multiyear plans with reconciliations, strengthening that alignment between rate base growth and earnings growth. And then you've got PECO with that variability that Calvin and Mike touched on. So that's why, if you look forward, 2023 is a little bit different than 2024, 2025, 2026, and I think Slide 16 really helps lay that out.
David Arcaro: Thanks for that.
Calvin Butler: Did it answer your question, David?
David Arcaro: Yes, absolutely. And I was just wondering on the – maybe just a quick other topic on the Chicago franchise agreement. I was wondering if you could just speak to the financial implications of the proposal that you've put forth? And your thoughts on the prospects to get that approved and when that could go into place? Thanks.
Calvin Butler: Absolutely. A couple of things. As we've been highlighting to you in our previous earnings call, we understood and have a clear understanding of what the City of Chicago was striving for. And I think the proposal that ComEd has presented in partnership with the Mayor outlines the goals of decarbonization, equity and workforce development. Within that ComEd over the course of the last couple of years as they've been negotiating this and putting this in place, understood the dollars in which they would do and what we would commit to as a company. Exelon, ComEd and alike and shareholder commitment to this effort because we value the partnership. So what has been outlined from the Mayor really is essence of all of that in terms. Gil, as I mentioned, is here to talk about some of the details, but what we have laid out is that this process goes to the Rules Committee this month with the city. And from there, it will go to a committee of jurisdiction. And we're confident that, as they begin to do an analysis of what we're proposing, it will meet the aspirations of the city and achieve those goals overall. So on the financials, I'm going to turn it over to Gil to kind of walk you through what that is.
Gil Quiniones: Yes. So for the Chicago franchise agreement, there are actually two agreements. There's the franchise agreement and the energy and equity agreement. And as Calvin mentioned, our goal was to align our proposal to Chicago's Climate Action Plan and the state's Climate Equitable Jobs Act, and we achieved those goals. In terms of the financials, it is a 15-year agreement with an option to extend for another five years and the first 15 years, we have committed – proposed to commit $100 million in shareholder dollars and if extended, another $20 million.
Jeanne Jones: And all of that's baked into the guidance that we've provided.
Gil Quiniones: Correct.
David Arcaro: Okay. Understood. Great. Thanks so much.
Calvin Butler: Thank you, David.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of James Kennedy from Guggenheim Partners.
James Kennedy: Hey guys. Good morning. Congrats on the outstanding quarter.
Calvin Butler: Thank you, James. Good morning.
James Kennedy: So I guess just kind of keeping on the topic of Illinois, how are you thinking about the backdrop for transition at the commission this year, given there's a vacancy, there some expired terms and some other overhangs on several at the moment?
Calvin Butler: Yes. James, great question, but I'll be honest with you. When we look at our interactions and engagement with regulatory bodies, we anticipate turnover. And that is exactly why – although we have regular conversations about the process and what we're proposing, our real engagement happens with our stakeholders, the stakeholders, our customers, residential, commercial and industrial. As I outlined in terms of ComEd even filing, I think there were over 45 stakeholder meetings, presentations over and over 1,000 different people attended these. So although the commission turnover is something that we deal within all of our jurisdictions, if we're doing this right, and I think we are. We're meeting the policy expectations of each of our jurisdictions, aligning our filings with those policies and engaging stakeholders at the grassroot level, the commission turnover should not be that big of a deal. So that's how we approach it in not only Illinois but in each of our jurisdictions.
James Kennedy: Got you. Got you. And then just on the expense side, '22 adjusted O&M look like it came in a little bit higher than the prior plan. I guess what were the drivers there? And how should we think about the, the future cost inflation embedded in the drivers and assumptions you guys laid out on Slide 16 that? Thanks.
Jeanne Jones: Yes. Great question. So for – you’re right, so for 2021 to 2022, we did see a little bit higher O&M. We had projected at Analyst Day to be up around a $100 million year-over-year due to certain IT investments, another infrastructure, cybersecurity work that was occurring in this year. But in addition to that, there were a couple other items at the end of this year or that impacted 2022. First was we have some onetime cost associated with the implementation of the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act at ComEd. So that’s reflective there. In addition to that, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we did some derisking this year. So we took advantage of the opportunity from some of the tailwinds related to the ComEd ROE and favorable weather conditions to get some work done this year, including corrective maintenance and veg management, but also some customer assistance and community support initiatives. So all in all that, that sort of gets you to the higher O&M for 2022. And then you asked about how to think about it going forward. I think the, our goal is to keep O&M as low as possible. You can see 2022 to 2023 is only a 1% increase and our long-term CAGR since 2016 has been about 1.7%. So our goal is to keep that as low as possible.
James Kennedy: Perfect. Thanks guys. I appreciate it.
Calvin Butler: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra from Evercore ISI.
Durgesh Chopra: Hey good morning team. Thank you for taking my questions. Jeanne, just a quick clarification on the $850 million - $875 [ph] million in CapEx which is sort of in the, I guess in the 2023 or the prior four years. Is that all in Illinois? Is that Illinois distribution?
Jeanne Jones: Yes, no, there was some also at BGE on the transmission side. So I think, while ComEd updated for its multiyear plan, there was also some added investment at BGE as well.
Durgesh Chopra: Got it. But most of it is in Illinois. And that is included in your, the multiyear rate filing?
Jeanne Jones: That’s correct.
Durgesh Chopra: Okay, thanks. And then just, I think this is back to you, but and I appreciate this is going to be difficult, but pretty sizable increase in CapEx that is great to see, and the equity didn’t move. Can you share any thoughts as we think about, sort of when you update your CapEx plan for future years, how should we think about equity needs? I’m thinking sort of 2027 and beyond. Are those going to be modest given that, you’re kind of trending upwards in your FFO to debt metrics?
Jeanne Jones: Yes, I think as you saw in the waterfall of the latest, sort of financing of the investment plan, our internal cash flows continue to strengthen as we step into new multiyear plans. And we have the roll-off of the onetime opening balance sheet adjustment in 2022. But, and as our rate base grows and depreciation, we collect that and reinvest it back in the business. As you think about, so for that period, right we’ve reaffirmed the 425 to the extent additional capital is required to help our energy, our jurisdictions with their energy transformation. You can expect us to fund it in a balanced way with a keen focus on our commitment to 6% to 8% as well as the balance sheet cushion that we talk about a 100 to 200 basis points.
Durgesh Chopra: That’s helpful. Thank you very much.
Calvin Butler: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference back to Calvin Butler, Exelon’s President and CEO for closing remarks.
Calvin Butler: Thank you, Gigi. Let me first begin by saying thank you to each of you for joining the call and the partnership that you’ve shown and demonstrated to Jeanne and I over the last several months. It’s been really appreciated. And to our employees, thank you for all the hard work and dedication that you demonstrated in 2022. We look forward to engaging with all of you throughout 2023. And with that, that concludes this call. Have a great day.
Operator: Thanks to all our participants for joining us today. This concludes our presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-11-03 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Q3 2022 Exelon Corporation Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today’s conference is being recorded. And I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Andy Plenge, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.
Andy Plenge: Thank you, Chris. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining our third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Leading the call today are Chris Crane, Exelon’s Chief Executive Officer; and Jeanne Jones, Exelon’s Chief Financial Officer. They’re joined by Calvin Butler, Exelon’s President and Chief Operating Officer, who will join Chris, Jeanne and other members of Exelon’s senior management team to answer your questions following prepared remarks. We issued our earnings release this morning along with the presentation, all of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of Exelon’s website. The earnings release and other matters, which we discuss during today’s call, contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today’s material and comments made during this call. Please refer to today’s 8-K and Exelon’s other SEC filings for discussions of risk factors and other factors that may cause results to differ from management’s projections, forecasts and expectations. Today’s presentation also includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for reconciliations between the non-GAAP measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures. We’ve scheduled 60 minutes for today’s call. I’ll now turn the call over to Chris Crane, Exelon’s CEO.
Chris Crane: Thanks, Andy, and good morning to everybody. We’re glad to have you with us this morning. As you know – as you all know, yesterday, we announced my retirement from Exelon at the end of the year due to some health reasons. I plan on addressing that at the end of the call after reviewing the operational and financial update of the quarter. Let me turn through, first, though, to the operating aspects of that announcement. Calvin Butler, our President and Chief Operating Officer become the President and CEO and a member of the Exelon Board on my retirement. Since Calvin began with us to comment, he has been a key part the development of our industry-leading platform. During his time at BGE, he made customer satisfaction best-in-class, significantly increase the leadership diversity and became CEO of Exelon Utilities after that. In that role, he continue to push the operating companies to align with the management model and drive industry-leading operational excellence. Jeanne is now CFO, which we’re very pleased with. Jeanne has been with Exelon for 15 years in various finance roles across the corporate and the former nuclear division. She was CFO at ComEd and most recently, Senior Vice President of Exelon Corporation. Jeanne has a very strong background and experienced positions for well for expanded responsibility. You’ll hear from Jeanne momentarily for the financial update. And both Calvin and Jeanne will join me for the Q&A of the call. I would also like to thank Joe Nigro for his work launching the new Exelon and successfully executing the spin. Happy to report solid performance for the quarter. The investments we’re making are on behalf of our customers and continue to drive strong operations and financial results. We reported GAAP earnings of $0.68 per share and adjusted operating earnings of $0.75 per share. We are reaffirming the midpoint of our range and narrowing it by $0.06. Jeanne will provide more color on that. We continue to execute at high operational levels, which I’ll speak more about on the next slide. We had a construction rate case outcome this quarter. The commission in Delaware and Pennsylvania improve settlements on gas situation rates for Delmarva and [indiscernible]. We also reached a settlement on key elements with the first multi-year filing for Delmarva Power first settlement for the multiyear plan. We expect the final order in December. In Illinois, ComEd received the final order on its performance tracking mechanisms and the plan in September. That’s a big milestone on the transition they’re making to a multiyear distribution rate construct, and it gives us a good foundation to build upon. As a result, we intend to file a multiyear distribution plan in January with a four-year rate structure beginning January 1, 2024, continuing through the end of 2026 choosing the multiyear plan over a future test year is the right choice for our customers and our shareholders. We appreciate the transparency and forward-looking planning in rate predictability that it allows. Our rate case will be filed at the same time as our multiyear integrated grid plant with the final order by the end of 2023. So there has been a lot of good operational and financial progress this year and we’re on track to close a very strong year. We know investors are focused on our outlook this year. First, I’ll update you on the Inflation Reduction Act. We’ve always strived for transparency. So last quarter, we communicated the potential impact or higher annual cash tax as a result of the IRA. Since passing the bill, we’ve been working with the industry and we remain optimistic that Treasury will implement the guidelines in a way that materially mitigates the impact. Regardless of the outcome of Treasury, we’re reaffirming our 6% to 8% annual growth target from 21 to 25, which I’ll talk bit more about shortly. In addition to reaffirming our growth commitment, we have emphasized the impact of the potential higher cash tax. Even in the event of the impact is not mitigated through treasury regulations. We expect that higher cash needs will not require us to issue additional equity beyond the original $1 billion commitment through 2025. On the positive side, the Inflation Reduction Act is very beneficial for our customers as we lead the energy transition. We look forward to the moment that we will build an industry as the industry takes advantage of this historic legislation past this year. Our jurisdictions were already driving for clean and federal support enacted this year is more affordable and accessible to customers. We see opportunities in terms of [indiscernible] to connect renewables, support alternative fuel production and distribution, and make the grid ready for increased electrification, including electric vehicles. Legislation alongside the Infrastructure Jobs Act provide more than $550 billion funding for energy related infrastructure over the next 10 years, which will generate significant demand for our investments we make. Finally, I’d like to talk about our growth outlook. We told you on Analyst Day, we expect to invest $29 million of capital to serve our customers in our communities over the next four years, which supports an annual growth rate of 8.1% that will drive the long-term earnings growth rate. As many of you know the path to achieving our annualized growth target is not linear, but 6% to 8% commitment through 2025 is our focus, largely because the cadence of rate cases, we have some years that maybe lower than that range and other years that will be above that range. We’ll see that more clearly when Jeanne covers Slide 9. On the operational highlights, Slide 5. We continue to ensure customers receive safety, affordability, and reliability and clean, which underpins everything they do. Excuse me. Reliability remains at top notch, we are again at top quartile for outage duration over all of our jurisdictions and outage frequency performance remains at high levels. ComEd and PECO achieved their best on record performance. In fact, through the third quarter of 2022, ComEd has delivered the most reliable service it ever has an over a 100 years. Reliability is 82% better than when ComEd had set out on a smart grid improvements in 2011. Our customers have greatly benefited from the investment as reliability on the grid increases. Through the third quarter BGE and ComEd – a testament to the reliability, I got a page ahead of my stuff. A testament to the reliability has increased data center growth in the ComEd district in the last few years. The data center additions have aggregated about 500 megawatts of new demand each year, approximately nine times the average of the annual amount seen in earlier in the prior decade. For safety ComEd maintains top decile performance, but the three other utilities continue to fall outside of that level [indiscernible]. We expect only the highest safety standards and performance for all utilities. Each utility is dedicated to implementing safety practices developed through lessons learned to minimize the chance of incident, and there’s an intense training program going on with our personalized supervisors to help further educate and it has set the expectation, which all utilities are participating together, which helps. Through third quarter – excuse me, three quarters BGE, ComEd, PECO remain in top quartile of customer satisfaction performance. Lastly, we remain top decile performance in odor response across our three gas utilities. For the third quarter in a row, PHI responded to all gas odor reports in less than one hour. Let me turn to Jeanne to provide the financial update.
Jeanne Jones: Thank you, Chris. And good morning everyone. Today will cover our third quarter results, completed an upcoming rate case activity, and then as Chris noted, provide further clarity on our earnings growth trajectory and potential balance sheet implications of the corporate minimum tax. On Slide 6, we show our quarter-over-quarter adjusted operating earnings. Exelon’s continuing operations earned $0.75 per share in the third quarter of 2022 versus $0.53 per share in the third quarter of 2021. As a reminder, the prior year third quarter reflects an $0.08 per share discontinued operations adjustments for certain corporate and overhead costs, previously allocated to generation that are required by accounting roles to be presented as part of Exelon’s continuing operations. These costs were paid for by generation and they are not indicative of our corporate overhead post separation. Excluding this $0.08 adjustment, Exelon third quarter results were $0.14 per share higher than the third quarter of 2021. The earnings growth was driven primarily by higher distribution rates associated with incremental investments and completed rate cases relative to third quarter 2021. The impact of higher treasury rates on ComEd’s distribution ROE, the absence of summer storm activity and distribution formula rate, timing at ComEd. This was partially offset by depreciation and amortization and higher interest expense on debt at the holding company. Year-to-date, results in drivers from the prior year are detailed on Appendix 540. Turning to the full year, we are narrowing our 2022 EPS guidance range to $2.21 to $2.29 per share from $2.18 to $2.32 per share. At Analyst Day, we told you we expected to earn 28% of our full year earnings in the first quarter, 20% in the second quarter, and 32% in the third quarter, or about 80% of full year earnings by the end of the third quarter. Delivering year-to-date earnings of $1.84 per share puts us slightly ahead at 82% of the midpoint of our revised guidance range, which considers the impact of higher treasury come on the distribution ROE, the absence of storms and our continued disciplined approach to cost management. These benefits are partially offset by higher financing costs at corporate and the businesses along with one-time items occurred in the first quarter. We are delivering on our financial commitments and are confident we will be within our revised guidance range at year-end. Moving to Slide 7. Looking at our utility returns on a consolidated basis, our trailing 12-month ROE as of the third quarter has improved to 9.3% and is back within our 9% to 10% targeted range. The 50 basis point increase from last quarter is in line with expectations as timing of equity infusions from the first half of the year are offset by the earnings growth in the second half of the year. As discussed on previous calls, we expect a trailing 12-month ROE to remain in our 9% to 10% target range at year-end. Our focus continues to be delivering strong earned returns at the utilities, which sustain the investment we make on behalf of our customers. Turning to Slide 8. There were some important developments in our open distribution rate case proceedings this quarter. Our successful execution builds momentum into 2023 when several jurisdictions expect to file a multi-year plans. Let me begin by highlighting key developments in the 2022 rate cases. On October 12, the Delaware Public Service Commission approved Delmarva Power settlement agreement without modification for its gas distribution rate case. The settlement was for a $13.4 million increase in distribution rates, which includes the transfer of $5.8 million of revenues from the distribution system improvement charge capital tracker into base distribution rates, reflecting an ROE of 9.6%. As permitted by Delaware law, Delmarva Power implemented full allowable rates on August 14, subject to refund. Additionally, on October 27, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission issued an order approving the joint petition for settlement in PECO’s GAAP rate case including an annual natural gas distribution revenues increase of $54.8 million beginning January 1, 2023. We also have two rate cases pending final orders. Notably, Delmarva Power reached a settlement on the majority of key elements for its first electric distribution multi-year plan with the Maryland Public Service Commission, including a cumulative revenue increase of $28.9 million beginning in 2023 through 2025, reflecting an ROE of 9.6%. The ability to reach this settlement is a testament of the many benefits of this progressive rate design, including customer rate predictability, ease of regulatory burden and transparency into future system investments at our utilities. We expect a final order from the commission by year-end. Lastly, we expect a final order on ComEd’s final distribution formulary update in the fourth quarter. More details on the 2022 rate cases can be found on Slides 18 through 22 of the appendix. Turning to 2023 rate filings. ComEd continues to prepare for a new rate filing in January of 2023. Throughout 2022, ComEd has been working with stakeholders on the performance metrics proceeding. On September 27, the Illinois Commerce Commission issued its order approving the performance and tracking metrics plans, which includes seven performance metrics with a total value of plus or minus 32 basis points. The order paves the way for ComEd’s first multi-year plan filing in January 2023 for rate effective 2024 to 2027. Details of the filing will be shared on our fourth quarter call. The multi-year plans across our East Coast jurisdictions have enabled investments necessary to improve reliability and customer service. They’ve modernized the distribution system and supported state environmental goals that have served our customers and communities well. Building on this momentum, we anticipate filing second multi-year plan at BGE in the first quarter, at Pepco Maryland in the second quarter and at Pepco DC in the first half of 2023. Additionally, we anticipate filing the first multi-year plan reconciliation with BGE expected to file in the first quarter of 2023. Our first multi-year plan reconciliation is an important milestone that helps us throughout variances from the costs we filed as part of the multi-year plan in early 2020. Importantly, this reconciliation process will also provide our first opportunity to understand how the process will be implemented for any potential cost variances in future multi-year plans. As you can see, next year, we’ll be busy on the regulatory front, but we are excited for the transparency and stability the multi-year plans will continue to provide our customers and stakeholders. Relationships across our jurisdictions will be constructive, and we are working together with our regulators, speeds and communities to support their clean energy and chemical. As Chris noted, this year’s federal legislation only bolsters support for and the affordability of the transformation of our energy economy. The multi-year plans provide a great structure to align on the pace and the progress of that transformation. As a reminder, we expect nearly 100% of our rate base growth will be covered by alternative recovery mechanisms, such as the multi-year plan by the end of our planning period. Moving to Slide 9. As Chris described, we are confident that $29 billion of investments we are making on behalf of our customers will result in expected rate base growth of 8.1% and 16% annualized earnings growth from 2021 through 2025. We have noted that our business model does include some variability in year-over-year earnings growth due to the timing of rate cases, largely driven by Pennsylvania, which generates strong returns that support the continued need to invest for the benefit of our customers. In addition, for 2022 and 2023 at ComEd, we’re exposed to the 30-year treasury rate before making the transition to a more traditionally set return on equity. We’ve attempted to provide investors with additional information on the year-over-year variability with the building blocks of our earnings growth trajectory. As defined in the chart, the gray arrows represent implied 6% to 8% CAGR pass from the 2021 guidance mid-point of $0.02 per share as disclosed at Analyst Day through 2025. While the [indiscernible] illustrates expected year-over-year growth percentages from the prior year relative to the 68% range each year. Getting to the growth drivers, starting with 2023, we have already mentioned ComEd in its exposure to the 30-year treasury rate. Although current forward imply we should see some good upside to its ROE, we’ll need to monitor the impact through 2023, which remains fully exposed to market move. People will be in year two of its existing electric distribution rate per year cycle and as a result, is expected to have lower year-over-year earnings assuming normal weather. PECO’s earnings should be positively impacted by new GAAP rates, transmission and its distribution system improvement charge tracker, which provides a mechanism for recovery on distribution investments made between rate cases. Weather and store normalization will also be a factor in the PECO’s decoupled and we are modestly benefiting from weather to date. Like all companies, we face challenges from higher financing costs and inflation, which we are working hard to offset through productivity initiatives, investments in technology and by leveraging our size and scale. Reconciliation processes in 2023 in Maryland and DC will help establish precedent for future cost recovery under the multi-year plan. Lastly, at corporate, we will see increased costs as we continue to refinance our remaining floating rate from the separation as well financing the investment needs of our utilities at the current higher rates. As we do have the utilities, we continue to challenge our corporate center to reduce costs. For all these reasons, 2023 is expected to be below the lower end of the 6% to 8% growth range based on our outlook as of September 30. In 2024, we expect to be in the range as we enter the next cycle of our BGE and PECO multi-year plan, which allow us to align with stakeholders for the next three-year phase of the clean energy transition. PECO is expected to be in its third year of its existing electric distribution rate impacting year-over-year growth. Then with an expected rate case filing for PECO electric in 2025 and the rest of our utilities growing generally in line with the rate base investments, we expect to be above the upper end of the 6% to 8% range in 2025. The combination of growth across these years should put us squarely in the 6% to 8% range on an annualized basis for the 2021 through 2025 planning horizon. You can expect us to initiate 2023 guidance and provide a roll board of CapEx, rate base and financing plans as we normally do on our fourth quarter earnings call. Turning to Slide 10. Exelon remains committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and a battered credit ratings continue to be a top priority. Our long-term corporate consolidated credit metric outlook remains strong for both S&P and Moody’s, regardless of the outcome of the corporate minimum tax. If the corporate minimum tax is enacted as written in the Inflation Reduction Act, the exposure tax on balance sheet is approximately $200 million per year as is posted in our August 8-K filing. We are working with the industry and remain optimistic that this impact can be mitigated. Even if unmitigated, as Chris noted, we expect to observe the cash impact on our balance sheet with cushion above our downgrade thresholds and we expect to be in our targeted 13% to 40% average range over the planning horizon without a need for incremental equity beyond the previously announced $1 billion commitment from 2022 through 2025. As a reminder, we issued $575 million in equity in August through a onetime offering and lease the remaining $425 million over the 2023 through 2025 period. Our commitment to a strong balance sheet is a top priority to ensure we can make the investments needed on behalf of our customers. I want to close by reiterating our confidence in investing an estimated $29 billion of capital from 2022 to 2025 driving 68% earnings growth from 2021 to 2025 and a strong balance sheet. This remains the case regardless of whether the corporate minimum tax is mitigated. Thank you. I will now turn the call back to Chris for his closing remarks.
Chris Crane: Thanks, Jeanne. Moving to Slide 11. I’d like to emphasize excellence in value proposition and placing the energy delivery industry. The economy is making the transition to a cleaner, more resilient energy model the significant federal legislation passed this year, including the IIJA and the IRA provide momentum and support to our jurisdictions, which have been leading the way for years. Exelon offers an unparalleled exposure to that opportunity. We serve more electric and gas customers in any of the utility in the country in some of the largest cities of the country. We have earned the trust of our customers and our commissions by consistently reliably providing top-notch operation performance. And we live our values with steady commitments to path – to our path to clean goal as well as through environmental advocacy and is support for our communities in a strong governance model. As a result, there is a tremendous demand and support for investments we expect to make in our communities, which, as I said earlier, totals that $29 million of capital from 2022 to 2025. And only in the beginning stages of the transition that will take hold a few decades. None of our investments represent more than 1% of the $29 billion and the result from customer growth need to keep up the customer demand and the resilience on the [indiscernible] So we continue to feel confident in our 8.1% rate base growth and the projected 6% to 8% growth through – rate growth through 2025. We offer a very strong proposition – we have offered very strong proposition and will continue for years to come with the balance sheet and matching dividend commitments, combining our 3.5% dividend yield with the 6% to 8% annual growth offers low risk to the 9.5% to 11.5% total return proposition. That brings me to my retirement announcement. As noted in the release yesterday, I’ll retire at the end of the year. And as I mentioned, Calvin will assume the role of CEO and a member of the Exelon Board. We have made this decision recently that I will need treatment for a significant spine and hip issue that require me to focus on my health. Because of these issues, I won’t be able to join you – but Calvin and Jeanne and other members of our senior team look forward to seeing you there. Being part of building this industry-leading company over the last 24 years has been an honor. Regardless of the economy, the commodity prices, the regulatory output for our asset mix, Exelon has always focused on job running its operations safely and at top notch levels to serve our customers. We have built an amazing platform over the decades. I want to thank all of our talented employees, what they have done to get us where we are today and recognize the diverse experience and innovative approaches that will get us to where we need to go tomorrow. While I’ll miss being part of the team being this energy industry transformation, I have all the trust in the world of Calvin and his leadership team to rise to the latest challenges in Exelon in many ways. As always, thank you for your time and support and we’ll now take questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Ross Fowler of UBS. Your line is open.
Ross Fowler: Good morning, Chris. Good morning, Jeanne. Chris, best wishes as you deal with the spine issue, really sincerely hope everything works out okay. So just on Slide – let’s maybe go back to – Jeanne to go back to Slide 9 and just think about what this is communicating. If I kind of look at the 210, which is the midpoint of 2021 guidance, that should be my base year for thinking about the 6% to 8% range. And then you’re saying in 2023, you’re below that. So, if I’m thinking about this correctly, I take the 225 [ph] base or midpoint of 2022. That’s really saying given that, that 7% growth of 2021, that you’re growing maybe at sort of 4%, if I’m thinking about the math directly off 2022 into 2023. But then if I think about what you’re saying for 2024 and 2025 will swinglines here around 7% and above 8%. You got to kind of get back to that 7% four-year CAGR midpoint off 2021 by the time we get out to 2025. Is that a fair way to think about this?
Jeanne Jones: Yes, yes. You’re thinking about it right. And I’ll just reiterate that the shareholders [ph] represent year-over-year growth from the prior year. So the way you walked through it is right. And then what we’ve tried to do is not give you a specific number for every year, but sort of narrow the outcome based on the building blocks below the CAGR line. So you can see the combination of growth over those years, puts us squarely in the 6% to 8% commitment 2021 through 2025.
Ross Fowler: Okay. Great. Perfect. And then maybe on the $200 million of cash tax impact, you said that’s unmitigated. Is mitigation here really just about the treasury rules? And what’s the timing of maybe getting a first preliminary look at those treasury rules? Is that really Q1 since every corporation is going to have to make an estimated tax payment at some point in April? And then if you mitigate that, does that change the equity need at all? Or is that equity need pretty firm regardless of what happens with this $200 million?
Jeanne Jones: Sure. Yes. So, I think three questions there. First, when we think about mitigation, there is working with EEI and the industry on the regulation. So that certainly would be a meaningful mitigation there if the regulations are written in a way that allows for certain deductions that we’ve previously had. But I would also say, as you know, right, we will look internally to do what we can, mitigate anything that we can on our end. But it’s a combination of those factors, but that’s right, the 60 basis points to 70 basis points that we put on the slide is the unmitigated whether through the regulations or internally the most conservative impact. I think your second question, I’m forgetting, but the third question was if the regulations do mitigate it or if it’s a 60 basis points to 70 basis points go away are we still committed to the $425 million that we are. So, we’re not – we don’t expect to do any more than the $1 billion we announced. As you know, we’ve already done the $575 million and then the remaining $425 million will execute between 2023 and 2025. The timing of the regulation.
Ross Fowler: Yes. The second question, the second part of the question. Yes, timing. Yes.
Jeanne Jones: Yes. So it would be helpful to have them by the first quarter. Obviously, that would be when we make our first payment that would be helpful, and we’ve sort of signaled that, that would be helpful, but we really can’t control. And we should know more next year, the sooner the better, obviously. But we’re still working through that. There are obviously the treasury is obviously still working through that.
Ross Fowler: Okay, great. Thank you. I’ll jump back in the queue. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. One moment please for our next question. Our next question will come from Paul Zimbardo of Bank of America.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey good morning. It’s actually Julien here. Thanks for the time and Chris my best wishes here. If I may, just with respect to this quickly lines, as we call them, and your commentary about being squarely within – I don’t mean to repeat the last question too much, but to ask you does squarely within equate to effectively at the midpoint of the 6% to 8%? Is that a fair way to interpret that specific language you used?
Jeanne Jones: Yes. I think we always seem to be solidly in within the range, right? But we haven’t given you sort of where with it. But what we’ve tried to do is show you that if you look at the year-over-year growth, and you look at the drivers below it that we are confidently reaffirming our 6% to 8% 2021 through 2025.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Fair enough. Sorry, I don’t mean the word it too much. You use the word. And then related second follow-up, if I may, on balance sheet. I know you talked about uncertainties here, but it sounds as if I’m hearing you correctly, the risk of having to make a payment, that payment being unknown, you’re confident in the current cumulative $1 billion of capital outlay on equity as being intact almost regardless of the various scenarios. Again, it doesn’t sound like it’s less than the $1 billion cumulatively, but it also similarly, depending on the scenarios doesn’t sound like it’s more than that as best you can tell right now again. And then if you can elaborate a little bit, is there any other nuance that we should be aware of that might be an offset to cash flow here to keep metrics intact? Or is this just simply a reduction of the metrics?
Jeanne Jones: Yes. I think it’s – I think you’re thinking about it right. We are affirming we don’t need more than the $1 billion that we mentioned after analyzing the unmitigated impact. We can – again, whether it’s unmitigated through EEI or internally, we can absorb that on the balance sheet, stay above our downgrade threshold without incremental equity and then be within our 13% to 14% over the planning price.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. All right. Fair enough. Thank you for the clarification.
Jeanne Jones: Thanks, Julien.
Operator: Thank you. One moment please for the next question. Our next question will come from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Steve Fleishman: Hi good morning. Chris, I also want to give you the best wishes and hope your health gets better and just recognize – just I know we’re seeing it more through a different stock right now with CEG, but just the turnaround in nuclear that you help kind of make happens pretty remarkable. So congrats on that. Just on the – I guess, Jeanne, just on the first question on the nonlinear growth. I think from the very beginning when you gave the guide of the new Exelon, you did kind of – you did say that it wasn’t going to be linear and may not be in the range each year. So just now that you’re giving this incremental information, is it pretty consistent where it would have been if you had just given this at the beginning of the year, just reflecting this PECO rate cycle for the most part? Or are there other like big changes that have occurred?
Jeanne Jones: Yes. I think the trajectory is pretty consistent. There might have been some puts and takes between 2023 and 2024, but the sort of nonlinearity. And I think the fundamental thing is it’s consistent with what we said at Analyst Day and that we’re investing $29 billion, which drives the rate fees growth of 8.1%, which drives the earnings growth. But because of the rate case timing, there’s some variability in there. And I think what we’re hopeful here is that this visual provides more clarity on how that – how those rate cases impact different years.
Steve Fleishman: Okay. Second question is, I think some people are trying to take those each year number from the Slide 9 and kind of taking, even though it’s an estimate to kind of adding that up. And when you do that by 25, you kind of maybe get to the lower half of the 25 range. Is that not what you should do because there’s estimates are just how – how should we take that?
Jeanne Jones: Yes. I think what I would just say, the combination of growth over the years and we’re – and then the tilde [ph], I’m laughing because we’ve – you wouldn’t view us laugh at how much we spend over tilde versus other things here to show the visual. But what we’re trying to show here is that the combination of growth puts you squarely in the range. And so that’s what we want to reiterate through the investments of the $29 billion, what we’re confident we’re going to be squarely in the range.
Steve Fleishman: Okay. And then just on the, going back to the alternative minimum tax, I think one of the big issues of focus with treasury is the repairs tax and whether that could get included. If you could get the repairs tax addressed as part of this, would that – would that cover most of this $200 million because some companies are actually assuming that it will get fixed?
Jeanne Jones: Yes, it would.
Steve Fleishman: It would, okay.
Jeanne Jones: It was substantially mitigated, yes.
Steve Fleishman: Okay.
Chris Crane: One thing Steve [indiscernible] with the IRS. So they march to their own big – our tech folks here are working with the industry and are really working on trying to communicate the necessity to move faster. But there can’t be a guarantees in the first quarter we have a good agreement on the approach.
Steve Fleishman: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.
Jeanne Jones: Thanks Steve.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question will come from David Arcaro, Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
David Arcaro: Hey, good morning. Thanks much for taking my questions and Chris best wishes from my end as well. As we look at the upcoming comment, multi-year plan, filing in January, I was just wanted to get a sense how comfortable and confident are you in managing that jurisdiction within a four-year plan going forward. Do you anticipate the parameters are going to be manageable to work under over that period?
Gil Quiniones: This is Gil Quiniones, CEO of ComEd. We have to had a constructive relationship with stakeholders and other parties here in our jurisdiction. And what you will see from us is that our plans will squarely align with the goals of the Climate Equitable Jobs Act, and generally the energy environmental and economic policies of this state, so that will be our plan and as was noted in the earlier remarks, the details of such we will share in our next earning call.
David Arcaro: Okay. Got it. Thanks. And then as we think about just the PECO electric earnings dynamic here, I was just wondering if as you’re planning out longer term, are there opportunities that you’re looking for or exploring to smooth out just the EPS contributions, whether it’s kind of shifting around expenses and cost saving opportunities? Are there longer term ways to smooth out the EPS growth trajectory?
Calvin Butler: Good morning. This is Calvin. We’re always looking at ways to operate our business more efficiently and manage our costs because that’s our responsibility in delivering that value to our customers. And as we’ve talked about previously, affordability is a driving factor as we operate in all of our jurisdictions. And just remember, PECO is one of our highest – is our highest earning utility in the fleet and one of the highest earning across the country. And the constructive regulatory environment within Pennsylvanian is something that we’ve come to build on and have that relationship – collaborative relationship with the regulators. So as we continue to manage across our platform, we will always look at costs within the operating units as well as at the corporate center; so to answer your question directly, yes.
David Arcaro: Okay, great. Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. One moment – just a second for our next question. Our next question will come from Jeremy Tonet, JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Jeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning.
Calvin Butler: Good morning Jeremy.
Jeremy Tonet: Just want to come back, I guess to 23 to 25 go drivers a little bit and anything else you could say as far as the way you can to minimize the headwinds for 2023 to operate against the plan and really just want to see what 30-year expectation was baked into the guidance there?
Jeanne Jones: Sure, yes. So I’ll take that. As Calvin mentioned, I think the first and foremost is our continued focus on cost management. So we continue to do that. I think the other thing is we’re also looking to manage interest rate volatility. So when you think about our long-term financing, we use tools there like creation, hedging to dollar cost average into the long-term rates before the issuance on our short-term debt. We’ve got interest rate caps that protect against the upside but also retain the benefit should rates fall. So we’re doing all the things we can to control costs heading into 2023. And then in addition to that I think you asked about where we marked that, I think in the footnote it says as of 9.30 [ph], so we marked comment to the 9.30 rate for 2023 there.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. That’s helpful. Thanks. And maybe just one more question if I could, if you applied the new Illinois performance metrics historically to ComEd, how would it have scored and how do you think about the opportunity here going forward?
Jeanne Jones: Yes. I would say there – the categories are somewhat consistent, but they’re also different enough, right? I don’t think you can back cast it. But what I would say is under the formula rate, one piece that’s very different as there was only downside risk and so we only had penalties under the formula rate. What’s constructive about this new path going forward is we now have the opportunity to do better. And as you heard Chris say, ComEd performing the best it ever has in its 100 years of operations. And so we’re excited about that. I think the other thing about the multi-year plan is the upfront alignment around the investments. And that was also there in the formula rate where we agreed that there would be grid modernization required and smart meters. And when you look at the results of that ComEd improve the reliability at 82%. So we like the ability to align upfront and we like the ability to get recognized should we perform well, which ComEd has done.
Gil Quiniones: And Jeremy, I would add that keep in mind how those performing metrics were developed. They were done in collaboration and partnership with stakeholders. So we started the process of transparency in which ComEd as they go in to file their multiyear rate plan. That’s the value of working with your customers and your regulators to ensure that the investments that you are making are leading to the increased reliability, resilience and meeting the clean energy goals of the state as Gil pointed out. And I think that is the first step as we continue to build a process in a constructive regulatory environment.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. That’s helpful. I’ll leave it there. Thanks.
Jeanne Jones: Thanks, Jeremy.
Calvin Butler: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our last question will come from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Michael Lapides: Thank you very much and Chris, obviously wish you well, wish you the best physically. Can – a cost question. When you benchmark yourselves whether benchmarking T&D, O&M or benchmarking at the corporate center, and I’m sure you still do a lot of that. Where do you think you do not score in the first quartile? Meaning from a cost management perspective? Where do you think whether it’s transmission, distribution, customer service, customer accounts or corporate G&A, where do you think the greatest opportunity set, not in the near term, but over a three to five, three to seven year period is to get more efficient? Like can you just kind of point directionally at where the opportunity sets may lie?
Jeanne Jones: Yes. I think that it operates – we look at it across the board and we would say there’s opportunity everywhere, right? We want to drive to the lowest cost possible while maintaining safety and reliability. I think the where everyone can kind of see what we see is where it shows up in our affordability metric because O&M is such a lever when you think about driving affordability. And so when you look at our electric, whether it’s build or rate on any metric, we are below the national average, whether it’s percent of median income, whether it’s average rates, we look at our average rates and they’re 20% below the top 20 metropolitan cities. When you look on the gas side, our gas bills are some of the lowest in the states we operate. So I think that, that’s where you can see our history of continued financial discipline. But that’s important that we look across all areas, whether it’s the corporate center, power utilities, and I think it shows up best in those metrics.
Calvin Butler: And Michael, what that jumps I’ll add to you is that in 2022, after the split, had a lot of talent go over to the other side to Constellation, and we continue to maintain our operational performance and metrics and continue to – at that time, it was one, keeping your O&M flat to below the rate of inflation and each of our operating companies continue to do that. And our corporate center stepped up because one of our commitments, and it continues to be one of our commitments when we announced the split that we would not let our corporate services ride as a result of that. And we were spending so much of that building over to the other side of the business. And we ended the year on the split to go back to our commissions and we met that regulatory compact. And that’s what I’m protest teams and the leadership and how they continue to dive in. And as I said earlier, costs will always remain a focus of ours and under Chris’ leadership, what you’ve seen is that Exelon has continued to raise the bar and meet that challenge. And I commit to you and we commit to you leadership team will continue to do that.
Michael Lapides: Got it. And I guess one follow-up on the cost side because I was kind of probing for a little more granularity and kind of where when you benchmark performance you see the opportunity sets within the organization to kind of get the cost performance up. That’s kind of the follow-on if you can give a little detail. The other is we’re starting to see companies that have formed via years and years of combinations. Recognize that there’s a little bit of hidden value in corporate real estate. And given the fact that you serve a lot of urban markets, just curious how you’re thinking about the real estate footprint of the company and whether there’s value that maybe not necessarily being the owner or the lessor of all of that real estate. We’re seeing companies like one of your T&D neighbors in the Midwest, Mid-Atlantic and we saw PG&E with their headquarters a year or so ago. Just curious how you’re looking at that opportunity set as well to both lower cost to improve the income statement but also to improve customer bills.
Calvin Butler: Yes. We have and we continue to look at that. We are consolidating our control centers across our fleet. We continue to look at how in this new hybrid work environment in some of our areas, what does that mean for office space. And as part of our real estate portfolio and supply chain, we continue to drive those costs out of our business. But as we’ve said, affordability is going to remain a focus, and we’re going to look at every opportunity we have to drive that. And I’ll turn it over to Chris.
Chris Crane: I think you’re used to us having the nuclear benchmarking book and how every nuclear operator shared their operational data and their cost data. UCG, we’ve got a lot of information from. And so we have very solid benchmarks. What we know is the national rates, affordability rates and we’ve continued to stay low those. But you’re not going to get the same level of disclosure from every facility like you got it from every plant. So the team has to work hard not only benchmarking ourselves against ourselves but also finding willing partners that will let us benchmark with them and benchmark with us. So we have a very high level of confidence Jeanne said it the supportability metrics and the total cost to the consumer that we’re far below the average benchmark, but the cost of putting a hole in the cost of transform just don’t get down to that level of detail or have that in the utilities. So we have to depend on our own challenges and depend on some that we can benchmark with and continue to drive these other indicators to ensure we’re providing the best service at the cheapest price.
Michael Lapides: Got it. Thank you.
Chris Crane: So I think that’s the end of the call. I’d like to thank you for joining the call today. The team looks forward to seeing many of you at EEI later that month, this month. And with that, I’ll just close everything out. And thank you all.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today’s conference call. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect, and have a pleasant day.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-08-03 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to Exelon's Second Quarter Earnings Call. My name is Dillan, and I'll be your event specialist today. [Operator Instructions] Please note that today's webcast is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to turn today's program over to Jeanne Jones, Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance. The floor is yours.
Jeanne Jones: Thank you, Dillan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Leading the call today are Chris Crane, Exelon's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Joe Nigro, Exelon's Chief Financial Officer. They're joined by other members of Exelon's senior management team who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. We issued our earnings release this morning along with the presentation, all of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of Exelon's website. The earnings release and other matters which we discuss during today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today's material and comments made during this call. Please refer to today's 8-K and Exelon's other SEC filings for discussions of risk factors and other factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts and expectations Today’s presentation also includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for reconciliations between the non-GAAP measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures. We set about 45 minutes for today’s call. I’ll now turn the call over to Chris Crane, Exelon CEO.
Chris Crane: Thanks Jeanne. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Before I get into the quarter, I want to spend a minute talking about the Inflation Reduction Act, a bill that's being considered in Congress. We appreciate those who have been working to position the United States as a leader in cleaner energy future and combating climate change. The bill extends tax benefits for familiar renewable technologies like solar and wind. It creates new ones for clean energy sources like nuclear and hydrogen. It also focuses on energy efficiencies, electrification and very importantly equity. These aspects of the bill will enable us transformation for customers while building a domestic clean energy sector. However, the bill also proposes a corporate minimum tax that could undermine the benefits of those incentives and slowly investment needed to make this transformation. The lower cost of clean energy technology and efficiency, their investments will be offset by higher taxes on companies making investments. With this language currently proposed, we and other utilities could face an increase in cash tax. While the bill has yet to pass in specifics could change as currently drafted, we could see an impact of incremental cash tax of approximately $300 million per year starting in 2023. The higher tax would ultimately limit our ability to invest in infrastructure needed to accommodate the clean energy our customers want in our jurisdictions of pursuing, but the situation remains very fluid. We continue to monitor the bill closely as it moves toward a vote in the Senate and beyond. In the meantime, we're working to advocate for language that better aligns incentives to achieve what we all want a cleaner, resilient, reliable and affordable grid, bridge that we are not getting [growth rate] Cleaner grid. Turning now to the quarter. Our first one since separating on April 1, I'm -- February 1. We continue to execute on our plan, focusing on operational and financial excellence to serve our customers in our communities while supporting their environmental and social equity needs. We earned $0.47 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.44 per share on a non- GAAP basis. We continue to expect our full range -- full year results in line with $2.18 to $2.32 range, we provide an on our Analyst Day. We've updated on previously announced plans to financing a small portion of our $29 million capital investment program with equity and Joe will provide additional details on our financing plan. Along with his commentary on the quarterly results. We're on track to limit the number of rate cases we have this year. In May, Delmarva Power & Light Maryland filed his first multiyear plan covering investments from ‘23 to ‘25 period. The filing highlights improvement in Delmarva’s reliability and customer service in Maryland. ‘21 marked its second straight year of record setting outage frequency performance. We look forward to building on the successes of the multiyear plans we have in place and leverage lessons learned to deliver value for Delmarva Power, Maryland customers. In Illinois, ComEd continues to work on a new rate setting process, including proposed performance metrics. We expect a final order by the end of the third quarter. In addition, on July 1st, ComEd filed its first beneficial electrification plan with the Illinois Commerce Commission, as required by the CEGA, ComEd proposes spending approximately $300 million from ’23 to ‘25. The plan is designated to reduce barriers to beneficial electrification, including barriers to electric vehicles like adoption of costs and charging availability. And the plan approaches and emphasizes equity and environmental justice as we implement. Our plan will ensure ComEd’s investment strategy delivers on the CEGA’s groundbreaking environmental and social equity goals. As a reminder, ComEd’s first distribution rate case under the new rate case structure will be filed in early 2023 for rate effective in 2024. And of course we continue to support our communities and provide transparency to stakeholders on environmental, social and governance practices. We recently published our ninth Annual Corporate Sustainability report, our first as a TOD only utility. It details all the ways in which Exelon is a responsible steward of the energy transition and delivers sustainable value for our jurisdictions. For instance, there's many programs going on, but for instance, it discusses our STEM activities, which in our 30 years this summer hosting approximately 180 young women in urban centers. I have been joining each of the three academies to talk with the participants. And in May, the Exelon Foundation selected nine young women that have graduated from our STEM program academies to receive a scholarship for the college education totaling $1 million. It's quite impactful for those young women, and it was quite impactful to be able to speak to them directly and tell them what they have just achieved. So I kind of broke down when they did it, but it was really powerful. The report also highlights $200 million climate change investment initiatives, a program that supports startups with potential to have wide scale impact on climate change risks. In mid-July, Exelon, an Exelon Foundation selected nine startups to receive funding in the third round of the program. It's a 10 year program, these companies’ business models address climate related products and services like EV charging repaired, carbon accounting platforms and other focus areas. We're very proud of the work that all our employees do every day to support the customers in the communities. And you can find all the details in our sustainability report. Switching to slide 5, let me talk about our operational performance for the quarter. We continued to provide safe reliable service for our customers. From a reliability perspective, we've seen improvement from the first quarter. We now are in top quartile for outage duration across all jurisdictions, and ComEd, PHI scored in top decile. ComEd delivered its best CAIDI performance on record despite severe storms in June, we met the restoration targets early restoring 80% of 125,000 impacted customers in less than a day. And ComEd’s distribution automation investments avoided almost 70,000 additional customer interruptions. Our outage frequency performance remains at top high levels, with ComEd achieving top decile. On a safety front, PHI improved the top quartile. But we did have a slip at PECO into the second quartile. We're doing additional training to address the primary drivers of the underperformance at both PECO and BGE. As always, safety remains our number one priority, BGE, ComEd and PECO continue to earn top quartile customer satisfaction performance through the second quarter. And lastly, we'll maintain -- we maintain the top decile performance in odor response across our three gas utilities. PHI continues its streak of perfect execution responding to all gas odors reported less than one hour for the first half of 2022. And this is very important for us to maintain confidence in the system, our gas distribution system that we can find, fix and repair anything that comes up so it's really good to see. Now let me turn it over to Joe and he can provide the financial update.
Joe Nigro : Thank you Chris and good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover our second quarter results, our quarterly financial updates and highlight several ways in which our utilities and power and economic health and wellbeing the diverse communities in which we serve. I'll begin on slide 6 where we show our quarter-over-quarter adjusted operating earnings waterfall. Exelon continuing operations were at $0.44 a share in Q2 this year versus $0.36 a share in Q2 of last year. As a reminder, the prior year second quarter reflects a $0.09 impact for discontinued operations adjustment for certain corporate overhead costs that were previously allocated to our generation segments that are required by accounting rules to be presented as part of Exelon’s continuing operations. As a reminder, these costs were paid for by generation and are not indicative of our corporate overheads post operation. Additional information including the full year impact of the discontinued operations adjustments on 2021 results can be found in the recast 10-K and which we filed on June 30. Excluding the $0.09 impact quarter-over-quarter of the discontinued operations accounting adjustment for service company allocations, Exelon’s second quarter results were a $1.00 lower than the second quarter of 2021. We did benefit from higher distribution rates associated with completed rate cases, including higher Treasury rates impacting Commonwealth Edison's distribution returns. But this was offset by higher depreciation and amortization, bad debt, timing of other costs utilities, and the impact of rising rates on the debt at the holding company. As Chris mentioned, we continue to reaffirm our 2022 EPS guidance range of $2.18 to $2.32 per share. Our year-to-date operating earnings results of $1.08 per share, are exactly in line with the historical percentage of full year earnings, in which we outlined at Analyst Day. Growth for the balance of the year will occur primarily in Q4, as we continue to realize the benefits of higher distribution and transmission revenue, including the net impact of higher Treasury's on ComEd. It will also include the absence of unfavorable weather and storms from a previous year, and the timing of taxes and O&M spend that impacted us in the first two quarters of this year. Any updates to guidance will be provided on our next call for Q3. Moving on to slide 7, looking at our utility returns on a consolidated basis, we expect to be in our consolidated 9% to 10% target by year end. As of the second quarter our trailing 12- month ROE of 8.8% was slightly below our targeted range. As we discussed on our last call, the timing of equity infusion supporting capital investments across all utilities outpaced the higher earnings, driven primarily by distribution and transmission rates. We remain focused on delivering stronger returns at the utilities, which the semi investment we make on behalf of consumers. Turning to slide 8, it was another quiet quarter on the regulatory front, with one notable rate case development. On May 19. Delmarva Power filed its first multiyear plan with the Maryland PSC, the third of its kind in the state proceeded only by its sister utilities of BGE and PEPCO. The filing outlines the company's plans to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in the local energy grid and other customer experience improvement during the three year period from 2023 to 2025. As we've noted before, the multiyear plans approach allows us to align with all stakeholders where the company is focusing its investments. Among the hundreds of projects, the plan specifically includes investments in the electric distribution system to continue to improve reliability and customer service, advanced technologies to modernize the distribution system and provide tools to assist customers in managing their usage. We expect an order by the end of the year. We also have three vacations that are still in progress. Delmarva, Delaware has a gas case with rates going into effect on August 14, subject to refund and an expected decision in the first quarter of ‘23. Additionally, we expected decision on the PECO gas case in the fourth quarter this year, and our ComEd’s final formula rate filings in December. Each case is proceeding in line with our expectations. Overall, we are pleased with the progress in advancing progressive regulatory designs that benefit our customers ease regulatory burden and improve visibility for our utilities. As a reminder, we expect nearly 100% of our rate base growth will be covered by alternative mechanisms by the end of our planning periods. And more details on the rate cases can be found on slide 18 to 21, in the appendix of our earnings presentation. On slide 9, I want to spend moment discussing the work that our utilities do to partner with local state and federal agencies, as well as community groups to ensure we are maximizing opportunities for our customers to benefit from the various build assistance programs available to them. With the challenges presented in the last couple years by the pandemic, and recent inflationary pressures on customers, there have been increases in the funding available to support our most vulnerable customers. For instance, the LIHEAP program it run since 2017 by $400 million to $3.8 billion in total. However, the percentage of households taking advantage of this assistance has remained flat nationwide, implying additional opportunity to support our customers that has gone untapped. Our utilities with their capabilities around billing and customer service, have stepped up to this challenge, looking for innovative ways to support the governmental agencies and ensure more eligible customers are taking advantage of the programs available. And I'd like to touch on just a couple of examples. ComEd introduced the Community Energy Assistance Ambassador program, whereby it offered employment to over 100 local residents to serve as trusted partners to educate customers about financial assistance, as well as energy efficiency. With support from these ambassadors, ComEd was able to expand its reach into hard to engage communities, distribute more than 11,000 Energy Efficiency kits and connect customers to a record $146 million in financial assistance, representing a 95% increase in the number of grants customers received relative to 2020. Of the PHI utilities, ACE Delmarva and PEPCO also took advantage of local outreach strategies, leveraging a data driven approach to ensure they were targeting the highest opportunity areas. Furthermore, they also partnered closely with the relevant governmental agencies to identify and reduce logistical pain points, around applications, eligibility verification and disbursement. These efforts resulted in customers securing $125 million of energy bill assistance, an increase of 70% from 2012. I can say similar approaches were also employed at our PECO, BGE operating companies, and Exelon efforts across all utilities resulted in over $450 million of funding, making its way to more than 650,000 customers, which lowers arrearages and bus bills for all consumers. This level of funding represents a 22% increase in the assistance we were able to connect to our customers relative to the prior year. In fact, these efforts were recognized by EI who selected Exelon as an Edison Awards finalist in 2022, specifically for the innovative ways we helped our customers obtain this assistance. Connecting customers to financial support is just one of the ways in which Exelon is ensuring its customers are making the transition to a cleaner and more resilient grid in an affordable and equitable manner. If I move on to slide 10, during the second quarter, we continue to invest capital for the benefit of our customers and are on track to meet our $6.9 million commitment in ’22. These investments will improve reliability, and resiliency, enhance service for our customers and personally prepare the grid for a clean energy future. Today, I would like to talk about the impressive effort led by BGE to replace a half century old underground underwater circuit nearing the end of its useful life in the heart of Baltimore Harbor. BGE’s Key Crossing Reliability initiative installed a double circuit 230 KV overhead electric transmission lines across the two mile wide Patapsco River. Proactive outreach and early engagement of stakeholders significantly reduced permitting durations and allowed BGE to incorporate feedback into the project's design. That benefit benefiting both BGE and its customers. To reduce durations allowed overhead construction to begin in May of 2020 and complete 15 months early. The transmission monopoles were installed, including two of the tallest towers on the continent, which contemplated adequate clearance for cargo and cruise ships entering the Port of Baltimore today and into the future. Rate reliability improvements stemming from the key crossings initiatives were made possible by the estimated 300 to 350 talented women and men who contributed to this project and all the constituents engaged in this -- 0:24:28.9 .each fader have BGE opted to replace the segment with overhead transmission lines, because the environmental impact was minimal, and it was cost effective and better supported the Port of Baltimore shipping operations, while having the greatest potential for local and domestic job creation. This project perfectly embodies our mission of providing clean, reliable, affordable and innovative solutions to all our key stakeholders. Lastly, I want to provide an update on our balance sheet, which we committed to keeping strong to support the investments made for the benefit of our customers and communities. As we announced in February of 2021, and reaffirmed as recently as last quarter’s call, we plan to issue $1 billion of equity in the holding company by 2025 as part of a balanced funding strategy. We are establishing a $1 billion ATM program. And we plan to issue $500 million of equity in 2022 leveraging either the ATM program or at one time offering or some combination of both methods. We will complete the remaining $500 million in 2023 to 2025. And we commit to continuing to update you as we make progress on these points. Beyond our equities complaints, as we noted in the first quarter, we have completed our long-term debt financings at corporate for the year, there is no change to our expectation and our consolidated corporate metrics will average 13% to 14%. At both S&P and Moody's over the 2022 to ‘24 period. And with a number of financings completed this quarter at our utilities, we continue to benefit from robust demand for that debt backed by extremely strong credit ratings that are operating. As you've heard from Chris, we are monitoring the Inflation Reduction Act, and its potential impact on cash [Inaudible] and tax. We will continue to update you on that as we can. Thank you, and I'll turn back the call to Chris for his closing remarks.
Chris Crane: Thanks Joe. And turning to slide 12, I’ll close by reiterating that Exelon’s value propositions, its position in the sector, Exelon is a premier TOD only company in the nation consistent of delivery and reliability results. There are several key attributes that distinguish us. We have an unmatched size and scale leveraging a common platform across all our utilities, we consistently and reliably offer best-in-class operation performance. This drives a superior customer experience and facilitates a positive regulatory engagement in our jurisdictions. Our purpose of powering a clean, brighter future for our customers and communities is how important ESG principles are to our company. And we maintain a strong balance sheet that drives investment needed to sustain our success. The net results in our operating, our opportunity to invest the $29 billion of capital over the next four years for our customers, with an annualized 6% to 8% operating earnings growth through 2025. And we expect to pay out 60% of those operating earnings each year to our stakeholders and shareholders. Thank you for your time. Now we'll turn it over to Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Shahriar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners.
Shahriar Pourreza: Hey, good morning, guys. Chris, just on the Inflation Reduction Act, just given your comments, any thoughts on prospects for ultimate passage? I think [senators] stance is still unclear and we may get a vote this week. And Joe if the 15% AMT passes as it stands, would you be sort of able to update to past as it stands? Would you be sort of able to update the financing plan by the EI timeframe and just remind us the multiyear plans? Would they adjust for the tax changes on the fly or would you require separate proceed in most jurisdictions? Thanks.
Chris Crane: Yes, I'll take the first half and let Joe take the second half. We have been working with our Head of Federal Regulatory Affairs, Melissa Levinson, who's in a room here. I’ll ask her if she wants to add anything after I speak. We have done significant amount of outreach, not only as a company, but as an industry to make sure that the message is heard that there is a technical fix that there's a potential or other methods. But I don't think we all know enough. Now, it's very fluid. As you talk to the senators, they're getting up to speed as we're getting up to speed. So it came quick, it came out of the closet. And we have to continue to dive in with the EI and as company to communicate the unintended consequences of where we're at. Melissa, anything else?
A – Unidentified Company Representative : I think it remains very fluid, we know that senators are working to review the bill, and understand the impacts. And expectations are that they're going to try to vote on the bill, but the end things remain fluid.
Chris Crane: Did I misspeak on the technical fix?
A – Unidentified Company Representative : I think as we look at the bill, we continue to talk with the senators about potentially unintended consequences of how the tax might be applied, and its impact on our ability to continue the robust investments that we're making. And so we are talking with them about some of the tax policy that has existed over time that enabled us to cost effectively and affordably invest in and talk about ways to look at the way that the minimum tax is currently structured and see what changes can be made.
Chris Crane: Thanks Melissa. Joe?
Joe Nigro : Yes. And I'll pick up the second two questions, Shahriar. Good morning. The 15% passage as you mentioned, we wouldn't expect to update our financing plans by EI, our normal cadence is that we would do that on the Q4 call after the first of the year. The reason we do that is it gives us time to get through our year end budgeting process. And mark things to that point, whether it's treasuries, pension, et cetera, et cetera. And we would be very transparent at that point. As for your last question, go ahead.
Shahriar Pourreza: No, sorry, Joe, you go, please.
Joe Nigro : Shahriar, as for your last question because of multiyear plans are just for tax changes, I think what we would say it's unclear at this point how these taxes will flow through to our customers, as this, obviously as Melissa and Chris just have talked about this situation is very fluid. As it's currently written, we've reached the threshold for the tax at the consolidated level. And so we're working through all this real time.
Shahriar Pourreza: Got it. And then just lastly, Joe, a little bit of confusion, I guess, this morning around the language around the equity plans for ‘22. I guess what a sort of the puts and takes of doing it via the ATM versus just a pure block, I guess. What are you trying to walk through? Why not just do an ATM? Thanks.
Joe Nigro : Yes, I think there's a couple of answers to that, Shahriar. I think the first thing is if we were having this conversation, the first of the year, we might have even had a different view with that but that’s market conditions change, we have to change with it. I, the way interest rates move, for example. So what we've tried to do is be transparent that we're putting a $1 billion ATM in place between now and ‘25, which is what we told you the equity needs were, we're going to do $500 million of it this year. But I think it's important for us to maintain flexibility. And that's why we're saying that we would do it in probably the one or two ways that I mentioned.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Paul Zimbardo from Bank of America.
Paul Zimbardo: Hi, thank you. Good morning. Just following up on the IRA and minimum tax. So is the right way to think about it that you could probably absorb that reduction in cash flows just looking at that 12% trigger versus your guidance range or could we think about that as potentially increasing equity and adds.
Joe Nigro : Yes, we, as I said this is obviously a very fluid situation and we're not ready to commit to either of those. It's all gets tied up. And if this were to pass in its current form this would all get tied up in our end year planning process. What I can say, though is, on the Analyst Day, we committed to use 16% earnings CAGR through 2025. And we're still committed to that.
Paul Zimbardo: Okay, great. Thank you. And then you mentioned the performance base rates, we've been watching in ComEd. Do you embed any kind of benefit and not just in Illinois, but across the footprint from potential positive incentives under the performance base rates at that CAGR midpoint you mentioned?
Joe Nigro : Yes, no, in our plan, we don't embed any incremental benefits from performance.
Chris Crane: But strategically tailwind, we are heading -- we're trying to head in that direction.
Calvin Butler: We are. So as you mentioned, we've been working with stakeholders and filed our performance based metrics outline and goal, which would add if ComEd is able, we were confident to sit back and afford reliable and electricity to the customers, as well as helped the state achieve its goals. The reliability metrics, as outlined could add 60 basis points.
Chris Crane: And we also provided an alternative to the commission if they wanted to consider adding up to 40 basis points, but all based on ComEd rising to the standards that have been outlined in collaboration with the stakeholders.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fleishman from Wolfe Research.
Steven Fleishman: Yes, thanks. Good morning. Hey, Chris, could you just give, I’ll calculator this later, but just if you have handy $300 million of cash flow potentially impacted by the IRA? What is that in terms of FFO to debt percentage?
Chris Crane: Yes, Joe, you want to --
Joe Nigro : Yes, Steve, whatever it is, I don't think we're ready to get into that. Because what the way we look at this is not in isolation. We have to go through year end planning process and see what if, what portion of this we can offset with other actions that we can take across the enterprise. And then net of that what falls to the impact of on our metrics. And obviously, this is so fluid, we haven't gone through that detail process.
Chris Crane: There's cost cutting, there's adjustment and project schedules, there's multiple ways to avoid any impact on our metrics. And that's what we'll be focused on when we figure out where this thing is going. What we've heard is, by the end of the week, potentially over the weekend, things could happen. And once we get the final, we'll be able to evaluate, and we can put the numbers in and start to see what we can do for mitigation. But we want to keep our capital spending plan where it's, our growth where it's at for reliability, and affordability, while we're maintaining a system that will take on the renewable. So there's a few balls in the air that we'll have to juggle, but we would rather have the fix to the bill. So we're not having to juggle this, but we'll see how we prevail as an industry as we go forward.
Steven Fleishman: Okay, and then second question is just in terms of, Joe, your thought process on the equity issuance timing, and doing half of it in kind of the first year, as opposed to just spread out? Could you maybe just give some flavor? Why kind of you decided that?
Joe Nigro : Yes, I think, Steve, a couple of reasons. This is the first window we have open post separation. We had to file the updated 10-K at the end of June, which we did, and then we went into blackout. So, as we previously disclosed, we executed some short-term debt, at the time of separation that we're now planning to use the equity to pay down and that's all part of the balanced funding strategies, to continue to support the balance sheet. We went through an evaluation of the type of equity issue and as I said earlier, it’s still very fluid due to changing market conditions and we want to maintain as much flexibility as we can and that's why we're saying we're putting an ATM in place. But we do have the flexibility to do this one time only.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Arcaro from Morgan Stanley.
David Arcaro: Hi, thanks so much for taking my question. Could you maybe just speak to as you look out over the EPS growth forecast period, your current thoughts on maintaining that linearity of annual kind of cadence and achieving the growth each year through the forecast?
Joe Nigro : Yes. Thanks David for the question. And good morning, we talked about this, we're confident in that 16% growth rate that we've given you through 2025 as relates to earnings. We've said there is some variability between the years and this really driven by three factors, right. One is, ComEd’s, the distribution return through 2023 is still tied to treasuries, which obviously, we don't control that mark-to-market exercise. And that's priced on a daily average throughout the year. So it's continuing to obviously change. PECO is on a three year rate case cadence. And the way that cadence works is they're higher earnings in the early years than they are later years. And that has some variability. And then lastly, we're transitioning to different ratemaking in Illinois, 2024 and beyond. And we have to make an assumption, what that looks like. And we've done that, and we're comfortable with ranges around that, and that 16% growth rate, but that drives some variability as well.
David Arcaro: Okay, got it. Thanks. That's helpful. And on the just the, are we, so ticked down slightly in this quarter, could you just refresh us on the confidence level of net rising in the back half of this year? And then any latest thoughts as to when you might be able to achieve something in the middle, like 9.5% ROE level as you look out in the forecast?
Joe Nigro : Yes, I think the reason you see the lower ROEs early in the year, and you saw the same trend last year is, it's tied to the equity, we're infusing into utilities, we do, a majority share of our debt offerings early in the year across the enterprise. And as such, to keep those capital structures in line, we infuse the equity, which over the course of the year takes time for ROEs to catch up. And that's really the big driver. So we're confident, we target 9% to 10%, for all of our utilities, we're confident at year end will be in that range, on average across the utilities.
Chris Crane: The key on this is the rate cases, as Joe said, and we've seen downward pressure in other jurisdictions on that 9.5% to 10%. So we have to work through that and explain with the higher interest rate environment. We need to be able to move that back up as we're working through our rate cases. So it's reversing the trend of what we've seen in the industry to accommodate the interest rate rise and it's very quick to come down when interest rates come down. It's a crawl back when interest rates go back up. But that's what we're focusing on.
Calvin Butler: Chris, if I can add, this is Calvin, David, I would also point out, Joe alluded to ComEd earnings being tied to the Treasury. But understand ComEd is also one of the lowest in earnings of any utility that impacts that 9% to 10%, average. So as ComEd begins to transition out of the formula rate, you will see that have a greater impact on the collective of utilities. And it's also important to note, when we talk about the multiyear plans, those three year plans that we've been put in place in Maryland, as well as in the District of Columbia. That's a process that is done in collaboration with the stakeholders and commission. So when we talk about investments across the utilities, that transparency is giving stability to those ROEs and also the growth projection that Joe talks about that 6% to 8% a year. That's how we feel confident that we can come in here and tell you what that growth plan looks like because it is done in collaboration with our commissioners and all of our stakeholders.
Operator: Our last question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra from Evercore.
Durgesh Chopra: Hey, guys, thank you. I'll keep it quick. Joe, I just want to go back to the $300 million per year cash impact from the alternative minimum tax, just given that your cash effective tax rate is going up each year. So I'm looking at this slide, which shows 2022, this is slide 16, in the appendix, I believe, which shows the effective gas tax rate going from like less than a 0.5% to 4% in 2023. As I'm thinking about ’24. ‘25, shouldn't that $300 million cash tax impact be actually lower given that you're going to pay some cash taxes, just by the effective tax rate going up naturally in the plan?
Joe Nigro : I think there's a lot of variables that go into that equation, or maybe we, given the size of our enterprise, and the number of operating companies we have, obviously, there's a lot of things that move around in a given year with taxes. I mean, we see that each and every year, and then quite frankly, each and every quarter. So this is very fluid, the situation we're dealing with as blow smoking. Chris alluded to here, there's still -- we still go to get to the goal line on this and see where it plays itself out. I'm not going to sit here and commit you to say it's going to do this or do that. We're giving you an indicative view what we think that impact looks like over, our planning horizon that we've disclosed.
Operator: Thank you. That concludes our Q&A session. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Chris Crane, President and CEO for closing remarks.
Chris Crane: Yes, thank you all for joining the call today. We look forward to continue to execute on a plan. And with that I'll close up the call and thank you for your continued support.
Operator: Thanks to all our participants for joining us today. This concludes our presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-05-09 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to Exelon's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. My name is Olivia, and I'll be your event specialist today. [Operator Instructions] Please note that today's webcast is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn today's program over to Jeanne Jones, Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance. The floor is yours.
Jeanne Jones : Thank you, Olivia. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Leading the call today are Chris Crane, Exelon's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Joe Nigro, Exelon's Chief Financial Officer. They're joined by other members of Exelon's senior management team who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. We issued our earnings release this morning along with the presentation, all of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of Exelon's website. The earnings release and other matters which we discuss during today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today's material and comments made during this call. Please refer to today's 8-K and Exelon's other SEC filings for discussions of risk factors and other factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts and expectations. Today's presentation also includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for reconciliations between the non-GAAP measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures. We've scheduled 45 minutes for today's call. I'll now turn the call over to Chris Crane, Exelon's CEO.
Chris Crane : Thanks, Jeanne, and good morning to everybody and thanks for joining us. We're pleased to host our first post-separation earnings call as the nation's premier T&D utility company. We closed, as you all know, on the separation on February 1, delivering on our commitment to close within the first quarter of 2022. The transition has really unlocked significant value for our shareholders. In the time of announcing a year ago through mid-April this year, the total shareholder return was 76%, far exceeding the UTY Index and the S&P. At the same time, we continue to demonstrate our reliability focused on operational and financial excellence. We earned $0.49 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.64 a share on a non-GAAP basis -- non-GAAP basis. We also completed a successful bond deal for our holding company with attractive pricing, showing the value of our strong balance sheet even in a challenging market. Joe will cover the financial highlights in his presentation shortly. On the regulatory front, it is a quiet year, but we made progress in several jurisdictions to support our investment plans on behalf of our customers. This includes a settlement in Delmarva, Maryland in the electric case, the gas filing for Delmarva Delaware and PECO and our last distribution filing under the ComEd distribution formula rate. In addition, ComEd continues to work with the stakeholders on the CEJA, last year's landmark clean energy legislation that continues to support what our customers and our stakeholders want. It's a clear path to Illinois electric utilities to transition into a rate setting process while we're ensuring the stake and support its ambitious climate goals and its social equity goals. We feel comfortable in our process going forward. ComEd has proposed performance metrics plan before the ICC which includes 8 performance metrics and 13 tracking metrics. As we adjust our proposal for stakeholder feedback, we're optimistic that the metrics approved by the commission will support continued improve in our -- improvement in our top-tier service for customers. We expect the final order by the end of the third quarter.  There's a lot of work to be done between here and there. ComEd's also participating in the stakeholder process in a multiyear integrated grid plan workshop. The plan will help ComEd's long-term investment planning process and priorities with the exception of the regulatories -- regulators in CEG pay. This is in preparation for our filing in early 2023 for rates effective in 2024. Joe will cover that case in a little bit more detail. Beyond the financial performance and operational performance, we continue to focus on our communities and the transition to a cleaner grid. We joined the DOE's better climate challenge in February, reinforcing our Path to Clean commitment to reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gases by 50% by 2023 -- 2030. As part of the HBCU corporate scholars program announced last fall, we have 24 students who were awarded $2.4 million in scholarships. This program will support the next generation to lead our clean energy future. It's astounding to sit with these young students and see their passion on where they want to go in the future. We are funding support for small business development in underserved communities in our service territory for more than 65 workforce-type programs where we train and make individuals capable of coming into our areas ready for work. And our fifth annual STEM Academy will be held this summer in Philadelphia, Chicago, D.C, Baltimore area with approximately the goal now is 60 women -- young women to be involved. Moving to our operations on Slide 5. We're delivering safe, reliable service across the jurisdictions. Performance has remained solid and outage durations and frequency remain our top priority. Our utilities are working together to improve in specific areas. As you saw this weekend, on the Mid-Atlantic utilities, the storms continue to intensify and the duration continues to be lengthened, but our operations teams are really focused on that in continuing to drive standards of construction reliability up. ComEd's reliability performance was top decile in both CAIDI and SAIFI, delivering on the highest first quarter reliability to customers for end-of-year earn record. We made improvements in OSHA performance, bringing PECO up to top quartile, but we really are not satisfied with anything but the safest experience for our employees and our communities, and we still have work to go on that. There is no shunning that away. It's a top priority of all our operations towards. BGE and ComEd and PECO all achieved top quartile and customer satisfaction through the quarter. In all 3 of our utilities that distribute gas, we're in top decile on order response. PHI had perfect execution, responding to all its gas orders in less than 1 hour. And that's a very large service territory acreage-wise, so being able to roll the trucks and the employees out is a good feat that they've achieved. Joe will highlight some of our investments we're making to help deliver this performance. And with that, I'll turn it over to Joe for you to hear the financial update and some of the strategic actions we're taking.
Joe Nigro : Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover our first quarter results, as Chris mentioned, our quarterly financial updates, and as he noted, highlight several areas in which our utilities are making investments for the benefits of our customers. If I start on Slide 6, we show our quarter-over-quarter adjusted operating earnings walk. Exelon's continuing operations earned $0.64 in Q1 of 2022 versus $0.55 in Q1 of '21. Let me start by reminding you the impacts to Exelon's financials following the separation. As disclosed in our 8-K issued on February 25, beginning with the 10-Q to be filed today for the first quarter of 2022, we are presenting our former Generation segment as discontinued operations for the 1-month period in 2022 prior to the separation and for the 3 months ended March 31, 2021. Financial results for the utilities in the holding company are reported as continuing operations. As a reminder, accounting rules require that certain corporate overhead costs previously allocated to generation be presented as part of the Exelon's continuing operations.  I want to note that these costs were paid for by generation and they are not indicative of our corporate overhead post separation. The impact of this business services company allocation adjustment to Exelon's continuing operations is $0.09 for the first quarter of '21 and $0.02 for the one month in 2022 on an after-tax basis. You will continue to see this adjustment for '21 as we present prior year quarters. However, this adjustment only impacts Q1 for 2022. Excluding the $0.07 quarter-over-quarter impact of the discontinued operations accounting adjustment for BFC allocations, Exelon's first quarter results were $0.02 higher than the first quarter of '21. The improvement from '21 was primarily driven by higher transmission and distribution rates associated with completed rate cases, partially offset by depreciation and amortization and stores at the utilities and the impact of rising interest rates on debt at the holding company. Our operating earnings results of $0.64 for the first quarter were in line with the percentage of full year earnings we shared with you in the January 2022 Analyst Day presentation. Turning to our full year outlook. We reaffirm our 2022 earnings guidance range of $2.18 to $2.32 per share. While we have benefited from rising treasury rates on ComEd's distribution return on equity, like most companies, we were also impacted by higher interest expense in our debt, in particular at our holding company. As we normally do, we will update guidance on our Q3 call. As a reminder, we have committed to a long-term operating earnings growth target of 6% to 8% through 2025, off the midpoint of guidance for '21 communicated on the Analyst Day. Moving to Slide 7. Looking at our utility returns on a consolidated basis, we expect to be in our consolidated 9% to 10% target range by year-end. As of the first quarter, our trailing 12-month return on equity of 8.9% dipped slightly below our range. Despite higher earnings driven primarily by distribution and transmission rates, the earnings were outpaced by timing of equity infusions across all our utilities to support capital investments. We remain focused on delivering stronger returns at the utilities which sustain the investment we make on behalf of our customers. Turning to Slide 8. There were some important developments on the regulatory front since the beginning of the year. First, on January 14, Delmarva Power filed an application with the Delaware Public Service Commission seeking a $14.5 million increase in gas distribution base rates, reflecting an ROE of 10.3%. Delmarva Power customers continue to benefit from the major enhancements that are being made to the local natural gas system. Key projects to strengthen and create additional capacity in the company's natural gas delivery system have also been critical to meet growing load. As permitted by Delaware law, Delmarva Power will implement full allowable rates on August 14, subject to refund. Second, Delmarva Maryland received a final order for its distribution electric rate case on March 2. The Maryland Commission approved the proposed settlement order by the Chief Public Utility Law Judge that recommended a $12.5 million increase in annual electric distribution rates, reflecting an ROE of 9.6%. Third, on March 31, PECO filed a gas distribution rate case with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission. PECO is seeking a revenue increase of $82 million to support significant investments in critical infrastructure which will modernize and enhance the natural gas system and allow us to continue delivering safe and reliable natural gas service and reduce methane emissions. In addition, the filing proposes enhanced energy efficiency and customer safety programs, increase customer assistance with additional low-income funding and the continuation of small business grant program. We expect an order in the fourth quarter of 2022. Finally, ComEd filed its annual distribution formula rate update with the Illinois Commerce Commission on April 15, seeking a $199 million increase to electric distribution base rates that resulted in a $2.20 increase in the average monthly residential bill starting January 2023. While ComEd is requesting a delivery charge increase, there will be offsets. Specifically, when taking into account higher energy prices based on the recent procurement auction and forwards, offset by lower capacity prices, the carbon mitigation credits and accelerated tax benefit, we currently estimate a net reduction to the average monthly residential bill. ComEd's residential customer rates next January are expected to be at least 10% below the average of rates in the 10 largest U.S. metropolitan areas. In its formula -- in its final formulary filing, ComEd's request supports investments needed to sustain the record level reliability performance for residential and commercial customers and helps advance the goals of the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act passed in Illinois to address climate change, create clean energy jobs, ensure equity and prioritize a just transition to a green economy. We expect to receive an order by early December. We continue to have constructive regulatory relationships across our jurisdictions and are working with our regulators, our states and our communities to support their clean energy and climate goals. As a reminder, we expect nearly 100% of our rate base growth will be covered by alternative recovery mechanisms by the end of our planning period. More details on these rate cases can be found on Slides 17 through 20 of the appendix. Slide 9 provides an update on how Exelon's utilities are working with key stakeholders to help our customers and jurisdictions achieve their decarbonization goals reliably, affordably and equitably. Electric vehicle adoption is unquestionably a key enabler for reducing emissions as the transportation sector currently represents about 1/3 of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Our jurisdictions alone are targeting 4.2 million electric vehicles on the road over the next 25 years, a twentyfold increase relative to the number of EVs in our service territories as of the end of 2021. Given our competitive rates, Electric vehicles also provide our customers the ability to save money. Using the Department of Energy's e-Gallon calculation, the annual cost of an electric vehicle is approximately $1.30 per gallon compared to the price of gasoline at $4.30 per gallon. On average, customers in Exelon service territories could save more than $1,000 per year in fuel cost by switching to an EV. Utilizing Exelon's EV time of use rates could offer an additional 11% savings per year. And while we recognize there are adoption costs and other barriers to entry, we value the role we play in bridging social equity gaps. Working with our jurisdictions, we bridge those gaps through programs like those authorized in the Climate Solutions Now Act in Maryland, which allows utilities to partner with local school boards and offer up to $50 million in rebates to incentivize the purchase and operation of electric school buses. And the benefits are not inclusive to EV buyers. As more energy use applications leverage the grid, fixed costs will naturally be lower for customers who have not yet made the switch to electric vehicles. As our states make this transition over the coming decades, Exelon is poised to support our customers through investments such as upgraded distribution circuitry, substations and ultimately transmission. Transforming the grid over this period to meet the increased standards required by EVs, along with other expanded and innovative uses of the grid, will require significant investment. Our Path to Clean encourages customers and communities to reduce their emissions through access to clean energy solutions. When establishing our goals, the focus was not solely on the environment, but also on equity, affordability, reliability and sustaining our communities. The role we are playing in the transformation of the transportation sector is a great example of this commitment. Moving to Slide 10. During the first quarter, we continued to invest capital for the benefit of our customers and are on track to meet our $6.9 billion commitment for 2022. These investments will improve reliability and resiliency, enhance service for our customers and prepare the grid for a clean energy future. As we have done on past earnings calls, I'd like to feature 2 projects within our portfolio of utility investments. The first is Pepco's Harvard substation rebuild. This substation is part of a larger capital grid project and is currently under construction with expected completion in 2023. This $220 million project will renovate aging infrastructure originally installed over a century ago to improve grid reliability and resiliency. The rebuild also expands regional transmission capacity, supporting future load growth in Washington, D.C. The second project is ComEd's $39 million Project Goldframe. ComEd completed it last fall, 3 months ahead of schedule, to meet the customers' accelerated project timeline. To service new load obligations at the data center and the surrounding area, ComEd installed a new 138 kV substation and associated equipment, including an indoor control building, 15 138-kV circuit breakers, 4 capacitor banks and transmission line extensions to the DeKalb area in Illinois. This was the first large-scale project resulting from the passage of Illinois Data Center Tax Incentive Program in 2019. It also likely creates additional renewable energy projects in the state as 100% of customer usage will be offset by wind and solar contracts. Both contracts or both projects are great examples of how we are connecting our customers and communities to affordable, clean and resilient solutions while enabling economic growth and local job creation through these modernization investments. These projects in their own right have significant economic and social benefits to our customers and communities served. However, combined, they represent less than 1% of Exelon's projected capital spend from 2022 to '25. This puts in perspective the scale and the impact of our investments. Moving on to Slide 11. As you've heard us say at Analyst Day, our consolidated corporate credit metrics are anticipated to average 13% to 14% at S&P and Moody's over the 2022 to '24 time period. And overall, maintaining a strong balance sheet to firmly supporting investment-grade credit ratings remains core to our strategy and who we are. From a financing perspective, we successfully completed a $2 billion corporate debt offering in the first quarter, which completes our long-term debt financing needs at corporate for the year. This inaugural offering as a new company garnered significant interest from investors, enabling a very strong execution that was a true testament to the strength of our balance sheet and our new platform. And finally, there has been no change to -- in our guidance to issue $1 billion of equity at the holding company by 2025. Thank you, and I'll now turn the call back to Chris for his closing remarks.
Chris Crane : Thanks, Joe. Turning to Slide 12. I'll close by reminding you all of Exelon's value proposition as the premier team, the only company in the nation. We're offering a great deal of value and scale, size and scale, which is particularly beneficial given the challenges posed in today's microeconomic environment and the storm intensity, as I mentioned earlier, over the weekend. We continue to be able to move resources and continuing to be able to procure required needs in the right environment. Our best-in-class operations that have led us to a world-class customer experience and constructive regulatory environments, which is key if your customers are not satisfied, the regulators aren't satisfied and that's a major focus of us. Our commitment to ESG principles by driving to a cleaner energy economy and advancing social equity, as Joe mentioned, and a strong balance sheet that will ensure our ability to invest on behalf of our -- all of our stakeholders, not only the customers, but those that want to see a stronger cleaner environment, all of these factors support our opportunity to invest $29 billion of capital over the next 4 years in response to our customer needs which will lead to an annualized 6% to 8% operating earnings growth through 2025. We've targeted a payout of 60% of those operating earnings each year back to the shareholders. Thank you very much for joining us, and now we'll open it up for questions that you may have.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question coming from the line of Paul Zimbardo from Bank of America.
Paul Zimbardo: Going to kick it off, if you could give a little bit more quantification of the net impact between the higher interest rate environment on the formula ROE in Illinois offset by the corporate cost. And it seems like a net positive mixing those 2 together. So just want to check if there's any other factors to be cognizant of as well.
Chris Crane: Joe, you want to take that?
Joe Nigro: Yes, I will, Chris. Paul, thanks for the question. When you look at the sensitivities we've shown you in the table, a 50 basis point move in treasury rates is worth about $0.04 to ComEd which is what we saw at the end of the first quarter. And that was -- about $0.01 of that was realized the way the formula prices is over the course of the year. So we've subsequently seen those rates move higher here in the second quarter. On the flip side to that is when you look at our corporate debt, we show you a sensitivity to a 50 basis point move, it's about a $0.01 impact. And so that move, about roughly 100 basis points or so in the third year -- year-to-date is down about $0.02 and those are the 2 big drivers of each of those variables.
Paul Zimbardo: Okay. Great. That's helpful. Does seem positive. And then the other, I know you said no changes to the equity issuance expectations. Just if you could discuss the approach to the timing and methodology, maybe a block or ATM, just given the appreciation of just Exelon but the utility sector broadly.
Joe Nigro: Yes. I think as we've said, we're expecting to issue up to $1 billion of equity by 2025. We haven't said necessarily when we're going to issue that. And the timing will be dependent on market conditions as well as the need for the cash itself, obviously. I mean there's a lot of things changing in the macro environment when you look at interest rates and, obviously, what the equity market is doing. And we'll work with our banking partners to make a determination at the time we need the equity or the cash as to what type of product we'll use. But at this point, we haven't made that final determination.
Chris Crane: Yes. And I think the key, Joe, on that is watching the solid balance sheet metrics and ensuring that we continue to focus on that.
Joe Nigro: Yes, that's right, Chris. I mean you and I both said in our scripts, right, we're investing $29 billion here over the next 4 years. And what we said at Analyst Day is $14 billion of that will become off of internal generated cash flows with the utilities, $14 billion at debt we raise across the enterprise and then about the need for the $1 billion, we just haven't made a determination as to when we need it.
Operator: Our next question coming from the line of Steven Fleishman from Wolfe Research.
Steven Fleishman: So just want to clarify the -- some of the adjustments, not looking backward, but maybe looking more forward. The $0.64 in the quarter, I think, includes $0.02 related to that last month of Constellation. So if we look to '23 in the future, would $0.66 essentially be the right base to kind of forecast from other drivers in the future?
Joe Nigro: Yes, Steve. Thanks for the question. You're right the way -- I mean if you talking about the performance of the business in the first quarter and removing the impact of discontinued operations, it was $0.66. When you compare that to Q1 for '21, the equivalent number would be $0.64. You're also right, the impact in Q1, because we have to recast the whole quarter, was $0.09. But because we closed the separation February 1, it's in only a 1-month impact in '22. We would expect that 1 month to effectively drag into the comparisons that you see in '23 next year because of the month of January of this year.
Steven Fleishman: Okay. Great. And then just the ROE improvement that you're expecting over the course of the year. Is that just kind of the normal rate relief flowing through and things like that? There's no other kind of key new drivers required to get the returns up?
Chris Crane: It's a little lumpy. But as the rate cases go through, we expect the improvement to go within our range of 9% to 10%, and we just have to execute on the plan. So 8.9 right now should come up, Joe, within a few quarters, and we'll be within our range of desire.
Joe Nigro: That's correct, Chris. We'll be in that 9% to 10% range by year-end, Steve. We infused equity into the utilities in the first quarter. The earnings were up, but they weren't up enough to offset that equity infusion and it just takes some time to reverse that effectively.
Operator: Our next question coming from the line of Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan.
Jeremy Tonet: Just want to go over to Illinois here real quick. I wonder if you could update us a bit on how the Illinois rate making process is progressing in the transition to its new multiyear framework. Any color you could share there would be helpful.
Chris Crane: Joe, are you going to cover that?
Joe Nigro: Please repeat the question for me. I'm sorry, I didn't hear it.
Jeremy Tonet: Just as far as Illinois ratemaking process progressing in the transition to its new multiyear framework, any color you could share there on the progress.
Calvin Butler: Jeremy. Chris, this is Calvin. I'll take that one. ComEd -- as Chris outlined, ComEd filed its last rate case under the formula rate this year. And they are preparing a meeting with stakeholders, including the Illinois Commerce Commission, for their first filing of whether it's a traditional future test year or whether they go into a 4-year multiplan -- year plan as outlined by the new energy law. The meetings with the stakeholders is critical in that as ComEd lays out its options. And as Chris outlined, they will be making that filing the first part, January - -first quarter of 2023, with an expected ruling from the commission by the end of the year. So that, to your direct question, the transition is going smoothly. All the meetings are being done and met and the team is lining up on what is the appropriate course moving forward.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. That's very helpful. And just with the new look Exelon here, just wondering how do corporate cost efforts currently stand since the separation? Are they tracking your expectations at this point? And do you have any sense for upside opportunities and potential magnitude of cost savings over time now post separation here?
Chris Crane: Yes. I wouldn't commit to upside yet. We've got to get through this transition. There's a lot of work being done by the business services company to execute on plan, the wrong plan right now and we feel comfortable. We watch the IT transition quite closely. That's one that can't get away from us, separating the financials, separating the operational, separating the common databases is -- it's crucial to making our targets. And right now, we're on track and we hope to improve on it, but I wouldn't commit to any significant improvement at this point. We have to continue to work through the process of the separation. It's astounding how much work has got to be done and it is on track, but there's a lot of people focused on it. If you look at the financials itself, separating that, looking at the operational integration, separating that, it's quite extensive. So we have the right leadership with Bridget Reidy and we continue to focus on it. Some areas might be a little bit faster than we anticipated based on the push from Constellation and Exelon, but too early to predict an upside.
Operator: Our last question coming from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore.
Durgesh Chopra: I have a quick clarification and then a big picture question on EVs. Just, Chris, I think you mentioned, if I heard it correctly, an order in the third quarter on the Illinois, I believe the multiyear rate framework, and I believe it -- that relates to the discussions on metrics, operational metrics that are sort of adders to the ROE. Did I hear that correctly?
Chris Crane: I wouldn't say it's the third quarter, Calvin. It's at the end of 2023 that would be finalized, but we did put in our input for the metrics, the operational metrics to ensure the customer satisfaction. But your time line, Calvin.
Joe Nigro: Chris, you're right. We did put something in our metrics and we would expect to get -- get a response back on that in the time line that was mentioned, but not the full rate case itself.
Calvin Butler: Right. So the performance metrics, as we've outlined, as you hit, Chris, the 8 performance metrics that they're looking for and we're currently -- it's outlined by the statute, by the law, and Gil and his team are working to drive what those are and give an agreement and alignment to how we move forward. But yes, we think within that, we know within the filing, [both] will all be locked down and our filing will take place in the first quarter of 2023.
Durgesh Chopra: Got it. But just to be clear, the sort of the stance or the commission order as to what those metrics might look like and what those like both qualitatively and quantitatively, that comes in -- later in 2023?
Joe Nigro: 9/30 this year.
Calvin Butler: Right. By 9/30 this year, we will have outlines, therefore, allowing the team to prepare for the rate case filing in the first quarter of 2023. We will know exactly what they are and how they will impact the business positively and/or negatively if those metrics aren't met.
Durgesh Chopra: Perfect. Guys, I appreciate you clarifying that. So in the third quarter, we'll know what those metrics are and that will dictate your filing in the first quarter of 2023.
Calvin Butler: Correct.
Joe Nigro: Correct.
Durgesh Chopra: Okay. And then just a quick follow-up. On EVs, thank you guys for sharing sort of the illustrative EV charging cost versus gas drilling cost, tremendously helpful. Maybe just very high level, and I appreciate this is a long-dated opportunity, is there a way to kind of think about the CapEx opportunity associated with this increase loads demand? And I appreciate it's over a sort of a 20-, 30-year period.
Chris Crane: Yes, one of our jurisdictions have a different focus and we're trying to work through those. But we do see, and I'll let Calvin speak to it, we do see a potential upside in the demand required to support the EVs. And for us, it's the infrastructure costs that we have to put in, changing voltage levels up from 41 60 to 13 8 to ensure that you've got not only the distributed generation, but you can service the EV demand. And working in the different jurisdictions on how that is framed is important. Calvin, I don't know if you want to add anything there.
Calvin Butler: I'll just -- I'll provide you some specific numbers. When you think -- because Chris is exactly right that each of our jurisdictions has approached this some more aggressive and others are just taking a staggered approach. So let's put it in terms of this. Right now, across our territories, we have approximately 215,000 EVs on the road out of the roughly 17 million vehicle registrants. So here under current statutes, the laws that have been passed, so let me just tell you about the degrees of pace. In Maryland, they have said they want 300,000 EVs on the road by 2025. New Jersey, 330,000 by 2025 and 2 million by 2035. Illinois law requires or says 1 million by 2030. And then in Delaware, 20% of the state registered vehicles by 2025. D.C., 25% by 2030 and 100% by 2045. And Pennsylvania is looking to replace 25% of its vehicles and transitioning to EVs. That just goes to show you the opportunity. And when you look at the infrastructure that is going to be required to meet that and all of our capital plan, we see the opportunity across the Exelon utilities. So to Chris' point, all different but significant opportunity for us to be partners in building out that infrastructure and preparing the grid.
Durgesh Chopra: Got it. for taking time to answer my question. It sounds like a significant infrastructure opportunity for you guys as it is for the utilities and some of the states here moving faster than others in your territory.
Chris Crane: Yes. And for the customers also, it's -- that's our major focus, is continuing to look forward to service the customer needs.  But I thank you for joining the call today. We're looking forward to our continuing, consistent performance we've delivered across our utilities. And with that, Jeanne, unless there's anything else, I'll close the call.
Jeanne Jones : Thanks, Chris.
Chris Crane : Thanks, everybody. Bye.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thanks to all our participants for joining us today. This concludes our presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-11-03 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to Exelon's Third Quarter Earnings Call. My name is Justin and I will be your event specialist today. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. Please note that today's webcast is being recorded. During the presentation, we'll have a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. [Operator Instructions] Finally, should you intend to call systems as a best practice, we suggest you first refresh your browser. If that does not resolve the issue, please click on the help option, in the upper right-hand corner of your screen, for online troubleshooting. It is now my pleasure to turn today's program, over to Emily Duncan, Vice President of Investor Relations. The floor is yours.
Emily Duncan: Thank you, Justin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter 2021, earnings conference call. Leading the call today are Chris Crane, Exelon's President and Chief Executive Officer, and Joe Nigro, Exelon's Chief Financial Officer. They're joined by other members of Exelon's senior management team, who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. We issued our earnings release this morning along with this presentation, all of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of Exelon's website.  The earnings release and other matters which we discussed during today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements, based on factors and assumptions discussed in today's material and comments made during the call. Please refer to today's 8-K and Exelon's other SEC filings for discussions of risk factors and other factors, including uncertainties surrounding the planned separation that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts, and expectations.  Today's presentation also includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for reconciliations between the non-GAAP measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures. I will now turn the call over to Chris Crane, Exelon's CEO.
A - Chris Crane: Thanks, Emily. And good morning, everybody. Emily, thank you for putting a hedge on everything we're about to say. We had a good quarter financially and operationally and head several very positive developments during the quarter. I'm starting on Slide 5, we earned $1.23 per share on a GAAP basis and $1.09 on a non-GAAP basis. And Joe will get into those details. Illinois passed, at the last minute, a landmark clean energy legislation, which makes the state a national leader in clean energy. Illinois will achieve 100% carbon-free by 2045 by preserving and adding tens -- preserving the plants and adding tens of thousands of jobs.  And we thank Kathleen Barone and her team and many others for the work they've done. As a result, we have reversed the retirement decision on Byron and Dresden. Our Illinois plants will continue to provide good paying jobs, economic support to the communities, and 0 carbon energy to the citizens of Illinois. We've begun to fill the 650 vacant positions and we'll be investing more than $300 million in our plants over the next 5 years to catch up on what we've pulled back from -- during the unknown period. The legislation also includes the provision that would transition into this out of the formula rates, into a new multi-year performance-based rate framework.  In August, we completed the PUCT transaction and acquired EDF's portion of the CNG nuclear plants, adding 17 terawatts to our own 0, admitting nuclear generation. We did receive a grant from the U.S. Department of Energy to explore the potential benefits of on-site hydrogen production. And our Nine Mile Point in New York. And we continue to believe that there is a very strong future for Hydrogen. Hydrogen will be key in helping the nation address the climate crisis, and the nuclear plants can pay a vital role in its production with its heat and capabilities. We're partnering with Nel Hydrogen, and the national labs to demonstrate the integrated production storage and use of hydrogen onsite to prove its commercial viability.  Operations are expected to begin in 2022. On the regulatory front, Delaware PSC issued a constructive order in our Delmarva [indiscernible] Last quarter we announced our path to clean and our net 0 goal for the utilities. So we continue to strive to meet what our customers desire and our regulators desire. Each utility is building upon existing work and supporting a path to clean, that aligns to the goals that are needed for their local jurisdictions and stakeholders. An example is PECO's Climate Solution, it's a 5-year action plan that will fill Pepco's --?I'm? said PECO of Pepco's.  That will fill with the DCPSC's request last month. This filing outlines 62 different programs to help enable the district's roadmap toward decarbonization. Another example of helping our communities to meet their goals is through our energy efficiency programs, which are some of the nations largest. Joe will talk about them in his remarks. We're committed to serving our communities in helping to drive equity and positive change. Last week, we launched a $36 million racial equity capital fund to expand access to capital from minority-owned businesses, so they can create jobs, and grow their businesses, and reinvest in the neighborhoods and the communities that we serve.  It's the first of a kind in our sector. In addition, we partnered with the UNCF to launch a $3 million Exelon fund for corporate scholarship program to provide scholarships and internships that create opportunities for students, attending historically black colleges and universities, that reside in the communities that we serve. Finally, we're closely watching the work in Washington on the infrastructure, build back better agenda. The legislation will help us address climate change prices through incentivizing clean technologies and infrastructure investments, to make the grid more resilient and ready for Clean Energy Technologies.  It is clear from the proposal that the Administration and Congress recognize, the critical importance of maintaining the existing nuclear fully. To ensure that the nation can cost-effectively address climate change and we're confident that when the legislation pass, does pass, it will include a production tax credit for the existing nuclear. Moving on to Slide 6, to our operations, reliability remains incredibly strong. All the utilities are delivering a top decile outage frequencies and first quartile in outage durations. BGE, PECO, and PHI were top decile for gas odor responses, which is very critical for us as we continue to defend gas as a source -- a bridge source of the future. Customer services, top-notch with BGE, ComEd and PECO achieving top decile and PHI top quartile.  On a generation front, our generation fleet performed well during the quarter, even in the face of uncertainty in Illinois, Our nuclear plants produced 40.5 terawatts of 0 carbon generation, avoiding approximately 21 million tons of carbon dioxide, that would be generated otherwise. The fleet had a 96% capacity factor over that period of time. And we're very proud of their operations with the uncertainty they've faced. On Slide 7, the progress in separation. We continue to make progress on separating the businesses into 2 independent Fortune 200 companies. FERC approved the separation in August, and in September we received a private letter ruling, from the IRS confirming the tax-free nature of the separation. The process for the NRC and New York PSC approvals are moving forward as expected, and remain on track. Last week, the New York PSC staff held the first meeting of settlement negotiations. This is an important step in the process and we've asked for authorization from the commission by December 16th, on their scheduled meeting date. We have named the CEO of each Company, as well as their direct reports and we'll continue the staffing prior growth process over the course of the next few weeks and months to be ready for the close in the first quarter of next year. Joe Dominguez and I are both excited to lead our companies into the next chapter. Exelon will continue to be one of the nation's premier customer-focused energy delivery companies with more than 10 million customers. Joe is the right person to lead Constellation. We'll be America's leading clean energy Company producing 12% of the nation's clean energy. And nearly 2 times more than any other clean energy Company out there. We remain focused on setting each business up to be successful for the long term. Joe, I'll turn over to you for the financial update.
A - Joe Nigro: Thank you, Chris. And good morning, everyone. Today I will cover our third quarter results, our quarterly financial updates and our hedge disclosures. I will also provide an update on our full-year 2021 guidance. Turning to Slide 8 first, we earned a $1.09 per share on a non-GAAP basis for the quarter. Exelon Utilities delivered a combined $0.66 per share net of holding Company expenses; and this was primarily driven by above-normal summer weather in our non decoupled jurisdictions, along with strong operational performance and the impacts of distribution rate cases.  ExGen earned $0.44 per share in the third quarter. Generation and Constellation both performed well during the quarter. We continue to make progress on levers we identified to mitigate the Texas loss, and we expect it will take the full year to realize all of the savings. Realized gains in our decommissioning trust funds partially offset the unrealized losses from our Constellation technology venture investments, which are mark-to-market in every quarter until realized. At our holding Company, we benefited from expected income tax favorability in the third quarter. And as a reminder, our holding Company incurred $0.12 per share drag in the first quarter, associated with how consolidated full-year tax expenses are booked due to the impact of the losses incurred at ExGen and Texas.  The remainder of the first quarter drag is expected to reverse in the fourth quarter, and is not expected to impact our full year results. Turning to guidance, we are narrowing our 2021 EPS guidance range to $2.70 to $2.90 per share, from $2.60 to $3 per share previously. Our updated guidance considers reversal of the retirements of the Byron and Dresden nuclear stations, as well as execution of the EDF put, and our continued additional disciplined approach to cost management. We are delivering on our financial commitments and are confident, we will be within our revised range at year-end. On Slide 9, we show our quarter-over-quarter earnings walk. The dollar per 9 -- $9 per share in the third quarter of this year was $0.05 per share higher than the third quarter of 2020.  Exelon Utilities inclusive of holding Company earnings, we're $0.08 per share higher compared to last year. The earnings growth was driven primarily by higher transmission and distribution rates associated with completed rate cases relative to the third quarter of 2020 and higher treasury rates on ComEd's distribution ROE. This was partially offset by costs related to the remnants of Hurricane Ida that swept through the PECO's service territory in our early September. The partial reversal of the first quarter tax expense at corporate also drove favorability relative to last year's results.  ExGen's earnings were down $0.03 per share compared with last year, and the decrease was due to net unrealized and realized losses on Constellation venture investments, lower capacity revenues, primarily in PJM, and more planned nuclear outage days. This was partially offset by realized gains in our nuclear decommissioning trust funds and higher ZEC revenue, due in part to increase volumes resulting from fewer planned refueling outages, and ZEC pricing in New York. Moving to Slide 10, looking at our utility returns on a consolidated basis, we continue to meet our consolidated 9% to 10% target with a 9.3% trailing month -- trailing 12-month ROE as of the third quarter. Earned ROE dipped modestly by 10 basis points since last quarter.  Despite higher earnings driven primarily by distribution and transmission rates, the earnings were outpaced by increased equity infusions in cross all for utilities to support capital investments. Looking forward, we remain focused on delivering stronger and returns at the utilities and supporting our growth targets to enable customer benefits. Turning to Slide 11, there were some important developments on the regulatory front since the last call. First, on September 1st, Delmarva, Maryland filed an electric base rate case with the Maryland Public Service Commission, seeking an approximately $29 million increase in electric distance rates and reflecting an ROE of 10.1%. The case highlight to Delmarva Power's strong record of reliability reporting the second-best reliability performance in Maryland in 2019 and 2020 behind only Pepco.  Delmarva Power continues to make significant investments to improve reliability and customer service, for our customers and communities. DPL Maryland expects to receive an order by March 30th, 2022. Second, on September 15th, Delmarva Delaware received a verbal order for its distribution electric rate case. The Delaware Commission approved approximately $14 million increase in annual base distribution rates reflecting an ROE of 9.6%. As permitted by Delaware law, Delmarva Power implemented full allowable rates on October 6th, 2020, subject to refund. We also have two rate cases pending final orders in the fourth quarter. On October 6, the administrative logo (ph) was presiding over PECO's electric distribution base rate case, recommended the settlement with all parties be approved. The settlement provides for an increase of a 132 million, in annual electric distribution revenues. And we expect to receive an order in the fourth quarter.  And then on November 2, the AOJ presiding over ComEd's 2021 distribution formula rate update, issued a proposed order. There were no adjustments to ComEd's proposed revenue requirement increase of $45.8 million. We expect to receive a final order from the Illinois Commerce Commission by early December. We continue to have constructive regulatory relationships across our jurisdictions and are working with our regulators, states, and communities to support their clean energy and climate goals. As a reminder, we expect nearly 100% of our rate base growth will be covered by alternative mechanisms by the end of our planning period, a differentiator for our utilities when compared to peers. More details on the rate cases can be found on slides 20 through 24 of the appendix.  And as Chris mentioned, our energy efficiency programs highlighted on Slide 12 is one example of how Exelon's Utilities are helping their customers on the path to clean. Exelon Utilities are driving customer-driven emissions reductions in our communities through some of the nation's largest energy efficiency programs and conservation efforts. These programs enable customer savings through home energy audits, lighting discounts, appliance recycling, home improvement rebates, equipment upgrade incentives, and innovative programs like smart thermostats, and combined heat and power programs. In 2020, through a combination of new and prior-year investments, our utilities helped customers save over 22.3 million megawatt hours of energy.  This equates to eight point million -- 8.1 million metric tons of CO2 emissions avoided. The equivalent of nearly 932,000 homes energy use for 1 year, or the carbon sequestered by 10.5 million acres of U.S. forest in 1 year, according to EPA's Greenhouse Gas calculator. Each of Exelon's Utilities is building upon existing work and supporting a path to clean that aligns to the goals and needs of their local jurisdictions and stakeholders. Our approach allowed jurisdictional flexibility such that each utility may respond to their unique regions and markets, and employ the strategies and solutions that best address their operational footprint and customer preferences. But for discussing our gross margin update on Slide 13, I want to remind you that we expect to provide 2022 hedge disclosures at Analyst Day, which will be held closer to the completion of the separation. However, what I can say now is that we have continued to hedge on our rateables plan for future years. And this includes the length from the Byron and Dresden retirement reversals until the carbon mitigation contracts begin and Exelon's full ownership of the CENG assets. Turning to the table, total gross margin increased $500 million since last quarter due to the plant retirement reversals in Illinois and full ownership of the CENG assets beginning on August 7th.  In 2021, open gross margin is up $1.6 billion relative to the second quarter, primarily due to higher prices in all regions and higher volumes driven by execution of the EDF PUCT, and the decision to reverse Byron and Dresden 's early retirements. Capacity and ZEC dollars are up $100 million due to full ownership of the CENG assets. Mark-to-market of hedges were down $1 billion due to our hedged position, partially offset by the execution of power new business. We executed $200 million of power new business, and $50 million of non-power new business during the third quarter. The non-gross margin impacts of the Illinois plant reversals and the full ownership of CENG are incorporated on page 32 of the appendix. Thank you. And I'll now turn the call back to Chris for his closing remarks.
A - Chris Crane: Thanks, Joe. Turning to Slide 14, I'll close on our ongoing priorities and commitments. As we've said in the past and will continue, we will meet or exceed our financial commitments, delivering earnings with our guidance range and maintaining a strong Balance Sheet. And that goes for both companies as we split, there's a commitment on both sides to do that. We'll complete the preparations to separate the businesses including the organization, the cost structure for each Company that will set each Company up for long-term success at a strong investment grade. At Exelon Utilities, we are prudently and efficiently deploying $6.6 billion of capital to benefit our customers and help meet the needs of our jurisdictions Energy policy goals. We are working with our regulators to ensure timely recovery of these investments, as Joe discussed in his talking points. We continue to advocate for clean energy and climate policies with the new administration and Congress, In our states to put the country on the path to meeting the carbon and air pollution reduction goals. There's more here than just carbon. We have a city in Chicago that is the 3rd highest with lung disease, and it's not only carbon, it's the fumes from the industrial sources, and we need to do our part to help lower that. We're partnering and supporting our customers in the communities that we serve. So with that, I thank you for your time today, and I'll open up the call, to questions.
Operator: Thank you. [ Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Stephen Byrd, from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Stephen Byrd: Good morning. Thanks so much for the thorough update.
Chris Crane: Thanks, Steve.
Stephen Byrd: I wanted to step back and talk about federal legislation broadly, and discuss the impacts, less on nuclear, I think you all have been very clear on that side. I'm thinking more about everything from tax policy to support for transmission. Just curious at a high level, what are you thinking in terms about the potential impacts to your business if this legislation were to pass?
Chris Crane: I'll let Kathleen Barron speak to it. We think there's a lot of positives that can be put in play here. I don't think we're looking for any handouts. We'd rather make the investments ourselves. And between Kathleen and Calvin Butler, we'll -- they'll ham and egg it.
Kathleen Barron: And Joe may want to jump in on the tax question, but good morning, Stephen. As you pointed out, I think we're very heartened by the support for the nuclear stations and the recognition that their continued operation is essential to meeting the climate goals. But the bill goes way beyond nuclear as you pointed out, in terms of the extensive support for electric vehicles both personal vehicles and electric buses and transit transmission, as you pointed out, and then significant funding on resiliency for hardening and weatherization, all of which we think are essential for the communities that we service as Chris pointed out. The transmission program, that's always been a challenging issue, as you know, given that it's not just about funding, but it's also about citing. And so we do expect that to continue to be a challenging area, but obviously essentially to the Clean Energy build-out. So I'll stop there, let Cal jump in or Joe, as I said, on tax.
Calvin Butler: Good morning, Steve. And I will just add a couple of things to piggyback off what Kathleen said. If you think about some of the specifics that the federal government is looking to partner with the states, think about the $7.5 billion they've earmarked for a charging infrastructure. $5 billion going toward zero emission and clean buses, port electrification. When you think about port electrification, for our city of Baltimore and Philadelphia, what that would mean for them, and not even talking about the different grants that they're proposing where utilities could partner to do different things in creative.  And all this is good for the customers. If those -- that -- those monies are coming directly to the state and there's a partnership, we will continue to invest on reliability and resiliency and then take these moments. It keeps the customer build down. And that is a concern of ours, just to keep affordability at the forefront of everything we do. So that's that partnership and how we see it playing out. Joe?
Joe Nigro: And I will pick up, Stephen, on the tax question and we're studying the potential implications across our business. And as you know, we obviously a very large capital plans at our utilities for the benefit of the cost -- our customers. And they also helped drive the local economies and help meet the climate and clean energy goals of our communities. Many of the goals -- of those same goals are shared by this build back better plan, which I think is driving the tax question. And you've heard others in the industry say the minimum tax could increase customer bills and potentially impact investment of the capital that we deploy. We are communicating with policymakers about that fact and the impacts it may have on the capital planning process, and we're continuing to work through that.
Stephen Byrd: Very helpful, thank you. And then maybe just -- separately, just thinking about the utility business. You already have excellent growth, so I suppose this question is going to come across as somewhat greedy, but I am thinking about other areas of upside potential there. I was just curious, maybe for Calvin and Chris. As we think about categories of growth upside beyond, the excellent base plan that is, resulting in above average growth. What are some of the categories of, additional upside as we think about, the utilities growth prospects going forward?
Chris Crane: I'll just start off and then [indiscernible] to Calvin. There are many case studies being done on voltage requirements -- on dual flow voltage requirements. What do we use to harden ourselves from an internet exposure which would be our own wires, our own fiber but -- Cal?
Calvin Butler: Chris, you captured it. It really goes around building the reliability and the resiliency of our system. And I think as we lay out our multi-year plans and across our jurisdictions, it's understanding and really diving in, Stephen, in terms of what the customers want in our jurisdictions, but the hardening and the resiliency of our system is coming in the forefront. In addition to fighting climate change, that's a big part of what we're doing in along with the security-related issues, as Chris has outlined. So those are opportunities in the areas, but it's that partnership and really understanding what the jurisdictions are wanting.
Stephen Byrd: Thank you very much. Go ahead.
Chris Crane: We can't run a system on the distribution side any longer at a 4,160-voltage level, we have to get up to 138, and that's going to take a significant investment to do that. And that's to support the distributed Generation. So there's a lot more work to be done.
Stephen Byrd: Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.
Steve Fleishman: Hi, good morning.
Chris Crane: Hi, Steve.
Steve Fleishman: Hi. So I guess 2 questions. First, on the Build Back Better [indiscernible] Bill. Just thoughts on the likelihood that that passes. And if some reason it does not, how do you feel about opportunities to address nuclear PTCs and other bills if we somehow got there?
Chris Crane: Well, Kathleen is earning her paycheck to ensure that it gets done. So I'll let her answer the question.
Kathleen Barron: Good morning, Steve.
Steve Fleishman: Kathleen, make it to -- make it 2 for 2.
Kathleen Barron: Thanks, Steve. I think we're still feeling very confident about the Democrats ability to get both infrastructure and build back better across the finish line. They're -- as you know, a strong proposal put out by the president that had support last week around a top line number that the group has apparently coalesced around. They have continued to work to flesh out the meat on the bones, so that they can move this package quickly and [indiscernible] has assured that he thinks that is doable, indeed, even signing an agreement with the Senate Majority Leader that it's possible this could get done by Thanksgiving. So I think there's a broad consensus that action is needed.  And in particular, on the clean energy tax package, that there's sufficient support for the provisions that we'll get the country to a place where it can come close to meeting the 2030 Carbon reduction goals. If for some reason that does not occur, as you know, there's regularly action at the end of the year on a bipartisan basis to look at tax extenders. And we're again hopeful given the amount of support that we've seen for support for the existing fleet, that the nuclear provisioning could be considered as part of an end-of-the-year bipartisan package, if the democrat BBB bill doesn't get across the finish line.
Steve Fleishman: Okay. My other question related to that is, I know there's a ton of detail of this, but just high level. How does the PTC interact with your existing state commitments for the different units, or subsidies or laws. Also you’re hedging and retail and all that, as well.
Chris Crane: I want to start new.
Kathleen Barron: Yes, I'll start off and pass it to Jim on the hedging question. But the short answer is that under the nuclear PTC as drafted, revenues from a state program are not, included at the state program would adjust, or reflect the existence of the federal support. almost all of our programs have some explicit reference to the fact that if there is subsequent federal support after the state program takes effect, that it will be reflected in the state calculation of the support under the program. So there clearly will need to be further proceedings to evaluate and have the state adjudicate how that federal support will be reflected, but assuming that the PTC passes, we would expect each of the states to take a look at that and for it to be reflected in the level of the states' supports. Jim?
Jim Mchugh: Yeah. And Steve, I think on the hedging the best -- the details of the implementation [Indiscernible] really matter. But for now, I think the right way to think about it, is this effectively will serve as a hedge for a significant portion of our generation. If you take our nuclear fleet and we kind of reconcile what the PTC program will do. And then kind of reflect what Kathleen just said about its impact on the state programs, the net result is you have a pretty highly hedged portfolio with the PTC. We'll get into the details about them, The exact settlement of it and exactly how it -- the implementation plan will be settled all the way through the prices all the way through to the spot market.  The best way I think on the retail business for us is we'll be able to still win our customer business. We'll have a portfolio that's a little bit more hedged to begin with. We'll have purchases in the market to help us where we need to go make additional purchase to help us serve the load portfolio that will continue to serve.
Steve Fleishman: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And thank you. And our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey. Good morning, team. Congrats on the continued progress across all your various efforts here. So kudos to Kathleen and team. But perhaps -- just to focus on one of the other topical issues of late. Uranium prices have been seeing a pretty sharp uptake of late. I suspect it's not too subsidiary and for you all, but I just want to make sure I understand how you all are thinking about that impact things sort of longer-term hedging and procurement activities. And ultimately impact back to the core business.
Chris Crane: I think we're very well hedged through this period and it's not like we haven't seen it before, but I'll let Bryan Hanson, our head of the Generating Company -- Operations of the Generating Company, answer that.
Bryan Hanson: Thanks, Chris. Good morning, Julien. We think today's market fundamentals are much improved from the last uranium bull market that we saw 2008-2010 period. Demand is lower, primary mining supply has increased and utility inventories are higher. We at Exelon, we hedge with a diverse portfolio of fuel contracts that include varying pricing mechanisms, or varying horizons with a diverse group of qualified and reliable suppliers. And we maintain a strategic inventory, both to ensure security of supply for our reactors, and to provide flexibility and purchase timing in the event of a market disruption like we're seeing today.  We even maintain or keep our uranium inventory in different material states, such as yellow cake gore uranium hexafluoride gas. So we think we're well hedged and well ready for this current bull market. We're looking in the forward part of the LRP for any opportunities and they're all well within our expectations that we see today.
Chris Crane: That would be [Indiscernible]
Bryan Hanson: UFS 6. Very good, Chris.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: There we go, excellent. Thank you guys for affirming that, appreciate it. And then, I just -- on the Hydrogen side, I heard the comment about partnering with Nel here, scaling into operate commercial opportunities to the extent available in '22. Can you talk a little bit more about what that opportunity means for you all? I mean, is this just about having a firm uptake or is this about having some portion of the economics over time? And I know it's early days, but I'm just curious to hear, at least it's the best to understand what that opportunity may be, especially considering the credits at hand here as well.
Chris Crane: Yeah. I don't think we're ready to give a full business model on it right now. I think we've got a good partnership with the DOE. Exelon, like other utility companies, sees a great use for hydrogen if it's mixing it with natural gas to cut down the carbon loads or other ways. There's -- our strategy organization is still looking at the transportation methodology and they're doing some metallurgical research with other labs to make sure that we -- if we were replacing natural gas pipelines with hydrogen pipelines, that the embrittlement problem doesn't become severe. So what we need to do first, is predict or perfect an efficient technology, using our heat and steam to develop the Hydrogen.  Then from there, continue to work with other stakeholders on, where we put the Hydrogen. Does it go in a mixed form with natural gas at first? Does it become, what was thought about ten years ago, the hydrogen economy? I don't think we're there yet. I think there is a lot of work to be done before we get there, but just having the grants and working with the labs and the government to start using a nuclear plant for something more than electricity because you've got all that waste, heat, and steam that can be redirected into the development of very efficient hydrogen, and then continue to move on from there.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Just to clarify this, I imagine you wouldn't touch on the subject of capital allocation given the rise in commodity prices here. And when still stated equity needs. Still too early, right?
Chris Crane: Yes. Too early
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Fair enough. We will leave it there. Thank you, guys. Best of luck here.
Chris Crane: Alright. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Your line is now open.
Shar Pourreza: Hey guys, good morning.
Chris Crane: Morning.
Shar Pourreza: Joe, can you just maybe further unpack, I guess the level of details and additional disclosures around the retail business that you plan to talk about at the Analyst Day, now that it's obviously a lot more in focus? And then the interim, maybe just further elaborate in how we should think about Nigro? Think about the prompt year, and year to hedge profiles just given the lack of disclosures and significant moves in the curves. I mean, appear didn't, obviously, take as much advantage as expected, so maybe just a better sense here would help, even if it's directionally.
Joe Nigro: Yeah, let me answer the first question, Shar, and good morning. And then I'll turn over the hedge question to Jim McHugh. As I've said previously, as we get closer to actual separation date, we plan to have an Analyst Day for both companies where we'll update all of the financial variables so you have a complete picture of both companies and you'll get insight into -- on the Exelon side, all the things that we normally provide including earnings trajectories and rate-based growth and so on. And on the Constellation side, we'll give you the details with the updated hedge disclosures and all the other associated information that allows you to do your modeling. But that's not going to happen obviously until we get much more certainty and much closer to the actual execution of separation itself. And with that, Jim, I'll let you answer the question.
Jim Mchugh: Sure, I'll talk about hedging. The outer years where we have less hedge -- we've always talked about our ratable hedge program. We're still following that. We're not deviating a large deal from what we've historically talked about. I think the change for 2022 has to be in relation to what we saw develop over the course of this quarter with the legislation. We had assets that we had previously said we're going to retire. And then the legislation passed and we un -retired.  And what that effectively meant for 2022 is that Before the contract goes into effect, it created a position that added extra generationally through our portfolio that we've been able to since then hedge but beyond -- then beyond May or June when the contract starts, effectively those megawatts are hedged through the CMC contracts. So the 2022 is just a little bit in a different beginning of the year, end of your story because effectively the contracts are providing the hedge in the long run. We hedged the length that got added back to the book, largely speaking, in the beginning of the year, during this price action that we saw this quarter. So that's been a generally good development.  And then, in the outer years, we would still -- other than the contracted assets, we would still be following along our rateables hedge programs. So there's the further out in time you go, the more open position areas as we've always had historically.
Shar Pourreza: Got it. That's actually pretty interesting points. Thank you for that. And then just lastly. I know you guys are still working through the details, but can we just touch on maybe just how you're thinking about the SpinCo capital allocation. Just even briefly, right? I mean, your IPP peers have been very specific. Is this something we should -- we could see from Constellation? Just maybe some high-level thoughts on how you and the board are thinking about approaching growth versus returning capital to shareholders.
Chris Crane: You know what? We're going through that modeling right now. As Joe Dominguez takes over a d he puts his financial team together, they will be evaluating the best use of capital and what the opportunities are. Having a good investment-grade gives us a little bit more opportunity. And maybe what would -- somebody would call our peers, that we don't think that they are our peers because of the hedge portion of the nuclear plants. But they will continue to evaluate that in the best way to create shareholder value, and Joe Dominguez you want to add any more?
Joe Dominguez: I don't think I really can add at this point. We're looking at it pretty carefully. As Chris said, we think we have, some unique opportunities in this business, around co-location of assets, Hydrogen, and other things. That will depend on how the legislation plays out, and we've covered that. I think we'll have a lot more to say on that on-Analyst Day, but at this point, we're really just studying options. Pretty excited about the opportunities in front of us.
Chris Crane: One thing I can say is, I don't see him building a new nuclear plant anytime soon.
Shar Pourreza: Thank you for clarifying that Chris. Appreciate it guys, and congrats.
Operator: And thank you. And our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, good morning. It's actually Ryan on for Jeremy. Just had one on the regulated business and kind of [Indiscernible] understanding it's still early days, but the changes are the framework at Illinois and ComEd and how you thinking at this stage about those 2 different options that multi-year plan versus the traditional rate-making and how that might impact growth of customer bill impacts as we approach that date?
Calvin Butler: Hey, Ryan, this is Calvin Butler. First and foremost, the team is really looking through and analyzing all the metrics. And as you know, we're operating with the formula rate through the end of '22 and we'll make that, decide on early midyear what that looks like going forward. But we're really making that determination now. We have not decided yet whether it's going to be a four-year multiyear plan, forward-looking test year. We're doing that analysis now.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Understood. And then just maybe just one on ExGen, and I know you guys are going to be very successful in achieving on the assets laid out beginning of the year on the offset, [Indiscernible] kind of storm. And just thinking through, maybe you can provide more color on what those assets have been and any kind of incremental thoughts on relative sustainability, going into future years?
Chris Crane: Bryan, you want to talk about what you're doing?
Bryan Hanson: Yeah, on the nuclear side where a lot of the offsets came from, in our capital allocation, our capital maintenance, many of those items were big, major transformer improvements, changes, change-outs. We've just simply moved those on a year or 2. We bundled them the way we did because it streamlined our efficiencies and use of craft resources. We're able to skip a year or 2 on those, no challenges to reliability from that standpoint. And a number of the other modifications included just a material condition. Improvements were always kept in the plan, but some of the digital upgrades that we had planned for those years, we've moved those out of a couple of years and reassessing the economic viability of some of those improvements.
Chris Crane: Would you just bring them back Colorado bend from hardening for the lessons learned.
Bryan Hanson: Yeah, in the Texas assets, we have done all the work that's required that address the known issues and the acute issues from Winter Storm Uri. We're finishing up at Colorado Ben, which is done. Our plant by Houston will follow -- we finished that work-up a couple of weeks ago, as well as a number of enhancements we made just to protect ourselves against a sustained cold weather event again in Texas. Temporary improvements that we've made looking for, again, what's the long-term market signals for those plants.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. I appreciate the color. I'll leave it there. Thank you.
Operator: And thank you. And I would now like to turn the call back to President and CEO, Chris Crane, for closing remarks.
Chris Crane: Thank you for joining the call today. As you know, we're working hard to run the business at best-in-class levels and taking steps to step up to item strong in?2? companies, strong independent companies. And we look forward to seeing you at EEI, I think next week. It's coming quick. And with that, we'll close the call out and tell everybody to be safe.
Operator: Thanks to all participants for joining us today. This concludes our presentation; you may now disconnect. Have a great day.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-08-04 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello and welcome to Exelon’s Second Quarter Earnings Call. My name is Danny and I will be your event specialist today. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn today’s program over to Dan Eggers, Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance. The floor is yours.
Dan Eggers: Thank you, Danny. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining our second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. Leading the call today are Chris Crane, Exelon’s President and Chief Executive Officer and Joe Nigro, Exelon’s Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by other members of Exelon’s senior management team, who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. We issued our earnings release this morning, along with the presentation, all of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of Exelon’s website. The earnings release and other matters which we discuss during today’s call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today’s material and comments made during this call. Please refer to today’s 8-K and Exelon’s other SEC filings for discussions of risk factors and other factors, including uncertainties surrounding the planned separation that may cause results to differ from management’s projections, forecasts and expectations. Today’s presentation also includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for reconciliations between the non-GAAP measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures. I will now turn the call over to Chris Crane, Exelon’s CEO.
Chris Crane: Thanks, Dan and good morning everybody and thanks for joining us this morning. We had a good quarter financially and operationally. We made progress on our regulatory and policy objectives as we had stated our desires last quarter. We earned $0.41 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.89 per share on a non-GAAP basis and Joe will go through those details when we get to his part of the presentation. As you know, we have been working with our regulators and our policymakers across our six jurisdictions on regulatory mechanisms that would allow us to prudently invest in critical infrastructure to the benefit of our consumers, while earning an appropriate return on that used capital. As part of those efforts, the DC, Maryland PSCs, approved multiyear plans for Pepco. The New Jersey BPU approved ACE’s electric rate settlement and we received an order in the PECO gas rate case. It’s the first in 10 years. PJM held a first capacity auction in 3 years. Results were disappointing, but were slightly better than we had anticipated or expected. Commerce and the administration continue to work on the infrastructure package and there is momentum building to preserve the existing nuclear fleet to meet the country’s energy and climate goals. The presence budget includes support for existing nuclear plants and Senator [indiscernible] and Representative Pascrell introduced legislation to provide $15 per megawatt hour production tax credit to existing nuclear power plants. This legislation would help ensure that the existing nuclear fleet, which provides more than 50% of the nation’s carbon-free power, remains in operations and available to meet the country’s energy needs, while preserving and achieving climate goals. This progress is encouraging. If the PTC is included in the legislation that passes later this year, it will make an enormous difference for climate and for our nuclear plants. Unfortunately though, that will be too late for the Byron and the Dresden nuclear facilities, which brings me to Illinois. After many months of very tough negotiations, we were able to reach agreement with the Governor and his administration that would provide support to Byron, Dresden and Braidwood facilities, allowing them continued operation and LaSalle would also be preserved. Unfortunately, the state leaders and other stakeholders are at an impasse at this point on provisions related to the nuclear regulation – or excuse me, the nuclear issues in the legislation. There has been no progress towards enacting the legislation since the session ended and the retirement dates for the plants are now only weeks away. We don’t want to close these plants, but we cannot make decisions based off of hope of legislation being passed in the future. We have been doing that since 2016, while significant losses have been incurred. We must act on the economic facts as they exist today where no legislation has been passed by the general assembly or signed into law by the Governor. Absent legislation, closing the plants is the right economic decision, but not an easy one. The talent, the dedicated employees that work at these plants, our colleagues and our friends that these – their jobs support their families and the communities. Premature retirement of these plants is also a loss for the citizens of Illinois. The 4 plants at Byron, Dresden, Braidwood and LaSalle, which are 8 reactors, provide 28,000 direct and indirect jobs, $3.5 billion annually to the Illinois economy, $150 million in Illinois taxes that support the schools, public safety and other critical services in the communities that they reside in. Two-thirds of Illinois carbon-free electricity is greatly at risk with these shutdowns. Once Byron and Dresden retire, it will take many years under the proposed legislation to add enough renewable energy – intermittent renewable energy to get back to where Illinois is in terms of clean energy production. In the meantime, more than 100 million metric tons of additional carbon will be admitted over the next decade as a result. I remain hopeful that the outstanding differences can be resolved and the Bill will be passed very soon that would allow the clients to continue to deliver the carbon-free power to the grid, but time is really running out on that becoming achievable. Moving to operations on Slide 6, reliability and performance remained strong despite the frequent storms and the heat across our service territories. All utilities achieved first quartile operating performance in outage duration and frequency, as you can see by the charts. ComEd delivered top decile performance in outage duration and frequency, while BGE and PHI were top decile for outage duration. Customer operation metrics remain strong across the utilities. BGE, ComEd and PECO achieved top decile performance in the customer satisfaction indices. On the generation front, our generation fleet performed well during the quarter. Our nuclear plants provided 36.6 terawatt hours of zero carbon generation to the grid, avoiding approximately 20 million metric tons of carbon dioxide. The fleet had a capacity factor of 93.7% for the quarter. Our fossil and renewable fleet operated above plan with power dispatch match at 99.5% and wind and solar energy capture at 96%. Our Texas plants are running as expected, helping to meet the summer loads. Turning to the separation on Slide 7, we are making progress against our execution plan and remain on track for first quarter close. The team is working on the organizational and cost structures of each company that will set each business up for long-term success. On the regulatory front, we have received comments in each of the dockets for approval and the process is moving forward as expected. We remain on track to get the necessary approvals. We will continue to update you on the work as it progresses. Turning to Slide 8, we all are very excited at Exelon to announce that Exelon Utilities have set a goal to reduce their operations driven admission by 50% by 2030 and reaching net zero by 2050. Since our founding, Exelon has been dedicated to being part of the solution for climate crisis and a leader in providing clean energy to the grid. We were one of the first companies in our industry to commit to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, even though our emissions were already 10x lower than our peers. We have met or exceeded our previous – three previous goals and Exelon Utilities new goal builds upon our longstanding commitment to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. We will make these goals through continued modernization of our gas systems, electrifying our light-duty fleet and exploring electricity and other zero carbon alternatives for medium and heavy-duty fleet. A focus on energy efficiency and clean electricity for our operations is clearly part of the plan, investing in equipment and processes to reduce our SF6 insulating gas from our large breakers from our system, exploring and piloting low-carbon fuels in new grid technologies and advocating for affordable grid decarbonization. In addition, we remain focused on how we can help our customers and communities decarbonize in an equitable way. The utilities will continue to invest in the EV infrastructure across our service territories and join the electric highway coalition, which will create a seamless network of charging stations on highway systems covering most of the country. We will invest in robust energy efficiency programs in each of our utilities. This is the continuing endeavor which will enable customers to have lower emissions profile, use less energy and save money. In 2020 alone, these programs avoided 8.1 million metric tons of carbon emissions. Advocates for policy that will put our state – we will continue to advocate for policies that will put our states and our communities on a path to a clean energy future while ensuring equitable transitions that’s benefit everyone in our communities. Before I turn it over to Joe on Slide 9, I want to highlight the work we are doing to help transform our communities through our workforce development programs, which you can see on – narrated on the slide. Diversity, equality and inclusion is a core value at Exelon and we are growing a diverse and inclusive high-performing workforce. We operate in some of the most diverse cities in the country and we have a responsibility to help address the inequities in our communities. We have more than 100 workforce development programs, spanning from middle schools, high schools and throughout colleges as well as programs for work-ready underemployed adults. These programs have already reached more than 22,000 participants. We recently launched the STEM Leadership Academy scholarships that are open to graduates of the program ensures that the graduates are debt-free and guaranteed internships with Exelon throughout their college path. I recently awarded scholarships to 7 young women and see their faces on how life-changing this was for them and their families. It was quite emotional, not only for the young women, but for myself and the rest of the leadership here at Exelon. We are committed to supporting our communities by investing in education, job training programs and giving the underserved populations opportunities to grow and succeed. I will turn it over to Joe now to take our financial update.
Joe Nigro: Thank you, Chris and good morning everyone. Today, I will cover our second quarter results, our quarterly financial updates and our hedge disclosures. First, turning to Slide 10, we earned $0.89 per share on a non-GAAP basis for the quarter. This favorability was driven by O&M tax timing as well as some realized and unrealized gains we have forecasted for later this year. Exelon Utilities delivered a combined $0.49 per share net of holding company expenses. This was primarily driven by strong operational performance and the impacts of distribution rate cases. ExGen earned $0.40 per share in the second quarter and we have begun to make progress on levers we identified to mitigate the Texas laws. But as we have said before, we expect it will take a full year to realize all the savings. Additionally, unrealized and realized gains from the Constellation Technology Ventures portfolio and realized gains from our nuclear decommissioning trust funds contributed to the favorable course. At Holdco, we benefited from expected income tax favorability in the second quarter. As a reminder, Holdco incurred $0.12 per share drag in the first quarter associated with how consolidated full year tax expenses are booked due to the impact of losses incurred at ExGen in Texas during Q1. The remainder of the first quarter hit will reverse over the course of the year and not impact our full year results. There is still a lot of work to be done this year, but we are confident we will deliver earnings within our guidance range of $2.60 to $3 per share. And you can see the details on Slide 17 in the appendix. On Slide 11, we show our quarter-over-quarter earnings block. The $0.89 per share in the second quarter of this year was $0.34 per share higher than the second quarter of 2020. Exelon Utilities less Holdco earnings were up $0.20 per share compared with last year. The increase was driven primarily by the absence of storm’s costs from last year’s record setting storm season at PECO and new rates associated with our completed rate cases and the impact of higher treasury rate on ComEd’s distribution ROE. The partial reversal of first quarter tax expense at corporate also drove favorability relative to last year’s results. ExGen’s earnings were up $0.14 per share compared with last year. And the increase was due to unrealized and realized gains on our Constellation Technology Venture investments, realized gains in our nuclear decommissioning trust funds, fewer planned nuclear outage days, and higher ZEC revenue from increased volumes in ZEC pricing in New York. As a reminder, the Constellation Technology Venture investment will be mark-to-market every quarter. And since the quarter end, we have seen some decline in prices. Moving on to Slide 12, looking at our utility returns on a consolidated basis, our trailing 12-month ROE as of the second quarter has improved to 9.6% and is back within our 9% to 10% targeted range. A 50 basis point increase from last quarter was primarily due to higher second quarter earnings across the utilities and the roll-off of the storms that I mentioned that occurred last year. Looking forward, we remain focused on delivering stronger returns at the utilities and supporting our growth targets. Now, turning to Slide 13, as Chris mentioned briefly in his remarks, there were some important developments on the regulatory front. Notably, we received orders in two multiyear plans at Pepco for DC and Maryland. Multiyear plans provide our customers with great predictability and reduce the administrative costs caused by frequent filing with traditional rate case to recover our costs. We are pleased that we have now received orders in our first 3 multiyear repayments, which will provide timely and predictable recovery for capital investments for the benefit of all our customers. And now moving on to the details of the recent rate case developments. First, on June 8. The DC Public Service Commission approved Pepco’s multiyear plan for the 18 months spanning the remainder of ‘21 through 2022 with an allowed ROE of 9.275%, a revenue increase of $108.6 million, along with the acceleration of tax benefits to partially mitigate rate impacts for customers through 2022 is approved. Additionally, the order allows for two-way reconciliation, including the ability to request recovery of costs that exceed the forecasted cost at the end of ‘20. The commission also approved tracking performance and center mechanisms that are focused on the district’s climate and clinical energy goals, including GHG, emission reduction, energy savings, peak demand reduction and distributed energy resources deployed. Second, on the 28th of June, the Maryland Public Service Commission approved Pepco’s 3-year multiyear plan for April 1, 2021 through March 31, 2024. The order approved a cumulative revenue requiring of $52 million over the period as well as a 9.55% ROE. Acceleration of tax benefits to offset customer increases were improved for the first year with years 2 and 3 to be determined later. COVID-19 in electric vehicle regulatory assets were also approved for recovery. Third, on the 22nd of June, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission issued an order approving increase in PECO’s annual natural gas distribution revenues of $29 million, reflecting an ROE of 10.24%. And fourth, on July 14, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities unanimously approved ASIS settlement in both the electric distribution rate case as well as our AMI meter and network deployment and cost recovery. The rate case settlement was for $41 million revenue increase and a 9.6% ROE. There will be no rate impact to customers until January 1, 2022, due to improved offsets from acceleration of tax benefits. We are excited about the AMI decision that will allow us to bring the benefits of this technology to our customers in South Jersey. We’ve also had several rate cases still in progress including Del Margo Delaware’s electric case where we expected in the third quarter, the PECO electric case in the fourth quarter and ComEd’s annual formula rate filing in December. And overall, we’re very pleased with the progress in advancing progressive regulatory designs that benefit our customers while easing regulatory burden and improving visibility for our utilities. As a reminder, we expect nearly 100% of our rate base growth will be covered by alternative mechanisms by the end of our planning period, a differentiator for our utilities when compared to our peers. And more details on the rate cases can be found on Slides 21 through 28 of the appendix. And before discussing our gross margin update on Slide 14, I want to remind you that we will not be providing any ExGen disclosures beyond 2021 at this time. And given the separation, we expect to provide the 2022 hedge disclosures closer to completion when we’re able to give a full financial picture for new spin-off company. Turning to the table on gross margin, there is no change to the 2021 gross margin since last quarter. In 2021, open gross margin is up $750 million relative to the first quarter primarily due to the impact of higher prices across all regions and the execution of $50 million of our new business in [indiscernible]. Our mark-to-market hedges were down $600 million due to our highly hedged position, partially offset by the execution of power new business. We executed $150 million of power new business in the quarter and $50 million of non-power new business. I’ll stop there. Thank you and I’ll now turn the call back to Chris for his closing remarks.
Chris Crane: Thanks, Joe. Appreciate it. Turning to Slide 15, I’ll close on our priorities and commitments. We will meet or exceed our financial commitments, delivering earnings within our guidance range and maintaining a strong balance sheet. We will complete preparations to separate the business, including obtaining the regulatory approvals. At Exelon Utilities, we will prudently and effectively deploy nearly $6.6 billion of capital to the benefit of our customers and to help meet our state’s energy policy goals, and we will work with our regulators to ensure timely recovery of these investments. We will continue to advocate for clean energy and climate policies with the new administration commerce in our states to put the country on the path to meeting the carbon reduction goals that all desire. And we will continue to partner and support our customers in the communities that we serve. Thank you. And I’ll now open it up for questions. Before I do that, though, I have one error in my prepared reading. I said we’re at impasse on the nuclear issues on the bill. And that’s not where the impasse is. We’ve resolved the nuclear issues. We’re working with all the constituents on other elements. So just want to make sure that my blender, there didn’t go too far down the path of what the hell is going on. But with that, I’ll open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question will be from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America. Your line is open. Go ahead, please.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hi, good morning. Thanks for the opportunity.
Chris Crane: Good morning.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: So I’ll let the legislative comment on Illinois. I know it’s dynamic, and there is probably not too much more you can comment on there. But I’d love just in a moment, if you can talk more high level with respect to the federal efforts – And perhaps outside of Illinois, can you speak a little bit to the ability to potentially tap into this CNC program, specifically in other states like Maryland and Pennsylvania as well as the ability perhaps in some of the states that have various programs, so should we say, true-up against future pressures should those prove insufficient against pressures on power cures and renewables into the future?
Chris Crane: I’m going to add a little bit more color on to Illinois and then let Kathleen talk about the federal side. The governor in his administration, the leaders in the legislature have a really tough job to do. They are bringing together coalitions that have, in cases different priorities and as a member of inputting into these coalitions, we’re at a point that we need to figure out how to best support our leaders, so they are able to execute on legislation that that supports all within the right timing, within the right economics. But we’re here to support and we recognize the tough job ahead of our leaders, especially in the legislature committee leaders being able to bring something to fruition. So I just want to make sure that we’re clear on that point. And with that, I’ll turn it over to Kathleen to talk about the federal.
Kathleen Barron: Sure. Good morning, Julien. So while we’re certainly very grateful for the attention in washing to – in Washington to the importance of continuing the operation of the existing fleet in order to achieve climate goals. What’s going on is there are a number of policy tools that are under discussion and I’ll sort of take them in order, while there, as Chris mentioned, has been a production tax credit for nuclear introduced in both the House and Senate, there are discussions of a clean energy standard potentially being developed for the reconciliation bill. And you asked about CMC, I think what you mean is COE grant program that has been discussed potential inclusion in the infrastructure bill. So those are three very different kinds of policy solutions, the first two being far more comprehensive and ones that, as you mentioned, in Maryland, Pennsylvania and other states, in the existing nuclear team potentially seeing a significant amount of support and as Chris said, providing a real benefit to the climate. The grant program, little bit more challenging and more limited given the limited amount of funding that will be available under that program at least as it’s currently drafted. The real point though, is that all of these programs are just sort of proposed programs. Nothing has yet been enacted as you know and so while we’re watching it very closely and again, very grateful for the growing amount of support for preserving fleet through federal legislation. The reality is that, as Chris said, we need to make decisions based on laws that have actually been enacted and nothing has yet come to fruition in D.C. as of yet.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes. No, I appreciate that very much. If I can give us the business or the attention to the other side of the business a bit more. As you think about opportunities describing from your peers on carbon-free attributes and specifically some of the new novel off takers like miners, can you speak to the willingness with some of your counterparties, especially considering the extent of your C&I relationships already to perhaps pay a premium and contract directly with some of your nuclear assets, if you don’t mind?
Chris Crane: I’ll let Joe start and then Jim can jump in making sure we’ve got your question right here.
Joe Nigro: Yes, Julien, if I understand your question, I think you’re asking with some of the what some of these larger companies and customers are looking for, is there an opportunity with our carbon-free generation to marry to them? And there is…
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes.
Joe Nigro: I’m sorry, go ahead.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: No, no. Yes. Exactly.
Joe Nigro: Yes. So I think there is, and that’s something that the Constellation team is looking at, and we’ve created some products already – When you look at renewable off takes that we back to third-party customers, large third-party commercial industrial customers, and we had some success in different areas doing that as well as some of the things you mentioned these large mining companies cryptocurrency type companies, and I’ll let Jim fill in the blanks on there.
James McHugh: Yes. Thanks, Joe. Hi, Julien. Yes, we definitely had a lot of demand from our customers for multiple areas of interest, right, in order for them to hit their sustainability targets. Are they interested in carbon-free energy, renewable energy both. And we’ve had some success in selling emission-free energy credits and other renewable type products to some of our larger C&I customers. They are also interested in just sustainability information and data around energy usage and how to be more efficient. So there is there is kind of this burgeoning suite of different products and services that we’re working through with our team and with our customers that they are very interested in. And we certainly have also seen the demand for direct off takes and large energy purchases for both data centers and mining as well as also people that are interested in the hydrogen business. So we have a pipeline of activity and different products and services that we’re talking to our customers about. And we will have more to come on that as that develops.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. I wish you all best of luck and will speak you soon.
Chris Crane: Thanks.
Operator: The next question will be from Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.
Stephen Byrd: I wanted to just focus on the Texas assets for a little bit. There is been a lot of movement in terms of market design and a lot of those moves seen constructed, the four curves moved up a lot. I was just curious your latest thoughts in terms of how satisfied are you with the improvements in market design? I know I think it was a question in terms of whether those assets would be a fit unless there were improvements. What’s your general take on the progress in Texas?
Chris Crane: I’ll let Kathleen start and then I’ll finish on the actual plant themselves and what we’re doing in what we see as a potential new market design.
Kathleen Barron: Good morning. Stephen. So I think the progress is a little bit slow. The ERCOT leadership and the PUCT have really been focusing on how to react to what happened in February, and there is been, as you know, a lot of work associated with that. So the changes looking forward, I think are – in some was helpful in that we have finally seen a proposal for how to address weatherization. But on the broader question of market design, there is a lot of discussion, but we do not yet at this point have some solid proposals that have been either filed or approved. So while there are a number of stakeholders working on ways to address changes to the ORDC curve or introducing new products into the market, in my view, there is not enough progress yet to evaluate whether we’re going to see the kind of changes that will be necessary to prevent an event like everywhere from happening again.
Chris Crane: So, on the plant side, which should help inform what we need from the market side, Bryan Hanson, who is our Chief Operating Officer, who is on the phone for the GenCo, as the team – technical team working through what the design basis temperature would be that we would have to install capital to be able to reach that. The plants in Texas were never designed for the weather that we saw and especially the duration of the weather that we saw. So if we go to something much lower in temperature as a design basis. We have to look at what adequately would preserve the piping trace is an insulation. Is it other type of barriers and what’s the most economic way to get there? And Bryan, I don’t know if you want to add anything, but that team is well underway at this point.
Bryan Hanson: Chris, I would just add, we’ve built the model that has some certain assumptions on temperature, wind speed, prolonged longevity of the weather event that will calculate the engineering changes we need to make to the plant, in which case then we will be able to price that out. And then once the weatherization standards are published and accepted in ERCOT, we can then tune that model to come up with our final outcomes and then establish the price points for those plants.
Chris Crane: And that will definitely have to feed into what ERCOT is doing on market design. Just as we saw in PJM some years back on the reliability standards that they were looking for, there was an expense to that. We all were willing or many of us were willing to invest that into that reliability, but we have to have some assurance that we are going to get a return on that invested capital.
Stephen Byrd: Very helpful. And it’s fair that we still have to wait and see how the rules develop to figure out sort of what your stance is with those assets. So, that’s all very fair. I wanted to shift over to the utility. You gave a very good thorough update on the utility. I wanted to just step back, at a high level, utility is already an above-average grower, but I was just curious, are there – what are the biggest categories of sort of upside potential in terms of growth of the utility business that you are most excited about really a multiyear period, not so much in the near-term, but sort of longer term?
Chris Crane: Let me turn it over to Calvin Butler.
Calvin Butler: Hey. Thanks, Steve and good morning. I would sit back and say our opportunities is really in partnering with each of our jurisdictions to understand what their needs are and how we are really hardening the system and building resiliency throughout. As you sit back and look, I think our efforts around our path to clean, as Chris talked about and Joe talked about earlier is really understanding where they are taking us and electrifying our entire distribution system, also in really setting up our gas distribution system for the future. And replacing that infrastructure is also a key ingredient in several of our jurisdictions. In addition to that, around the security of the overall system as well. So, when we look at where we are going, electrifying our vehicle fleet, electrification of our system, the replacement of our gas system and also ensuring that it’s secure are really our opportunities across each of our jurisdictions.
Stephen Byrd: Thanks Calvin. That’s all I have. I appreciate it.
Operator: The next question will be from Steve Fleishman at Wolfe Research. Your line is open. You may ask your question.
Steve Fleishman: Thank you. Good morning. My questions are focused on Illinois. Just we have seen a decent move up in power prices recently. And particularly, I guess, in the near-term, just any sense on – is there any chance that, that could be enough to wait this out longer with the plants?
Chris Crane: I can give you the beginning, which is the end and then Joe can fill in the blanks. No. It doesn’t give us what we need. But Joe?
Joe Nigro: Thank you, Chris and good morning Steve. It really isn’t that simple. In certainly Steve, it’s very important. As you know, the plants face near-term financial challenges, and as Chris said in his script, after legislation closes the plant is the right economic decision and obviously not an easy one. I would tell you, we have seen an uptick in energy prices many times before, never of the help. And when you look at it at the front end of the power curve is up more materially than the back end of the power curve in terms of pricing. In addition, we have seen capacity prices decline. The stability and certainty provided by a contract better address – clearly better address the financial challenges of these plants without being exposed to all this market volatility. In addition, the term of the contract helps obviously with things like capital planning and the efficiency of that, obviously, our workforce and personnel planning. And we just think it’s a much more certain outcome and...
Steve Fleishman: I mean is there any appreciation that to the flip side that the law as proposed at least would actually be below where current price levels are in the near-term?
Chris Crane: It’s something that we see today. But we have seen this stance before. Something happens in the market, the near-term rises, it’s flat or low on the back side as we drift into the above years. We come right back down. And so we really have to focus on the long-term viability and the economics versus the cyclical nature of the markets, the lows and all the variables. We are agreeing to and support a significant renewable build-out within the legislation. We know that, that will have a depressing factor on prices as low demand periods with excess generation will bring the prices down, and that will drop not only the forwards, but the back here. So, it’s – there is consumer protection in the legislation that ensures we don’t over earn, but the – to bet on the come that these forwards are going to maintain and eventually lift the out years is a gamble that we are not willing to take.
Steve Fleishman: I guess my other question just on the law is it doesn’t seem like anyone, as you mentioned, is debating the nuclear provisions, but the issue, as I guess the governor said, is that that – as he kind of commented on the labor unions that they are preventing potential job loss in 2045 over certain job loss in 2021. Just – can you maybe – do the union group not believe you are shutting the plants or are they just willing to take potential benefits in 2045 over 2021?
Chris Crane: First of all, let me make it clear. We are not engaged and involved in that negotiation. And as far as the shutdown of the coal and the jobs issues that go along with that. We understand what the union is asking for. We understand what the governor is asking for, and it’s put on the lap of the legislative body to figure out what’s the right thing to meet the state goals, continue to have adequate employment certainty. And so it’s a tough situation. But I can say that’s not a fight that we are involved in. And we are very dependent on the support for our power plants to be maintained by our union partners, building trades in the IDW. They are very aware of the dire situation for the nuclear plants. So, I don’t think that their dedication to saving the jobs at these plants are in question. They have some other priorities and other constituents within their organizations that are dealing with issues. So, I would just leave it at that.
Steve Fleishman: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And the next question will be from [Technical Difficulty] JPMorgan. Please ask your question.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi. Good morning.
Chris Crane: Good morning.
Unidentified Analyst: Just wanted to turn to the storm offset for a second here, the $600 million-ish that you were targeting here from – to offset the rate, just wondering if you could help update us as far as how that’s progressing, where you see yourself versus what you are targeting and how much is left to do at this point?
Joe Nigro: Yes. Good morning. So, we did achieve more in the second quarter than when we had done our planning originally in Q1. What we would have expected to achieve, we expected most of the share [Technical Difficulty]. We have achieved somewhere between 20% and 25% of the offsets that we expected. And we said they would come in a number of areas, when you look at deferral of cost and one-time cost savings opportunities, whether it’s things like contracting dollars, holding labor vacancies, reductions in travel and entertainment expense, deferring non-critical maintenance capital, those types of things. There were some revenue opportunities when you see the improvement in treasuries. We talked about our technology ventures investments. So, we are ahead of what we expected to do at this point in the year. And we are continuing to work hard on delivering the balance of what we committed to.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. That’s very helpful there. And then turning towards the utility business as a whole here, given the potential moving pieces at ComEd and then some positive outcomes, it seems like with Maryland and DC with the multiyear plans, better outlooks in those jurisdictions. How should we think about both the trajectory of utility earned ROEs? And how this might impact the 6% to 8% utility growth rate that you guys see?
Calvin Butler: This is Calvin. I would just sit back and tell you that we are very confident in achieving the stated financial performance for each of our utilities and to your reference on the multiyear plans that have gone taking place in Maryland and in DC and Joe outlined in terms of the rate cases across our business. It goes to show you the partnership that we have established with our jurisdictions and understanding what their needs are and how our investments are meeting those goals. We are committed to $6.6 billion annual investments in capital and recovery of real-time on that capital. And the alternative ratemaking that has been taking place across those utilities indicate that we are recovering and returning on that capital in real time. If you think about the jurisdictions in which we operate, they have typically been some of the more difficult across the country. And we are changing that landscape. So, I am very proud of the team across each of the utilities and really building that partnership and showing that we understand the needs, and we are meeting those objectives.
Chris Crane: Joe want...
Joe Nigro: Yes, I would just add one thing on top of what Calvin said, which I thought he did a very comprehensive job should be – as you know, we target 9% to 10% ROEs in all of our utilities. And this quarter, you saw us jump 50 basis points back across the composite to 9.4% and that factors into our 6% to 8% projection.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it, that’s very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: The next question will be from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Go ahead please.
Michael Lapides: Hi guys. Couple of ExGen questions, first of all, the offsets or the O&M savings you are trying to realize this year to help offset the winter storm Uri year impact. How much of that do you think will remain in place as we go out into 2022 or 2023 or should we assume there was a sizable step back up in O&M in those years?
Joe Nigro: Yes. I think what we have said is a lot of that is one-time in nature. When you think about deferring some things that you, ultimately, need to get done. I talked about things like labor vacancies and contracting, travel and entertainment. At this point, a lot of that is one-time in nature. But what I would add to that is, as you know, Michael, we have done a good job across the enterprise and as well as at ExGen in really driving efficiency cost here in the last 5 years or 6 years. And we continue to look at new ways to do that, whether it’s leverage in technology or the scale of our business when you look at our supply organization doing a nice job in that area. And we will continue to challenge ourselves. But some of these costs specifically are going to be one-time in the nature.
Chris Crane: Yes. I can tell you that each cost as we bring it back in, in 2022 will be scrutinized against what is the new workplace of the future, what’s the productivity we are able to achieve with these reductions. It is not a healthy recipe to forgo capital maintenance or required O&M maintenance and let the systems decay. So, you can buy yourself some time on some of those decisions. But at the end of the day, reliability on the system is critical and we will watch that. But there are other areas that there is teams working on reentry, looking at staffing needs as we go through the design of the organizations. As we look at the split, there are savings that we are not ready to announce yet, but that will be coming into play in each one of the companies in the design of the future state of two entities, strong entities working on their own.
Michael Lapides: Meaning when you think about the two entities as separate entities, we should think that there are costs – I don’t want to call them synergy, but there are cost opportunities as separate entities versus maybe having dissynergies on the cost side?
Chris Crane: Yes, that – what you focus on at the start is making sure you attack the synergies. And that’s what we are doing. And then from there, when you are attacking the dissynergies, it will expose potential business ships and how we perform. So, we are working through that Bridget Reidy, our Chief Operating Officer of Corporate is leading. A lot of that as long as – along with our project management team that is daily following each one of the designs, staffing, expenses and will continue to report out to the senior team on where we are at on obtaining. The first goal is to try to minimize, neutralize, do away with any dissynergies. And then from there, what new efficiencies can we drive into the business.
Michael Lapides: Got it. And one last one just on Byron and Dresden, is there a scenario where you could push out the refueling outages until next year, meaning early next year and keep them afloat or keep them operating through the end of this year or is that kind of physically or for safety reasons impossible to do?
Chris Crane: What happens at the end of cycle, which we are heading towards on these plants, your fuel becomes less and less effective and the term is coast down. And so you start power out of the reactor – thermal megawatts out of the reactor is reduced, which compounds to the electric megawatts produced. And so you get to a point that you are running within months or so period. You are running inefficient steam paths and inefficient operations. So, you make the call as to start and to shut the facility down. The one thing to reiterate in shutting down a nuclear plant, it is – the goal is you shutdown, you cool down, you disassemble the reactor, you offload all of the fuel into the spent fuel pool and you relinquish the license to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and there is no path back from that. There is no regulatory path back. And so what we do is start into the phases of the chosen decommissioning trust fund and it comes out of our expense column. It’s in the prefunded category of the decommissioning trust. So, it’s irreversible. And running a year is physically impossible. Running an extra month is very challenging on the steep supply system and maintaining adequate controls on the physics.
Michael Lapides: Got it. Thank you, Chris.
Operator: That concludes the Q&A session. And I will turn it back to Chris Crane.
Chris Crane: I want to thank everybody for the time this morning for joining the call. We are working hard to run the businesses at best-in-class levels and taking the necessary steps to set up two strong independent companies. There is quite a focus on both of those goals, and we will continue to update you as we go along. We appreciate your support. And with that, I will close the call out.
Operator: Thanks to all our participants for joining us today. This concludes our presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-05-05 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to Exelon's First Quarter Earnings Call. My name is Amanda, and I'll be your event specialist today. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. Please note, today’s conference is being recorded. During the presentation, we will have a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn today's program over to Dan Eggers, Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance. The floor is yours.
Dan Eggers : Thank you, Amanda. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. Leading the call today are Chris Crane, Exelon's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Joe Nigro, Exelon's Chief Financial Officer. They're joined by other members of Exelon's management team who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. We issued our earnings release this morning along with the presentation. All of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of Exelon's website. The earnings release and other matters which we discuss during today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today's material and comments made during this call. Please refer to today's 8-K and Exelon's other SEC filings for discussions of risk factors and other factors, including uncertainties surrounding the planned separation, that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts and expectations. Today's presentation also includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for reconciliations between the non-GAAP measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures. I'll now turn the call over to Chris Crane, Exelon's CEO.
Chris Crane: Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us. As you've seen from our earlier releases and notifications, we had mixed results in the first quarter. We performed well across our businesses outside of the challenges from 5 days in February due to the Texas weather event. Overall, our first quarter GAAP loss was $0.30 per share and our non-GAAP loss was $0.06 per share. Exelon Utilities performed well operationally and financially during the quarter, delivering $0.72 per share, which is $0.11 better than the first quarter last year. At ExGen, we lost $0.58 per share overall, with the February weather event cost a $0.90 in the first quarter. The event was unprecedented. We continue to investigate the multiple complex factors that led to our plant outages. And we are working with ERCOT regulators and other stakeholders to ensure an event like this does not happen again. As you saw in our 8-K last week, we updated our full year losses at $150 million due to the updated load meter data in ERCOT default payments that differed from our original estimate. In addition, we reaffirmed our full year guidance of $2.60 to $3 per share. We continue to work on mitigating this approximately $1 billion loss, and expect to offset the loss by $410 million to $490 million after taxes through a combination of mostly onetime cost reductions and deferral of nonessential maintenance and revenue opportunities. Joe is going to go in much more detail on that in his presentation. Turning to the operations. Despite the extreme cold winters, and the winter storms, the pandemic conditions, our utilities had a strong operational performance, delivering reliability, affordable electricity and gas for our consumers. All the utilities achieved first quartile operating performance in outage duration and frequency. BGE, ComEd and PHI were in top decile in outage duration. Customer operations metrics remained strong across the utilities. PECO and BGE's customer satisfaction levels were top decile. ComEd was top quartile. And PHI just missed top quartile, but improved year-over-year. On the generation front, in the face of extreme temperatures, winter storms, our nuclear plants provided 37 terawatt hours of reliable, resilient and clean to the grid of the citizens of Illinois, Pennsylvania, New York and Maryland. The fleet capacity factor of 95.3% was what we reached for the quarter. The spring has been active -- switching to policy. The spring has been active on the policy front with momentum building at both federal and state levels for policies that recognize the value of existing nuclear and would put the country on a path to a net 0 future. Both ExGen and the Utilities are well positioned to benefit from these policies and the transition to a clean energy economy. On the federal level, the Biden administration has set out an ambitious goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50% to 52% by 2030. Nuclear provides more than half of the carbon-free emission electricity in the U.S., with Exelon plants providing 12% of all the carbon-free energy in the United States. The administration is clear that preserving the existing nuclear fleet is key in meeting the goals that they have set. The administration's infrastructure proposal, the American Jobs Plan, would enact policies to help reach the goal. It includes a clean electricity standard that would require 100% clean electricity by 2035, with existing nuclear qualifying as clean; incentives to build 500,000 EV charging stations by 2030; and for 20 gigawatts of high-voltage transmission lines to be built to support the renewable build-out. We're encouraged that the administration and members of Congress recognize the importance of preserving the nuclear fleet to meet the country's clean energy and climate goals. The timing in the outcome of federal legislation is highly uncertain. And in any case, it will be too late to reverse the retirement decisions for Byron and Dresden. Our states are also advancing clean energy policies. In Illinois, six energy policy reform bills have been introduced that would drive the transition to clean energy and address climate change. The legislative leaders are meeting to craft a package from the various bills that can be considered this session. We're encouraged by the expression of support that continued -- for the continued operation of the nuclear plants. However, the details really matter. A bill needs to pass before the end of the regular session, and it needs to provide adequate support for continuing to invest in the Illinois fleet. Current market prices do not continue to meet -- do not allow us to continue to meet our payroll, paying our property taxes, and covering other significant costs and risks of operating these assets. Without adequate policy, as I've stated, to you that we will retire uneconomic plants beginning this fall. If you take a look at what happened in New Jersey last week, the Board concluded that the financial challenges faced by nuclear plants there justified a maximum ZEC of $10 per megawatt hour. The same voices that are arguing in Illinois that our plants are profitable were overruled in New Jersey's decision. The commission in New Jersey emphasized that maintaining the existing nuclear plants was critical to achieving the state's emission goals and -- significantly less costly than replacing nuclear with other 0 free carbon generation. This is true in Illinois. Keeping the nuclear plants running is better option for the customers than trying to replace them with all renewables in storage. At 12 times the cost, higher cost than preserving the nuclear plants, it would cost the Illinois consumers over $80 billion more to achieve the same emissions. We've been advocating for policy changes in Illinois for more than two years because I feel that we have a duty to our customers to preserve every opportunity to correct flawed policies and keep these critical energy resources running. But we're almost out of time, and we'll prematurely retire these assets in the fall if the policy reforms are not passed in this session. Turning to clean energy policy in Pennsylvania. The Senate is moving forward on a bill that would set a state goal for transportation, electrification and authorized electric utilities to develop EV infrastructure and plans authorize a recovery for these investments. We support these federal and state policy efforts and stand ready to enable this important transition to a clean energy future. Joe will talk about what our utilities are doing currently on EVs. Moving on to the separation update. Our team is working to get the separation done. We filed our applications for regulatory approval at FERC, the NRC, New York Public Service Commission in February. The NRC has indicated that our application is complete, and they expect to rule by November 30. In New York, comments are due on May 24. And we requested that the commission rule no later than their December 16 meeting. We're on track to get the necessary approvals so that we can close in the first quarter of next year. With that, I'll turn it over to Joe to go into the financial details.
Joe Nigro: Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover our first quarter results, quarterly financial updates and our hedge disclosures. Turning first to Slide 9. As Chris mentioned, we recorded a loss of $0.06 per share on a non-GAAP basis for the first quarter, driven by the losses from the February weather event. Our utilities performed ahead of plan for the quarter, delivering a combined $0.72 per share this year, which was $0.11 per share higher than the first quarter of 2020. This was primarily driven by strong operational performance as well as the impacts of distribution rate cases. ExGen reported a loss of $0.58 per share for the quarter. Excluding the 5-day weather event in February, ExGen would have earned $0.32 per share as we had anticipated. However, specific to the weather event, we incurred a loss in the first quarter of $0.90 per share. A portion of this loss is due to some penalties or charges associated with our natural gas business, that we ultimately expect to be reduced through waivers and/or recovered from customers later in this year. As we disclosed in our 8-K last week, we estimate our full year loss from the weather event to be approximately $900 million to $1.1 billion pretax or $670 million to $820 million after tax. We also continue to expect to offset between $550 million and $650 million pretax or $410 million and $490 million after tax for the full year 2021. These offsets will occur primarily at ExGen through a combination of enhanced revenue opportunities, deferral of selected nonessential maintenance and primarily onetime cost savings, and are mostly expected in the second half of this year. Holdco recorded a loss of $0.20 per share for the quarter, which was a larger loss than is typical in the first quarter and was driven by a tax adjustment required by GAAP to partially offset the tax benefit recorded at ExGen due to the Texas losses. This amount will reverse over the next three quarters, and ultimately will not have an impact on full year results. As Chris stated, we are reaffirming our guidance range of $2.60 a share to $3 per share, and you can see the details on Slide 16 in the appendix. Moving on to Slide 10. Looking at our utility returns on a consolidated basis, our trailing 12-month ROE as of the first quarter has improved to 8.9% from 8.7% last quarter. The 20 basis point increase was primarily due to higher earnings across the operating companies in the first quarter. As a reminder, the calculation is backward-looking. So you should continue to see some pressure on ROEs over the next couple of quarters as we work off the impacts of COVID-19, low interest rates at ComEd and the 2020 storms. We do expect to be in our targeted range of 9% to 10% by year-end. And looking into the future, we remain focused on delivering strong earned returns at the Utilities in supporting our growth targets. Turning to the next Slide 11. Since the last call, there were some important developments on the regulatory front. First, on March 30, PECO filed an electric distribution case with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission. PECO is seeking a revenue increase of $246 million for continued investments in electric distribution infrastructure, which will make the local energy grid stronger and more resilient, enhance service, and help the company deliver safe, reliable and clean energy for consumers. In addition, the filing proposes customer relief offerings for eligible residential and small business customers, and we expect an order in December of this year. Second, ComEd filed its annual distribution formula rate update with the Illinois Commerce Commission on April 16, seeking a $51 million increase to electric distribution base rates. This year's formula rate update file in March ComEd's first request for a distribution rate increase in 4 years. The filing will support investments to expand access to clean energy through private and community solar and support the growing demand for electric vehicles. Additionally, we continue to make investments and make the power grid more resilient to severe storms, such as those experienced in Northern Illinois last year. We expect to receive an order by early December. We also have several rate cases still in progress, including orders in multiyear plans for Pepco D.C and Pepco Maryland, which are expected in the second quarter. We continue to have constructive regulatory relationships across our jurisdictions, and are working with our regulators, states and communities to support their clean energy and climate goals. More details on our rate cases can be found on Slides 20 through 28 of the appendix. Slide 12 provides one example of how Exelon Utilities are working with our regulators and states to make investments that will address the climate crisis and help our customers. Our utilities pay -- play a critical role advancing electric vehicles in our communities. This includes both the installation of publicly available charging stations and investment in the system to support this infrastructure. Exelon Utilities have been leaders in this rapidly growing space by expanding charging infrastructure, offering rebates and incentives and innovative rates, while electrifying public transportation to deliver convenient, affordable and equally accessible clean transportation options. Our clean electric transportation programs aim to support nearly 100,000 current electric vehicle drivers across our service territories, aligned with state climate goals, and improve overall air quality for all our customers and communities. To date, electric vehicle programs have been approved in Maryland, D.C., Delaware and New Jersey, with approval pending in Pennsylvania, as part of PECO's recent rate case filing. ComEd also has several ongoing educational and outreach initiatives. And several of the bills Chris spoke about would provide incentives for EV infrastructure. The transportation sector currently represents about 1/3 of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Urban areas, like many of our service territories, are disproportionately affected by air pollution and the negative effects of climate change. One way we aim to help address this is by advocating for and helping to usher in cleaner, zero emission transportation particularly in underserved communities. Our programs are designed to reduce common barriers to electric vehicle adoption, including range anxiety, total cost of vehicle ownership and lack of education and awareness among consumers. Cleaner vehicles on the road help our cities and states meet their environmental goals, reduce their carbon footprint, bring cleaner air to communities, and create economic opportunity through job creation and reduced energy costs. Additionally, Exelon's utilities are leading by example in setting an aggressive goal to electrify our fleet, including both light and heavy-duty vehicles. We have committed to electrify 30% of our fleet by 2025 and 50% by 2030.  Electrifying 50% of the fleet could avoid more than 65,000 metric tons of emissions cumulatively from 2020 to 2030. That's the equivalent to the carbon removed by 1 million trees planted and grown for 10 years. On Slide 13, we provide a gross margin update. For 2021, total gross margin is down $150 million versus the fourth quarter call, due to the increase in the estimated impact of the February weather event. The midpoint of our current estimate of the gross margin impact from this event is $950 million. This number is lower than the midpoint of our loss range of $1 billion because it does not include bad debt, which is captured in O&M. Excluding the impacts of the February weather event, gross margin is flat to last quarter. Open gross margin is up $300 million relative to our prior disclosure, primarily due to higher prices in NI Hub and West Hub. Our mark-to-market of hedges were down $200 million due to our hedge position, offsetting the increase in open gross margin partially offset by the execution of $100 million of power new business. We also executed $50 million in non-power new business during the quarter. Thank you. And I will now turn back the call to Chris for his closing remarks.
Chris Crane: Thanks, Joe. Turning to Slide 14. I'll close on our priorities and commitments. We will deliver or exceed our financial commitments, delivering earnings within our guidance range and to maintain strong balance sheet. We will complete preparations to separate the businesses, including the regulatory approvals. At Exelon Utilities, we will prudently and effectively deploy nearly $6.6 billion of capital to benefit our customers and help meet the needs of our states energy policy goals. We'll work with our regulators to ensure timely recovery on these investments. We'll continue to advocate for clean energy and climate policies with the new administration, Congress and our states to put our country on the path to meeting our carbon reduction goals. And we'll continue to partner with the support of our customers and our communities that we serve. So thank you all for joining us. And with that, we'll open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.
Stephen Byrd: I wanted to just get your latest thoughts on ERCOT and market design. We've certainly seen a lot of activity. And you all gave some prepared remarks on that. But just curious, it strikes me it looks like it's a little less likely that the state may go in the direction of sort of fixed resiliency or capacity light payments. But just curious what you're sort of seeing and what direction you think we may take in terms of market design.
Chris Crane: Yes. Let me have Kathleen cover that.
Kathleen Barron: Yes. I think there are a number of ideas under discussion in the legislature. And I guess I wouldn't say that it's less likely that the state will ultimately choose to go down the path of setting a reliability standard. That idea does have some support and is being discussed openly, as are other changes, for example, to the ORDC curve to sort of lengthen it and lower the cap. And then there are other ideas out there as well. So I think there's active discussion in both the House and the Senate over whether and when the legislature should act. There are some who think it should move forward and set some expectations and let the PUCT work on a market design over the balance of the year, whereas others are thinking maybe they'll wait and do it later in the year. So it's a little bit early to tell how those conversations are going to land. But I think the concept of setting as all the other markets do, a reliability standard and letting the market operator design a market-based way to get there is still under active discussion.
Stephen Byrd: That's really helpful. And then maybe going to PJM and FERC. And we've seen a lot of activity around the treatment of MOPR. And just curious there as well your latest thinking on sort of where we may be headed and kind of broader implications, given it looks like we may see a reversal.
Kathleen Barron: Yes. There are sort of two avenues where that's being discussed. First, at the RTOs themselves. And as you know, PJM has a stakeholder process to work through. How to reform MOPR, they have direction from their board that they should reform it. But the question is how, and they've laid out a proposal, and they'll be taking comments and working towards the FERC filing in the summer to express their view of how it should be reformed. And then, ultimately, of course, it will be up to FERC. You have two commissioners who are open that they think MOPR should be reformed. The other three, less transparent in terms of how they would vote. So I think there's certainly going to be an effort on PJM's part to make a change. And then the question will be how the votes line up at the commission once that filing is made.
Operator: And your next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.
Steve Fleishman: So a couple of questions, I guess, focused on the nuclear. So first, in Illinois, I know there's been several proposals. The most recent, I think, was from the governor, related also to the audit that he set up. Could you give your views on whether that proposal would be sufficient to keep the Dresden and Byron open?
Chris Crane: Yes. I mean all of you have written on the economics of the plant and the reality of what the bill is starting at. I think it's -- from what we've heard, it's open a negotiation. But just going from the Street analyst opinion and what we've seen, its starting point is not adequate to keep the plants continued operations going.
Steve Fleishman: Okay. And then just to be clear on Illinois, in the event that maybe they just can't get a build on this session, and they try to go to the veto session. Obviously, you're targeting to shut the plants before then. So can you just confirm clearly whether, if they just don't get something done this session, the plants will shut, Dresden and Byron?
Chris Crane: Yes. Sure. We've been real clear about that, but we're still optimistic. Most state or legislative bodies, the work comes to an end towards the end of the session. There's a lot of stakeholders involved here. There's a lot of voices that are inputting into it. And the legislature has a tough job of building a single bill out of six suggested bills and making sure that they take care of their constituents as well as all of the other stakeholders involved in the process. So we're not giving up. We're confident that we've got adequate support within the administration and within the legislature, and we'll see how it goes. That said, we have been clear for a couple of years. And it's just the reality we cannot continue to run uneconomic plants and challenge the balance sheets of the genco or the holdco. We've got commitments. As I said earlier, we're going to make payroll. We've got to pay pensions. We got to pay our bills. We have to have an investment grade credit rating that we can access capital markets. And when you have plants that are uneconomic and pulling you down, it's a tough decision, but it's one that we've made. And we'll continue to be optimistic that we can work with the stakeholders and the legislative body and the administration. But short of getting something done, we'll have to start to proceed what we are already doing the planning proceed for the shutdown. You can't order fuel. You can't do capital improvement. You can't do a lot of stuff in the face of uncertainty, which causes you to spend hundreds of millions to billions of dollars on plants that just aren't going to support themselves.
Steve Fleishman: Okay. One final question on nuclear. Just the -- there was a story, I think, in -- on Bloomberg this morning, talking about a nuclear EPP being discussed in the Biden -- with the Biden administration and legislators. Could you talk about what you're hearing on that and whether we're seeing momentum in that as part of the Biden infrastructure plan?
Kathleen Barron: Steve, this is Kathleen. I can take that one. As Chris mentioned, the Biden proposal is for a clean energy standard. That's inclusive of existing nuclear and is technology neutral. That is what their proposal is. That's on the table. We saw the story this morning as well. But of course, their plan does not currently include a PTC for existing nuclear nor -- for existing nuclear nor has one been introduced in either chamber. So it's obviously helpful that there is a growing focus on the fact that the existing nuclear fleet is integral to getting to any of the carbon targets that has been set. And we welcome that sort of change in focus and a growing understanding. But the challenge remains that we're not yet even to the point where we know, is Congress going to move forward on a bipartisan basis? Does a bill need to be drafted that would be consistent with reconciliation? And the timing and the outcome is just far too uncertain for us to make any decisions here based on that. Obviously, to the extent something happens in Congress, that's a long-term positive for the company. But just one Reuters story is not enough to -- we have to make decisions based on current economics and current policy.
Operator: And your next question comes from James Thalacker with BMO Capital Markets.
James Thalacker: I just want to touch briefly on the governor's legislative proposal. And I guess his proposal for an application of an $8 a ton carbon mechanism. I know it's early. And as you -- but as you think about the final market structure and the - a pretty clean generation stack in Illinois already, how do you see the pass-through of this potential tax on power prices? In New York, you've seen about a 35% -- 25% to 35% pass-through, but it's not clear to me how you can sort of tax on the state supply from Wisconsin and Illinois. So where do you guys kind of see the potential uplift in power prices in its early stages, understanding the final market structure is yet to be determined?
Chris Crane: It's a difficult -- I'm going to let Kathleen get into the technical details. But it's difficult for a single state that is an island surrounded by other states without the same policy not to have leakage coming in. So as we pointed out, if we shut down those four reactors that we're talking about, they will be replaced by leakage, the energy coming in. So we will go backwards in that area. How you monitor that and how you tax on it is a very difficult thing in an island. Kathleen, I don't know if you want to go into more technical.
Kathleen Barron: I think you covered it. I mean I think the issue is when you have a national carbon price, you would see a high pass-through rate given the amount of fossil that's still in the stack. But when it's a single state, it's just -- our estimates are that there would be a very small impact on carbon energy prices due to out-of-state plants running more frequently.
James Thalacker: Okay. Great. And I just wanted to see if you could kind of give me a quick update on the outage with the cell plant and what's your outlook for the cost and the timing for its return.
Chris Crane: Brian Hansen, he's our COO of generation. You want to cover that?
Brian Hansen: Yes. Thanks, James. Yes, the LaSalle Unit 2 reactor was out of service for an extra 34days when we found through maintenance activities higher than expected deterioration of 2,000 reactor recirculation system. And because of the size and location of these valves, we had to design and deploy special welding and machining tools to make the necessary repairs which were required prior to returning that unit to service. It involves several hundred people given the difficulty of that work. That unit has since been returned to service. The cost was a significant impact for that particular plant. And these types of risks are the kinds of things that we have to take into account when we are assessing the financial viability of each of those plants. But that unit has been returned to service and ready for a summer run.
Operator: And your next question comes from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim.
Shahriar Pourreza: Chris, Joe, have you had any conversations with the agencies kind of about the SpinCo since the fallout we saw in Texas? Just trying to get a bit of a sense if this is more of a structural risk going forward as we're thinking about sort of the general business model for the IPPs or just kind of an anomalistic situation. I mean, especially as we're sort of thinking about the standalone ExGen entity and maintaining IG ratings post spin. And obviously, we understand that the metrics are extremely healthy. But I'm just kind of curious how they're thinking about the business -- maybe a little bit more qualitative factors post the weather event. I just have a follow-up.
Joe Nigro: Yes. Sure. As you could imagine, we've had numerous contacts with the agencies since the event in February. And you saw, after the announcement on our fourth quarter call of separation, they -- that Moody's and S&P published some preliminary thoughts on both generation and on the RemainCo or Exelon. On the 29th of April, S&P came out and updated some commentary on ExGen and affirm their investment-grade rating and the stable outlook. And it's important to note that they've also delinked them from the corporation effectively from the standpoint of the fact that we have announced separation. So we continue to have dialogue with each of the agencies. All three of them have generation rated investment grade currently. And we continue to expect that to happen in the future as we manage our business.
Chris Crane: A key to that is managing the business and managing the risk and understanding the risk. It was an unprecedented weather event that was beyond potentially the design basis of the plants. And we have to take that into consideration as we look at our risk profile going forward. We will not continue to weather risk like that that could challenge the balance sheet and the investment-grade ratings.
Shahriar Pourreza: Got it. And then just lastly, there's been some noise building on the Chicago franchise agreement. Is there sort of a path forward there? Any sense on time line? Anything on expectations you can share? I mean I just were curious if this is going to turn into a San Diego situation or not.
Chris Crane: Joe Dominguez, we'll let cover that. I believe he's on.
Joe Dominguez: Yes. First of all, Chicago is a world-class city, and we're privileged to serve it. And we want to continue that relationship. And we've been working with the city for some time on terms for a new franchise agreement. As you know, the franchise agreement continues until a new one is approved or until a new franchise -- or franchisee is selected. They are going to explore all their options. And I think they are going to follow a blueprint like San Diego used to solicit ideas. We have an RFI that's been issued. We'll participate in that RFI. We'll see if others do. And we'll see what ideas come out of that process. That's expected to close on May 28. In the meantime, we are continuing with the discussions around the new franchise agreement. And we're pretty confident that ComEd is going to be successful at the end. We have a lot to offer. We're leaning in on the city's priorities around energy efficiency, jobs, support for low-income families, clean and renewable energy and more. I think the most important thing for the city, and they've been very clear about this, is making the study reliable and resilient against some of the storms. We have talked on these calls about some of the storms we've experienced. We added ratio in August, where we had 110-mile per hour hurricane in-forced wins across our service territory. 15 tornadoes landed. It was the second most expensive storm in the U.S. this year. And unfortunately, that event has not been an anomaly. We saw unprecedented flooding coming off the lake in the summer. And just maybe 12 months earlier, we saw polar vortex that brought with it negative 30-degree weather. So the city, I think, is rightfully concerned about the changing weather from the climate crisis. And notwithstanding these weather events, Chris reviewed earlier some of our performance. We're not only top decile in SFI and Katy, but I think, best-in-class in both categories, first time for this company to achieve that. And we've been able to make the investments, keep residential rates low and so on. So I think we're doing what we need to do. We're investing philanthropically in the city. And I think it's important to note. I think we all know this, that serving cities alone is a pretty expensive proposition. The infrastructure is expensive doing any work in the city is expensive just because of the density of a existing infrastructure. You tend to have more of a concentration of low-income customers in the city for a variety of reasons. It's more expensive. When the city is part of a broader Chicago system, and the city accounts for about 1/3 of ComEd, we have the ability to use the horsepower and the talent not only within ComEd, but the Exelon family of companies to come in, repair the system when it's damaged as a result of weather. But also, we have the financial wherewithal of the industry and the businesses and the people that live outside of Chicago in the suburbs to cover some of the costs for the cities more economically challenged citizens. So we think the whole package is going to be valuable. You mentioned the San Diego process. We've followed that for some time. I don't think there was, at the end of the day, anyone who actually competed for the franchise there. But it is a process. And it's a transparent process that we need to go through, and we appreciate that. And in the meantime, as I said, we're going to lean into it. If the city decides to go into in a different direction, they would have the pay ComEd upwards of $7 billion for the system, depending on the timing of the transaction. And because these systems were built in an interconnected way, we anticipate that there would be about $5 billion or more in separation costs that would take upwards of a decade to complete new substations, control centers computer platforms alike. So this is going to be a long road if the city goes in that direction. We understand this move within the fabric of the negotiations that we've been having with the city. And I'm confident that the proposal we're going to offer is going to allow us to continue this long-standing relationship. And we will be very fortunate to be able to continue to serve this great city.
Operator: And your next question comes from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse.
Michael Weinstein: On electric vehicle charging infrastructure. This is still pretty early days, I understand that. But is there -- at what point does this become a significant portion of CapEx opportunity? What do you think that opportunity is? And when do you think it really starts to kick in?
Calvin Butler: Michael, this is Calvin. I would say we continue to look at EV infrastructure and partner with all of our jurisdictions on how we go about it. And Chris, I think it was no Joe outlined in detail what we're doing in each of our jurisdictions in terms of EV adoption, charging infrastructure and the like. Right now, it is not a significant piece of our capital plan. Chris alluded to the $6.6 billion that we will execute this year, and it's just scratching the surface. But at the end of the day, it is part of our business priorities moving forward. As you laid out 50% of our fleet will be electrified internally by 2030. And we continue to look at working with each of our jurisdictions to encourage them in that way in investing in infrastructure. So the bottom line is that it's a small portion of our total capital investment, but it is on our plan to continue to grow.
Chris Crane: The infrastructure investment beyond the EV charging stations is something that our engineering units are working on between EV and distributed generation, upgrading lines, changing voltage levels that gets into a lot more complicated, but it's a bigger part of the investment.
Michael Weinstein: Yes. That's what I was thinking of. Is there a tipping point or a point where the curve starts to really kick in gear? And what year do you think that approximately happens? And is this a 2030s type opportunity or more of a maybe late 2020s?
Chris Crane: Yes. It's something we're working on now more for the distributed generation. There's analysis that goes into the circuits to make sure that we're not overloading them. And we're upgrading them as we see the demand go up. And so I think we're investing now a tipping point, I think it's going to be a gradual investment over a 10-year-plus period. It's not going to all of a sudden hit immediately one day. And I'll give you an example. Philadelphia Electric and BGE are upgrading their voltages on their distribution systems from 41.60 to 13.8 in anticipation of more distributed generation, but that will also support EV. So it gives us more capacity on the circuits to allow the customers to get the services they want.
Michael Weinstein: Got you. Just one last question. On the New York Public Service Commission filing for separation, is there any reason why you think it might take longer than the end of the year to get an approval there?
Kathleen Barron: This is Kathleen, Michael. I can take that. I mean we haven't even seen comments yet on the New York application. They were due at the end of the month. We had to ask for action by the end of the year, and we think the agency is capable of acting in that period. But of course, we need to see what the comments are. And we'll have a better sense once we do. We have targeted close in the first quarter of next year. So if we need a little bit extra time, whether in the New York case or at the NRC, we have accounted for that. But again, we think that acting by the end of the year is doable in New York.
Operator: And our final question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.
Michael Lapides: Two questions for you, actually unrelated. One, some of the potential draft Illinois legislative approaches have pretty decent changes to how Commonwealth Edison's ratemaking process would work. Could you just give an update on what you think put and takes are. What are the thing that are actually the benefit to ComEd's earnings power? What are the things in there that could be a headwind if implemented to ComEd's earnings?
Chris Crane: Joe, Dominguez, do you want to cover that?
Joe Dominguez: Yes. There's a lot of different proposals at this point, Michael. I think the common thread in all of them is that we would come out of the formula rate. And so -- as you know, the formula rate historically for the last 10 years, really throughout the entirety of EMA, has produced an ROE that is significantly lower than the national average. And that's resulted in billions of dollars of savings for our customers over that period of time. As we emerge from the formula and we come to a more normalized ROE, there will be an opportunity for expanded earnings at ComEd. At the same time, one of the things we very much liked about the formula is our ability to plan work for years in advance. We don't -- as you well know, we don't do radically different things year-to-year. We kind of continue to invest in poles, wires, smart devices, those sorts of things over the course of years. And the formula had given us some certainty that we were going to be able to continue those investments, and that allowed us to kind of make arrangements with our vendors so that we could maximize efficiencies there, both from a supply standpoint as well as from a labor standpoint. So one of the things I worry about coming out of the formula is that planning process. Are we going to continue to see volatility from rate case to rate case? So some of the ideas that have been proposed are aimed at looking at a longer-term transparent investment direction coming out of the company and being reviewed by the commission. For example, the labor proposals would have us produce reports every four years, showing all the investments that we're going to make. And it would give stakeholders an opportunity to take a look at that. We wouldn't necessarily get an approval from that. But it would give people a good understanding of what we're trying to do, what we're trying to invest in the system as we integrate renewables and build on the resilience of the system. So that would be, I think, helpful, so that we have some clarity in the process about where we're going next. It's clear to me that to continue the level of reliability that we've been able to attain and meet the challenge of these storms, integrate renewables, integrate fleets of electric cars, trucks and buses, we're going to need to continue to invest in the system the way we have been investing in those technologies. The formula gave us a clearer path for doing that. And one of the concerns I have about just returning to traditional ratemaking is we don't have that year-over-year clarity. And you could get the volatility and rate outcomes, and that turns into volatility in terms of your workforce volatility in terms of your suppliers and the loss of efficiency there. So I think those are the puts and takes, at least as I see the legislation right now. And I think as Chris said, the policymakers have been meeting routinely on that. And I think those are the issues they're worried about as well.
Michael Lapides: Got it. And then one quick follow-up, unrelated, on taxes. You can't necessarily rely on ERCOT or the PUCT to act quickly and make market design changes. Often, they've been very reticent to do so. Is there anything you're thinking about doing, either from a contracting standpoint or something physical at the plant, aka maybe backup generation on site with storage tanks or something like that to forestall potential risk like what just played out happening in the future?
Chris Crane: Right now, the design of ERCOT does not compensate for reliability, availability. It's a pure energy market only. We would have to take into consideration, as ERCOT and the commission continues to deliberate on what the design could be is what we could afford to invest into those plants for that resiliency. In PJM, it's a very resilient market. We're compensated. And we're penalized if we don't produce. That is not the structure that ERCOT has taken in the past. And so it leaves the generators competing against significant amounts of wind suppressing the prices during the shoulder months, especially. And then you have to look at your return on capital to make the investments for that. So going to a dual fuel, going to a different design basis for temperatures can be an expensive proposition. And if you're not getting rewarded for that and the market doesn't prioritize that, it would be difficult to do.
Michael Lapides: Got it. Okay. I was just thinking, is it materially expensive to add things like fuel oil tanks to some of the gas plants that could store a couple of days for use in emergency only? Is that prohibitively expensive relative, I guess, if I were to compare it to what just happened?
Chris Crane: No. It is expensive, but it's more complicated than just having oil on site. The plants have designed for temperatures and we’re starting to see those temperatures expand in the variants. And so you have to do more than just put oil tanks on in dual fire, make the modifications on the firing jets, in the turbines -- excuse me, in the generators. And so you would -- it is much more complicated than just a couple of oil tanks to make sure that the resiliency is there. And then you've got to make sure that you're being compensated, like PJM does, for those investments. And we stand up. We made those investments in PJM. And we also know that we'll be penalized if we don't produce in PJM. So if and when ERCOT decides that availability and reliability of the fleet is a priority, which thus far, they have not, we would be able to participate in that market and make whatever modifications make economic sense to weather the storm. Pretty good cliche there.
Chris Crane: Okay. Thanks, everybody, for joining the call today. I hope you all stay and your families stay safe and healthy. And with that, I'll close out the call.
Operator: That does conclude today's call. You may now disconnect. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-02-24 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Exelon Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference may be recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to one of our speakers today, Dan Eggers, Senior Vice President, Corporate Finance. Sir, please go ahead.
Dan Eggers: Thank you, Michelle. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining our fourth quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Leading the call today are; Chris Crane, Exelon's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Joe Nigro, Exelon's Chief Financial Officer. They're joined by other members of Exelon's senior management team will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. We issued our earnings release and separation announcement release this morning along with the presentation, all of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of Exelon's website. The earnings and separation announcement release and other matters which we discuss during today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today's material and comments made during this call. Please refer today's 8-Ks and Exelon's other SEC filings for discussions of risk factors and other factors, including uncertainties surrounding the planned separation that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts and expectations. Today's presentation also includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and our earnings release reconciliations between the non-GAAP measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures. I'll now turn the call over to Chris Crane, Exelon's CEO.
Chris Crane: Thanks, Dan and good morning, everybody. We have a lot to talk about this morning. So Joe and I will then try to go through it and allow adequate time for questions. Some of the stuff we have to talk about is bad on the recent events in Texas, to put some light on that, but we have some great other subjects to talk about our strong performance in 2020, the results there and the future path for our business. I'll start with Texas. The experienced unprecedented sustained cold temperatures, as we know impacted the energy system in the state, along with severely impacting the people who live there. As noted in last week's 8-K, we had operational issues with our plants due to the extreme weather. They only periodically were available when the price is hit and/or maintained at the administrative cap of $9,000. Our preliminary estimate is and this is preliminary, of the impact of this event across our portfolio is $750 million to $950 million pre-tax or $560 million to $710 million post-tax. At this point, the range is wide. It includes our best estimate for load obligations, ancillary charges and bad debt, it will take some time to refine this estimate. The data we normally, comes to us is on a lag from ERCOT with recently PUCT actions that data has been further delayed and continued uncertainty around any future actions the PUCT or others may take. We expect it to provide a better update no later than the first quarter earnings call. This loss is unacceptable to us. We are mitigating it through business updates, including first quarterly favorability, mostly one-time cost reductions and deferral of non-essential maintenance, which Joe will cover in further detail. We have today found updates and offsets that are expected to reduce our net impact to $0.20 per share at the midpoint of our loss estimates, which is reflected in our earnings guidance. These mitigating efforts are expected to reduce the cash impact to $200 million. As you know, last week's events have raised many questions about Texas market design and associated risks. And this has not been a new conversation. It's been one that's been around for a while. And we hope that through this that the proper actions can be taken on the design. As a result, we are evaluating all our options with respect to our ERCOT business. Moving on to good news. Our 2020 operational and financial performance was strong. Our utilities maintained excellent operations not only in the face of the pandemic, but an extremely punishing storm year, derecho was hurricanes and one day we had 13 tornadoes in the ComEd service territory. The power of our utility platform paid off for us this year. The mutual assistance across the fleet helped achieve record restoration speeds for both ComEd and PECO. Each utility delivered excellent reliability, top desk outage frequency and top quartile outage duration. This performance was reflected in our Customer Satisfaction scores with all the utilities receiving their best on record scores in first quartile in customer satisfaction. Strong operations led to constructive regulatory results as we saw in the outcome of three rate cases across our jurisdictions in 2020. In December, The Maryland PSC approved BGE's first ever multi-year plan, enabling investment in reliability, we're expecting orders for multi-year plans at both Pepco DC and Pepco Maryland. This is allowing for timely recovery whilst supporting jobs in the economy in DC and Maryland. Turning to Slide 7, nuclear had another very good year, generating 150 terawatt hours of zero-emitting power, avoiding - $78 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide. The capacity factor was 95.4%, second only to last year's performance in fleet history. The nuclear group completed 12 refueling outages in fewer days planned, despite the rigorous pandemic protections. Our relationships with our retail customers continue to remain strong with 79% customer renewal rate, average customer duration of more than six years and power contracts of 21 months on average. Slide 8, the financial results. Excellent operations and robust cost led to our strong financial results as you see on the slide. The pandemic reduced our demand for electricity, particularly at Constellation, which created financial headwinds for us. We've reduced our earnings guidance on the first quarter call based on what we knew at the time, and we kept looking for ways to improve our earnings outlet throughout the year. We delivered on $400 million of savings, $150 million more than announced, which brought us well within our original earning guidance range. And then gains from the Constellation Technology Ventures portfolio brought us above the midpoint of our range guidance. We earned $2.01 on the GAAP basis and $3.22 on a non-GAAP basis. Turning to Slide 10, this morning's announcement is really a very good strategic move for us. With our board, we've completed or concluded the separation of our regulated utilities in the competitive businesses is the best interest of all stakeholders, and are moving forward with that decision. So separation, it establishes two best-in-class standalone companies are high growth, high quality, a 100% regulated utility in America's leading clean energy company, producing the most clean energy paired with the best and largest customer-facing business in the country. It better positions each business within its peer set, and it will support business strategies tailored to the distinct business investment profiles and meeting unique customer needs. The same operational expertise, customer focus and financial discipline that you expect from this management team will continue to underpin the value proposition of each company. On Slide 11, the separation of the spin out of the generation business to our existing Exelon shareholders. The regulatory business, which is being termed the RemainCo shares the traits of a high quality, best-in-class utility, strong above earnings growth rate of 6% to 8%. Diversified rate base across 7 constructive jurisdictions with almost 100% of our rate base growth covered by alternative rate recovery mechanisms. Best-in-class operations and an attractive ESG attributes provide platforms to enable a transition to a clean energy economy without owning the generation. The SpinCo, GenCo it's entitled as SpinCo for this, will be America's clean energy leader will continue to produce electricity that is over 90% carbon free, provide 11% of the clean energy in the country. And with no coal-fired generation and emissions profiles - our emissions profiles are significantly below the 1.5 degrees C targets. Delivering solutions for our large customer-facing platform in the country. And we anticipate having an investment grade rating on that balance sheet. The transition, going to Slide 12, Joe will get in more details around the strategy and the specifics of these two great companies. But let me hit on some of the key transaction considerations. The spin is designed to be a tax-free distribution of the SpinCo shares to the existing shareholders of Exelon. We've worked hard to close by the end of the year, which provides execution benefits around a clean calendar year transition for the split. But regulatory approvals could potentially take longer. We have several required approvals with long lead time items being the NRC, New York Public Service Commission. We have good plans for each of these approvals, and we'll be making the necessary files in the very near-term. We maintain an open dialogue with three credit agencies and anticipate both businesses remaining investment grade under various scenarios. Our preliminary work on this energy gives us confidence that they will be able to at least offset them at both companies. Turning to the dividend, the Board has approved the dividend at $1.53 for 2021, which is holding it flat to last year. RemainCo expects to target a 60% payout in line with best-in-class high growth peers and will grow its dividend consistent with earnings. The SpinCo will focus on the combination of debt pay down to support our credit metrics and return capital to our shareholders and continue to invest in clean energy solutions. Resolution of the Illinois Legislative Session and capacity auction results in June, along with a number of other factors will have a bearing on the allocation of this strategy. From a funding perspective, we estimate that Remain Co will need around $1 billion of new equity capital through 2024 investment horizon. This could change depending on variations of factors that we expect to play out over the course of the year. The EPS bands that Joe will show you for the Remain Co already incorporate the potential future equity needs. I'm now going to turn the call over to Joe to talk more about the two business strategies and the outlook for 2021.
Joe Nigro: Thank you, Chris and good morning, everyone. I will try to build on Chris's remarks by providing more detail about the two standalone businesses, and then we'll discuss our 2021 guidance. I'll start with RemainCo on Slide 14. Our utilities will continue to be a premium business within the sector and share the characteristics of other high quality utilities. They operate in constructive regulatory jurisdictions, with nearly 100% of rate base growth recovered through alternative recovery mechanisms. We will continue to meet our commitments to our customers through bill affordability and best-in-class operations. We will maintain a keen focus on our ESG initiatives, including clean energy and diversity, equity and inclusion. And we'll continue to pursue a balanced and disciplined financial policy underpinned by a strong balance sheet. All of this will allow us to deliver on industry-leading rate base and earnings growth built on strong returns on equity, growing the RemainCo business model well into the future. If you turn to Slide 15, we show RemainCo's growth outlook. We have a robust investment plan across our utilities to continue to improve reliability and resiliency, enhance the service experience for our customers and prepare for a clean energy future. In 2021, we plan to invest nearly $6.6 billion and a total of $27 billion over the next four years. Since our last capital investment disclosure, we've identified more than $500 million in additional investment needs across our system that will provide further benefits for our customers and communities. We are planning to grow our rate base by 7.6% annually - to $58.8 billion, adding nearly $15 billion to rate base by 2024. Our rate base growth is improved by 30 basis points since last year. And as a reminder, our capital forecast reflects only identified projects that we expect to recover through our normal rate filings and other recovery mechanisms. I will also point out that the largest project in our plan is less than 1% of our capital spend from 2021 to 2024, avoiding concentration risk with any particular project. Our earnings per share outlook remains strong at 6% to 8% growth, compared to last year's update, this growth reflects updates to our rate base forecasts and our assumptions around funding RemainCo's growth would get and the $1 billion equity issuance through 2024 that Chris mentioned. We are confident this growth extends beyond 2024, I would note that 2025 will further benefit from rate case timing as you think about your long-term modeling. We deliver on this strong growth while maintaining a focus on affordability, which is paramount to successful utility. We will continue to manage our costs and support energy efficiency programs to keep bill inflation in check, even as we make these investments that benefit our customers. Now turning to Slide 16, RemainCo is a 100% fully regulated transmission and distribution utility with no generation. It is diversified across 7 regulatory jurisdictions, with no one jurisdiction representing the majority of the rate base. We have worked with stakeholders in our jurisdictions to establish recovery mechanisms that allow us to prudently and efficiently invest in critical infrastructure for the benefit of our customers, while generating an appropriate return on capital. Nearly 100% of our rate base growth will be covered by alternative mechanisms by the end of our planning period. These mechanisms include multi-year plans in Maryland and DC, formula rates for both transmission and distribution, capital and other trackers as well as forward-looking test years. We see the combination of being a fully regulated T&D utility, with geographic diversity and constructive regulatory designs as a clear differentiator among our utility peers. Turning to Slide 17, Chris covered our 2020 operations earlier, but I wanted to highlight our operations over time, which consistently outperform the sector average, bringing tangible benefits to our customers. Moving to Slide 18, environmental, social and governance or ESG values have been at the core of our business since Exelon's founding. We have been committed to doing what is right for all our stakeholders, and that will not change, specifically RemainCo is committed to working within our state's regulators and communities to make investments that help them achieve their environmental and clean energy goals. Continuing to support our diverse employees, customers and communities and create a workforce that reflects our community, and operate responsibly and transparently, maintaining the high standards of corporate governance. ESG will continue to be an integral part of RemainCo's strategy as a standalone company. Moving to SpinCo on Slide 20, SpinCo will be the largest supplier of clean energy and sustainable solutions to its customers. It produces 12%, or one out of every nine megawatt hours of carbon free electricity in the United States. SpinCo is an essential partner to businesses and federal, state and local governments that are setting carbon reduction goals and seeking long term solutions to the climate crisis. SpinCo's clean generation fleet is paired with one of the largest customer-facing platforms with the leading share in the C&I market where we continue to have very high customer renew and retention rates. It is also the best operator of nuclear power plants in the country. As Chris mentioned, we're in ongoing conversations with rating agencies and anticipate that SpinCo will remain investment grade. It will continue to have a disciplined financial policy focused on optimizing cash flows to support the balance sheet, invest in clean energy solutions and return value to shareholders. On Slide 21, you can see how SpinCo's clean generation fleet stacks up against others. SpinCo is and will be the leading clean energy producer in the United States. It does not own coal-fired generation and 90% of its output is emissions free. As a result, SpinCo produces nearly double the clean energy of the next leading provider and more than 8 times to 17 times the clean energy of its IPP peers. It also has the lowest emissions intensity, nearly fivefold less intensive than the next generator, and more than 13 times to 15 times less carbon intensive than the other IPPs. These attributes are a clear advantage for SpinCo as the Biden administration committed to 100% zero-carbon electricity sector by 2035 to address the climate crisis. Turning to Slide 22, each of SpinCo's states have or are looking to set ambitious emission reductions for clean energy goals. SpinCo's generation is essential to helping states meet their goals in an affordable manner. SpinCo provides a significant amount of the clean energy in the states where it operates. In Illinois and Maryland, it provides merely all of the clean electricity in the state. Losing any of these assets would be a significant step backward for each state in meeting its goals, while also creating higher costs for customers and significant economic hardship for host communities. The company will continue to be a leading advocate for clean energy policies aimed at preserving and growing clean energy to combat the climate crisis. SpinCo's clean energy leadership extends beyond the power generation fleet. As you can see on Slide 23, our Constellation business has also been a leader in developing and providing clean energy and sustainability solutions for our customers. The desire of our customers to positively impact the environment is real and the Constellation business leads the charge through new products and strategic investments to help our customers. Not only have these efforts been economically beneficial with solid margins, they've also yielded strong customer retention rates and opened up additional revenue opportunities. One example of this is our core product. Constellation serves as an intermediary between the renewable developer and the customer, filling a niche where multiple off takes are needed for 150 megawatt to 250 megawatt sized projects and customers may have varying demands for term and deal structure. It allows Constellation to provide a customized solution for our customers. Moving to Slide 24, it shows the operational performance of generation over time compared to the industry. Generation remains the best operator of nuclear power plants in the United States, with industry-leading capacity factors of approximately 94% or better and industry-leading refueling outage days at least 10 days better than the industry average every year. Turning to our customer-facing business on Slide 25, Constellations retail business is strong, it is steady, repeatable and with stable margins. Customer retention rates have averaged 77% over the last five years with that average contract terms of 25 months and customer duration of more than six years. Constellation is successful at acquiring new customers with a win rate of 29%. We have the largest C&I customer base and that remains key to our strategy. First C&I customers have higher load factors compared to residential customers and are less exposed to seasonal weather fluctuations. Second CNI customers allow us to achieve scale that cannot be done with residential customers. And finally, although the gross margins may be higher on residential customers, these margins do not account for the cost to acquire these customers, which are higher than C&I. Turning to Slide 26, there are uncertainties that will impact SpinCo's future, such as legislation in Illinois, the next PJM auction and potential federal carbon legislation. Regardless of those outcomes, SpinCo will continue to focus on its strong investment-grade rated balance sheet supported by stable free cash flows, which we see in the different scenarios we are currently considering. Exelon generation has a strong record of cost management, with announced savings of more than $1.1 billion since 2015 and that cost discipline will not change. We will continue to seek fair compensation for the zero-carbon attributes, while maintaining the discipline to retire on economic assets and opportunistically monetize others. We will provide a more detailed capital allocation strategy, including debt reduction, return of capital to shareholders and growth later this year, when we have more clarity on these policy and auction outcomes. That said, we are confident that our disciplined approach will keep SpinCo an investment-grade rated business regardless of those outcomes. Finally, I'll conclude with our 2021 earnings guidance on Slide 28. We are providing 2021 adjusted operating earnings guidance of $2.60 to $3 per share, which incorporates the midpoint of the range for the severe weather impacts offset by the opportunities that Chris discussed. Our disclosures including O&M, CapEx and gross margin reflect the mitigation opportunities we have identified and factored into this guidance. Thank you. And now, I'll turn the call back to Chris for his closing remarks.
Chris Crane: Thanks, Joe. Turning to Slide 29, I want to discuss our key focus areas for 2021. Obviously, we will be working on preparations to separate the businesses, including the regulatory approvals that we are confident we will obtain. That is the work of relatively a small group of our team members, most of the company will continue to focus on delivering operational excellence across our businesses. The operating - operating the grid reliably and safely, supporting our customers and communities during the pandemic and everyday providing zero-carbon energy will meet or exceed our financial commitments delivering earnings within our guidance range and maintain a strong balance sheet. We'll continue our work to mitigate the impact of ERCOT losses and maximize the earnings and cash flow. At the utilities, we will prudently and effectively deploy $6.6 billion of capital to benefit the customers meet the state's energy policy goals. We will work with our regulators to ensure timely recovery on these investments. We'll continue to advocate for clean energy climate policies, with the new administration Congress and the states to put our country on a path of meeting the carbon reduction goals. In Illinois, stakeholders continue discussion on clean energy legislation. The Governor has called for passing an energy bill this session that protects our nuclear fleet, grows renewable energy and supports customers and job creation. We expect the legislation - legislative process to ramp up in the coming weeks and months. We will continue to work with all interested parties on legislation that will achieve the state's clean energy goals and a power system dependability, while protecting our customers from higher bills, dirtier air in our communities from the loss of the economic engines that our nuclear plants are. To be a partner and an ally to our communities we serve, including following through on our work we have underway on social justice, racial equity and restoring civil discourse. Thank you, and I'll open the call up for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Stephen Byrd: Hey, good morning.
Chris Crane: Good morning, Stephen.
Stephen Byrd: Thanks for the thorough update on a lot of topics. I wanted to talk about your Constellation Technology Venture investment portfolio I think you laid that out well on Slide 45. You know I've noticed there quite a few of these entities are public entities now, as you know, with fairly significant market caps. It is challenging to determine kind of the aggregate value that you all have generated here often, you know, share counts are not available. And I know you can't disclose that on an individual company basis. But I wondered if you could maybe first just talk at a high level at you know, what is the approximate magnitude of a value of those public entity states that you have? And then over time, could this be a potential offset to the equity needs that you have?
Joe Nigro: So Stephen, good morning, it's Joe. I can't tell you that you know, are those entities contributed $0.14 to earnings in 2020. We have included an expectation of value in our '21 forecast. You know along those assumptions you - we have assumptions of what the IPO schedules would look like. Obviously, for competitive reasons, I can't say a lot more than that. And as you know, these will move around day-to-day until they get to IPO and also till we get to a point if we consider liquidation. But we have included some value in our '21 forecast.
Stephen Byrd: Understood, Joe. And is it possible over time, you know, I know you don't want to commit to sell in any particular company. But you know, it looks like the magnitude could be significant compared to the $1 billion of equity you need? Is it a potential offset in the future? Or have you ruled that out? How do you think about kind of the longer-term path here?
Joe Nigro: Yeah. Those are two very distinct things, when you look at the $1 billion, $1 billion of equity is needed at our RemainCo. And it matches to the growth plans, the capital allocation plan and our target metrics we're shooting for. You know, we'll see where these investments move through time, and we'll make the necessary decisions on what we want to do with liquidation you know, as we see value, but at this point, they're not linked.
Stephen Byrd: Okay, well understood. And maybe just last one for me, just as you think about ExGen and sort of the leverage levels. I think you've laid this out clearly, but I just wanted to maybe explore a little bit further, how do you think about sort of target ratios you're thinking about there? And then also you did provide a discussion of capital allocation. I just wondered if you could just add a little bit as you think about sort of ranking the different uses of capital at ExGen, if you could just expand on that a little bit?
Joe Nigro: Yeah, Stephen, we, as you know, we have a long history of investment grade at Exelon Generation. We have had preliminary conversations with the agencies and we've shared data with them, it's been very productive. You know, you've heard both Chris and I say in our prepared remarks, that we have a continued commitment to investment grade with the SpinCo. And the first use of the free cash flow will be to manage the balance sheet and pay down debt. You know, we believe investment grade has value to the business, and also to completing the transaction. And given the strength of the balance sheet, we expected warrants to be investment grade, even when it's fine.
Stephen Byrd: Very good. Thanks. I'll pass it over to others. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Steve Fleishman: Hey, good morning.
Joe Nigro: Hey, Steve.
Chris Crane: Good morning.
Steve Fleishman: Thanks. So just a couple of clarifications. Is it fair to say that the financing plan, the equity plan you've laid out incorporates the impacts of the Texas events that occurred and the cash flow that from that there was no change from that?
Joe Nigro: Yes, it does. Steve it's Joe, good morning. It does.
Steve Fleishman: And then just one other clarification there. I think, Chris at the end of your comments you said the $1 billion in the plan to 24 could change some depending. Could you just give a little more color on that?
Chris Crane: Yeah, I would like to give color. But you know, we did link some of this to Texas and it's early on in our actions. We want to make sure that we're giving a picture of what it potentially could be, but we'll be working on it. Joe?
Joe Nigro: Yeah, I think there, Steve, just examples of things that could change. It would be you know, we talked about $500 million of incremental capital investment at our utilities year-over-year in the four-year horizon, that would obviously have an impact. You know, ComEd currently is under a formula rate the ties to treasuries, treasuries move around, you know, regulatory settlements could change from assumption. So there are factors that will move it, but when we look at our plan as laid out, and we look at the metrics and all, you know, right now we see $1 billion of equity need -
Steve Fleishman: Okay -
Joe Nigro: Company at the rates -
Steve Fleishman: Okay, so it's more just the normal course stuff at any utility.
Joe Nigro: Normal course business activity -
Steve Fleishman: Yes. Yeah, yeah. Okay. And then the, just on the dividend. If you take that payout, times the utility guidance, you're - you have a slightly lower dividend than the current one, but it doesn't take much dividend from ExGen to kind of make it even. So just, I don't know how important that is in the scheme of your decision-making. But just maybe any comment on that?
Chris Crane: You know, it's really early on that one as we go through the planning process, understand what we'll be prioritizing at the GenCo for debt reduction or alternate investments we'll have to see on that and to talk about the RemainCo is definitely early in the planning process, we have to look at all sources and uses of cash. And do that throughout the year before we give a suggestion to the Board on the long-term.
Steve Fleishman: Okay. And then my last question is just maybe for Chris, a high level between the Biden administration, there's on the nuclear future between what happened in Texas, the Biden administration coming in, the comments of the Governor of Illinois like - so far, just how are you overall feeling about the ability to get some credit for nuclear to stay open, then maybe six months ago?
Chris Crane: You know, we - we've had a cloud in Illinois, and that has slowed the process of the discussion as some look at ComEd and the nuclear plants being one, and working to separate that, but also explaining not only the environmental benefits, but the community and the economic benefits that they serve along with the reliability. You know, in all of our jurisdictions that we have nuclear plants, I think that recognition is strong or becoming stronger. The preliminary conversations that Kathleen and her team are having with the administration and the Congress are positive. You know, it's, to say that that you can see a carbon tax in the future, the eminent future, still a lot of ground to plow there, but continuing to work on some other mechanisms that her team has been engaged with on the legislative side and briefing on the administrative side, I do feel from a year ago to now we're making progress.
Steve Fleishman: Great, thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning, team. Thanks for the time. Perhaps just wanted to follow-up here on the confidence in executing this transaction. Clearly, New York prior approvals with Entergy in previous attempts, obviously drove some challenges in the past. I'll leave it open ended. I'm curious, what are the preliminary conversations in New York and NRC looking like? I've recognized that you're directly addressing some of those early concerns with investment grade balance sheet here. But if you can speak to it more broadly, I would appreciate whatever context you can provide. Certainly seems - if I can read between the lines that you're already talking about providing a capital allocation update here. So certainly seems like that's a positive indication.
Bill Von Hoene: Julien, this is Bill and thank you for the question. We have had conversations with New York and we intend to file our approval request immediately after the announcement. This is a very, very different situation from the Entergy situation where they went in with a spin off that would be non-investment grade. We have given New York a good idea and a good understanding of how we think the financial stability of the SpinCo would be, and it's a very, very different situation. We've also had a long and relatively strong relationship with New York since this expert passed. So we are confident that we will get through New York, it's going to be a process, obviously, and there'll be some negotiations. But the initial signs are good. And while there is no timeline on New York, as you know, we would expect to be able to complete this in New York within a year. And we think that conversations are productive and continue - excuse me, to be that way.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. Just a couple of clarifications. EDF put that's reflected, I presume in this outlook and approval process, and then separately, the minimum FFO to debt targets that you're talking about here. Can you elaborate at all? I know it's early on both sides of the equation.
Joe Nigro: The answer to your first question is, we've made an assumption of EDF put in this analysis. The second one we have had preliminary conversations with the agencies. It's you know, it's too soon for us to begin commenting on what targets and metrics you know would look like but we are confident that both entities will be strong investment grade rating companies.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Okay, fair enough. Best of luck.
Chris Crane: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Shah Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Shah Pourreza: Hey, good morning, guys.
Chris Crane: Hey, Shah.
Shah Pourreza: So just focusing on the credit side. Do you sort of expect there to be sort of any parental guarantees between the RemainCo and the SpinCo upon separation? And curious, how do you sort of get the agencies comfortable with the business risk profile, despite sort of having IG metrics? I mean, this has been a little bit of an uphill climb with some of your IPP peers?
Joe Nigro: Yeah, so I think, Shah to the question of parental guarantees that we don't expect any parental guarantees being held at RemainCo for the benefit of SpinCo. I think, to your agency question. You know, there's a number of ways to think about that, right. We continue to look at ways to shore up the cash flows in the business, you looked at the, you know, the ZEC payments, capacity payments, the strength of our Constellation business, the strength of our Nuclear operations were strong investment grade rating. Now, I think, you know, we continually honor that commitment. We think there's value in it, our value return policy and our capital allocation at SpinCo. First and foremost, we'll start with debt reduction with the use of free cash flow. So I think all of those things go into the dialogue with the agencies to ensure that, you know, we continue as an investment grade entity.
Shah Pourreza: Got it. And then, so I know you obviously, the key is that you're mitigating or offsetting some of the dissynergies or all of dissynergies from the transaction that's announced today. Can you just maybe elaborate how you expect to mitigate dissynergies? And how do we sort of thinking about the $7.4 billion the HoldCo debt that's going to be allocated between the two?
Joe Nigro: So the debt will remain, the HoldCo debt will remain with the parent with RemainCo. When you talk about dissynergies, there are opportunities to reduce costs when you look at governance models, you look at, you know, the use of technology and some of the other external things we spend money on. We're going to challenge ourselves like we do each year to determine how we can continue reduce that, but we are confident when you go through those buckets that we can offset any dissynergies.
Shah Pourreza: Okay, perfect. And then just lastly, I know, Chris, you highlighted sort of, you know, reevaluating the ERCOT fleet like Colorado Bend and Wolf Hollow? Do you sort of expect a transaction or strategy there prior to the Spin or so how do we sort of think about the Texas fleet in light of the ExGen spec?
Chris Crane: Yeah, the first step is working with the other stakeholders on what happens and what's the future design of the Texas market? Do they lean towards a reliability standard that takes into consideration capacity tested for, which has not been the view of the market design in Texas, there's been a lot written on this over the years that we're heading in this direction is a very unfortunate event? But we have to know first a market design. The second thing is we have to look at the design and the root cause on our specific units. And the issues that we had anywhere from metallurgical issues to pressure issues to instrument issues. We had taken some action after the Super Bowl event a couple of years ago. But you don't get compensated to do what we've done in other jurisdictions with hardening the plants that have not only energies but capacity payments that allow you to make those investments. So you know, we have to look at it, we want to be a reliable provider. We want to participate in a market that's designed to not only protect the consumers, the cost element, the reliability element, but allow us to make the investments and operate our plants safely and reliably.
Shah Pourreza: Terrific. Thank you, guys. Congrats today.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Durgesh Chopra: Hey, good morning team. Thanks for taking my question. Joe, just - good morning. Just quick, I want to be clear on dividends, just in terms of when we're thinking about pro forma dividend to shareholders. Are we - should we be modeling them lower? Or are you suggesting that there could be a dividend at the SpinCo? Just -
Joe Nigro: What we -
Durgesh Chopra: Let me -
Joe Nigro: Right, sorry.
Durgesh Chopra: No, that's it.
Joe Nigro: Okay. Yeah, what we've said is, you know, we've aligned the utility payout at 60% of EBS - EPS it'll grow in line with our earnings growth. And, you know, we believe that compares to other high growth and high quality utilities. We haven't made a determination on the capital allocation plan at SpinCo for some of the reasons that we've talked about in our prepared remarks. And you know, the first and foremost, we're going to continue to pay down debt there to maintain the strength of the balance sheet, because we think that an investment grade rating is important. And then beyond that we'll determine how we return capital to the shareholders. And we expect to have, you know, those decisions made through time here, we're just not ready to commit to that at this point, given some of the uncertainty.
Durgesh Chopra: Understood, okay. Okay. So guys from GenCo basically goes to pay down debt, and then the balance, you may administrate dividend or sort of buy back shares or do other, you know, other ways of giving it back to shareholders?
Joe Nigro: I wouldn't say it that black and white, I would say we have to make a determination on what our capital allocation policy is. And we'll do that through time as some of these other things are resolved. But there's been no final determination.
Durgesh Chopra: Understood. Okay. Thanks. And then just maybe can I quickly get your thoughts on you mentioned the federal carbon legislation? So what sort of are you expecting there and perhaps in the timeline?
Chris Crane: Yeah, I'll let Kathleen to pile on them.
Kathleen Barron: Yeah, thanks for the question. I mean, you know, obviously, we were heartened to see the administration set the carbon free power sector goal by 2035. And we know that there are number of steps that are to come, including, as you mentioned, potential for climate legislation. But you know, I would keep my eye on the administration needs to set an NDC for the US a Nationally Determined Contribution to match up to the new commitment to the Paris target, we do expect that to be more aggressive than in the past. And that we'll sort of set the tone for what Congress takes up. But I think the nearest term thing to look to is the push for an infrastructure package. There are a number of business and labor and other interests pushing the administration to move forward on a piece of legislation that itself could make progress on climate. So separate from a pure climate Bill, and infrastructure bill, that included tax incentives for clean energy development, electric vehicle storage, climate resilient infrastructure, is sort of the first thing to look out for. And then I think once that gets done, you know, we'll see the discussions wrap up around what the future sort of National Climate Policy is going to look like, as you know, the administration has already expressed support for a national clean energy standard, that counts nuclear as clean. And so that, that clearly will be on the table, but there will also be discussions about a carbon tax dividend approach and with, you know, the growing public support for national action, you know, we, as Chris said, are working with folks in Washington to make sure that, you know, the proper design is included in the sense that we need something that is going to be cognizant of the customer impact, but also aggressive enough to address the challenge of the climate crisis. The last thing I'd say, I guess, is that while those are all extremely positive developments, they do take time, legislation in Washington will take some time to enact and then it will take time to implement. So that's why our focus does remain at the state level on moving forward with legislation that will support the state's climate goals, air pollution reduction, electrification of the economy and job creation and equity, so that we can make progress now, while the federal discussions continue.
Durgesh Chopra: Understood, thanks for the color. Thanks for time, guys. Appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Michael Lapides: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question. And congrats on today's announcement. Lots of interesting stuff going on. Real quick, just curious how you're thinking about really the broader risk to run the retail business, not just Texas, but anywhere you do it, and then how we should think about the potential for power price volatility, especially given a significant amount of retired baseload generation over the last 5 to 10 years, how that can impact you in other regions, where you're much bigger than you are in Texas and retail. Trying to think about, you know, it's not the first time we've had price spikes, we had them in January of 2014 and January 2018 in New England, there have been other retailers. Just curious about how you protect yourself from the risk of a, Texas like events happening in one of your bigger markets.
Chris Crane: The one thing is, you have to differentiate between the market designs. Texas is far different than PJM. The interconnectability and availability of power through that Eastern interconnect is strong. We have taken on steps in other markets to ensure that we have adequate capacity that can weather such events, weather events. But you know, you take in an isolated market, where you do not have the ability to import, cover your load. You have a price cap at significantly high, and you essentially lose your sites. It is not something you can hedge for at this time in ERCOT. And that's what we have to work on. But our hedging strategy and our ability to have our customer-facing products in our retail C&I and Residential business, as many risk focuses on that, and we continue to work as the markets evolve. So we're not looking at it like this is an event everywhere across the country, as long as we keep focusing on sound market designs, understanding capacity requirements and the investments required by the generators to prevent such volatility. But our hedging strategy is the key to that.
Michael Lapides: Got it, okay. And then a follow-up on SpinCo. How should we think about, I mean, you've got an RPM auction coming up this May? How should we think about, you know, potential changes in RPM outcomes relative to the, you know, to the last auction which was almost two years ago. And what it means for the financial structure, the capital structure for kind of ExGen as a new entity separate from consolidated Exelon?
Chris Crane: So that's a pretty broad question and there's a bunch of questions in there. I think, I'll let Joe start with it and then see where we go for the rest of it with Kathleen and -
Joe Nigro: Michael, the one thing I would say is, and we made this comment in our prepared remarks, we looked at the SpinCo business under a range of different scenarios. And those scenarios ultimately take into account, you know, changes in cash flow assumptions, and how we would manage the business accordingly. I think you've seen us through time, you know, we would be very prudent, financially with a lot of discipline, right, we've used alternative tools like project financing, we've retired assets when they were on economic and we couldn't get paid for them. We've sold assets that the market has put a higher premium on than ours. But we don't look at just one point estimate or we have to make sure we understand how shocks would impact our, you know, the balance sheet and the free cash flow of the company. And we continue to look at that and you know, your example of capacity outcomes would tie into that.
Michael Lapides: Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Vertical Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Arnold: Hey, good morning, guys. And thank you for taking my question.
Chris Crane: Hi, Jonathan.
Jonathan Arnold: Hi. I want to just clarify one thing on the corporate segment drag that you have say in your '21 guidance. It looks as though that is mostly allocated to RemainCo just as we think about transitioning forward, is that correct? Or is a piece of that sort of not coming - will a piece of that go away with the Spin?
Joe Nigro: Yeah, that is, you are correct. It's mostly allocated to RemainCo.
Jonathan Arnold: Okay. So that was one thing. And then just as I look at the RemainCo's earnings trajectory I mean obviously you're reiterating the 6% to 8%. But a good bit of that seems to be the step up in '21 from 2020, so, then it's kind of flatter further out, and obviously have the equity in there. But that doesn't look like that's huge. So just curious what's kind of tempering that flow further out when you actually raised the CapEx, et cetera?
Joe Nigro: Yeah, so Jonathan 6% to 8% is a long-term target for us. As you could imagine, you know, given the size and scale of our business, there's going to be some oscillation in a given period of time. When you think about rate case timing and then would be one that changes it. So if you were to carry this through to '25, you would see strong growth, just given some of the timing of our rate cases. I would also say, you know, the work we're doing at the utilities under Calvin Butler's leadership is to make sure that we're reducing lag, right, we're investing for the benefit of our consumers and improving reliability and the customer experience. But we're also trying to make sure that we reduce the regulatory lag. And we've seen that with things like the multi-year rate plan in Maryland and DC, for example, but there are going to be some years where it moves around just given timing of rate cases and other things.
Jonathan Arnold: Okay, good enough. And just maybe one other thing on timing. You've obviously talked about these offsets to the Texas hit. Well how should we think about those in terms of how they show up through the year? And is the Q1 going to be - take obviously, the negative thing Q1, but does it sort of take most of the year to get back to that negative 20 net. Or would it become quicker than that?
Joe Nigro: Yeah, no, though, it will take time to flush through the year. And, you know, we're looking at these in a number of buckets, we have the ability to defer non-essential maintenance. There are some one-time cost savings, which will monetize throughout the year. And then there are some revenue enhancement opportunities, which also will happen throughout the year. But there's a number of different levers that we're using.
Chris Crane: There's a very focused team that's overseeing this, working with individual businesses on making sure that they can commit to what we believe that these goals are, that come up with this savings range, and will continue to challenge from the corporate financial organization, other areas on where we can affect some dampening of the effects of ERCOT.
Jonathan Arnold: Right, thank you, Chris.
Operator: Thank you. And this does conclude today's question-and-answer session. And I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Chris Crane for any further remarks.
Chris Crane: I'd just like to thank everybody for joining today. You know we had a lot to go through today. As we were planning for this with the Board, we did not anticipate the ERCOT event to the extent that it played through, creates a little bit of complication. But it's nothing that the team is not up to try to work through the challenges. So we'll continue to update you on the calls or if something happens. In the meantime, when we think is worthy, Dan and his team, Emily will be reaching out to folks just to make sure we're in sync and you know where we're going. So with that, be safe and thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-11-03 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to Exelon’s third quarter earnings Call. My name is Gigi, and I will be your event specialist today. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. Please note that today’s webcast is being recorded. During the presentation, we will have a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note that today’s webcast is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn today’s program over to Dan Eggers, Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance. The floor is yours.
Daniel Eggers: Thank you, Gigi. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Leading the call today are Chris Crane, Exelon’s President and Chief Executive Officer; and Joe Nigro, Exelon’s Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by other members of Exelon’s senior management team, who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. We issued our earnings release this morning along with the presentation, both of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of Exelon’s website. The earnings release and other matters, which we discuss during today’s call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today’s material and comments made during this call. Please refer to today’s 8-K and Exelon’s other SEC filings for discussions of risk factors and other factors, including uncertainties surrounding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic that may cause results to differ from management’s projections, forecasts and expectations. Today’s presentation also includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for reconciliations between the non-GAAP measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures. I will now turn the call over to Chris Crane, Exelon’s CEO.
Christopher Crane: Thanks, Dan. Appreciate it. And as you can see from our release, we have had strong earnings and operational performance, while continuing to focus on the health and safety of our employees and the communities. Our GAAP basis earned $0.51 per share and non-GAAP basis earned $1.04 per share. We did outperform our guidance that we had originally given at $0.80 to $0.90 per share due to some favorable weather and more cost savings coming through sooner than we anticipated Joe is going to get into the detail [indiscernible] that I want to highlight. In August, we had a tropical storm that battered the East Coast with rain and strong winds, significant impacts to ACE, Delmarva and PECO. It was PECO’s 10th largest storm on record following the 8th largest storm in June. Then a hurricane-like derecho tore through the ComEd service territory, spawning 13 tornadoes. Between the two storms, we had more than 1.5 customers lost power. We had more than 500 employees and contractors that were helping their sister utilities moving back and forth between the East and the West to try to respond to the needs of the customers. And despite the intensity, we were able to restore the power to our customers in record time due to the power of our Exelon Utilities platform. Our employees’ quick response and collaboration made the difference for our customers. So we really want to thank our employees for their great work restoring service to customers during, not just the pandemic, but a very active storm season as we have seen. As I mentioned on the last call, Exelon is committed to our values of diversity, equality and inclusion. Part of this commitment calls on our businesses and our partners to recognize these values and include women and people of color in key roles on our accounts. For 10-years, we have recognized partners who have excelled in this area. This year, we have included 30 companies in banking, insurance, legal, investment, professional and IT services to our 2020 diversity and inclusion honor roll. We also are committed to delivering clean energy in a clean-energy future. Exelon Foundation and Exelon selected 10 start-ups as part of the first round of $20 million in climate change investment initiatives. Beyond the financial support, Exelon will mentor the start-ups on accessing capital, structuring the business, capital allocation and meeting the regulatory requirements. Through this program, the Foundation will invest early in stage start-ups, working on climate change, mitigating, adapting and resilience in our service territory. 50% are minority or women owned, 60% of the projects focus on greenhouse gas mitigation and the others are on resiliency and adapting to the changing climate environment that we are living in. These investments will bring us a step closer to a clean-energy future by helping entrepreneurs translate their ideas for reversing climate change into practical solutions. Finally, we made the difficult decision to retire some uneconomic generation stations. Mystic generation, gas-fired station in Boston will retire in 2024 when the cost service agreement expires. And very disappointingly, we announced our Dresden - Byron and Dresden nuclear stations will retire in 2021. These plants produce 30% of the carbon-free electricity in Illinois. They provide over 1,500 good-paying full-time jobs, and they support 2,000 supplemental workers during refueling outages, most from local union halls, paying $63 million in taxes annually to support local schools, fire departments and other services in their community. Despite being among the most efficient, reliable units in the U.S. nuclear fleet, they face revenue shortfalls, declining energy prices, lack of capacity revenue and market rules that allow fossil plants to underbid clean energy resources in the PJM market auction. Given these losses, we have made a tough decision to shut these units down and give our employees and the host communities time to manage through the personal and economic challenges ahead. Without these plants and others at risk, customers will pay $483 million in increased annual energy cost under the PJM auction structure that is about to incur. The electric sector emissions will increase by 70% and instead of growing zero carbon energy in Illinois to reach the state’s goal of clean energy will fail - fall decades behind. We continue to work with interested parties on the best way to achieve these state goals, but urgent action is needed. We have to protect our consumers from higher bills, our state from dirtier air and our communities from the loss of these irreplaceable power plants and the jobs that they create. Turning to operations, even with the pandemic conditions, extreme storms and record heat across our territories, all our utilities have achieved first quartile operating performance in outage duration and frequency. Customer service remains at top quartile across all utilities with BGE, ComEd and PECO delivering service in top decile. Power dispatch match of 98.9% in renewable energy capture at 91.9%. The Constellation has also had a very strong quarter of execution, and as a result was able to increase the new business targets for the year that we talked about at trouble in the first quarter. The nuclear performance was excellent. The plants ran at 96% for the quarter. They led the nation in zero carbon electricity production, producing almost 38 terawatt hours of emission-free generation. Like all of our plants, Dresden and Byron ran at nearly full power through the hottest summer on record. Employees at Dresden and Byron are entirely focused on ensuring the reliability and safety of these plants through their retirement dates. The plants’ forced retirement is simply hard to deal with, and it is a shame. I will now turn the call over to Joe for a financial update.
Joseph Nigro: Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover our third quarter results, quarterly financial updates and our hedge disclosures. I will also provide an update on our full year 2020 guidance. Turning to Slide 7. We earned $0.51 per share on a GAAP basis and $1.04 per share on a non-GAAP basis, which exceeded our guidance range of $0.80 to $0.90 per share. A key driver in our quarterly EPS performance for both the second and third quarters has been success in managing costs. As you may recall, on our first quarter call, we announced $250 million of savings across the organization to help offset the impacts of COVID. At that time, we expected our offices would reopen in late summer. Since then, we have pushed phase 1 of our reopening for remote-enabled workers until January of next year at the earliest. This change in expectations, along with the hard work of the organization, led to higher savings than originally anticipated. For the quarter, Exelon Utilities delivered a combined $0.57 per share net of holding company expenses. Utility earnings were modestly higher relative to expectations, driven primarily by favorable O&M and taxes, earlier recognition of bad debt regulatory assets and favorable summer weather in our non-decoupled jurisdictions. This was partially offset by costs related to tropical storm Isis, which hit the East Coast in August. ExGen outperformed expectations for the third quarter, earning $0.47 per share. The upside was largely driven by lower O&M, where targeted savings exceeded our original expectations and were achieved sooner than planned. Additionally, favorable weather and lower cost to serve benefited our gross margin. On Slide 8, we show our quarter-over-quarter earnings walk. The $1.04 per share in the third quarter of this year was $0.12 per share higher than the third quarter of 2019. Exelon Utilities less Holdco earnings were up $0.01 per share compared to last year. The earnings growth was driven primarily by higher distribution and transmission rates associated with completed rate cases relative to the third quarter of 2019 as well as favorable weather at PECO. This was partially offset by storm costs at PHI and PECO. ExGen’s earnings were up $0.11 per share compared with last year, benefiting from lower O&M and higher capacity revenues. Turning to Slide 9. We are raising our 2020 EPS guidance range to $3 to $3.20 per share from $2.80 to $3.10 per share and are now comfortably within our original 2020 guidance range of $3 to $3.30 per share. When we revised guidance on the first quarter call, there was a great deal of uncertainty about the severity and the length of the impacts of COVID on our business. Our updated guidance considers the strong ExGen performance to date, our successful cost management as well as the favorable weather we saw in the third quarter. We are delivering on our financial commitments, and we are confident we will be within our revised guidance range at year-end. Moving to Slide 10. Looking at our Utility returns on a consolidated basis, we have dipped slightly below our consolidated 9% to 10% target range with an 8.9% trailing 12-month ROE as of the third quarter. The 20 basis point decline from last quarter was primarily due to equity infusions at BGE and ComEd to support capital investments. This calculation is backward-looking, so you should continue to see some pressure on ROEs over the next couple of quarters. This is simply due to the roll-off of better pre-COVID-19 quarters, the burden of poor first quarter weather, summer storms and the continued impact of lower treasuries on ComEd. Looking further into the future, we remain focused on delivering stronger returns at the utilities and supporting our growth targets. Turning to Slide 11. Since the last call, we had two major developments on the regulatory front. Pepco filed its first multiyear plan in Maryland, and PECO filed its first guest distribution case in 10-years. Pepco was the second utility in Maryland to file a multiyear plan with BGE filing the first plan in May. The filing will support capital investments in the electric distribution system made during 2019 and 2020 and planned investments through March of 2024. Pepco’s planned investments will continue to improve reliability and customer service, advanced technologies and investments to modernize the distribution system, support state environmental goals and provide tools to assist customers in managing their energy use. The filing considers the current health emergency and economic challenges in Maryland, while allowing for timely recovery of our investments that benefit our customers. A few highlights from the filing include flat distribution rates for the first two years of the plan, partially offset in year three. Residential electric bills are projected to be lower in 2024 than they were in 2011. Recovery of electric vehicle program cost and COVID-19 costs and inclusion of tracking performance incentive mechanisms focused on system reliability, customer service and the environment. We expect an order in May of 2021. On September 30th, PECO filed a gas distribution case with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission. PECO is seeking a revenue increase of $69 million for continued investments in its gas distribution system to maintain and increase safety, reliability and customer service. We expect an order in June of 2021. We also have several rate cases still in progress, two of which we expect orders on this year. In October, evidentiary hearings were conducted as part of BGE’s pending multiyear rate case. As a reminder, the filing supports planned capital investments from 2020 to 2023 as well as investments made in late 2019 to maintain and increased reliability and benefit customer service for our electric and gas distribution systems. We expect an order in December. Additionally, ComEd’s annual formula rate update filing is expected to be decided in December of this year. On October 14th, draft proposed orders were filed by ComEd, the ICC staff and intervenors as part of the case. This filing requests a reduction in delivery rates for the third year in a row and the fifth decrease in 10-years. Since the formula rate has been in place, ComEd’s investments in grid modernization and enabling clean energy growth have improved reliability by 70% while keeping bills lower than they were nearly a decade ago. More details on the rate cases can be found on Slides 20 through 27 of the appendix. Turning to Slide 12. The Utilities continue to deploy capital largely as planned for the year, investing $1.6 billion during the third quarter and year-to-date, we have spent $4.5 billion of capital at our utilities, improving our infrastructure and increasing reliability and resiliency for the benefit of our customers. Despite some early challenges from the pandemic, our capital plan is on track for the year. Today, I will talk about two projects that advance Exelon utility strategy. A key element of that strategy is involving our capabilities to anticipate and meet changing customer needs and expectations of the system. The first project is Pepco’s streetlight modernization project in Maryland. This project includes conversion of approximately 66,000 existing streetlights to smart LEDs and integration with a central management system. The new streetlights will send automatic notifications to the central management system, improving outage response time, maintenance efficiency and customer billing accuracy. Additionally, LEDs improve light quality and benefit public safety and security. This project is included in the Pepco Maryland multiyear plan filing I discussed earlier. The second project is the Exelon Utilities’ customer information system upgrade, which was completed on time even though it was done almost fully remotely. This is a $130 million project to upgrade BGE’s customer care and billing system and implement Oracle’s customer experience service cloud at BGE, ComEd and PECO. This new system will provide operational efficiencies as well as improve customer satisfaction. It is simply one piece of an ongoing project across the utilities to transform the customer information system. These improvements will support a platform to enable future customer benefits. Improvements will include a more personalized customer experience allowing for more efficient issue resolution and a streamlined and simplified implementation of billing for new customer offerings, such as community solar where energy is produced at different locations than the customers’ residents. Additionally, it will allow for faster implementation of new rate structures, bringing pricing for new services such as EV charging and storage pricing to market faster. Transitioning to Slide 13, we provide our gross margin update and current hedging position at ExGen. Our disclosures now reflect the impacts of the planned retirements of the Byron and Dresden nuclear plants in September and November of 2021, respectively. For 2020, total gross margin is up $50 million. Open gross margin decreased $100 million, primarily due to lower spark spreads in ERCOT, partially offset by higher prices at NiHub and West Hub. Our mark-to-market of hedges were up $250 million due to our hedge position, which offset the decrease in open gross margin including the execution of $150 million of Power New Business. We also executed $50 million in non-Power New Business during the quarter. Based on the higher load volumes associated with favorable third quarter weather and lower cost to serve across the portfolio, we are raising our 2020 new business targets by $50 million. For 2021, total gross margin is down $150 million driven by the retirements of Byron and Dresden nuclear plants, which is flowing through the open gross margin line. However, open gross margin is flat due to higher prices at West Hub, NiHub and New York Zone A. Mark-to-market of hedges was down $100 million due to our hedge position being down $150 million, offset by the execution of $50 million of Power New Business inside the quarter. As a reminder, the Byron and Dresden retirements are expected to be earnings and cash flow accretive. However, they are essentially flat in 2021 due to the timing of the retirements. The $150 million decrease in gross margin is offset by lower O&M, TOTI and depreciation and amortization totaling $150 million. Additionally, we remained slightly behind our ratable hedging program in 2021 by 2% to 5% when considering cross-commodity hedges. Our hedge percentages reflect the removal of Byron and Dresden in the fall of 2021. Moving on to Slide 14. Our consolidated FFO to debt is projected to be 18% for 2020, consistent with last quarter. Looking at ExGen, we are ahead of our debt-to-EBITDA target of 3.0x. For 2020, we expect it to be at 2.3x debt-to-EBITDA and 1.9x when excluding nonrecourse debt. On the ratings front, Moody affirmed its existing ratings for Exelon Corporation and ComEd in the third quarter. We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and investment-grade credit ratings. Thank you. And I will now turn the call back to Chris for his closing remarks.
Christopher Crane: Thanks, Joe. Finally, turning to Slide 15. I want to close as we do each one of these calls, with our value proposition. We are focused on growing our utilities, and now we are targeting a 7.3% rate base growth with a 6% to 8% EPS growth through 2023. We will use the free cash flow from the Genco to support the utility growth, pay down Genco debt and support the external dividend. We continue to optimize the value of Exelon Generation business by seeking fair compensation for our 0-emitting generation. And I have to say that many editorials and others call what we are asking for as a bailout. It is not a bailout. The nuclear fleet is only zero emitting fleet that does not get compensation towards value. So this is not a bailout. It is leveling the playing field. It comes across nice and political venues or editorial venues, but the last thing it is, is a bailout, it is leveling the competitive field. We will continue closing uneconomic plants, like we announced the retirement of Dresden, Byron and Mystic, monetizing these assets and maximizing the value through Constellation, retail and wholesale. We will continue to sustain investment-grade credit metrics and maintain a strong balance sheet and have grown our dividend annually at 5% through 2020. Before turning to Q&A, I want to comment on some recent news reports that Exelon is considering separating the Exelon Generation from the Utilities. As discussed recently on our last earnings call, we regularly evaluate whether our corporate structure best serves the interest of our communities, customers and our employees and also our investors. We would consider modifying that structure when we can create value and recognize those interests. The nature of our business and the landscape that it is in has been evolving over the years. In addition, you have seen a number of competitive integrated companies in our sector that have shrunk considerably. Given those circumstances, a review of our corporate structure is underway, started earlier this year, and we have the help of outside advisers. As we continue this review, we focus on creating value, taking into account, as I have mentioned, all of our stakeholders: the investors, the employees, the customers and the communities we serve. So I want to emphasize that the separation of the companies would involve addressing some complex operational, financial and regulatory issues. No decision has been made, but we continue to do the work to determine the best outcome for our stakeholders, and we will provide you an update on our progress on the next earnings call. So with that, operator, we can now open it up to questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Stephen Byrd: Hi, good morning. I just wanted to first talk about the strategic review. And I respect that you are at, I guess, a fairly early stage of thinking through your options. But I was just trying to think about the strategy here, and I guess maybe I wanted to start with what sort of attributes or sort of risk profile would you want to achieve for your merchant fleet for ExGen to be consistent with your strategy versus sort of what risk profile would be not consistent with your strategy? I know overall, you are trying to derisk the business and provide greater stability. How do you, at a high level, think about that?
Christopher Crane: Yes. I would wouldn’t say we are at the early stages. I would say that we are in an in-depth review of the evaluation. And some of the things we look at are the cost of capital, things like that, the degradation of the Constellation business with collateral costs. There is many aspects to it that are under review right now. But what we want to make sure is that we have two healthy companies, a utility business - if we and the Board determine this is the right thing to do, two healthy businesses that can stand on their own and provide the support needed for the balance sheets, the customers, the employees, the shareholders as we go forward. So a lot to be taken in there. But I don’t think we have pinpointed a risk profile yet that - well, I can say we haven’t pinpointed a risk profile yet that I have agreed with and the Board has agreed with.
Stephen Byrd: Understood. Is it fair to say it is an objective to try to reduce the volatility and also just to improve the viability, I guess, of that business going forward, right? That seems clear that, that is part of the strategy here?
Christopher Crane: Yes. It is a free cash flow machine. And how do we optimize that to be the best that it can and produce the most on valuation side and shareholder return side. So that is kind of the focus.
Stephen Byrd: Yes, that makes sense. And maybe just one last one for me. More on the tactical side, thinking about your nuclear plants. You have obviously made some shutdown decisions already. But I guess we calculate that some of your remaining nuclear plants are currently or will be negative cash flow. Would you agree with that assessment? And I guess, over what time frame are you thinking about making decisions for some of the plants that look like they are negative cash flow?
Christopher Crane: You have looked at our disclosures. We have outlined the plants that are sliding into that space. A lot depends on what we do with the capacity market or the FRR and how we treat the plants is comparable with other zero carbon-emitting plants, which they are not being treated equally right now. So the time frame, we have to watch the auction, we have to watch the legislation. If we don’t get a capacity redesign and the auctions run, you could anticipate there would be some issues coming up in the future.
Stephen Byrd: Understood. Thanks so much, I appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.
Steven Fleishman: Great. So I guess, first, arguably, for the last year or so, you have been getting little value, if even maybe negative value for ExGen in the Exelon stock price. So the value case seems obvious, but obviously, there is probably risks and obstacles to just get through. Could you maybe just talk to what some of those are in making this decision?
Christopher Crane: Yes. I mean you can imagine, this is a complex combination of a competitive integrated. And I wouldn’t get on the path of laying out each one of those, but I will tell you that when you start to look at the corporate center, splitting out the IP, splitting out the financials, splitting out the corporate organization, has a lot of design that we have to make sure we are not creating these in-synergies dissynergies, and we do that properly. There is other considerations that we have to make for the employees, for the regulatory bodies to do that and it is not an easy one. Many of the competitive integrateds that have switched and split have not had the complex level of the integration or the size of the scale that we have. We have the most premier retail and wholesale trading organization, nobody that has split had anything like that. So there is value being created, but there is expense there too. So we have to watch how we do it, make sure we do it properly. There is a lot to be said about what we do for the consumer and the zero carbon market. You haven’t seen anybody that has a zero carbon fleet like ours split-off. You have seen coal plants, you have seen gas plants, you have seen gas infrastructure split-off. We have to make sure that when or if we do it, that we have the right compensation for the assets that are being spun-off. And that is not something that is been recognized by the regulators or the legislators or the administrations thus far. They recognize when they recognize solar, but they have not recognized nuclear. And if you look at just the state of Illinois right now, 60% of the generation is carbon-free. 90% of it is nuclear. Nuclear is the only one that is not compensated for its low carbon or zero carbon elements. So there is a lot of different avenues we have to go down to, to get this right. But as I said in the last call, the market’s changing, and we have to figure out how we change with it.
Steven Fleishman: Great. Just based on the comments you just made, Chris, is it fair to say that you need to get some type of decision on Illinois law, either supporting nukes or not before making this kind of business structure decision?
Christopher Crane: I will let Bill jump in here, but I would not say that, that is going to be a gating function. Bill, I don’t know if you want to add anything to that?
William Von Hoene: Yes. No, Chris, I agree with what you said. But Steve, you have identified a big point of sensitivity here. As Chris alluded to, we have to take into account, in considering whether to do this or not, a variety of stakeholders, including the communities we serve, our customers, employees and the like. So all of that goes into the equation of not only the substance of this, but the timing of this. There is lots of ground to plow before we get to the exact decision on - before we decide whether we are doing it or not. Number one, the Board has not decided that. And number two, if so, what the timing would be. And obviously, the FRR is relevant to that, but it is hard to - I wouldn’t put it as a gating function. It is a function that is relevant to our consideration of what’s the optimal timing if we decide to do this.
Christopher Crane: The only thing I would add to that is, if the plants are not profitable, they don’t cover their cash needs or their earning requirements, we shut them down and - with or without FRR. And it is a business decision. Some people have called it a threat. It is not a threat. It is just a reality. When businesses don’t make money on assets, they shut them down. And so we have to look at the timing of all these decisions and make sure we are doing the right thing. But the legislation is important for the value, but we have to make decisions based off of current economic conditions.
Christopher Crane: Great, thanks and just Bill, great to her your voice. Thanks for the answers.
William Von Hoene: Thank you for your nice notes to me, I really appreciate it. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thanks you. Our next question comes from the line of James Thalacker from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
James Thalacker: Thanks for the time guys and good morning. Just two real quick questions. One is, I know you previously stated you conduct reviews on a regular basis. But in your prior evaluation of the corporate structure, has this process included the retention of outside advisers to help you kind of work through the process? Or is this kind of the next level of review this time around?
Christopher Crane: No. I think we were very public. In 2017, we used outside advisers, and we did a very, very thorough evaluation. And we looked at the free cash flow coming off of Genco. And at that point, it was accretive to be able to reduce debt, be able to put equity into the Utilities and also support a reasonable dividend policy. So we have kept close advisers as we have looked through this in the past, not only on business structure but assets also. It is nothing that is been insular to the company. It is always been with advice from outside.
James Thalacker: Okay. Great. I appreciate that. And just 1 last question, I guess, in just thinking, I guess, about cost allocation, as you undergo the review of the potential separation. Is there any initial guidance, I guess, you could give us on how you are thinking about the magnitude of shared services overall across the company and how potentially that falls into the regulated and ExGen buckets? And thoughts on how you sort of mitigate that as if you were to move forward, I guess?
Christopher Crane: It is too early to go there. I will tell you that we have to be very sensitive to what falls back on the Utilities and what the Genco can manage. And so some of the cost savings that you have seen in this quarterly update is us accelerating that type of focus. Not going too far, but the Genco’s done a lot. The business services organization is accelerating some stuff on technology and contracts and other things that would mitigate those costs when split. One thing about competitive integrated, you get to use the Massachusetts-modified model to spread the costs around. That is a revenue generated formula. We know if or when we do a split that, that goes away. And so we have to figure out how do we keep the financials, right, keep the employee benefits programs in all the databases. I mean you can go through that list of all the complex things that we have to do. But we do understand that the regulators are not going to want to see an increase in costs because we split the company. And the owners of the Genco are going to want to make sure their - the shareholders of the Genco are going to want to make sure that we are the most efficient. So we are working through that now, but we don’t have a number yet.
James Thalacker: Okay. I appreciate that. And just on Slide 36, you talked roughly about $200 million of the $250 million on the cost savings sort of this year or coming at the ExGen level. Should we think about that as being a decent run rate going forward? Or how much of that do you think you can retain as we move into 2021 and 2022?
Christopher Crane: I will let Joe jump in on that. There is travel, there are some other smaller things that we are not doing right now. But Joe, you want to take that?
Joseph Nigro: Yes. Thank you, Chris. This year, we had a goal of $250 million of O&M - or of cost savings across the enterprise. And we are going to overachieve that by about $100 million to $125 million is our expectation. We are working through that right now. To your question about how much of that is repeatable in the future, we are in the throes of analyzing that. To Chris’ point, we have learned a lot here in the last almost 8 months, where we have been working remotely. We have had savings on travel and entertainment. We have had consulting dollar savings, training savings. We have looked at almost everything. And I think there will be things that fall to the bottom line, and we are going through that now. We would expect to provide you an update on that on our fourth quarter call, but there will be things that bleed through. We are just not ready to commit to how much of that is run rate in the future.
James Thalacker: Okay, great. I appreciate that. Thanks for the time.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Jeremy Tonet: Hi good morning. I just want to speak more on the strategic review. And could you speak more to the financial considerations here? And namely, would ExGen require a bunch of equity to separate from the business, if that is something you could share any details there? And how should we think about the funding needs, growth prospects at Exelon’s Utilities under an independent scenario without the support from ExGen cash flows?
Christopher Crane: Well, there is still a lot of work going on right now. I don’t think we have an anticipation of that. We are still trying to figure out what level of the ratings that we keep. But Dan, do you want to take it?
Daniel Eggers: Yes. Thanks, Chris. I mean, Jeremy, I think it is a good question. Right now, I think it is probably a little early to start making calls around balance sheet and capital allocation decisions. You could imagine amongst all the factors we are considering with this review, looking at the credit metrics, working with the agencies, thinking through that is going to be an aspect. Thinking about how ExGen would use the free cash flow that is been funding the Utilities to be part of it, thinking about how the Utilities can fund their growth, both with their internally generated and retained cash flows, but also other sources of funding will all go into the decision. But a number of factors will go into our analysis over the coming months.
Jeremy Tonet: That is very helpful. And just wondering if you are in a position to share any feedback that you have received in Illinois with response to the retirement announcements that you put out recently?
Christopher Crane: No. There is some disappointment, as you can imagine, from the communities. There is disappointment from employees. And these are not the first nuclear plants we have had to shut down. Some will say that we make enough money already, we should not shut them down, but that is just not the way businesses work. And so you have to work through the reaction. And the two major constituents that are going to feel the pain here with us shutting these units down, because we are losing so much money, are the employees and the communities. If you look at the taxes and what we provide in the community as far as employment in commerce and - it is not easy. And so you can imagine those communities are trying to figure out what they can do to support us staying - keeping those plants open. But haven’t heard a lot from the legislative side. And I will let Kathleen and Bill jump in on that side.
Kathleen Barron: Yes. Chris, I can jump in. I mean, as you know, the legislature is not in session. So there has been continued work on potential clean energy legislation through the governor’s working group and similar efforts on both the Senate side and the House side. But until the legislature is back in session, we won’t have a sense of where that is going. But I agree with you that the impact, both on the employees and the communities around the plants, as well as the sort of broader communities in Illinois are watching this because to the extent these plants shut down, what will happen is fossil plants will ramp up, and that will affect communities around the state that are already struggling with air pollution and the effects of COVID. So a lot of folks are watching it for sure.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. Understood. And if I could just ask one last one here. How do you see proposed multiyear plans impacting your return to 9% to 10% ROE target and the sustainability of maintaining that range?
Christopher Crane: Yes. I will let Calvin answer that one. We have had a couple punches in the gut this year that brought us back down with storms and some other things. But Calvin, you want to cover that?
Calvin Butler: Absolutely, Chris and good morning. What I would say is that our whole process and working with our regulators in our jurisdictions around multiyear plans was geared to really create a foundation for long-term growth and also giving transparency and accountability to our customers on how this was going. So it is our commitment that we are going to remain in that 9% to 10%, but it is going to be done in a way where it is transparent to our customers and we are able to invest in our system for just to continue to operate a safe and reliable system. So that is the commitment, that is what we are discussing, and we are on course to meet that obligation, as you have heard in Maryland and now in D.C. with both of our utilities in Maryland and in D.C. And we already have very constructive environments in our other jurisdictions. So we are moving forward with that.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. That is great. Thanks that is it for me.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: So if I can pick up where Jeremy left off a little bit, can you talk about the balance sheet, especially under any prospects of a spin here? Just want to hear clearly from you all how you are thinking about it. The rating agencies have talked these broadly about ExGen being an investment-grade entity. If I can ask you this way, how committed are you to IG metrics under a spin? I know that you have kind of alluded to this earlier in the call, but I just want to be extra clear about this. And then subsequently, it seems as if in past periods, one of the calculations here has been the implications to the retail business. Can you talk about that side of the equation under any strategic shift?
Christopher Crane: Joe and Jim, do you want to tag team that one?
Joseph Nigro: Yes. I think, Chris, the answer to Julien’s question around how committed we are to investment grade, we take our strong balance sheet and our strong investment-grade ratings that we have today, obviously, very seriously. As you mentioned, we are still in the process of evaluating what the spin would look like and all the ramifications of that. And that includes impacts to all the stakeholders you mentioned, the rating agencies being one of those and how it would impact the rating of a Genco that stand alone. But at this point, it is too early to commit to anything along those lines. And with that, I will turn it over to Jim to talk about the retail business.
James McHugh: Yes, sure. Thanks, gentlemen. And Julien, I guess, likewise, we are working through - over the next period of time over the next few months, we are going to work with the finance team to understand and how we can continue to optimize our business. Our customer-serving business is really the large portion of our overall earnings capability that we bring to the Genco and cash flow capability that we bring to the Genco. We are committed to that. We want to keep that going, and we will work through the structures and the product structures that we need to maintain and to continue to serve those customers and then optimize the management in all the way through the spot market of managing the load and the generation output. So I think we will make sure the impacts are such a way that we can maintain that focus all on the customer and keep our products going and the growth that we see in that business.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: And further kind of clarification, if it is. First, Chris, on carbon and the subject of how that might ultimately translate back to your all’s portfolio here. How do you think the election could impact that? Clearly recognizing states’ rights and a lot of these PPA programs ultimately end up - for the state, right, to implement one way or another. Given that context, how do you think about carbon today as potentially implemented in Illinois eventually?
Christopher Crane: So what we are trying to do is work at the state level. We have had little traction at the federal level, and it is very polarizing as you know. It doesn’t matter who gets elected, it is still going to be a polarizing issue. So working it through the states and then through the markets because you have got the cross-state leakages is where we have been focused. We will have to see what happens tomorrow and what happens in the House and the Senate, the legislative body where they want to go. We hope they do it as a technology-neutral approach versus what some size of the house and the Senate have gone at technologies versus outcomes. But we will have to see. We are still going to fight at the state level and the market level to make sure that we get the right valuation for our assets. We are the largest non-carbon producing entity with no remunerations for those assets. But like I said earlier, it is nice for editorial or an editor or a politician to say we are looking for a bailout. We are looking to be able to compete with the other non-carbon that people have decided to provide a payment, a valuation for that low carbon output. But when you look at the largest non-carbon emitting source in the country and the largest Non-carbon emitting company in the country and they are competing against other resources that are getting compensated for the value of that, it is just frustrating. But you will pick up the paper tomorrow and somebody will write that Exelon is looking for a bailout. We don’t care about a bailout. We just want to compete. If we don’t compete, we will shut units down.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Understood. quite clear. Thanks Chris and team.
Christopher Crane: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra from Evercore. Your line is now open.
Durgesh Chopra: Hey guys, thanks for including me in. Maybe just one quick one on the quarter, and then I want to go back to the strategic review. Just on the quarter, you showed this projected cash flow slide with the 2020 balance. The balance is significantly lower, like $400 million lower versus the Q2 call and your guidance is up. So just wondering what drives that.
Joseph Nigro: Yes. Chris, I can take that.
Christopher Crane: Take that Joe. Yes.
Joseph Nigro: Yes. So yes, there is a couple of things going on. Our free cash flow from our operations across the enterprise were up for the quarter. But we did see - because of that, number one, we had an assumption of kind of less requirement for working capital needs. And then more importantly, we had some movement in cash flow on other activity related to Exelon Generation, and there were just a number of small factors at normal-type quarter activity that moved the cash flow for the quarter, even though the earnings were up pretty materially versus the range we would given last quarter.
Durgesh Chopra: Okay. That is helpful. Understood. And just really quickly, Chris, you mentioned FRR not a gating factor. Maybe just to the extent that you can, could you procedurally talk about the next steps here? And if there is a time line that internally you guys are working on to get this strategic review over?
Christopher Crane: Yes. I can tell you that although the FRR and the legislation is critical for the communities and the employees, we have to make our business decisions. I think we are going through the review right now and trying to evaluate the complications of the potential separation, but we wouldn’t use that as the gating factor. So once we get through the very complicated review, we would like to provide a whole lot more color on the fourth quarter call. Not guaranteeing were done or saying we would be done by then, but that will be the view of where we think we are heading. Dan, I don’t know if you want to say anything else?
Daniel Eggers: No, Chris, I think you have covered it.
Christopher Crane: Alright.
Durgesh Chopra: Okay guys. Thanks so much. Great quarter.
Christopher Crane: Thanks.
Operator: At this time, I’m showing no further questions, I would like to turn the call back over to Chris Crane for closing remarks.
Christopher Crane: Yes. I just want to thank everybody for joining the call. It is a busy day. Election’s going on, all kinds of concern about stability in the country. And so for us to be able to share your time, it is appreciated. I really want to thank the employees for their commitment and dedication. We have had a lot of stuff going on this year, not only the COVID, the storms, and the things that they have had to work through. And I hope that you and your families are safe and healthy. And with that, I will close the call.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-08-04 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to Exelon's Second Quarter Earnings Call. My name is Nora and I will be your events specialist today. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. Please note that today's webcast is being recorded. During the presentation, we will have a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn today's program over to Dan Eggers, Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance. Sir, the floor is yours.
Daniel Eggers: Thank you, Nora. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Leading the call today are Chris Crane, Exelon's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Joe Nigro, Exelon's Chief Financial Officer. They're joined by other members of Exelon's senior management team who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. We issued our earnings release this morning along with the presentation, both of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of Exelon's website. The earnings release and other matters, which we discuss during today's call, contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today's material and comments made during this call. Please refer to today's 8-K and Exelon's other SEC filings for discussions of risk factors and other factors, including uncertainties surrounding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts and expectations. Today's presentation also includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for reconciliations between the non-GAAP measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures. I'll now turn the call over to Chris Crane, Exelon's CEO.
Christopher Crane: Thanks Dan and I appreciate everybody joining the call this morning and spending time with us. Starting off, as you've seen from our releases this morning, the GAAP basis -- on a GAAP basis, we earned $0.53 per share; on a non-GAAP basis, we earned $0.55 per share. We had a great quarter, outperforming our guidance range of $0.35 to $0.45 per share due to achieving cost savings earlier than planned. Joe will get into it. Our load assumptions came out how we expected, but we've had excellent operations, but also have confronted some serious challenges throughout the quarter. First, ComEd reached an agreement with U.S. Attorney's office in Illinois, that concludes -- includes a three-year deferred prosecution agreement and a payment of $200 million, which ends the investigations into ComEd and Exelon. We have taken robust actions to identify and address deficiencies, including enhancing our compliance governance to prevent this type of conduct. We apologize for the past conduct that did not live up to our values. These new policies and oversight will ensure it won't happen again. We're extremely disappointed in the seriousness of the past misconduct, and we know many stakeholders understandably feel the same disappointment. We have -- you have our commitment that we will take every possible step to earn back the confidence and trust we have lost with others. This will not happen overnight and it will be a formidable task, but we are resolved to get there. Second, the country is addressing the important issues of racial and inequity and social justice, and we are doing so as well. Our employees and communities, our customers are diverse, and we have a critical leadership role in pursuing equity and fairness for all those who are facing ingrained injustice and discrimination. That means living our values both within and outside the walls of our company. Sponsoring job programs in underserved communities is a big focus of ours, developing a larger base of diverse suppliers in our footprint, supporting through philanthropic and volunteerism a wide variety of organizations, pursuing equity, and economic development, making it clear what our values are through action and speaking up when we see injustice. Focus -- our focus on our values of respect, diversity and inclusion cannot waiver, and we know Black Lives Matter, all of our diverse communities matter, and we're standing to protect them and help serve them. We've doubled down on our work to support our diverse and underserved customers and communities since we all are impacted by continued inequity, and we must do more. Switching to the COVID issue. COVID-19 continues to impact our communities. We remain focused on safety of our employees, running our operations at the best-in-class levels and supporting our customers and communities, incorporate pandemic-related policies into our management model that keep our employees and our contractors safe, implementing responsible reentry plans that predict -- are predicting on key milestones that will ensure employees' safety and confidence that they can come back to the workplace. We've created contingency plans to monitor system configuration and allow us for rapid emergency response in storm or normal operations. And providing a deferred payment arrangement for residential and low income customers that are affected by the high rate of unemployment that we're dealing with in the communities that we serve. On the operational highlights. Operations are strong with the pandemic conditions and extreme storms across the territory. In early June, PECO faced its eighth largest storm in history, which brought sustained winds of over 40 miles per hour and gusts of more than 60 miles per hour. 400 customers were out within an hour of the storm beginning, and -- but we were able to restore 80% of those customers with widespread damage in 36 hours. We had already prepared and drilled new procedures for storm response during the pandemic. 80% of our back office storm rolls are performed now remotely. Within 48 hours, 3,750 contractors and mutual assistance personnel were safely on-site in the PECO region to restore customers and onboard -- they were onboarded electronically, which -- we continue to develop the techniques for that. Despite the pandemic and the active storm season, all Utilities are in top quartile for outage duration and outage frequency. Nuclear had its best second quarter capacity factor in more than a decade at 95.4%. Safety -- we safely completed in this quarter five appealing [ph] averages. There's been eight for the year, and most ahead of schedule while protecting our employees and the contractors. Power dispatch match was 97.4% and our renewable capture rate was 92.7%. So, overall, very, very strong operational performance. We also continue to focus on our environmental stewardship. In July, we released our 2019 Corporate Sustainability Report that shows the accomplishments that we made. Benchmarking air emissions report once again found Exelon as the lowest carbon emission rate of the top 20 investor-owned power producers, nearly five times less than the number two producer and the largest producer of carbon-free generation. In 2019, utility energy efficiency programs helped customers save 22.3 million megawatt hours and avoid 8.7 million metric tons of carbon. Exelon Utilities set a goal to electrify 30% of the vehicle fleet by 2025 and 50% by 2030, avoiding more than 65,000 metric tons of carbon from 2020 to 2030. We're committed to deliver affordable zero emissions power in helping our customers and our community reduce the harmful emissions that there -- exist in their communities. These efforts are important to transition to a clean energy economy, but they are not enough to address the climate crisis. We continue to advocate for policies at the state and federal levels that will address the challenges. Now, I'm going to turn the call over to Joe for the financial update. 
Joseph Nigro: Thank you, Chris and good morning everyone. Today, I will cover our second quarter results, our quarterly financial updates, including trailing 12-month ROEs at the Utilities, and our hedge disclosures. Turning to slide nine, we earned $0.53 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.55 per share on a non-GAAP basis, which exceeded our guidance range of $0.35 to $0.45 per share. Exelon Utilities delivered a combined $0.29 per share net of holding company expenses. Utility earnings were modestly higher relative to expectations, driven largely by ComEd formula rate timing and O&M timing, which was partially offset by the record-setting storm in the Philadelphia area, which cost for $0.04 per share to PECO. ExGen outperformed expectations for the second quarter, earning $0.26 per share. The upside was largely driven by lower O&M, where we saw targeted savings for 2020 coming sooner than we originally budgeted. These savings were realized by lower outage cost, lower labor costs, travel and entertainment, and training costs being lower as well. On the last call, we introduced -- we announced $250 million of savings across the organization to help offset the impacts of COVID-19, which we expected would be more weighted to the back half of this year. The organization has been hard at work and is on track to achieve these savings in 2020, with some coming earlier than anticipated, as you can see in our second quarter results. During the quarter, load at the Utility and Constellation was in line with our expectations. For the third quarter, we expect earnings of $0.80 to $0.90 per share, and we are affirming our full year guidance of $2.80 to $3.10 per share. On slide 10, we show our quarter-over-quarter earnings walk. The $0.55 per share in second quarter of this year was $0.05 per share lower than the second quarter of 2019. Exelon Utilities less Holdco earnings were down $0.10 per share compared with last year. The decrease was driven primarily by storm costs at PECO, ComEd formula rate timing, and higher bad debt expense, partially offset by favorable weather at PECO. ExGen's earnings were up $0.05 per share compared with last year, benefiting from lower O&M and income taxes. This was partially offset by lower capacity revenue, primarily in PJM, and the impacts of COVID-19 on load and bad debt expense. Turning to slide 11, looking at our Utility returns on a consolidated basis, we remain in our consolidated 9% to 10% target range, with a 9.1% trailing 12-month ROE as of the second quarter. Earned ROEs for the Utilities remained above 9%, but dipped from last quarter by 60 basis points. The decline was primarily driven by lower earnings at PECO as a result of the storm --- June storm, higher bad debt at PECO and PHI, and declining treasury yields, which impacted ComEd's ROE. As a reminder, this calculation is backward looking, so as we think about the next couple of quarters, you should expect to see some pressure on ROEs as we roll off the better pre-COVID-19 earnings quarters and carry the burdens of PECO's poor first quarter weather and second quarter storms as well as the impact of lower treasuries on ComEd. These headwinds are captured in our full year guidance, so you should have the financial impact already assumed. Looking further into the future, we remain focused on delivering stronger earned returns at the Utilities and supporting our growth targets. Turning to slide 12, I since the last call, there were some important developments on the regulatory front. First, regulators in all our jurisdictions have approved COVID-19 recovery mechanisms. Second, BGE was the first utility in Maryland to file a multiyear plan after getting the green light on this approach from the Maryland PSC in February. The filing will support planned capital investments from 2020 to 2023 as well investments made in late 2019 to maintain an increased reliability and benefit customer service for our electric and gas distribution system. The critical infrastructure sector will be a key component to Maryland's economic recovery, and BGE has designed a multiyear energy infrastructure investment and customer relief plan to assist with the economic recovery. BGE will invest more than $5 billion to fund enhancements to the safety, reliability, security, resiliency and environmental attributes of the grid and improve customers' experience. BGE is expected to support more than 26,000 jobs and have at least $15 billion of economic impact over the three-year period, which is critical as communities manage through the pandemic recovery. In conjunction with the filing, BGE will provide customer relief and assistance in 2020 to 2023 for limited income customers and small businesses. We expect an order this December. Third, in June, Pepco filed their multiyear plan enhanced proposal in D.C. with the PSC, addressing the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and current economic challenges. The enhanced plan would expand and establish a series of customer programs, targeting those that have been hardest hit, including small businesses, non-profits, and our residential customers. The flexibility of the multiyear plan structure provides Pepco the ability to offer these innovative adjustments in response to the pandemic. We expect an order by year-end. Fourth, ComEd's annual formula rate update filing is expected to be decided in December of this year. This filing requests a reduction in delivery rates for the third year in a row and the fifth decrease in 10 years. Since the formula rate has been in place, ComEd's investments in modernizing the grid's reliability, resiliency, and clean energy growth have improved reliability by 70%, while keeping bills lower than they were nearly a decade ago. And finally, last month, Delmarva and Maryland received a final order for its distribution rate case. The Maryland commission approved the proposed order by the Public Utility Law Judge that recommended an $11.7 million increase in annual electric distribution revenues. Importantly, the order increased Delmarva's allowed ROE by 10 basis points to 9.6%. We believe it is recognition of strong performance and reliability and customer satisfaction. More details on the rate cases can be found on slides 24 through 30 of the appendix. Turning to slide 13, we are continuing our robust capital deployment program at the Utilities, investing $1.5 billion during the second quarter. Year-to-date, we have invested $2.9 billion of capital into our Utilities, improving our infrastructure and increasing reliability and resiliency for the benefit of all of our customers. Despite some early challenges from the pandemic, we are on track for the year. Today, I will discuss two projects that are part of these efforts and will bring improved performance to our customers in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. The first project is Atlantic City Electric Moss Mills - Moss Farm transmission line rebuild, which is a $69 million project to rebuild 15 miles of 69 kV transmission lines and poles. This project upgrades a critical transmission line that runs through the entire Northeastern portion of the Atlantic City territory in New Jersey spanning three different counties. Additionally, the Chestnut Neck Substation will be retired and replaced with a modernized mobile-ready substation, allowing for incremental flexibility. The second project is PECO's upland substation project in Philadelphia. The $68 million project includes replacement of an existing 75-year old substation with a new modernized substation and extension of 230 kV transmission lines and new 13 kV feeders into West Philadelphia. This project improves infrastructure that serves 10,000 customers in the Overbrook and Bala areas, including hospitals and universities. It will also enable customers to implement solar energy solutions. PECO engaged local diverse companies to participate with project implementation and construction, which provided approximately 250,000 construction hours. On slide 14, we provide our gross margin update and current hedging strategy at the generation company. Turning to the table, there is no change in total gross margin in 2020 or 2021 since the last quarter. We executed new business consistent with our plan. In 2020, open gross margin is flat to the first quarter, and we executed $100 million of power new business and $50 million of non-power new business. In 2021, open gross margin increased by $200 million due to increasing power prices across most regions. This was offset by our hedges and lower capacity revenues in New York and uncleared capacity from the PJM incremental auctions. In 2021, we executed $50 million of power new business and $50 million of non-power new business. We remain slightly behind our ratable hedging program in 2021 by 4% to 7% when considering cross commodity hedges. On slide 15, I'll give a brief update on Constellation's business and what we've seen to date on load performance. During the second quarter, commercial and industrial customer load was in line with our expectations. Load was within our down 9% to 15% projected range, although it varied from week to week. Our load forecast for the remainder of the year is unchanged. As we get more information, we are getting a better handle on the impacts from COVID-19, which is helping us to monitor how specific regions, customers and industries are behaving with respect to COVID-19 impacts as they continue to evolve. Additionally, we are working with our large customers to better understand their load impacts and outlook. Even as we evolve to an ever-changing landscape, our focus remains on being strategic partners with our customers and providing clean energy products. We work with our customers by providing proactive analytics and insights on their current loads, tools to manage and optimize in real-time, and navigate emerging trends such as electrification impacts to their businesses, while also reaching their environmental and sustainability goals. This partnership is key to our success and provides the most stability for our business via high retention rates and consistent margins. Moving on to slide 16, we are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and investment-grade credit ratings. Our consolidated FFO to debt is projected to be 18% for 2020, consistent with last quarter. This reflects the pressures from COVID-19 as discussed in detail last quarter. Looking at ExGen, we are ahead of our debt-to-EBITDA target of 3.0 times. For 2020, we expect to be at 2.5 times and 2.0 times when excluding nonrecourse debt. On the rating front, in July, Fitch affirmed our ratings and S&P took action to downgrade ComEd's issuer credit rating. However, S&P reaffirmed the senior secured and short-term ratings at ComEd, therefore, not impacting our anticipated cost of borrowing. Furthermore, S&P changed the ratings outlook for Exelon Corporate, PECO, Pepco Holdings, ComEd, and ExGen to negative from stable. While we were disappointed in these actions, we remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and investment-grade credit ratings. We have successfully executed all of our planned long-term debt financings for the year. The 2020 financing plan was significantly accelerated to take advantage of attractive market conditions and provide ample short-term liquidity, leaving us well positioned for the balance of the year. The issuances in the second quarter were all meaningfully oversubscribed, and we secured record-setting low interest rates at the Utilities. Thank you. I'll now turn the call back to Chris for his closing remarks.
Christopher Crane: Thanks Joe and thanks for the comprehensive report. Finally, turning to slide 17, I'll close on Exelon's value proposition, which is unchanged. We're focused on growing our utilities, targeting 7.3% rate base growth and a 6% to 8% EPS growth through 2023. We will use the free cash flow as we have done from the Genco to support utility growth, pay down Genco debt and support some of the external dividend. We continue to optimize the value of the Gen business by seeking fair compensation for our zero emitting generation fleet, closing uneconomic plants and monetizing assets and maximizing their value through the Constellation avenue. We will sustain strong investment-grade credit metrics. We have remained committed to that and will not waiver. And we'll grow our dividend at this point right now annually at 5% through 2020. The strategic underpinning of this value proposition is sound, effective in providing tangible benefits for our stakeholders. Operator, we can now turn the call over for questions. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open.
Shar Pourreza: Hey good morning guys.
Christopher Crane: Good morning.
Joseph Nigro: Good morning.
Shar Pourreza: Just two questions here. First, on financing, as we sort of think about some of the moving pieces, like obviously, the sizable organic growth of the Utilities, minimal headroom from a credit perspective, the CENG buyout, potentially maybe higher uncollectibles, Joe, do you sort of currently envision any kind of potential scenarios, maybe in the next 12 months, that would require you to have to issue equity?
Joseph Nigro: Yes. Shar, thank you for the question. And as you know, we've received this question many times over the last few months. As I said in my prepared remarks, we're committed to a strong investment-grade rating, and it's a central tenant to our business and it has been quite frankly for a very long time. We go through a very rigorous planning process, and we disclose the results of that process each year on our fourth quarter call and under that most recent plan, there is no equity issuance in the plan. Last month, we kicked off that process for our next plan that will take us through the end of this year. And as you can imagine, Shar, there's many variables that go into that process, market prices for power, obviously, treasury rates, our load forecast, our O&M projections, what our capital plans are, funding strategy when you think about debt. And obviously, we still have the FRR out there, and that will be taken into account. So, what I would say is we don't take any one of those variables in isolation. They obviously all work together to create the basis for our plan. We've been successful in -- with our strong balance sheet and growing our Utilities, and we've been harvesting the cash flow of ExGen to help do that. We also look at the levers we have, right? We've been pretty successful with our cost cuttings over the last five years, obviously. We've sold some assets. We look at alternative financing arrangements. And the last thing on that list is equity. But in our current plan, there is no need for equity and as we move through the planning process and that takes us through the end of the year, we'll relay or communicate the outcome of that on our fourth quarter call. 
Shar Pourreza: Great. And then, Chris, just on -- a question for you on strategy. I mean, in the past, it felt like you weren't confident if the ExGen business could be spun out without IG rating sufficient scale. With what we're seeing with IPPs eventually going IG, which would certainly alleviate the liquidity requirements, others looking at their own merchant fossil fleet as they de-risk, can you give us any refreshed thoughts on the Genco as a strategic fit within the portfolio over the long-term? I guess do you now have some incremental confidence that the Genco business could eventually stand on its own without the support from corporate? I mean a transaction would obviously alleviate balance sheet concerns and in the valuation disconnect, and we've obviously seen a few players looking to simplify kind of their own structures. So, whether we're talking about the entire fleet or simply the fossil fuel assets, has your strategic thinking kind of changed over the past, let's say, 12 months? 
Christopher Crane: So, it is something that we look at on a regular basis, and we do a deep dive strategic review of the benefits of keeping the two companies bolted -- or the two lines bolted together versus what are the alternatives. We have enjoyed a period of time of free cash flow from the Genco that has allowed us to have a significant investment into the Utilities for the benefit of the customers over a period of time since our last review. As you can imagine, it's something that we always look at. And I understand the basis of the question with the recent announcements from two other companies on where they have decided to go. But right now, there's work to be done to create the certainty and the value of the cash flows that would be maintained to allow a company to either stand on its own or continue to support the growth of the other side of the business. And so we're in the middle of trying to work through a legislative strategy in Illinois. We're on firm ground in New York. I know there's work going on in New Jersey. We have to look at the value of the assets and what's going on in Maryland and what can be done there legislatively to compensate the assets for their low carbon output. So, it's something we look at, and it's something that we think we have been very clear on from the beginning. And it's good to see other IPPs coming along and understanding the value of being investment-grade and not having stressed balance sheets with commodity cyclicality like we see. But we think we can improve the value further and the strength further to be able to serve the states and the communities that we serve with good, well-paying jobs, a strong balance sheet. And then we will continue to assess to -- do the assets stay bolted together through a corporate holding company structure or is it better for all stakeholders involved to have some type of separation of the entities. The one thing I can tell you is there's an annual review on all the non-nuclear assets to see if they propose more value to others than we have projected for ourselves, and that annual review will continue. And as we see assets that could perform better in somebody else's portfolio and we could monetize those assets, we'll do that. There's assets that we'll shut down that aren't carrying their own weight. There are assets in New England that have a finite period of time under the ISO's regulation. And so there is a constant flux in our nonnuclear business that we'll continue to evaluate with our focus on strong balance sheet debt reduction and optimizing what we have on the balance sheet.
Shar Pourreza: Terrific. Thanks Joe and Chris and congrats on good results and tough year. Appreciate it.
Christopher Crane: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Fleishman of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Steven Fleishman: Yes, hi. Thanks.
Christopher Crane: Hey Steve.
Steven Fleishman: Hey Chris. The Illinois, I guess, ComEd deferred agreement and fine. Could you just maybe give kind of views on implications that you're seeing for addressing the clean energy law and -- if any? And then also on future of the rate-making structure. Any thought there [ph] would be helpful.
Christopher Crane: Sure. I'm going to let Joe Dominguez jump in on the second half of the question. He's here with us in the room. The first half of the question, does it affect the Exelon Generation's drive for legislation on changing the capacity market. There's an obvious issue that trust has been eroded. Although it's isolated to ComEd, it has effect on all the entities. And so there's been a lot of press reporting and there's been some disappointed stakeholders and is rightfully so. And so our job is to rebuild the trust of those that we serve and make sure that we can show that we have done a fantastic job, and Joe will cover some of this, in the investments that have been made at ComEd and what the rate structure is done for us. It has been totally super beneficial to the consumer. But there's a period of time where we're just going to have to continue outreach conversation and show our commitment to ethical behavior that doesn't compromise our integrity or the trustworthiness of us going forward. So, we're still working to engage with stakeholders on a capacity market redesign. It's very critical for us to get it done. As you know, PJM is going to run an auction. And there's a strong sense from our analytic folks that the -- some of the nuclear units are not going to be picked up in that auction. Some are uneconomic at this point right now and some more may become uneconomic. And our commitment to you has always been if we can't find a way or path to profitability, we'll have to shut them down, which is a sad turn of events that will affect the state's goals on carbon reduction, it will severely affect the communities around the plants and the very high paying, critical jobs that those communities benefit from. So, -- but it's an unfortunate thing. We apologize for what went on. We had a code of conduct that clearly defined the behaviors, but it wasn't enough. And so we've put controls in place to ensure it will never happen again. And we have to work with stakeholders, not only legislative and elected folks, but our customers and our other stakeholders and the communities that we serve to rebuild that trust. One thing I can tell you is this company is committed to doing the right thing for the communities that we serve, not only through philanthropic activities, but also volunteerism. I think you can look at us in all the communities we serve, and we're probably the strongest corporate partner out there, and we're going to continue that. And we know that we're only as good as a company as the communities that we serve. So, that's what we've got to get back to. This is the most unfortunate thing to happen, not just because of time, it's because of trust. And it's because of a small amount of individuals making decisions that should not have been done, and it shouldn't have gone undetected. But with that said, we still remain confident that the consumers have been protected, served. And as you heard me say, we have lower rates and high reliability than we did 10 years ago. And so that's because we have a strong regulations -- a regulatory body that's focused on the same thing that we're focused on, is reliable, affordable, clean energy. With that, I'll let Joe talk about what his thoughts are on rates making and regulatory process.
Joseph Dominguez: Thanks Chris. I think -- Steve, I think Chris covered a lot of it, just to level set for the folks on the call. The formula rate continues through the end of 2022. So, we'll -- we have some additional time to see what the future looks like, whether it's a continuation of the formula with additional transparency or a return to traditional rate making. As both Chris and Joe talked about, we think the formula has provided enormous benefits to our customers. If you take a look at page seven on the deck, you see the key metrics, and you see all green for ComEd. But in a certain sense, that almost understates the performance at ComEd. We are not only top quartile in all those dimensions, we're actually top decile in all of those dimensions. And last year at ComEd, we had the best-performing year ever in the history of the company, over 110 years best-performing year. And as I look at the metrics at the close of July, we are tracking 20% better than last year in SAIFI and 11% better in CAIDI. So, we've still got a number of months to go, but very, very proud of the team at ComEd and the operational performance. Customer satisfaction is highest it's ever been. We were J.D. Power's number 1 Midwest utility at the end of 2019. We had never achieved that objective. So, I focus on that because -- for two reasons. One, the transformation that's occurred at ComEd and it's been recognized here. And second, we always tell you that from an Exelon perspective, and Chris says this virtually every call, that we think of good regulatory and political outcomes as being driven by good operational performance. And I think at ComEd, we can lay claim to perhaps having the best operational performance in the country. So, we'll see what that looks like going forward. From comments from the governor's office that we've recently seen, it's clear that, at least from his perspective, the formula was tied to the transformation that's occurred, the investments in smart meters and other devices. And to the extent that there is a renewal or a new methodology that's installed, that's going to have to be related to a new policy objective, and that's tied up in a lot of the clean energy goals. But I guess from my perspective, Steve, whether we continue with the formula or whether we return to traditional rate making, I think the entire team at ComEd believes it's got to be constructive. And one reason we're confident in that is that there's been an evolution in Illinois. As we've been in the formula, Illinois policy for ratemaking has evolved. The state now uses forward-looking test years and the gas utilities have used that. That's been constructive. We're decoupled as a state. We have bad debt and other rider mechanisms that are strong and transparent and better than we were in 2011 when we first went to the formula. But I guess the biggest difference that I would point to is the operational performance between 2011 and now is so much better. If you take the thesis that operational performance drives regulatory results, then in a certain sense, the outcomes we were seeing in 2011 were driven by poor operational performance at ComEd and today, that's a different story. And so the final point I would make is we've had an eight-year history of making the investments in underground cables and poles and including smart devices across our system. Not only -- the commission has seen that now for eight years. What we'd be continuing, whether it's in a formula rate or traditional rate making, is those programs that have been wildly successful in terms of improving reliability, integrating clean energy, making the system more resilient in the face of climate change, and doing all of that stuff and keeping customer bills low. As Chris said, our average bill today -- or I think Joe said this, is lower than it was 10 years ago. And in part, that's a story about wholesale power prices. But in big measure, it's about energy efficiency at ComEd and the overall efficiency of the organization. So, the punchline for me is this, Steve. Regardless of whether we're in formula or not, I think we've got good alignment in terms of the investments we're making in the system. We're going to continue to make those prudent investments going forward, and I think the results are going to be constructive. 
Steven Fleishman: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America. Your line is open.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey good morning. Thanks for the time.
Christopher Crane: Hey good morning. Thanks for joining.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Thank you. Listen, perhaps just to pick up where we left off on the last question, if I can. Can you speak specifically to the Utility and bending the relationship in terms of the franchise arrangement? I mean maybe that's a Joe question again, but can you provide some context in that process, the back and forth, obviously, in the public? And then at the same time, just to clarify the last response, if you can. In an event in which the formula rates are not extended, it would be conceivable that you go back to a traditional ratemaking contract in which you would benefit or at least you would have available to you those mechanisms you just alluded to, Joe. I just want to make sure we're explicit about that as well.
Joseph Nigro: Yes, that's right. Chris is it okay if I go?
Christopher Crane: Yes, go, please.
Joseph Nigro: Yes, sure. So Julien, let me answer the short question that you asked last first. Yes, if we return to traditional rate making, we would intend to file a rate case using a forward-looking test year, and that rate case would likely be filed in the first quarter of 2023. So, that's number one. In terms of the franchise agreement, we've been through a process with the city where we've been meeting periodically just about every week, although that got interrupted a bit with COVID. We're making good progress, I thought, on the franchise agreement. Then we have the DPA. And we had a hearing last week with City Council and also some input from the Mayor's office. The Mayor's office indicated that from her perspective, two things need to happen before we could continue the conversation around the franchise agreement. One is we have to deal with the ethics reforms and the compliance mechanisms. And from my perspective, that is assuring the city that the measures we've taken are the appropriate ones and then having reporting requirements and other things with the city so that they understand that we're implementing those and that we're moving forward appropriately. The Mayor has a big ethics agenda, so we're going to embrace that ethics agenda. Here, the hiring of Dave Glockner, which we've talked about before, is quite an important piece. Dave has -- comes to us with an impeccable reputation. As many of you know, he came out of the U.S. Attorney's office, serving as Chief of the Criminal Division at that office for 11 years. But most importantly, and for folks outside of Northern Illinois, you don't see this, but Dave has an unbelievable reputation within the community.  And for folks like the Mayor who have served in the U.S. Attorney's office as a colleague of Dave's, that's quite an important point. But we need to work through ensuring that we have a transparent mechanism of providing regular updates to the city in terms of the adherence to the new protocols that we've adopted. That's one piece of it. The Mayor has also indicated that we need to be committed to the goals of sustainability, to the goals of equitable and affordable energy for all customers in the city. And that's kind of the sweet spot of our strategy around electrification, around clean energy, energy efficiency, the many jobs programs we sponsor. So, we look forward to a good conversation on that. There's a tangential issue relating to the franchise agreement that being the issue of the city's takeover or municipalization of the grid here in Chicago. We've spoken about that previously on this call. Commissioner Reynolds, who is leading for the city the negotiations with ComEd, testified at the hearing last week and indicated that the city will have a feasibility study out shortly on the possibility of municipalization. At least he indicated in his testimony that, that would -- that the view would be that, that would not be feasible. And there's a few big reasons for that. One is it's a $5 billion to $6 billion system and then the separation cost would be another $5 billion. So, I think we'll tie together a few of these issues here. We need to assure the city of the reforms I've talked about. We'll have a conversation about the programs around clean energy, electrification, jobs programs, benefits to customers' affordability. And then I imagine we'll continue to have this backdrop of municipalization. But if the feasibility study comes out as Commissioner Reynolds indicated, I don't think that's going to necessarily be a pathway. But we have our work to do with the city. I'm confident we will get there. It may take a year or more to hash out. That's something Commissioner Reynolds indicated as well. But the way our franchise agreement works, and I've talked about this previously on this call, is that if it has not continued, it simply rolls over year-to-year on its own terms. It's like a lease in that sense where it just automatically renews year-to-year. So, that's probably more than you wanted to hear, Julien, but that's the whole story on the franchise agreement.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent guys. Thank you. I'll leave it there.
Operator: Our next question comes from Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Stephen Byrd: Hi, good morning.
Christopher Crane: Hey Stephen, how are you doing?
Stephen Byrd: Good. Congrats on a good quarter. Just want to follow-up on Shar's question just as you think about your credit outlook. Joe, you gave a very thorough response. I was just thinking through, I guess, your prior plan, which did not include equity, had you hitting the credit stats. And you mentioned in response to the last question, just a variety of things that could impact those credit stats. But I was just wondering at the high level, as you think about the kind of the major puts and takes that as you see it, that can impact your credit stats, I was thinking about, for example, Constellation on one end in terms of the temporarily weak demand. But what are kind of the bigger puts and takes that you're just thinking through as you think about your credit stats since the last time you had the full planning process?
Joseph Nigro: Yes, I think there's a number of elements associated with that, right? I mean, obviously, treasuries have an impact at ComEd. They have an impact on our pension and other things, right? You think about market prices, and you mentioned load, that clearly plays into it. We expect mostly to see recovery by the time we get into 2021. There is some minor impacts that we talked about the last quarter. We control things like cost, right? We'll continue to challenge ourselves in that regard. There's other variables, too, right? We just talked about the Illinois legislation, what is the outcome of that. That will have a -- obviously be a binary impact. How much capital are we putting into our Utilities and what that looks like? And all of those things go into the -- to the decision-making. Chris talked about on economic assets and actions around those. We've clearly sold assets where we thought the market had higher values on them. We've looked at alternative financings and have used project financing. We did the securitization of the receivables at Constellation. So, there's a lot of elements to it, Stephen. Some are kind of decisions we control. Others, we're part of and we're working on, and they build upon themselves. And ultimately, we -- our dividend, we have to make a recommendation to the Board at the end of this year, and we'll do that and determine how much capital we're putting in across our footprint and then from there, we'll see what the funding plan looks like.
Christopher Crane: The one thing that I would add is the uneconomic. We will not run plants and lose free cash flow or earning on assets that are not supporting themselves. It is very unfortunate for the communities that we serve, the employees, but we will not let the balance sheet get further deteriorated by non-profitable assets, then we will take swift action to resolve that dive in cash flow and earnings. So, we're doing everything possible to prevent that, but it's a reality. We've shut two units down in the recent years. We could not see a path to sustainability of those assets in the portfolio. Not the greatest decisions we ever had to make, and we understand the impact that has on the communities that we serve, the environmental goals of the states and the economic impact of the states. But maintaining an investment-grade that can support the remaining facilities is our main focus.
Stephen Byrd: That's very clear. Separately, just thinking about your cost control, you all have had good success in cost savings. Just thinking about potential benefits beyond the near term of those cost savings, is there any potential, for example, for that to create better customer rate headroom that could result in more CapEx at the Utilities? How do you think about sort of sustainability of cost savings? And if you're able to sustain some of those savings, sort of what other knock-on benefits you could see?
Christopher Crane: Well, as you know, on the third quarter call each year, we announce the next round of cost savings. I can tell you there's a significant effort and contingency planning going on within the generating company and the BSC, the Business Services Company. Now, on -- if we maintain the fleet as we have it, how are we going to do it more economically, how are we using technology. Then a significant amount of work in the financial organization, HR, legal, other organizations to look at the world differently. And we'll announce our next round probably in third quarter -- fourth quarter. I'm looking at Dan to make sure I'm answering right because he's responsible for this, and he's waving his hands at me. So, the fourth quarter call. But -- and we'll have a better picture of the future life of the nuclear fleet by that point. And if we are in the mode of unfortunately retiring plants, you can imagine that we'll have a significant reduction in the BSC overheads that could go back to the benefit of the customers from the modified Massachusetts formula. I wouldn't necessarily say it gives them more headroom to spend capital. We spend capital that is needed capital for reliability and customer service. But it should -- if the -- it should benefit the customers and take some of the overhead burden off of the utilities as we continue to refine how we can do work cheaper, better, faster, be very efficient, while serving the communities and the customers. There's one thing we've learned during this pandemic. Our real estate footprint may not have to be as big as it is right now. We are very efficiently working with about 17,000 people working remotely. And there's a group right now that's assessing not only a safe reentry around the first of the year for some portion of the workforce that's not on the line and maintaining the system or the plants or backing those individuals up. But we will take a very strong look at all expenses around and footprint around facilities. We've closed the books with the controller's organization, only having a few people come in for a couple of days. And audit has maintained its schedule and it's in-depth audit programs. So, we're doing a lot, and we're learning a lot, and I think that's going to translate into more savings as we go forward. But looking at Dan again, I guess I'm not going to be committal on the time. But they're all squirming around me right now. I'll -- we'll be back to you at the end of the year with that.
Stephen Byrd: That's great. Thank you so much. Appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Chris Crane. Please go ahead, sir.
Christopher Crane: Yes. Thank you all again for joining the call. I want to thank you for the time. I really want to thank our employees for their commitment and dedication. As you can imagine, onboarding 1,200 and contractors onto a nuclear site with all the site employees on deck, going through testing and screening and answering the questions and still getting stuff done at world-class performance and efficiency, our Utilities maintaining the highest levels of reliability. And right now, we've got 200 folks, 100 ComEd employees and 100 contractors, driving across the country to support our eastern Utilities for outages. So, I think they arrived today. And so the willingness and the dedication is fantastic. I hope that you and your families are safe and healthy. And with that, I'll close out the call.
Operator: Thanks to all our participants for joining us today. This concludes our presentation. You may now disconnect and have a good day.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-05-08 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to today's webcast. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. Please note that today's webcast is being recorded. During the presentation, we will have a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn today's program over to Dan Eggers, Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance. The floor is yours.
Daniel Eggers: Thank you, Mary. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Leading the call today are Chris Crane, Exelon's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Joe Nigro, Exelon's Chief Financial Officer. They're joined by other members of Exelon's senior management team, who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. We issued our earnings release this morning, along with the presentation, both of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of Exelon's website. The earnings release and other matters, which we discuss during today's call, contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today's material and comments made during this call. Please refer to today's 8-K and Exelon's other SEC filings for discussions of risk factors and other factors, including the uncertainty surrounding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts and expectations. Today's presentation also includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for reconciliations between the non-GAAP measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measure. I'll now turn the call over to Chris Crane, Exelon's CEO.
Christopher Crane: Thanks, Dan, and thanks to everybody that's joined today. I'll first start off with the first quarter results. We had a strong quarter even with one of the warmest winters we've seen in a long time. The GAAP basis earned $0.60 per share, non-GAAP basis earned $0.87 per share. Joe is going to cover all those details in his remark. We had very solid operations throughout the first quarter. First quartile outage frequency and duration and record-setting nuclear refueling outages that I'll go into further as we continue. Hearings on working groups in Illinois on Clean Energy legislation, which is very critical right now, are meeting. The discussion is going on, we still haven't determined how the legislature will get back into session to resume work, but I think they all understand the priority of what needs to be done, not only for energy, but the capital budgets and other issues in Illinois. So we will continue to work on that through May. Our number one focus throughout this pandemic has been focusing on the safety and wellbeing of our employees. Our employees are on a mission. They know we are mission-critical in as many as possible of working remotely in supporting the critical infrastructure. We have approximately 17,000 people, employees and another 8,000 contractors working remotely and being able to execute on their tasks without any faults. So our frontline workers, the 17,000 frontline workers and the contractors that are maintaining the electric gas system in the power plants, we’re protecting with PPE, social distancing and pre-screening. We have not laid-off or furloughed or reduced hours or pay as a result of the pandemic. We've done a couple things. Employees diagnosed with COVID remain in pay status and no charge to sick leave. Overall, we've had 102 employees have been diagnosed with COVID plus 25 contractors. 82 of those total count have returned back to work. And so we are continuing to focus on the health and safety and the wellbeing. We give full pay to employees that are being quarantined. If they've become in contact through our tracing mechanisms that we're providing at all of our facilities, we quarantine them from the required amount of time, which allows us to keep not only them and their families safe, but also other employees. We also expanded access to backup care for dependence. So those frontline employees are supporting frontline employees that need to be in the workspace out in the field do not have to worry about their children out of school or their elderly parents. So that's another service we are providing to the employees to keep everybody focused on their own safety, the job, one, keeping the grid up and keeping the gas flowing, and keeping the power plants running. On Slide 4, you'll see a big part of what we do, what we've always been doing and what we will continue to do is support our customers and communities. As you know, and you heard all the utilities suspended disconnects, waived new late fees and we did reconnect or reach out to customers that had been disconnected since the March 1 and offered to reconnect those individuals who had been disconnected. And this gives us the ability for people that are laid off or people that are in financially challenged times to have one of the most critical social and needed energy sources that we can provide. We also, at the Exelon Foundation and our companies, have contributed over more than $5.9 million to relief organizations, ensuring food banks and other programs can be supported during this time of need, and we'll continue to focus on that. But at the core of everything, after safety in the community is our operational excellence, which is even more critical right now. Keeping the lights on in this crisis, keeping the hospitals with power, healthcare providers, grocery stores, medical food production facilities, you can see the list of the priorities that are there. And we have to, as a company and an organization continue to have reliable service, and that is strong at the utilities. We've had spring storms already this year. We restored more than 350,000 customers across the service territories in late March and early April. We've been able to do that and test ourselves on moving in resources and being able to adequately and safely shelter our employees, but allow them to work safely in the field to restore the power. On the power side, the nuclear group has completed seven of eight refueling outages, all better than planned. There's one refueling outage left to go that will be closing up later in this month, a major rewind on the Ganey Station. But if you look at the majority of the plants, it's been world class performance with the outages being performed between 16 and 18 days. If you look about these trying times, we've only had 25 employees that have – 29 including contractors, 25 employees have been infected with the COVID virus, and all but four have returned to work. So the work that we are doing with PPE, social distancing and allowing the critical resources to come in and operate the facilities that are needed, has been very critical to us. And as I mentioned earlier, we've expanded our care to those families that need extra resources. We've completed 26 maintenance outages at our power facilities readying for summer readiness, and all done without issues. So with that – that's the overall view of the operations and what we are focused on. And I'll turn it over to Joe to go through the financial.
Joseph Nigro: Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover our first quarter results and our updated full-year guidance, including the financial impacts of COVID-19 and sensitivities for the remainder of the year. Starting with Slide 10. We earned $0.60 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.87 per share on a non-GAAP basis, which was slightly below the midpoint of our guidance range. We are particularly pleased with the results considering we had one of the warmest winters on record. Temperatures in the Mid-Atlantic were five to seven degrees higher than average in January through March, costing us $0.14 per share between Exelon Generation in our non-decoupled utilities. This quarter was the most impacted by weather of any quarter since the PHI merger. Exelon Utilities delivered $0.55 per share net of holding company expenses. Our non-decoupled utilities, PECO, Delmarva, Delaware and Atlantic City Electric were impacted by the warm winter weather. Across these territories, heating degree days were down 18% to 22% during the quarter. These impacts were partially offset by O&M timing across the utility. ExGen was also impacted by weather, earning $0.32 per share in the first quarter. The weather impact on gross margin and unplanned outages at Salem and FitzPatrick were offset by favorable O&M and nuclear decommissioning trust fund gains. Turning to Slide 11. Efforts to combat the spread of COVID-19, including stay-at-home orders in our states have caused dramatic changes in electricity demand and the national economic outlook. Taking into account the impact of COVID-19 unfavorable weather and lower ROEs at ComEd, we are revising our 2020 full-year guidance range from $3 to $3.30 per share to $2.80 to $3.10 per share. While typically we would not change guidance so early in the year, we want to provide a complete picture of where we stand at this point in the year and include our best estimates of the COVID-19 impacts. Let me start by saying that none of us has ever experienced anything like this before. The full impacts, including the duration and structural changes to the economy continue to evolve. In developing our revised guidance range, we looked at the load and economic data we were seeing in April, talk to our customers about their expectations for the year and considered different economic outlooks. In Q2, we expect commercial industrial load to decrease by 9% to 15% and residential load to increase by 4% to 7% depending on the region. Over the remainder of the year, we expect commercial, industrial unfavorability and residential favorability to diminish as the economy recovers. We've taken a cautious view of the world and you can see the assumptions on this slide that underpinned our new guidance range. We also recognize that the situation is changing rapidly, so we show a number of sensitivities to our guidance on the following pages so you can calibrate. I also want to come back to a point on actions we are taking. We challenged the organization against the current backdrop, identifying and pursuing initiatives across the company to lower our costs and improve our profitability. These provide $250 million of offset to other pressures which we reflect in this updated forecast. At the utilities, the $0.10 per share degradation from prior guidance can be split into a little over $0.05 for lower distribution ROEs at ComEd due to the drop in the 30-year treasury and a little less than $0.05 for the record mild first quarter weather. For COVID-19-related impacts, we expect to be able to offset the impact of lower loads at our non-decoupled utilities through cost reductions and the assumption that our regulators allow for timely recovering of expected higher bad debt. At ExGen, the $0.10 per share degradation reflects $0.05 of drag from the very mild Q1 weather and then $0.05 of COVID-19 impacts on load net of our cost and business initiatives. In addition to the O&M savings, we remained focused on cash at ExGen and have lowered CapEx by $125 million in 2020. We expect our earnings to be most impacted in the second quarter and have provided adjusted operating earnings guidance of $0.35 to $0.45 per share. Looking at the impact of COVID-19 on the utilities on Slide 12. As you can see, 70% of the Exelon Utilities are decoupled and the revenues are not subject to load fluctuations. The majority of volumes that are non-decoupled utilities, PECO, Atlantic City Electric and Delmarva, Delaware, are commercial industrial customers. In the table at the bottom right, we provide sensitivities for load by customer class and ComEd's distribution ROE for the remainder of the year. Each of our utilities is working with the regulators on COVID-19 cost and bad debt recovery mechanisms where we do not have them. Atlantic City Electric and ComEd have existing bad debt recovery mechanisms that result in no earnings impact with the cash being recovered in 2021 and 2022, respectively. Last month, the PSCs in Maryland and DC issue orders to authorize a regulatory asset that tracks prudent COVID-19-related costs incurred, which will allow for an assessment of recovery of incremental bad debt or atypical costs related to the pandemic. We are currently engaged with our commissions and stakeholders in Delaware, New Jersey and Pennsylvania regarding the potential recovery of costs. On Slide 27 of the appendix, we provide more detail on these efforts and current bad debt recovery mechanisms. Turning to Slide 13, the impacts of the Constellation business are like those of a non-decoupled utility. Constellation delivers around 210 terawatt hours annually of customer load through its wholesale and retail channels. In retail, Constellation’s 2019 customer breakdown was 90% commercial and industrial and of those customers, 70% of them were on fixed price contracts. When we look at volumes for the rest of the year and exclude index contracts, we have about 125 terawatt hours of normal annualized load exposed to COVID-related demand destruction. For the last nine months of the year, we assume Constellation load is down 6% in total with C&I down 9% and residential increasing 2%. I know there've been questions about how Constellation’s fixed price load contracts are impacted by COVID-19, so let me take a minute to explain. These fixed price contracts assume that the customer will use a certain amount of electricity and are impacted by fluctuations in customer usage in three ways. First, margin; second, commodity value; and third, through collection of fixed price charges and we are seeing the impacts of lower load on easing the current environment. When load is lower, Constellation loses the original sales margin on those unconsumed megawatt hours. Customer contracts can become in and out of the money over time. When a forward contract is signed, it assumes a price for electricity over the term of the contract. If the power procured for the customer is at a higher price than the current market and then the customer consumes less than forecasted, the generation must be sold into the open market at a lower price creating a gap in revenues. Finally, customers are billed for capacity and transmission charges that are charged by the ISO. Although these are typically fixed charges, for many customers we unitize them over the expected quantity of electricity and collect them on a dollars per megawatt hour basis. So when the customer consumes less, we under collect the fixed charge due to the ISO and are responsible for the shortfall. These fluctuations can be positive or negative to our bottom line. In a normal world where load fluctuations are primarily driven by weather, the risk is priced in and assumed in the contract. That assumption of risk could not have predicted the demand shocks and impacts that we are seeing due to the pandemic. In 2020, where C&I load is significantly displaced, we are seeing pressure on our gross margin, which is reflected in our guidance. We also expect the drop in profits to be limited to the period in time that the pandemic drives very wide differences in actual and assumed usage. Looking to the future, the Constellation business will return to profitability levels similar to those under normal conditions. And besides this highly unusual situation, having our load be primarily commercial and industrial customers remains key to our strategy. First, C&I customer usage patterns are aligned with our baseload generation portfolio, as C&I load is much more predictable and stable than residential load. In normal circumstances, C&I customer load is less exposed to weather fluctuations due to its higher load factors than residential customers. Second, C&I customers allow us to achieve scale that cannot be done with residential customers. Finally, although the gross margins maybe higher on residential customers, these margins do not account for the cost to acquire these customers, which are higher than C&I. You can see the impacts of weather and COVID-19 on our gross margin on Slide 14. In 2020, total gross margin is down $300 million. $100 million is due to Q1 weather, which can be pretty evenly split between lower volumes on our power and gas customer businesses. As a reminder, our gas business makes most of its margin in the winter. We’ve entered $200 million lower due to the impacts of COVID-19 on the balance of a year. During the quarter, we executed $100 million and $50 million in powered new business and non-powered new business respectively. In 2021, total gross margins down a $100 million primarily due to lower power prices in PJM in New York as well as some modest carry over of COVID-19-related drag on the load business. Since the end of the quarter, we have seen power prices rebound a levels above the start of the year, recovering most of the gross margin decline. We also executed $50 million of powered and non-powered new business during the quarter. We've remained behind our ratable hedging program in both 2020 and 2021. We ended the quarter slightly more behind ratable in 2020 then at year end at 8% to 11% due to the reduction in load offsetting hedges made during the quarter. 2021 is 2% to 5% behind ratable. We continue to see some upside in certain markets, but are not expecting a significant rebound in power prices or volatility. Slide 15 provides our 2020 projected sources and uses of cash. Our free cash flow is down $775 million from our last disclosure. The utilities cash flow accounts for $600 million of the degradation, largely due to timing of accounts receivable and bad debt, which we expect to reverse. ExGen's free cash flow is down $100 million reflecting the gross margin decline, but is mitigated by cost reductions and lower CapEx. Our liquidity position is strong. As you know, in March there were significant disruptions in the commercial paper markets and we temporarily drew down $1.5 billion on ExGen's $5.3 billion credit facility, which we repaid in early April. Given the uncertainty in that market in a $900 million [June] holding company refinancing, we issued $2 billion in April at corporate, which gives us additional flexibility. We are confident that we have ample liquidity to meet our needs. We also remain committed to strong investment grade credit ratings. Our FFO to debt is projected to fall to 18% and is below our 19% to 21% target, which reflects the combination of lower FFO and higher debt in 2020 due to the pressures I previously disclosed. We expect to see improvement in our FFO in 2021 as some of the cash timing issues that the utilities resolve next year and the impacts from COVID unwind. If they were to persist, we have levers we can take to enhance our credit profile. We talked to the rating agencies and their understanding of the current market environment. I'll now turn the call back to Chris.
Christopher Crane: Thanks, Joe. The pandemic has brought unexpected challenges to our business in 2020. We have found ways to offset much of the financial impact of this unique challenge, but we're not done. We'll continue to look for ways. We can increase profitability and cash flow through the next three quarters. The impact on the COVID-19 does not change the fact that Exelon's fundamental business is strong and our strategy remains strong. Our utility rate base is growing over 7% annually for the next four years. In that time, we will add more than $13 billion in rate base, nearly equivalent to adding a utility the size of ComEd. Our utility operations are best-in-class first quartile – first quarter performance in reliability and customer satisfaction are continuing the solid performance for the rest of the year. Constellation is a premier integrator in their competitive platform. It's the most effective way to bring our generation to market while providing customizable solutions to fit the needs of customers. Our generation fleet is the cleanest in the nation. We are delivering one out of every nine megawatts of Clean Energy in a significant portion of the nation's Clean Energy. We continue to advocate for policies that will compensate our nuclear fleet for the essential role it plays in reducing carbon and air pollution and ensure their continued operations. If you look at our value proposition on Slide 18, I'll close with this. The value proposition is unchanged. We're focused on a growth of our utilities, targeting 7.3 rate base growth and a 6% to 8% EPS growth through 2023. We're confident in our rate base growth and the continued needs for these investments for the customers that we serve. But we're also mindful of the impact that the current 30-year treasury rate has on ComEd's distribution ROE and the impact on EPS in growth rates, if that rate was to stay this low. We will use the free cash flow from ExGen to support utility growth, paydown ExGen debt and support the external dividend. We will continue to optimize the value of our Genco business by seeking fair compensation for our zero-emitting generation fleet, closing uneconomic plants, monetizing assets and maximizing their value through Constellation. We will sustain a strong investment grade credit rating metrics throughout this period. Operator, we can now open it up for questions. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Stephen Byrd: Hey, good morning. Hope you all are doing well?
Christopher Crane: Hope you are too.
Stephen Byrd: Thank you. I wanted to just first talk to – thanks for the thorough update and disclosure, very helpful. The Illinois legislative process, we're trying to follow this as closely as we can. I guess the Illinois Department of Public Health gave some guidance around sort of how the legislature might be able to – under what circumstance they could reconvene. Do you have a sense for sort of the process and sort of the potential for the legislative session to go through the summer, just given the formal ending date in May, obviously, does not coincide very well with the state’s plan to sort of reopen. But it does look like there's some potential that the legislature maybe able to meet if they meet sort of these health department guidelines. What is your sense in terms of the ability of the legislature to meet and do business?
Christopher Crane: We have seen in other jurisdictions, legislative bodies be able to work through and convene. Kathleen, you want to talk specifically to the path forward here in Illinois?
Kathleen Barron: Sure. Good morning, Steve. And then – as you know that stay-in-home order does extend through the end of May. So it is good – a good sign to see the Department of Public Health guidance to the legislature on how they might bring people back to the capital safely. That is good progress, but it just remains to be seen whether the leaders will decide to bring folks back to Springfield this session. Even if they cannot come back in May, they can come back in the summer by agreement of the Senate President and the Speaker. They could call a session after May 31 or the Governor himself could call a special session under the constitution. So we're glad to see that there has been guidance provided. There's just not yet any indication about when exactly they will come back.
Stephen Byrd: Understood. A lot of uncertainties there. And then just I guess in a related matter in terms of operational decisions for your nuclear plants in Illinois, Chris, you had mentioned a lot of refueling has been completed and quite quickly as well. But are there any operational considerations you all would have to make, for example, if legislation is not passed in this, call it, some recession? Or do you have some flexibility, so that you can get the legislature a bit of time just given, obviously they have a lot on their plate to address in Illinois?
Christopher Crane: Yes. It's tough to speculate with everything going on with the COVID, what the outcome of this legislative session or being able to go into an extended session. What we've stressed to all the stakeholders is PJM is committed to run the auctions, and their stated time was towards the end of the year and that could be extended. We haven't gotten any public statement that it was extended that I know of. So we're up against a clock. And once those auctions are run, we're highly confident that minimal or any of our clean megawatts will compare in that capacity auction, they’ll be replaced by fossil units, which is detrimental to the states goal of being 100% clean by 2030. So the clock is ticking. And I wouldn't speculate on timing of decisions right now. But we're just stressing the importance to the administration and the key legislative stakeholders and others about not only the importance for the nuclear megawatts, but the importance for the renewable megawatts. So they have been invested in the state of Illinois to continue to be able to operate with a profitability that's reasonable. So that's where we're at right now. We're continuing the dialogue. Kathleen, Bill Von Hoene are leading the conversations through the state legislators and the stakeholders, and we'll continue to push on that.
Stephen Byrd: Very good. I'll let others ask questions. Thanks.
Christopher Crane: Yes.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research, LLC. Your line is now open.
Steven Fleishman: Yes. Hi, good morning.
Christopher Crane: Hi, Steve.
Steven Fleishman: Hey Chris, I wanted to – I guess just get a little more color on the comments on the 6% to 8% utility growth rate. And you mentioned you'd be mindful, I think, you said, of the Illinois ROE and just – can you maybe give a little more color on how to think about – it's obvious what you're embedding now for 2020. But how about for the kind of broader growth rate and if rates don't get better, are you still within that range? Or just what you've been assuming in there?
Christopher Crane: Yes. We have continued to work our five-year plan. I think we report out in some places a four-year plan, another is a five-year plan, but we're continuing on our long range plan and it has helped us significantly in customer satisfaction and reliability and it's also allowed us to maintain a cash flow and profitability while doing so, in the last three rate cases, we actually gave a rate reduction. So as you can imagine, as you would expect, we look at multiple scenarios. And if the economy continues to degrade, impact on customers, whatever it could be is out in the future. The plans can be adjusted. But at this time, we don't plan on adjusting. We plan on continuing to do the much needed reliability and efficiency modifications and prepare the system for the onset of much more distributed and renewable energy coming on. It won't be able to happen if we don't make the investments and facilitate it. If we see a day that we're not getting that return or don't see a path to go back. I mean, we haven't seen that day and we haven't seen that in the near future. So we're continuing on with the investment and watching the treasuries and watching the recovery mechanisms.
Steven Fleishman: Okay. So – but just to clarify the – if we're in these kind of lower rate environment, I don't know exactly where the whole forward curve of 30-year is? You're still expected to be within the 6% to 8% range?
Christopher Crane: Yes. Go ahead Joe.
Joseph Nigro: We're not changing the target of the 6% to 8%. As Chris said, we're moving forward with the investment that we plan to make. We update that target once a year. We also show you sensitivity related to the ComEd ROEs. Obviously they've dropped some since the first of the year has an impact. We also give you earnings bands that we gave you out through 2023 and we're still well within the bands that we gave you and we'll continue to look for ways to challenge ourselves in this regard.
Steven Fleishman: Okay. Thanks, Joe.
Christopher Crane: At this point, it would be very short. It would be very shortsighted for us to start, stop, start, stop depending on an interest rate. The most efficient way is to get the long-term investments prudently done and support the customer's needs.
Steven Fleishman: Got it. I see what you're saying. So you're saying, Chris, that you're not going to hold back on investment in the state because of the temporary rates being lower. Got it, okay. Just one other question, yes. One other question just for – I guess for Joe, you mentioned levers on your credit. You have levers on your credit profile. If I guess things stay weaker there, could you just give some color on what those levers are?
Joseph Nigro: Steve, I think we've got a track record of proving that we continue to challenge ourselves on our cost structure. I mean, we're reducing our costs by $250 million this year with actions we've taken and we're going to continue to challenge ourselves in the future in that regard. We've been clear that we have some on economic power plants and we're working hard to rectify that. We would have to address that. Those would be two big levers that we would have to address.
Steven Fleishman: Okay. Thank you.
Christopher Crane: Thanks.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim. Your line is now open.
Shar Pourreza: Hey. Good morning, guys.
Christopher Crane: Hey, Shar.
Shar Pourreza: So a couple of questions here. Realize with Illinois, there is significant uncertainty over 2022 with PJM, but can you speak a little bit at a high level to how gross margin is developing? Maybe just directionally ignoring the upside or downside from capacity reform. And I realize this is secondary at this point, everything going on, but do you still think something can get done in Illinois at the veto session?
Christopher Crane: We're still working. We still have significant support on what we have to do. Where it gets done, we would hope that it would get done before the end of the session. That's what we've stressed to give the IPA time to be able to develop their own auction process, that will allow us to breakaway on capacity needs for the state of Illinois from PJM. As I said earlier, it's a very tight timeframe. If they were able to come in, in a summer session and we had assurances, they were going to address this in a summer session under the requirements by the Illinois Health, we would continue to work with them on that. But there's a lot of things that have to get done in Springfield, but they also realize that this is a very important issue to address and along with the state budget in some other large issues. So we know there's a will to get to work. It's just the way to get to work and how fast we can get this done.
Shar Pourreza: Got it. And then just what kind of C&I attrition are you guys expecting in your assumptions? And sort of how do we sort of think about contemplation more broadly as we look at 2021 and beyond? And does the current situation present any strategic opportunities in your view, maybe on the retail side? Or does sort of some of the reprieves we've been seeing at the state level, on the retail side push off any potential acquisition opportunities as you guys look to tighten up that natural hedge?
Christopher Crane: Jim, do you want to – Jim McHugh, do you want to cover that one?
James McHugh: Sure, absolutely. I'll answer kind of two parts. I think what we expect from the low decreases we're seeing now is as the states reopen and as things recover, we're seeing about a 15% reduction in that C&I on average in these front-near months. By the end of the year, as Joe mentioned on the call that's more than a probably 4% to 6% range and coming back in through mid next year. So from a load perspective, it's temporary and I think we expect that to bounce back. I think from a strategic perspective, a couple of things, we definitely for acquisition space, we'll continue to look for any value of books that comes to the market. There could be some suppliers that would need to look over their books. We've talked about our strategy before. We'll stay the same, which is we would be looking to buy things, buy books of business that we could easily fit into our platform. We've developed, I think, a world-class platform over the years that we can integrate easily. And we've shown that before when we bought books of business. And then lastly, I think strategically it's just product development where we'll look to either continue to refine the products we sell now and look for demand charges that could be either faster or more associated with the customers fixed charges and look for other products that we can develop to give them access to data analysis and sustainability targets that they have.
Shar Pourreza: Got it. And just lastly, Joe, I know you obviously highlighted that the rating agencies understand how transient in nature the cash flow dip is in 2020? Can you just remind us just from a perpetual ongoing perspective, how to think about the $250 million cost savings and the ExGen CapEx reductions for our modeling perspective?
Joseph Nigro: Yes. I would say right now most of the $250 million we're viewing as a one-time item. And some of it's being driven by the situation when you think about with things like reducing contractor spend, reducing non-critical IT spend, when you look at reductions in travel spending, consulting spend, holding vacancy rates in our organization, all of those things are contributing to the reduction in O&M. I will say though, when we go through our planning process, which begins here late in the second quarter and through the end of the year, we've had a track record of continuing to challenge ourselves and find ways to reduce costs. And given the environment we're in and some of the things, quite frankly, we've learned we maybe able to carryover some of these cost savings as we look at future periods. We just haven't made a determination on that yet.
Shar Pourreza: Terrific. Thanks guys. I'll pass it to someone else. Thank you.
Christopher Crane: Operator, next caller please.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of James Thalacker from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Christopher Crane: James, you there?
James Thalacker: Can you guys hear me?
Christopher Crane: Yes, we can now.
James Thalacker: Okay, thank you. This is obviously a little bit more of a granular question, but just looking on Slide 14, there was a $100 million, I guess change from December in the non-powered new business to go. I was just wondering if you guys could talk a little bit about what's exactly in that bucket.
Joseph Nigro: Yes. The $100 million non-powered new business to go is attributed partially to execution and partially, as I said in my prepared remarks in Q1. We had impact both on powered and non-powered related to weather and we took a reduction for the balance of the year. That's all embedded in a total $300 million that you see in the gross margin change in the hedge disclosure.
James Thalacker: Okay. I was just wondering, was it a specific product that you guys are selling that where you saw the weather impact? Or just trying to understand…
Joseph Nigro: What's embedded in that non-powered to go, the bulk of it is our – big piece of it is our gas business. And since that's so seasonal and related to the winter, you see the impact there.
James Thalacker: Got it. So it was just retail gas. Okay. Perfect. Thank you very, very much.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra from Evercore. Your line is now open.
Durgesh Chopra: Thanks for taking my question. I just have a quick clarification question. You answered most of the things I had. In terms of just states or territories where you don't have riders on COVID costs like bad debt, just want to clarify that you’re assuming recovery of those in the future, right? So the $250 million kind of targeted cost reductions don't cover that.
Calvin Butler: No, they don't. This is Calvin. In all of our jurisdictions where we are not – for our bad debt and we do not have a rider, we are working in partnership with the commissions to sit back and establish regulatory assets. As Chris alluded to in his opening comments, Maryland and DC, both of their commissions unanimously passed regulation allowing the utilities to set up regulatory assets and also set aside what identify prudently incurred COVID-related costs. And we will operate under the same standard that were used to operating on, showing that it's just and reasonable. We are working with the Pennsylvania commission and Delaware commission and we hope to have rulings from them in the next week to 10 days to drive that. So at the end of this, all of our jurisdictions, we believe will be operating under a regulatory asset to show what those are bad debt costs and the COVID-related costs are.
Durgesh Chopra: Got it. Perfect. That's it for me guys. Thank you very much.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey. Good morning, team. Hope you all are well.
Christopher Crane: We are doing good. Hope the same for you.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. Thank you. I wanted to follow-up, perhaps clean up a little bit on some of the questions thus far. First, with respect to the earnings CAGR and how you're thinking about that. But for the oscillation in the 30-year treasury, anything else shifting in your outlook? Obviously, the slide is slightly different here, so I just want to make sure we're not missing anything, coming back to Steve's question.
Joseph Nigro: Julien, there's nothing else shifting that CAGR other than the 30-year treasury.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Okay. Thanks. Glad we've set that one aside. Separately, if I can keep here on the Constellation business and ExGen overall, when you think about the sensitivities to further – you saw a faster or slower improvement here. Can you give us a little bit of a sense, and I mean that more in the context of C&I sales degradation improvement as well as some of the portfolio optimization of volatility dynamics here as well. And how that could play out in 2020 as well as what are you reflecting in 2021, just to be extra clear about that.
Christopher Crane: Jim, do you want to cover that? I'm not sure we've covered 2021 yet, but we can cover 2020.
James McHugh: Sure. Glad to do it. Thanks, Julien. The way we think about the balance of this year, and then I'll talk about 2021. You see the sensitivity on the slide that for every 1% change in C&I load, you see about a $15 million net income impact and resi is about a $7 million impact. We've assumed, as we said, a slow return through the balance of this year and into next year. So what the 1% sensitivity at least allow you to do is say, well, if across over those months, it moves up or down 1%, that's the number you would expect. I think as far as the optimization activity with this – with these gross margin estimates, we've given you, we see line of sight to being able to hit our normal optimization activity in the remainder of the new business to-go bucket. So we don't expect too much impact there. We basically realign these targets now with these adjustments to have good line of sight to balance of the year. For 2021, we've included about $50 million of impact for COVID and that is more a little bit of an impact on the load trickling into the year, but it also represents the fact that some of the new business activity to sign customers up has slowed down just because of the status of work that people are in. We've been tracking that and we feel like that's a really good estimate right now and we've been able to maintain a pretty good signing up of new customers. A little bit of dip in the win and renewable rates for the month of April. As we get granular on really being able to understand which those are impacted by how much, those win rates and renew rates bounce back up to, I think more on normal levels and the $50 million we've included is a good estimate.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Okay. Excellent. If I can just clarify your prior response very briefly. With respect to what the date as of for the 30-year treasury that you are assuming in that EPS CAGR, I just want to be extra clear. Again, I don't know if you have a specific date or curve that you're using, you want to establish that.
Joseph Nigro: Yes. 3/31 is the date we're using, the end of the first quarter.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: End of the first quarter for the 30-year treasury, so.
Joseph Nigro: Yes.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Okay. Excellent. Thank you.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Chris Crane, do you have any closing remarks?
Christopher Crane: Yes. No, thank you all for joining the call. I want to thank our employees for their commitment and dedication in these unprecedented times. And I hope that all of you and your families are safe and healthy. And with that, I will close out the call. Thank you very much.

===== 2019 Q4  (2020-02-11 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to today's webcast. My name is Tamara, and I will be your event specialist today. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. Please note that today's webcast is being recorded. During the presentation, we will have a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn today's phone over to Dan Eggers, Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance. The floor is yours.
Dan Eggers: Thank you. Good morning, Tamara. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining our Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Leading the call today are Chris Crane, Exelon's President and Chief Executive Officer and Joe Nigro, Exelon's Chief Financial Officer. They're joined by other members of Exelon's senior management team, who'll be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. We issued our earnings release this morning along with the presentation, all of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of Exelon's website. The earnings release and other matters, which we discuss during today's call contains forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today's material and comments made during this call. Please refer to today's 8-K and Exelon's other SEC filings for discussions of risk factors and factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections forecasts and expectations. Today's presentation also includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for reconciliations between the non-GAAP measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measure. I'll now turn the call over to Chris Crane, Exelon's CEO.
Chris Crane: Thank you Dan, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us for our 2019 fourth quarter earnings call. I'm going to start on slide 5. On almost all accounts, we had a very good 2019. Exelon Utilities and Generation remains focused on delivering for our customers and their communities. ComEd had its best performance ever. The nuclear fleet had its best capacity factor and we delivered financially. As you can read, the full year GAAP earnings were $3.01 per share, and the non-GAAP earnings were $3.22 per share above our revised guidance range and midpoint of our original guidance range. Joe will walk you through the financial details later in the call. I want to address the operational details as we go forward. Last year, Exelon Utilities invested $5.5 billion in capital and $150 million – which is $150 million more than originally planned. These investments were primarily in infrastructure and technology to provide a premier customer experience, improve reliability and resiliency, modernization of our gas system resulting in best-ever customer satisfaction at each of our utilities. We had a productive year on the regulatory front. Pepco D.C. filed its first multiyear rate case and Maryland's PSC is moving forward with the multiyear rate plans. We received a constructive settlement at BGE and at ACE. PECO's transmission formula was approved by FERC, and ComEd's formula rate provided the third-rate decrease in five years helping to keep the average residential customer bill flat from where it was a decade ago. On the policy front, the United States Supreme Court upheld the Illinois and New York ZEC programs. New York Supreme Court – Superior Court affirmed the ZEC program and New Jersey implemented their ZEC program in the spring. Governor Wolf in Pennsylvania announced plans for Pennsylvania to join RGGI, and the Pennsylvania State Senate passed legislation setting a goal for electric vehicles and deployment. FERC approved PJM's fast-start reforms. PJM filed its proposal to reform the reserve market and scarcity rules. We made our commitment to grow the dividend by 5% annually through 2020 with the Board raising the annual dividend to $1.53 per share in January. We're good partners also with the communities we serve. Our employees volunteered a record-breaking 251,000 hours in 2019, that’s 11,000 more than in 2018. During National Volunteer Week, we sponsored 452 events in 16 states and 128 cities with 5,400 employees which is another record. In addition, Exelon donated nearly $52 million to charities and organizations throughout our footprint. We are committed to providing a diverse and inclusive environment for our nearly 33,000 employees. We were once again named Best Company for Diversity by Forbes, DiversityInc, and the Human Rights Campaign. Our total diversity supplier spend exceeded $2 billion for the third straight year, accounting for 27% of our overall supplier spend. Exelon companies continue to prioritize partnerships with local-based diverse businesses by offering development programs. We also continue to be recognized for our environmental stewardship and were named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the 14th year in a row. We are focused on operating at world-class levels delivering on our strategy in supporting clean energy policies in their state. The hard work and the commitment of our employees to provide safe, reliable power, and natural gas to our customers led way to the greatest performance we had in 2019. We delivered on our commitments to you our shareholders, but also our employees and our customers and our communities. However, this year was not -- last year was not without challenges including subpoenas we received from the U.S. Attorney's Office in Northern Illinois. As we said before, we are limited in what we can share about the investigation. However, I want to reiterate that we are fully cooperating with the U.S. Attorney's Office and taking the situation very seriously. The Board appointed a special committee to provide oversight of the investigation led by outside counsels to determine if any changes are needed to ensure that going forward we operate at the highest possible standards. At the end of [Technical Difficulty] our commitments for 2020. Turning to slide 6, we're committed to operating our utilities at the highest levels for our customers. Since 2016, we have deployed nearly $22 billion across the utilities and plan to invest $26 billion over the next four years. These investments enhance reliability, resiliency, and modernize our electric and gas systems. We've been able to make these needed improvements while keeping the boards -- the bills affordable. The rates in all our major cities; Baltimore, Chicago, Philadelphia, and Washington are 13% to 18% below the average for the largest U.S. cities, and 2% to 7% below the national average. These investments are producing tangible benefits for our customers. Customer satisfaction is the highest level it's ever been at each one of our utilities, reflecting a strong system performance that has come from our investments. Frequency of outages has decreased significantly, down near 50% at ComEd and 30% at PHI. Outage duration has also decreased by 52% and 38% at ComEd and BGE respectively. 2019 was the best reliability performance for ComEd and the second best for BGE. On the gas side, PECO and BGE have replaced more than 200 miles of cast iron and bare steel mains and nearly 30,000 metallic gas services in 2018. These investments will help our customers' current and future needs while reducing gas leaks and greenhouse house gas emissions. Moving to slide 7, our states are focused on ensuring the electric and the gas systems are ready to meet the changing customer needs, more reliable and more resilient and are prepared for renewables in electric vehicles and are ready to meet the challenges of climate change. We are working with each state to get the right mechanisms in place to be able to make these needed investments. Our states are providing support through a range of regulatory tools, including alternate rate making such as formula rates and multiyear rate plans as well as tracker mechanisms for reliability and gas infrastructure programs. Turning to Slide 8, FERC's recent order on PJM capacity. The Governors in Illinois, Maryland, and New Jersey are firmly committed to having their electricity be supplied by 100% clean. These states are leading the way to a clean energy economy and we share that goal, and we'll work with them to achieve it. Unfortunately, there is a clear conflict between clean energy goals of our states and our customers on one side and the resource decisions being made by PJM and FERC on the other. Unless states take action to protect their clean energy programs, FERC's December order on the PJM Minimum Offer Price Rule or MOPR will result in clean resources supported by the states being pushed out of the capacity market only to be replaced by carbon-based generation. This would result in billions of dollars of additional costs for customers and threaten the progress being made in retaining and expanding our clean energy. Our states as well as many others oppose FERC's MOPR decision and are evaluating what actions may be necessary in response. We are working with policymakers and stakeholders to protect the clean energy programs from the negative impact of FERC's MOPR decision and enable the transition to 100% clean. On Slide 9, we show our operating performance for the year. Each utility continues to have outstanding customer operations, all achieved first quartile in performance and service level and abandon rate. And I mentioned, we had our best ever scores on customer satisfaction index with BGE ComEd and PECO achieving top decile and PHI's performance significantly improved in the last three years missing first quartile by 0.01 points. Reliability performance was mixed this year due to a very active minor storm season throughout the Mid-Atlantic. For instance, PHI had 32 minor storms for 2019 compared to eight in 2018. Minor storms are not excluded from these calculations. However, ComEd achieved top quartile in both outage frequency and duration and BGE achieved top quartile on outage duration. Turning to generation on Slide 10, our fleet -- generation fleet performed one of its best years ever, very good in 2019 providing a significant portion of the country's clean energy. Exelon generates 12% or one out of every nine clean megawatts in the United States. Our best-in-class nuclear fleet operated very well last year. Our capacity factor was 95.7% our highest ever. We generated 155 million megawatt hours, avoiding 81 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emission in 2019. Our average refueling outage duration was 21 days, matching the record set in 2018 and 18 -- 14 days better than the industry average. Exelon Power's gas and hydro dispatch matched 97.9% and wind and energy capture at 96.3% were better than planned. Our Constellation business remains the industry leader. A vast majority of our retail businesses is with C&I customers where we have the largest retail platform with 25% market share delivering 154 terawatt-hours of electricity and 67 terawatt-hours more than our nearest competitor. Our retail operating metrics remain strong; 79% customer renewal rates, average customer duration of more than six years, and power contract terms of 23 months on average. We continue to see stable unit margins with our power customers. Our focus is on cost and helping support operating margins. Constellation's strength lies in its durable relationship with our customers. We work with our customers to provide them solutions to meet their energy needs while also reaching their environmental and sustainability goals. We provide our customers with much more than just a commodity. And now I'll turn the call over to Joe to review the financials.
Joe Nigro: Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Today I will cover our 2019 results, annual updates to our financial disclosures, and 2020 guidance. Starting with slide 11, we had another strong year. For the fourth quarter we earned $0.79 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.83 per share on a non-GAAP basis. For the full year we earned $3.01 per share on a GAAP basis and $3.22 per share on a non-GAAP basis, which is above our revised full guidance -- full year guidance of $3.05 to $3.20 per share and $0.07 per share above our original mid-point. Exelon Utilities delivered a combined $1.91 per share net of holding company expenses. Utility earnings were higher relative to original guidance, due to favorable O&M, including the lack of major storms, and favorable weather at PECO and BG&E, as well as higher distribution revenues of the PG&E. These were partially offset by the impact of lower treasury rates, on ComEd's ROE. ExGen earned $1.31 per share, exceeding its guidance range of $1.20 to $1.30 per share. ExGen's outperformance was primarily due to favorable O&M, including incremental nuclear insurance distributions, and recognition in the fourth quarter of the research and development or R&D tax benefit, for the years 2010 through 2018 tax years. We expected to record this benefit, but it was more favorable than we had planned. This favorability was offset by the unplanned outages at Salem, Handley Station and a contracted asset during the year. Overall, we delivered well on our financial commitments. Moving to slide 12, the consolidated PHI utilities earned a 9.2% ROE for the trailing 12 months, up 90 basis points from year-end 2018. The improvement is driven by the constructive distribution rate cases, across the jurisdictions as well as incremental transmission revenue and a decrease in O&M, partially offset by an increase in depreciation. Earned ROEs for the legacy Exelon Utilities were above 10%, slightly improving from year-end 2018. Looking at our utility returns on a consolidated basis, we earned a 10% ROE for the trailing 12 months, which compares to last year's 9.6%. As a reminder, we targeted 9% to 10% consolidated ROE at our utilities. And expect that we will move around in that band over the course of time. And we remain focused on earning fair returns across all of our utilities. On slide 13 we rolled forward our outlook for utility CapEx and rate base, covering 2020 to 2023. This year we expect to invest nearly $6.5 billion, in our utilities and a total of $26 billion, over the next four years. These investments are improving our system reliability, service experience for our utility customers, and preparing us for the future. Our capital forecast reflects identified and approved projects. As we move through time, we identify more investment needs across the system that will provide additional benefits to our customers and communities. Since the initial disclosures for the 2018 to 2022 period, we have identified nearly $4.9 billion in additional investments, including an additional $1.9 billion, since last year's fourth quarter call. As Chris mentioned, these investments benefit our customers, by helping to drive our operational excellence, overall customer satisfaction, and meet state resiliency and environmental priorities. Since the PHI merger in 2016, we have added more than $9 billion in rate base across the utilities. Over the next four years, we will grow our rate base 7.3% annually to $54.2 billion, adding $13 billion to rate base by 2023 or the equivalent of adding a utility between the size of PHI and ComEd, without paying a premium, issuing equity or obtaining merger approvals. As a reminder, 65% of our rate base growth is covered under either formula rates or mechanisms such as capital trackers. These support our ability to efficiently invest in our system while also allowing us to earn a fair and timely return on our capital. Where we do not have these mechanisms, we will continue to work with stakeholders to establish more timely recovery tools. Chris touched on this earlier, but I want to remind you all that we have been able to make these important investments while maintaining lower customer rates compared to other large urban areas. When we look at our projected residential bills, we continue to see bill inflation around/or below the rate of inflation even as we make these important investments. In the appendix, we provide a more detailed breakdown of the capital and rate base outlook for each utility starting on slide 23. Turning to slide 14. We continue to forecast strong utility less holding company, EPS growth of 6% to 8%. When you consider the drop in the 30-year treasury that lowered our EPS outlook for ComEd by roughly a nickel compared to what we had showed you last year, we've been more than able to offset in the back end of our plan through the increased CapEx program across the utilities for the benefit of our customers, which brings us to the durability of our industry leading earnings growth, which reflects the combination of strong rate base growth to support system needs for a more digital economy and environmental goals, successful cost management and a focus on customer bill affordability. Before discussing our gross margin update on slide 15, I want to remind you that given the lack of clarity around the outcome of legislation in Illinois and the fact that PJM has not yet held a capacity auction for the 2022, 2023 delivery year, we will not be providing any ExGen disclosures beyond 2021. So turning to the table, there is no change in total gross margin in 2020 or 2021 from our last disclosure. Open gross margin declined by $400 million and $100 million in 2020 and 2021, respectively due to declining power prices across most regions offset by our hedges. During the quarter, we executed $50 million of power new business in 2020. We remain slightly behind our ratable hedging program in all years. We ended the year 6% to 9% behind in 2020 and 3% to 6% behind in 2021 when taking cross-commodity hedges into account. We continue to see some upside in certain markets, but are not expecting a significant rebound in power prices or volatility. Slide 16 shows our O&M and capital outlook at generation for 2020 and 2021. Compared to our previous disclosure on our fourth quarter call, last year our O&M is down in each year. The updated forecast reflects O&M cuts we announced on last quarter call, pension benefits and nuclear savings. The return on our pension investments in 2019 significantly exceeded our planned returns, but this favorability was partially offset by the drop in the discount rate. Taking both into account our pension expense it's about flat to plan in 2020 and is down by approximately $25 million in 2021. Turning to CapEx. We expect lower cash outlays than we projected last year. We have reduced the growth capital in 2020 and 2021 given the focus of recycling ExGen cash and the increased need for equity investments at the utilities given their growing capital needs. Nuclear fuel costs are also lower in 2020 and higher in 2021 versus last year's disclosure, primarily due to a shift in deliveries. Overall, we continue to see a constructive outlook for the nuclear fuel costs looking out over our planning horizon. We will continue to look for ways to be more efficient in how we work and spend to improve the cash flow profile of ExGen while maintaining the safety and reliability of our fleet. Moving to slide 17. We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and our investment grade credit ratings. Our consolidated corporate credit metrics are consisting with our targeted ranges and above S&P thresholds. Looking at ExGen, we are well ahead of our debt-to-EBITDA target for 3.0 times. For 2020, we expect to be at 2.4 times debt to EBITDA and 1.9 times debt to EBITDA when excluding non-recourse debt. This year we will be active in the capital markets, as we support our utility rate base growth. At ExGen, we plan to retire $1.5 billion of long-term debt this year, including the $1 billion maturity we paid off in January. As a reminder, this in addition to the $600 million of long-term debt retired in October of 2019. Finally, I will conclude with our 2020 earnings guidance on Slide 18. We have provided 2020 adjusted earnings guidance of $3 to $3.30 per share. Growth in utility earnings is primarily driven by the continued increase in rate base, as we deploy capital for the benefit of our customers as well as carry through from the 2019 rate cases. We will see offsets from lower treasuries on ComEd's earned ROEs, higher depreciation and some regulatory timing drags between investment and rate cases most notably at PECO. Our consolidated range in 2020 for utilities less HoldCo is $1.80 a share to $2.10 per share. The decline in earned ExGen's earnings is a combination of lower realized energy prices and capacity revenues, more planned nuclear outage days and the absence of nuclear decommissioning trust gains. These are partially offset by a full year of ZEC revenues in New Jersey and increased ZEC revenues in New York. We expect first quarter operating earnings to be in the range of $0.85 per share to $0.95 per share. More detail on the year-over-year drivers by operating company can be found in the appendix starting on Slide 55. With that, I will now turn the call back to Chris for his closing remarks.
Chris Crane: Thanks Joe. Turning to Slide 19, I want to discuss our key focus areas for 2020. We will continue to deliver operational excellence across our businesses, focusing on modernizing the grid and improving the customer experience at our utilities, while staying focused on safety and reliability. We will meet or exceed our financial commitments delivering earnings within the range and maintain our investment-grade credit ratings, as Joe mentioned. At the utilities, we will prudently and effectively deploy $6.5 billion of capital to benefit our customers and help meet the needs -- our states' energy policy goals and we will work with our regulators to ensure timely recovery on these investments. We will support the enactment of state and federal clean energy policies with major initiatives in-flight in several states. We will -- and we will partner and ally with the communities we serve. This is key to who we are. Slide 20. I will close on Exelon's value proposition, which highlights our strategy and commitment to shareholders. We will continue our focus on growing our utilities targeting 7.3% rate base growth and 6% to 8% earnings growth through 2023 rolling forward another year at this above-group trajectory. We will use free cash flow from ExGen to support utility growth, pay down debt and support the external dividend. We will continue to optimize the value of our Genco business by seeking fair compensation for our zero-emitting generating fleet, closing uneconomic plants and monetizing assets as we see value is there, while maximizing their value through generation to load matching strategy at Constellation. We will sustain growth investment-grade metrics -- excuse me, strong investment-grade metrics and we will grow our dividend at 5% through 2020. The strategy underpinning this value proposition is effective in providing tangible benefits to our shareholders. We remain committed to optimizing the value of our business and earning your ongoing support to Exelon. Operator, we can now open the call to questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first response is from Greg Gordon with Evercore.
Greg Gordon: Thanks. Good morning. Congratulations on a great year and the outlook is encouraging. A couple of questions. The utility growth outlook has obviously improved as we go out through time, despite the headwind from ComEd. The CapEx is up significantly, but the rate base growth numbers look like they're not moving as much in tandem. I skimmed through the whole deck. I understand, you've also moved capital around the different jurisdictions as well, but can you just comment on sort of that modest level of dissonance between CapEx being up and rate base growth looking like it's not up as much?
Joe Nigro: Yes, Greg. Good morning. It's Joe. Yes. The issue isn't solely that the incremental CapEx that we mentioned of approximately $2 billion isn't falling to rate base. It's about all of the CapEx and what we get into is the timing of when these projects go in service. So, we've updated some assumptions as it relates to the schedule of when the projects are finished and then they go into service. In addition to that, we could have changes in things like depreciation that would also impact that. So, it's really just a movement of when we see project timing and other things.
Greg Gordon: So AFUDC is not -- or CWIP and AFUDC are not contemplated in those calculations then?
Joe Nigro: No. They're not contemplated in that calculation.
Greg Gordon: Okay. That explains it. Thanks. In terms of the cash flow profile, I know that you haven't given us an update because we do have obviously significant uncertainty with regard to ExGen and Illinois. But as you look at most scenarios there, whether it's getting some sort of deserved incremental revenue for the clean attribute to your plants or having to use self-help to rectify the earnings issues, under most of those scenarios do you still see the utility being funded by the cash flow of the corporation without needing equity through this forecast period?
Joe Nigro: Yes. Greg, so the first thing I would say is, based on the current plan, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we don't incorporate any equity issuance in the plan. And going forward, we can meet the funding needs and maintain the investment-grade credit metrics under most scenarios that we look at, because we do look at this under a range of different possibilities.
Greg Gordon: Okay. Two more questions and they're quick. One, since the Q -- since the EEI deck, where you usually give us your update on where you think O&M and capital are driving it at ExGen, things have improved on the margin. Can you comment on how you've pulled forward some of the O&M and CapEx trajectory?
Joe Nigro: Yes. I think the big thing is when you look at the improvement in ExGen earnings, it's really driven by four variables. As you could see in 2020 and 2021, the gross margin hasn't changed, right? But what has changed is we announced the O&M reductions on the third quarter call, that’s been a benefit. Lower property taxes has been a benefit at ExGen. Lower depreciation is also a benefit. And then, finally, we do have some lower interest expense, when you think about the retirement of debt. So those four variables have driven improvement to the ExGen earnings.
Greg Gordon: Okay. Final question, Chris. The time flies. It seems like yesterday since you made the commitment to grow the dividend 5% through 2020, and here we are in 2020 and you've made good on that commitment. At what point do you go back to the Board with a recommendation on the dividend policy post 2020?
Chris Crane: So I would anticipate, the discussions with the Board will be in the fall time frame, when we have further clarity on what the future looks like. If we are able to enact some of the policies and programs in the states we're working on, and it provides us with certainty that we can provide certainty to the Board that maintaining the health of the balance sheet while creating shareholder value, we should have a better picture at that time. So, I would expect us talking to you around year-end time frame about that.
Greg Gordon: Thank you, Chris. Take care, guys.
Chris Crane: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Your next response is from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.
Stephen Byrd: Hi. Good morning.
Chris Crane: Good morning 
Stephen Byrd: I had a couple of broader policy questions. We've certainly been seeing quite a bit of evidence of -- especially, in the PJM states, a movement away from fossil fuels. And on the merchant side, I think I understand some of the moving parts there, but on the regulated utility side, what is your sense of the degree to which states are now pushing to move away from fossil fuels? And how do you think broadly about pivoting and sort of reacting to that shift at the utility side of your business?
Chris Crane: So as you know Stephen, our utilities do not have any generation and are restricted from having generation in the states that we serve. What you see in our planning years that you're looking at for the utilities, they incorporate what we believe needs to be done to support the states' needs which calls for more robust distribution system investments to allow two way energy flows, which is going to require transmission buildout to take care of importing the wind [ph] from the pockets of the service areas that we serve. And that's what's anticipated right now in the capital plan that we have in front of you. We have got to keep up with the state's policies, legislative agendas, or whatever is going to change the system so our customers can benefit from these policies that the states are enacting.
Stephen Byrd: Understood. And then just shifting over to the PJM capacity process, I wanted to just get your latest thinking on next steps procedurally. I'm thinking about sort of the broader process under which PJM would refine their approach and the timing under which they have an auction. I guess I'm thinking also about the possibility of pretty significant litigation around the -- whatever comes out of the PJM and the FERC process here. How do you see that unfolding? Just wanted to get your latest thoughts there.
Kathleen Barron: Hi, Stephen, it's Kathleen Barron. I can take that question. I'll start with auction timing. As you know there's a large group of stakeholders including clean energy advocates, consumer advocates, renewable developers and most importantly the states who have asked PJM to take their time in scheduling the next auction. There's just been such a fundamental change in policy here that states need time to evaluate what the impact is on their customers and to design appropriate policies to protect their customers from the significant impact of this new policy on customer bills. So we of course agree with that perspective and are going to continue to urge PJM when they're developing their next filing effort which as you know is in March to propose an auction timing schedule that takes into account the states' needs. And in terms of litigation, you're right that there have been a number of requests for rehearing that have been filed. That would be the next step for FERC before this case could go to litigation. FERC has no time line in which to ask -- to act on requests for rehearing, but I think the more important point is they have been developing this policy for years. I mean they laid out in an order in ISO New England three years ago that MOPR is their standard solution and they have carried that through to PJM. I see no future where they change their mind on that policy and I think therefore the states are right in looking at what their alternatives are to continue participation in RPM.
Stephen Byrd: Understood. And just to follow-up there Kathleen, can the auction proceed if there is pretty significant litigation from multiple states sort of questioning the fundamentals of the FERC order?
Kathleen Barron: Well technically, it can. I mean I think from a good governance perspective, of course as I said before PJM should take into account the fact that some of the states need some more information to figure out what the impact is going to be on their citizens. They're going to need to do an internal evaluation. But from a legal perspective, the FERC order is final. And once the compliance filing is submitted and approved then PJM will be allowed to conduct an auction unless there's some sort of judicial stay imposed.
Stephen Byrd: Understood. That's helpful. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Your next response is from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.
Steve Fleishman: Yes. Hi, good morning.
Chris Crane: Good morning.
Steve Fleishman: Can you hear me okay, Chris? Thanks.
Chris Crane: Yes, perfect. Yes, we can.
Steve Fleishman: Great, great. So just on the Illinois process, could you just maybe talk to I guess an update of the legislation and just trying to make sure that -- I think the hope is that there'd be more of a long-term framework in place for treatment of nuclear and renewables. And just how much is that likely to be part of any legislative activity in the state?
Chris Crane: Well it's definitely -- there's two focuses that Exelon has in the legislation. One is the ComEd side ensuring that we have adequate recovery mechanisms for capital investments being made, while trying to maintain the customer protections that we need by caps on bill increases. So that part is very critical. Kathleen can address the Genco parts. She's been heading that up in Springfield in and around the state.
Kathleen Barron: Sure Steve. I can jump in on the -- on your point about having a longer-term framework which is exactly the point of the legislation that's pending in Illinois. And the idea of using the Fixed Resource Requirement provision in the PJM tariff or the FRR provision is to give states that kind of flexibility to provide for example for renewables that may want to have contracts of differing lengths exactly that flexibility for them to have those contracts. And likewise for their broader clean energy goals for them to be able to differentiate when they're procuring capacity resources between clean resources and emitting resources. And having that ability to design their capacity procurement to meet their state policy on a longer-term basis is one of the key benefits of the FRR strategy.
Steve Fleishman: Okay. And any sense on when we'll get kind of a more -- kind of full bill with more details proposed to get a better sense on just the details of a potential bill?
Kathleen Barron: Yes. I think you should expect to see further discussion and public hearings about what the bill should look like. As you know there are a number of proposals that are alive in the legislature in Springfield and so there needs to be some discussion in public hearings of how the state's policy on all the issues that are pending will come together in a comprehensive approach. So I think over the course of the spring session those details will become more evident. As you know in most legislatures, it usually takes until closer to the end of the session for all the details to be worked out, but I think you'll start to see over the coming weeks and months more detail emerge.
Steve Fleishman: Okay. And then a broader question just on -- I guess it's an ESG/nuclear carbon question. Just -- maybe for Chris, just how do you feel about your ability to get credit? It seems like there's a lot of focus on ESG and renewables and not necessarily as much focus on the benefits of nuclear and carbon reduction as you said 12% of the megawatt hours you produced for the country last year. Just how do you feel that you're going to be able to get credit either Republican or Democrat for the benefits of nuclear? Just how both sides are kind of looking at that right now including the FERC side?
Chris Crane: Yes. I think over the last two to three years, you've seen a greater recognition of the benefit of nuclear as it's contributing to a cleaner environment low carbon and also other emitting gases. So as we work with stakeholders explaining electrification and the benefits of electrification and that electrification is coming from clean sources that are highly reliable like baseload nuclear, and there's been quite a few environmental organizations and government legislative folks that agree with that. The dialogue is going on, on how do we keep these assets so the states can make their goals and that's going to be a critical part going forward. We've shared numbers with you before that if we shut down a couple of nuclear units in a single state, we can totally destroy all the investments that were being made in the renewables and we're just going to go backwards with our carbon emission. So we have to do our job as -- not only as a company, but an industry and we're trying to do that. The Nuclear Energy Institute has done a very good job on their campaign to communicate that to greater and broader masses and we'll continue to do it ourselves and work through things like the legislation that may be enacted or policies that may be enacted in states. We've seen the ZEC and the recognition in New York. We saw the ZEC and the recognition in Illinois. We're going to have to go a little bit further to be able to save these plants and that's where we're talking about FRR. And it's also -- another part of it is, it's more than just environmental. The reliability they provide, the jobs they provide, the economic engine for the communities that they serve is very impactful. And to not have these assets or them to be replaced with carbon-based assets will just send the states not only financially, but environmentally backwards.
Steve Fleishman: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Your next response is from Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim.
Shar Pourreza: Hey, good morning guys.
Chris Crane: Good morning.
Shar Pourreza: Just focusing a little bit on the Genco. If we get to sort of the November veto session and find energy legislation gets pushed to 2021 and we assume that there will be a PJM auction in, let's say, December and January and another one roughly six months after that. Can you just walk us through how you'd be thinking about the auction participation and the timing of potential closures? And do you feel that the MOPR order has catalyzed the states to act on CJC?
Chris Crane: We're not speculating right now on that. We surely hope for many complicated issues that the states are able to enact and given time to enact the policies that they desire that will allow these plants to still operate. I've said for the last four or five years on almost every earnings call that if we can't see half to financial stability for each one of these assets that we will have to retire them and we're not going to speculate today on which ones or when. But we've shut down Oyster Creek, gone into decommissioning with a decommissioning company. TMI is off. There was no path for financial stability. And as I've said in the past, we must watch the balance sheet and our debt commitments and the negative cash flow assets will only send the fleet backwards and our goals on strong investment-grade will allow us to maintain our commitments to operate plants safely and meet our financial commitments on retiring our debt. So, we'll work hard through this legislative session to convey the importance of it and we're not going to speculate until we have no longer have a path to profitability for the assets.
Shar Pourreza: Got it. And then if let's just say Illinois does FRR, how are you thinking about maybe the potential impacts on sort of the rest of the RTO fleet like in Pennsylvania and Maryland, especially given obviously the IMM has been taken somewhat of a bearish tone on the impact?
Kathleen Barron: Yeah. Shar, this is Kathleen. I can take that one. I mean, there are a number of estimates as you know out there about the impact of one, two, three, four, five states choosing the FRR option. We have not conducted an analysis of what that means for the rest of the pool so I'm not going to speculate on which ones of those analyses are accurate. But I will just say with respect to the market monitor, and the suggestion that the MOPR is going to have no impact on capacity clearing prices, it's -- and I note that that's been repeated by a number of the fossil companies, yeah, it's just it's a little bit concerning. I mean, it's exactly these state programs that they -- that were the reason that multi-litigation was brought by these companies. Recall when the first lawsuit was filed in New York, when New York adopted the ZEC program they said the point of the lawsuit was that ZEC programs were suppressing market prices by $15 billion over the course of that program's life. The whole purpose of MOPR was to raise capacity prices. Commissioner Glick estimated that he's going to raise capacity prices by $2.4 billion annually across the pool. Other independent analyses have gone there too. So it's just not credible for them to be now saying MOPR is going to have no impact.
Shar Pourreza: Got it. That’s helpful. And congrats guys, its very solid result.
Chris Crane: Thank you.
Operator: Your next response is from Joseph Gutowski [ph] from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Julien Smith: Hi, it’s Julien, can you hear me?
Chris Crane: Yes.
Julien Smith: Thank you guys for the time. Super quick. Let me come back to some of the numbers that we start with Greg earlier. Just in terms of the guidance I know you mentioned the AFUDC and the reconciliation of the CapEx and rate base. Can we talk about the earnings? Obviously, rate base unchanged; EPS guidance higher. Is that principally due to some of these changes in AFUDC that isn't formally reflected in that rate base and obviously is reflected in that CapEx? Or are there other changes? Obviously the cadence of the trajectory of the earnings in 2020 and 2021 onwards has shifted a little bit as well but just wanted to clarify that. And then also on ExGen, similar dynamic around what's causing the offset versus the open margin. I think you had a little bit of a quick brief commentary about basis potentially. Just want to elaborate quickly on that as well as maybe the tax piece for ExGen year-over-year.
Joe Nigro: Yes, Julien. Good morning, it's Joe. On your first question remember we're giving you guidance for the combined EU and HoldCo, so there's a couple of variables even though we're investing CapEx and rate bases are rising. When you look at it the interest rate – the interest expense at corporate is projected lower which drives EPS as one variable that's positive to the earnings. We are – when you look at these projects, right you could still see there is additional CapEx growth and then we've had some improvement in ROEs versus our prior plan as well based on some of the regulatory actions and performance. So there's a number of variables outside just the incremental CapEx that would drive the value. Your second question on the offsets at generation it's – when you look at the prices falling use 2021 as an example where we're less than 70% hedged. You see that you would have the open gross margin come down. However that's a price at a common trading point. When you look at the values associated back to where the generator busbars are for example those prices move every day as well and there were some offsets associated with that. So that got us down to flat.
Julien Smith: Got it. Excellent. And then just to come back to the broader strategic points here. At what point in time do you need to make decisions here? It sounds like there's latitude through the course of this year. And then related to that are you expecting any kind of FRR developments ahead of these auctions themselves? Or would the outcome of the auction and the outcome of any ultimate resolution of how to run this auction prove to be a decision point for states outside of Illinois? I just want to understand the cadence of events given where we stand today. I know there's a lot of moving pieces and that could be a long question but I'll let you respond to as you peak that.
Chris Crane: We are definitely responding to the MOPR in our commentary to FERC in PJM if they need to allow the states to enact whatever policy or legislation they are pursuing prior to running the auctions. There's adequate capacity in – within the system that we don't need to rush to secure it until the rules are clear. So it would be an unfortunate event if the auctions ran before the states were able to take action, which means you'd be looking at 2024, 2025, before you'd be able to enact and that's a long time with negative cash flows that many of the units would be facing at that point. So we want to work with every stakeholder we can within the states that we serve to help them enact the policies and explain what we can on the economics. If the bill, as we've seen it and draft towards the end of last year is enacted, it actually has a significant benefit to the consumer. It's not a bill increase as being communicated by some are understood by others. It actually as Kathleen pointed out, could cost as much as $2.6 billion to the PJM customers. And you take just Illinois alone, that's about 15% or a little over $400 million on an annual basis on an increase to those customers. So there's a customer benefit here. There's – as drafted or inputted previously there is a cap on the -- and what can be increased on both sides of the investment to support the renewables or the cost of the energy capacity in the system. So we need to be able to have the time -- or the states need to be able to have the time and there's discussion in multiple states right now that they want to look at something differently. And we hope that PJM respects the states' needs and allows them time to enact the policies that they desire.
Julien Smith: Perfect
Operator: Thank you. Your last question come comes from the line of Michael Weinstein from Crédit Suisse.
Michael Weinstein: Hi, Joe and Chris. 
Chris Crane: Hey, Mike. 
Michael Weinstein: Hey. Maybe you could explain a little bit why the hedging program is still -- is a little bit more behind ratable? And I guess you talked about not expecting a significant balance in power prices going forward. Just wondering what the -- what your thinking is.
Chris Crane: Yes. I'll let Jim McHugh answer that.
Jim McHugh: Yeah. Hi, Michael, it's Jim. We have shifted our positioning in the markets through time. I think we -- at this time of year 18 months ago or even 24 months ago we were carrying a position behind ratable primarily in the baseload regions looking at the markets and where they were trading. What we've done is we've shifted some of that to different regions. For example one of the areas we've -- with a backward-dated curve in ERCOT for example. We see opportunities in different seasons in Texas with ORDC pricing being more relative for the future. So there's just we're picking and choosing our spots I would say and it's spread out across multiple regions. And it's just a smaller overall position but we're looking at where the opportunities are. And then not -- a little bit relative to your question I would just highlight too that the vast majority of our new business would not come from that type of optimization activity, but 70% to 75% would come from our load sales and customer-facing business in retail and wholesale. So we see a good strong pipeline for those activities. And you saw the win rates and renewal rates that Chris spoke to during the call which is another opportunity for us to continue to make our new business targets.
Michael Weinstein: Right. Still pretty well-balanced. Hey, and on the capital program would it be fair to say that it's -- that you're being conservative on it given the uncertainty over PJM and CJM? Could the capital program actually be higher next year if we see some more resolution more certainty over that?
Joe Nigro: Michael, what I would say is our capital program reflects what we think is -- the projects we've identified as I said in my prepared remarks at this point in time. I think that you've seen the uptick in what we put in in 2019 versus what we're putting in in 2020 and we'll continue to challenge ourselves for the benefit of our customers. But right now I would tell you I think what we're showing you is a fair reflection of where we are and what we expect to do.
Calvin Butler: Michael, this is Calvin. I would also say when you look at 2019 we added $150 million additional capital all around gas main replacement and really adding to the overall customer experience. And as we've built out our plan whether it's transmission or distribution additional capital it's all around meeting those customers' expectations and our stakeholders' in terms of reliability and resiliency. So we feel we have a solid plan and can execute to it.
Chris Crane: The only thing, I'd add to that is every quarter we look at the total bill of the customers and we're very sensitive to making sure the investment is prudent. It drives efficiency reliability and benefit to the customer and we also watch the affordability.
Michael Weinstein: Got it. One last question. Hey, Calvin. So the PHI multiyear rate plan filing for this year are you guys -- would it be fair to say that the ROEs tick up from the low 9s could go up to the high 9s if you get that approved later on?
Calvin Butler: No. What we anticipate -- we do not first right now we expect the DC Commission to come out with a ruling in the fourth quarter of this year. And along the way we've adjusted our ask in terms of those multiyear plans. But we have a very solid understanding of what those ROEs are so I'm comfortable with where they are right now.
Michael Weinstein: Got you. All right. Thank you very much.
Chris Crane: Thank you and thank you for participating today. Before we end, I want to thank our employees for staying focused on safety and delivering another good year both operationally and financially. And with that, I'll close out the call. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you for joining us today. We hope you found this presentation informative. This concludes our presentation. You may now disconnect and have a good day.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-10-31 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Exelon 2019 Third Quarter Earnings Call. At this time all participant lines are in a listen only mode. After the speakers’ presentation there will be a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to hand the call over to your speaker today, Dan Eggers, Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance. Please go ahead, sir.
Dan Eggers: Thank you, Tamara. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Leading the call today are Chris Crane, Exelon's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Joe Nigro Exelon's Chief Financial Officer. They're joined by other members of Exelon senior management team who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. We issued our earnings release this morning along with the presentation, both of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of Exelon's website. The earnings release and other matters, which we discuss during today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties, actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today's material and comments made during this call. Please refer to today's 8-K and Exelon's other SEC filings for discussions of risk factors and factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts and expectations. Today's presentation also includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation. And our earnings release for reconciliations between the non-GAAP measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures. I'll turn the call over to Mr. Chris Crane, Exelon's Chief Executive Officer.
Chris Crane: Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. We had a good quarter delivering strong earnings, excellent customer service across our utilities and our nuclear units ran at high levels of reliability. I'll turn to our regular reporting of our financial performance in a minute, but I first want to address a matter that I know is on all of our minds. We have publicly reported we have received two grand-jury subpoenas; the subjects which are lobbying practices in Illinois and the company's relationship with an Illinois state senator. These subpoenas and the speculation about what's behind them have dominated the news about Exelon and ComEd. Given that the investigations are ongoing we cannot discuss many details, but I'll tell you this, when we learned of these investigations we pledged complete cooperation with the government and that is the path we have taken. The company's outside lawyers are undertaking an exhaustive investigation of the facts relevant to the subpoenas, a special committee of the Board represented by its own outside counsel has also been informed and is being briefed on the investigation. Exelon's outside lawyers are sharing the results of the investigation with the government on an ongoing basis. Their investigation is enabling us to determine what changes necessary internally to ensure that going forward we operate at the highest possible standards, not whether actions have been legal or not but rather which go beyond the ethical reproach. We are keeping our eye on the ball by staying focused on the operational and the strategic path that has delivered the success. Now I'll turn to the regular report and answer any questions about that I can at the end of the call. Starting on Slide 5, we've had positive developments over the quarter. First, we were named Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the 14th year in a row with Exelon continuing to score in the top 20% of North American companies in all industries.  Second, we launched a Climate Investment Initiative to invest $20 million and start-ups in our service territories that are working on new technologies to reduce greenhouse emission -- gas emissions in climate change -- mitigating climate change.  Third, Pepco Maryland was granted a 9.6 allowed ROE in its most recent rate case. This is an improvement and the results continued to -- through the enhancement in our reliability and customer service for our customers.  Fourth, the Maryland PSC issued an order in the alternative rate making proceeding known as PC 51, allowing Maryland utilities to file a multi-year rate plan as soon as next year.  Fifth, the New York Supreme Court rejected challenges to the New York ZEC program removing the last remaining legal challenge in front of us. Sixth the Governor Wealth Issue and executive order beginning to process for Pennsylvania to join REGI, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. This will allow Pennsylvania to meet its climate goals while helping to preserve the state's remaining zero carbon nuclear plants.  Seventh, earlier this week, we announced an agreement with Governor Hogan in Maryland that will allow us to continue to operate Conowingo Dam and protect the long-term health of the Chesapeake Bay. Continued production of carbon free energy from the dam is vital to support Governor Hogan's goal in generating a 100% clean electricity in Maryland by 2040.  Finally, we're announcing new round of cost savings at ExGen finding an additional $100 million savings. We continue to work hard at driving efficiencies and adapting to current market conditions. These savings will help ExGen navigate the depressed forwards but will not be enough to overcome the financial challenges of some of our Illinois nuclear plants. I realize there has been some discussion on the potential impact of the investigation on the prospects of a clean energy legislation in Illinois. The need for clean energy legislation is bigger than just one stakeholder or one company. We are one part, but only one part of the ongoing discussion about the urgent need for legislation in Illinois. With the roadblock, excuse me, with the rollback of environmental regulations in Washington, states across the country are taking action to require emission reductions, so they can benefit from clean energy economy that will result. This is true Illinois where many stakeholders and policymakers want for Illinois on a path to 100% clean drive and drive electrification of transportation and to protect our communities. They believe the act action is urgently needed in Illinois to ensure clean air, reliable service in affordable rates for Illinois consumers. Exelon nuclear plants are essential to achieving these goals. The four plants without ZECs avoid $45 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emission contribute 4.5 billion in state gross domestic product pay $149 million in state taxes and if they were to retire prematurely Illinois customers -- consumers will pay more than $483 million more in electricity annually. I should point out that the delays in enacting the legislation are in part linked to FERC's delay in issuing an order on PJM market capacity. This is due to the lack of quorum until the end of November when Commissioner Glick completes his recusal period, and while the FERC delay is very frustrating. It does allow Illinois more time to enact and implement the legislation changes in time to protect the clean energy programs from negative treatment in PJM capacity auction. The delay in FERC order will push back the 2022 and '23 auction until at least late fall of 2020. Spring passage of legislation will allow for Illinois clean energy procurement mechanism to be in place before the 2023/2024 capacity auction and potentially before the 2022/2023 auction as well. Moving to our financial results, we have had a strong quarter with the earnings above our guidance. Our GAAP-based -- on a GAAP basis, we earned $0.79 per share versus $0.76 per share last year. On a non-GAAP basis, we earned $0.92 per share versus $0.88 per share last year. Joe will cover these details in his remarks. Moving onto Slide 6, operational performance at the utilities was mix this quarter. Each of our utilities performed well on customer operations side, with mostly top quartile performance. However, only ComEd performed in the first quartile and outage frequency and duration metrics. This year, in the Middle Atlantic, we have seen significantly more storms and abnormally higher temperatures which increased vegetation impacts it caused on the reliability related issues. For instance PHI had 27 minor storms in 2019 compared to four in 2018. These drove the lower reliability metrics for our mid-Atlantic utilities. Generation performed well during the quarter. Nuclear produced 39.2 terawatt hours of zero emission electricity with a capacity factor of 95.5. Exelon power exceeded our plan and had a gas and hydro dispatch match of 97.5 and a wind and solar capture of 96.5. That said, we also had some outages in Texas during critical hours that were disappointing and cause us to miss out on some of the bigger opportunities in ERCOT. For now, I'll turn it over to Joe, and then we'll go to the questions after. Thank you.
Joe Nigro: Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover our third quarter results, quarterly financial updates, including trailing 12 month ROEs at the utilities and our hedge disclosures. I will also provide an update on our full year 2019 guidance and our cost management program. First, turning to Slide 7, we earned $0.79 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.92 per share on a non-GAAP basis which exceeded our guidance range of $0.80 to $0.90 per share. The outperformance was driven by Exelon utility which delivered a combined $0.56 per share net of holding company expenses. Utility earnings were higher relative to guidance, driven largely by O&M timing during the quarter and favorable weather in our non-decoupled jurisdictions including PECO, Atlantic City Electric and Delmarva Delaware. As a reminder, in total, we are approximately 70% decoupled across our utilities. ExGen earned $0.36 per share, which was a little behind our plan. The third quarter was impacted by unplanned outages at owned and contracted assets in ERCOT which unfortunately hit during periods of high prices. Although, we had one of the top 10 hottest summers in 70 years in PJM and the third hottest September on record, we saw lower prices and volatility which resulted in less ability to optimize our wholesale portfolio during the quarter. Turning to Slide 8, we show our quarter-over-quarter walk. The $0.92 per share in the third quarter of this year was $0.04 per share higher than the third quarter of 2018. Exelon Utilities less HoldCo earnings were up $0.001 per share compared with last year. The earnings growth was driven primarily by higher distribution rates, associated with completed rate cases relative to the third quarter of 2018. This was partially offset by unfavorable weather in load at PECO. ExGen's earnings were up $0.03 per share compared with last year, benefiting from fewer planned nuclear outage days at our owned and operated plants and savings associated with our cost management program. Higher ZEC revenues from the increase in New York ZEC pricing and the start of the New Jersey ZEC program in April of 2019 also contributed to ExGen's year-over-year earnings growth. These were partially offset by lower capacity pricing, primarily in PJM. Turning to Slide 9, we are narrowing our 2019 EPS guidance range to $3.05 to $3.20 a share from $3 to $3.30 per share. As you are aware ComEd's ROE is tied to the 30-year treasury rates which is declined about 70 basis points since the beginning of the year. Our updated guidance takes into account the slight degradation in earnings we are seeing from the decline in treasuries. We are delivering on our financial commitments and confident we will be within our revised guidance range at year-end. Moving to Slide 10, looking at our utility returns on a consolidated basis, we continue to exceed our consolidated 9% to 10% target with a 10.1% trailing 12 month ROE. Earned ROEs for the legacy Exelon utilities remained above 10% but dipped modestly last quarter, primarily due to a BG&E equity infusion to support capital investments as well as declining treasury yield which impacted ComEd's ROE. The decline in treasuries will continue to impact ComEd's ROE for the remainder of the year and going forward if they do not rebound. The consolidated PHI utilities earned a 9.4% ROE for the trailing 12 months, a 30 basis point increase from last quarter driven by higher distribution revenue from the constructive distribution rate order at both Pepco Maryland and the settlement at Atlantic City Electric. We remain focused on meeting our utility earnings growth target by maintaining the earned ROEs at PHI and sustaining strong performance at our other utilities. Turning to Slide 11. During the quarter, there were some important developments on the regulatory front outside of our rate cases. First, as Chris mentioned, in August, the Maryland PSC in its PC 51 proceeding found that alternative rate plans can be beneficial to both customers and utilities by reducing administrative costs caused by the frequent filing of traditional rate cases and providing customer rate predictability. The order supports the implementation of multi-year rate plans of a three-year duration and established a working group to develop the rules. We are actively participating in the group process. Once the commission issues its final order, Maryland utilities will be able to file a multi-year rate plan on a staggered basis consistent with the Commission's order. Second, the DC Public Service Commission approved Pepco's DC notice of construction request for Phase 1 of the capital grid project. It will strengthen the capital area electric system, improve reliability and resiliency and help facilitate the district's climate commitments. This phase including rebuilding two substation and constructing approximately 10 miles of two 230kV underground transmission lines. Phase 1 is scheduled for completion by 2026. On our current rate cases, Pepco Maryland received a final order on August 12th. The Maryland Commission approved a $10.3 million increase in annual electric distribution revenues. Importantly, the order increase at Pepco's allowed ROE by 10 basis points to 9.6%, a recognition of strong performance in reliability and customer satisfaction. Rates went into effect on August 13th. We also have several rate cases still in progress. On October 23rd, the administrative law judge providing over ComEd's annual formula rate case issued a proposed order, no additional adjustments to the revenue requirements were recommending. We expect to receive a final order from the Illinois Commerce Commission on December 4th of this year. Last Friday, BGE filed a settlement agreement with the Maryland PSC. The settlement provides for an increase to BGE's annual electric and natural gas distribution rate of $25 million and $54 million respectively. We expect a final order by December of 2019. Finally, we received a procedural schedule in Pepco DC multi-year plan with the final order expected in the fourth quarter of 2020. More details on our rate cases can be found on Slides 21 through 24 of the appendix. Turning to Slide 12, we are continuing on our robust capital deployment at the utilities, investing $1.3 billion of capital during the third quarter. Year-to-date, we have invested $3.9 billion in capital at the utilities, improving our infrastructure and increasing reliability and resiliency for the benefit of our consumers. We expect to deploy more than $5.4 billion this year, $100 million above our original plan. And as a reminder, 63% of our rate base growth is covered under either formula rates or mechanisms like capital tracker. Today, I will talk about two projects that are part of these efforts and will bring improved performance to our customers in Maryland and New Jersey. The first project is the BGE key crossing reliability initiative, which is a $232 million multi-year project to install a double circuit 230kV overhead electric transmission line across the Patapsco River, replacing the 2.25 mile underground circuit. The circuits are critical link in the electric system and are exhibiting system symptoms of long-term failure and are approaching the end of the useful life. Key crossing will improve grid reliability by reducing risk of power outages caused by aging infrastructure and will support faster restoration of customer interruptions going forward. The second project Lewis Higbee Ontario rebuild project in Atlantic City. The $62 million project include rebuilding 369kV transmission lines which are about 16.5 line miles long in total and replacing 295 existing wood structures with 225 new galvanized steel structures. This project results potential system performance and reliability issues, thereby improving reliability and resiliency to customers in the service area of Absecon, Island. On Slide 13, we provide our gross margin update incurring current hedging strategy at the Generation company. Since the Constellation merger, we have delivered strong results in our wholesale business quarter-after-quarter even in an environment of declining power and natural gas prices as well as lower volatility. These market conditions combined with reduced liquidity added out on the curve leads to less opportunity to optimize our wholesale portfolio compared to history. As a result, we are reducing our power new business target by $50 million in 2020 and '21 and our non-power new business target by $50 million in 2021. These new business target reductions are mostly offset by cost savings, which I will discuss on the next slide. I should also stress that these changes reflect our expectation for our wholesale optimization business. Our customer facing Constellation businesses continue to perform very well with sustained margins and success in delivering new products for our customers. Turning to the gross margin tables, we did benefit in the third quarter from higher forward prices which you can see in the open gross margin line. These positives were offset by the lower wholesale business targets that I just discussed, which leaves total gross margin in 2020 and '21 flat. During the quarter, we hedged a more than a ratable amount as prices modestly recovered from their late second quarter lows. Although, we are still behind ratable overall ending the quarter 5% to 8% behind ratable in 2020 and 1% to 4% behind ratable in '21, we are much closer to a ratable hedging amount. We continue to see upside in certain markets but are not expecting a significant rebound in power prices. Turning to Slide 14. Between 2015 and 2018, we have announced more than $900 million in cost savings which does not include the synergies from our merger with PHI. These savings were primarily at Exelon Generation with approximately one-third coming from our corporate services company. In addition to O&M savings, we have continued to find ways to reduce the capital intensity of our generation fleet and improve its cash flows. Since 2015, we have reduced ExGen's total annual capital expenditures from $3.5 billion to a projected $1.5 billion in 2022, while maintaining the safety and reliability of our fleet. Included in these reductions are the elimination of most growth capital at ExGen except for Constellation's customer facing solar business. $325 million of base capex savings and $675 million of savings from nuclear fuel. One of the key components of our value proposition is ExGen's ability to generate free cash flow and we continue to look for ways to optimize its cash flow. Today, we are announcing additional $100 million in run rate, pre-tax cash savings in 2022. $75 million is attributed to O&M reductions and $25 million is other P&L items, which mostly offset the reduction in new business targets. I should point out that these savings reflect our current state and we expect an opportunity for additional savings that will vary in amounts depending on the future state of our challenged Illinois nuclear stations. We can find these savings due to the hard work of all of our employees, who strive every day to run the company more efficiently, while adhering to our commitments of safety, reliability and community stewardship. Finally, moving on to Slide 15, we remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet in our investment-grade credit rating. Our consolidated corporate credit metrics remain above our targeted ranges and meaningfully above S&P thresholds. Looking at ExGen, we are well ahead of our debt to EBITDA target of 3.0 times. For 2019, we expect to be at 2.5 times debt to EBITDA and 2 times debt to EBITDA when excluding non-recourse debt. Before turning the call back over to Chris for his closing remarks, I want to set expectations for our fourth quarter disclosures. Given the lack of clarity around the outcome of legislation in Illinois, which will shape the future of Exelon Generation and the fact that PJM will not have held the capacity auction for the 2022-2023 delivery year before our call in February, we will not be providing some of our usual disclosures, including the roll forward of our hedge disclosures to 2022 and ExGen's updated four-year free cash flow outlook. Thank you, and I'll now turn the call back to Chris for his closing remarks.
Chris Crane: Thanks, Joe. Turning to Slide 16, we are accomplishing things we committed to do, including maintaining industry leading operations, meeting our financial commitments, effectively deploying more than $5 billion in capital across our utilities this year and advocating for policies that support clean energy. Our strategy remains the right one and we are committed to our value proposition. We will continue to grow the utilities targeting a 7.8% rate base growth and a 6% to 8% earnings growth through 2022. We continue to use, as Joe mentioned, the free cash flow from Genco to fund incremental equity needs at the utilities, paydown debt and fund part of the growing dividend. We will continue to optimize the value of our ExGen business by seeking fair compensation for zero emitting generation fleet, closing uneconomic plants like we did with TMI and Oyster Creek, selling assets where it makes sense to accelerate our debt reduction plans and maximizing value through the Generation to load match strategy at Constellation. We will sustain strong investment-grade metrics. We'll grow our dividend annually by 5% through 2020. The strategy underpinning this value proposition is effective. We remain committed to optimizing the value of our businesses and earn your ongoing support of Exelon. Operator, we can now turn it over to questions. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first response is from Greg Gordon of Evercore. Please go ahead.
Greg Gordon: Thanks, good morning. Got a couple of questions. First as it pertains to ExGen, you sort of commented at the end with regard to plant closures. If you're, for one reason or another, unable to get the state of Illinois to understand the economic necessity of increased compensation for your nuclear fleet. At what point do you go down the path of moving to shutdown of the most uneconomic units?
Chris Crane: I can't stress how important the spring legislative session will be for the future of the four sites that are not covered under the ZEC program. So we'll be watching -- there's couple of variables here, we'll be watching what happens with the FERC order and what PJMs responses to the FERC order driving the legislation, but the first half of 2020, will be a real critical point in decision making and potential announcements one way or the other.
Greg Gordon: And Joe. As it pertains to the details of the guidance, it's sort of two steps forward, 1.5 steps back on the outlook for ExGen better wholesale prices, but -- and the cost cutting, but lower optimization expectations. Is that a function of just lower volatility and lower overall prices making it less some -- less -- that volatility lessening the opportunity for your traders to manage the book effectively or can you give us a little more color on that?
Joe Nigro: Yeah, Greg. You're spot on. I think it's a combination of factors. It's -- the lower volatility in the marketplace, I mean, we had a warm summer here and we didn't see much volatility, we didn't see prices respond. I do want to stress that we're talking about the wholesale side of our business, our retail business remains very solid. And as it relates to ExGen, we announced these cost cuts which mostly offset the reduction in new business targets. As Chris mentioned, depending on the outcome of Illinois, there is still other things that we would have to evaluate on how our business model changes and disposition of assets. There is other costs that we would look at -- some of the levers we have at hand, we'll continue to address capex obviously and any other asset financing. So there is a combination of factors here. But specifically to the drop in the new business targets, it is the market environment that we're seeing.
Greg Gordon: Okay. And then on -- two more questions, one on the regulated side, the ComEd sounds like it's operating very well but 30-year is a headwind and it'll continue to be a headwind into next year and until we see a steepening of the yield curve. So like -- as you're looking at the outcomes in the other areas of the utility business. The other 60%, 65% of the earnings contribution from outside ComEd, are you seeing opportunities to offset the impact of interest rates or should we assume that all things equal, you're trending lower in that 6% to 8% guidance range than you were before?
Joe Nigro: Yeah, Greg. Good questions, Joe again. We update once a year on our Q4 call and we -- and as it relates to Exelon utilities and we will expect to do that on the call in February. Having said that, we are seeing the impact of the lower ROEs at ComEd just for reference every 50 basis point move up or down is about $0.03 of EPS. So for 2019 for example, the weighted average 30-year is down approximately 50 basis points and you see that with our revised guidance. The 30-year treasury on the forward curve is down approximately 70 basis points versus 12/31. I would say though that's one piece of the plan. The capex plan, as we've said, only corporates identified projects that benefit the consumer and improve the liability in the customer experience. We have seen through time that as we get closer to a given period, we find need for an additional investment to continue to improve the liability in that customer experience and we'll continue to work hard at that as we move forward.
Greg Gordon: All right. And my last question, Chris, I know it's a difficult topic, the investigation. The second subpoena and the retirement of Anne Pramaggiore, they're all very disconcerting public disclosures. What is it that you can tell us about how you can potentially resolve this investigation? What kind of timeline are we looking at between now and when you can get the other parties and this comfortable with the way that you've acted or comfortable that they've gotten the information they need, so that we can resolve this?
Chris Crane: There is a grand-jury investigation going on. There's not a lot of details that we can provide at this point. The timeline is not set by us, it's set by the government and the grand-jury and we'll continue to cooperate. Anything we learn from our outside attorneys doing the independent investigation will immediately take action on and correct. But our cooperation with the government -- full cooperation, very open cooperation is the imperative here. And like I said, we're not passing judgment on is anything legal or illegal and some of our past practices with contract lobbyists or consultants. So these things can take a while. I don't expect it will impede our business at all. Going forward is keeping the eye on the ball, improving the operations, driving the reliability while driving efficiency at the same time. The management team is very focused. There's a lot of speculation in news articles. There is things out there that people are speculating on that they're getting to say that the best. So we'll just have to continue the process, continue to cooperate, continue to keep our eye on the ball and when it comes time that we're able to speak we can provide a little bit more color on any corrective actions we've taken. But for now, it's -- we can't go there.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is from the line of Julien Dumoulin Smith from Bank of America.
Julien Dumoulin Smith: Hey, good morning, team. Hey just wanted to follow up on a few details perhaps we can talk to as a function of the process today. And I'll include that the two of them together here. First the Clean Jobs Coalition and just some of the headlines around where the legislative -- legislation stands today. I know whether it happens this year or more importantly next year. Just wanted to understand how we're framing that conversation today given the realities? And then separately and somewhat related, I'd be curious how would you position the conversation of the franchise extension at ComEd next year? It seems unrelated, but I just want to make sure we at least talk through some of the process on that front as well?
Chris Crane: Sure, I'll cover the first part and Joe Dominguez is with us and I'll let him cover the second part. The conversations, negotiations, strategy for the legislation is still an active conversation with many stakeholders. And when you talk about the Clean Jobs Coalition, just so you know that's not a very structured organization. And to speak as a body, as somebody did to one publication, we're still very close in conversation with some of those members of the coalition and we'll continue, but there is a lot of people involved, there is different coalitions, there's the path to one hundred to the clean jobs coalition. There is the labor. So things are continuing to evolve in conversations with leadership and the legislature are continuing to take place. So it's not like we're stalled or stopped or don't have parties to deal with. Kathleen is doing -- for the Generation side doing a significant part of that. And Joe is working to not only support what the Governor wants and what the State wants, but in the meantime, also protecting the consumers to make sure what we're doing to get to the path to a 100% clean by 2030 is done in a most economic fashion. I'll Kathleen if she wants to add anything more to the first part and I'm going to turn it over to Joe.
Kathleen Barron: The only thing that I would add is that the same news story is talking about that question, Julien. I also mentioned that the FRR is the center piece of this CJC bill. And that's because it's essential to achieving the state's clean energy goals. If we do not address this, the PJM market will send over $1 billion a year to old coal plants rather than investing the money toward the state's clean energy ambition, and that the fact that folks are lobbying and rallying in the capital around this. The fact that it's an important policy change and that it needs to happen right away is something that should be noted. Now obviously there are other elements of the bill both from the CJC, the path to 100 others that there is not agreement about and that's why it's going to take all stakeholders together to deliver piece of legislation that will get the states to its clean energy goals in a way that's affordable and we are committed, as Chris said, to working with all stakeholders to achieve that goal.
Chris Crane: Joe?
Joe Dominguez: Great, Julien good morning. Let me just start off explaining what the franchise agreement is. At its most basic level, it's an agreement that sets for the procedures for us to use city right away for our infrastructure and the fee schedule that we pay in order to use their right away. So what I'm talking about here that are kind of granular things that are in the franchise agreement is, how many times could you open up a street to interconnect a new business, what the fees are for those operations that kind of granular detail. We've been in negotiations with the city now for some time. There was a pause in those negotiations while the mayor's race was being sorted out and her new team was put in place, I'm pleased with the progress we're making right now. There are three potential outcomes here. The agreement that is scheduled to come to an end at the end of next calendar year, at the end of 2020. Either party ComEd or the city have an option at the end of this year to terminate the agreement or they could continue to negotiate. As I said the path we're on right now is that we're continuing to negotiate and if we're successful we'll will get a new agreement. If the city elects to terminate at the end of this year, we will continue negotiations and if we do not reach a resolution. It's not like we stop providing electric service to the city but our fee schedule and our procedures will drop out of the franchise agreement and will be governed by the municipal code that'll add a little bit of process to our work, but it doesn't shut down quite obviously our activities. If the city does not issue a notice of termination at the end of the year and we continue to negotiate and can't reach a resolution. Then the agreement by its terms just continues year-to-year until we reach a resolution. So that's kind of the outline of it. And Julien, if you don't mind, I'd like to provide some additional context Chris and Greg talked a little bit about our performance, but I think it bears on the entire discussion this morning. We are on track at ComEd to deliver our best performance in the history of the company. We talk about being first quartile. We're actually first decile in reliability and arguably best in class. As a result of the good policies, which we've advocated for, 92% of the energy that we deliver to customers comes from zero carbon resources. To put that into context, the next closest large utility is at about 46%. We have a supplier diversity program that is second to none. 41% of our spend this year is with businesses owned by women and people of color as well as veterans. We are on track as a result of all of this to deliver the best customer satisfaction we've ever seen. And we're doing all of it at affordable rates. Today, our rates are 20% lower than the average for large American cities. Four out of nine of our rate cases have been decreases under the smart grid law, including the last two cases. Chris talked about the investigation and certainly, we'll have learnings as a consequence of it. But it's important for all of the shareholders who invest in our platform to understand that we are doing a lot of things, right. And with some humility could lay claim to being one of the best performing utilities in America. And I just add that for context in all of the things we're talking about today.
Chris Crane: Thanks, Joe.
Julien Dumoulin Smith: Excellent. Guys, I appreciate that.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research.
Steve Fleishman: Yeah. Hi, good morning. So I guess one of the things that we struggle with these disclosures has just been really what benefit if any you've gotten from legislation over the last few years. And for example on the formula rates, the ROE right now is actually really low and, as Joe mentioned. And then also, I guess, you've gotten the ZECs on Clin and Quad. So just but I think those plants would have been losing a lot of money if you didn't get them. So I guess, maybe you could just give some color of kind of what value really is at risk from this from an investor standpoint because it's just not clear that you've gotten a lot of value out of any legislation over this period?
Chris Crane: Well, we -- the value is the consistency in the process of the rate cases. We are tied to the 30-year and that was a negotiation that was done. If you look at the history of the rate cases and how it has improved the regulatory process and the consistency of the regulatory process, I think there's a lot of value in that. When you get 100% of ask or 99.6% of ask and you're not litigating something over an extended period, it creates predictability. We can't control the 30-year, but we can control the efficiency and the productivity of the system with the right regulatory format and that's what we've done. As for Clinton and Quad cities it did save the plants and it's more than just saving losing cash, we would have shut them down and that issue would have been resolved very quickly. It's meaningful to state in the community but it also is providing a profitable cash flow from those units. We're working on legislation that would either secure on the other four sites in the state through the FRR process or we will shut those plants down. So -- in a point in time with the low interest rate, you could point to that and say we haven't got anything, but that is not been the historical case, and going forward, we'll watch what we can do if interest rates persist to stay low what action we should take. But I would have to tell you that, I understand the sentiment of your view or your question but there has been a great deal of consistency that's happened and a great deal of ability to invest capital. It's more than just the ROE, right. We have been able to through legislative terms -- been able to consistently invest needed capital for reliability and efficiency and be able to earn a return. They may be a little bit lower returns but we're able to predictably invest the money and predictably get a return on the money. So that's huge, if you go back historically to what's happened in some of our jurisdictions investing money at risk and then getting the disallowances in the regulatory process was much more damning than having a low 30-year rate and having a low ROE , but still an ROE that's above our cost of capital.
Steve Fleishman: Yeah. Got that. And then just one other question with respect to the nuclear plants. This may be premature, but just could you give us a sense, I am assuming they're -- money-losing on their own the 4 nuclear plants that you're referring too, is there any way to kind of get a sense of the -- if you ended up having to shut them, what it would do?
Chris Crane: We don't evaluate the market response -- projected market response from shutting the plants down. So what we do evaluate is the current financial performance of the free cash flow and earnings and then the forward projected based on the forward curves and look at the credit metrics and the balance sheet to see what's happening. And so we have discussed openly that there -- the four sites are in the future at current forwards with the current capacity market being managed the way it is by PJM versus the needs that the state wants to maintain the clean energy sources with lack of being able to get legislation to change and be able to pull ourselves out of a very inefficient by what the state wants auction process at PJM and go into FRR. They're marginal at best to looking forward to losing cash and earnings. So that's the situation. Now, I don't think we're announcing the amounts yet. We're continuing to evaluate these numbers, but I can tell you that some are more dire than others at this point and we need to move forward with the legislation to prevent the loss for the state from an environmental perspective and from economic perspective.
Steve Fleishman: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Your next response is from Stephen Byrd from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Stephen Byrd: Just wanted to go back to the point you mentioned about the special committee at the Board with respect to the Illinois investigation. Are there any targeted deliverables in terms of reports or updates and will any of that eventually be made public or is that more for internal purposes?
Chris Crane: I'll let Bill answer that.
Bill Von Hoene: Steven, it's Bill Von Hoene. The special committee of independent directors will continue to meet periodically as needed. They have their own counsel. There is no particular deliverable that you should anticipate out of that. It's just part of the regular process that's undertaking in circumstances such as this. So no particular deliverable should you foresee.
Stephen Byrd: Understood. And in terms of the scope of the investigation, to your knowledge, is this focused solely on Illinois or there are other states or elements of the business involved?
Bill Von Hoene: We're not at liberty to talk about the particulars of the investigation but you've seen what has been reported about the subject matter and the subject matter of that has been reported by us in our case, and I refer you to that.
Stephen Byrd: Yeah. No, that's fair. And then just lastly -- just in terms of the scope of the investigation. I think there are four individuals mentioned. And I think we've seen two announcements from Exelon I assume just at a high level, you had mentioned, Chris at the beginning the policy is to cooperate with investigations. I presume that employees who do not cooperate would not be employed at the firm or is there sort of policy we should think about in terms of how you approach cooperation with the investigations?
Chris Crane: Yeah, the expectation is for all employees and all executives to participate in whatever manner they're requested to, if that's providing information or having discussions. That's the expectation. Peoples employment is based on their total record, but our expectation is full cooperation and ethical behavior.
Operator: Thank you. Your next response is from Praful Mehta from Citigroup.
Praful Mehta: Hi. Good morning. So maybe I just wanted to focus on the generation side a little bit, as comparing Q2 and Q3 power prices and it looks like every region the power prices go higher. However, given as you talked about your volatility was lower and so margins came in lower and there is also a little bit of cost cutting now for 2021. So just wanted to understand how we should think about the generation business, it seems like curves itself aren't enough volatility is now a new element that we need to consider. How should we think about the stability of the generation business? And also in the context of reserve margins in PJM, if you could just give us a little bit more on how you think about the business that would be really helpful.
Chris Crane: Let me have Joe starting and Jim McHugh go into more detail.
Joe Nigro: Praful. Good morning. What -- I think if you think about what the intrinsic strategy of our generation business is, it's been producing electric generation and we deliver it to our customer-facing businesses and that still continues. Obviously, the power markets have some challenges and you've seen what we done -- we've done with our new business, we continue to work hard to find ways to reduce the cost structure both from an O&M and capital investment perspective of our generation assets as well as our Constellation business. And I think that's -- what you'll see us continue to do. I think the second piece of that gets into the industrial strategy of what we're trying to accomplish as a company. You see how we're investing in our utilities, you see how we continue to manage our balance sheet and we continue to return value to the shareholders. That is being done on the back of cash flows that are being generated -- free cash flow that's being generated at Exelon Generation and we will continue to work hard to do that as we continue to transform the Generation business. So last piece is obviously, as we've talked about in our prepared remarks and with some of the questions, we announced this cost cutting exercising business as usual state, depending on the outcome of the legislation in Illinois, clearly there is other elements to our business that would need to evolve under certain scenarios, so we'll continue to work hard at that and then that'll be dictated by other outcomes.
Ken Cornew: Hey, Praful, it's Ken Cornew. I'll just add a comment. We can -- our strategy continues to be a premier operator of generation particularly nuclear and other clean generation and also be a solutions provider for customers that has not changed. I wouldn't think about the Generation company any differently than that. And I'd like Jim to comment a little more on the customer side of our business.
Jim McHugh: Yeah, so I think it's important to note that the new business generation -- we put new business targets in our hedge disclosures, that's an expectation of the value we're going to create both from our customer-facing businesses as well as the optimization of the assets in the markets. The customer-facing businesses are performing very strongly and the stable value that has been there for a while, we still see good margins in really product enhancements and product solutions for customers who are demanding more. What's happening on our wholesale business side is the lower volatility in the markets which actually where we've reduced our new business targets around that end of the business, which actually, in my view point, leads to more stability. We have an environment where 70% to 75% of the gross margin in our new business will come from the stable customer-facing businesses that we run that are still performing strongly. So a smaller portion of our overall gross margins would come from this optimization activity. We happen to have an expectation of those numbers in our forward disclosures and that's the number that we are lowering based on this environment where we just see the supply stack being strong in markets like PJM and policy adding more generations to the stack, low natural gas price volatility and low demand growth in markets like PJM. So I think we're able to shift our business focus here to this customer-facing business that's more stable. We can reduce our costs to match that new business model and really provide an environment that I think is a less risk environment for the Generation company.
Praful Mehta: Got you. That's super thoughtful and helpful color. So I appreciate that. I guess just the quick follow-up in terms of the federal investigation, as you mentioned earlier on the call, it could take a long time or it could take some time. So if it does take time and your Illinois legislation for some reason is delayed linked to that. How do you decide on what happens with the units? Do you still run them? Do you still -- nuclear refueling is still continued or do you kind of wait? What kind of decision making you kind of expect around that from a timing perspective?
Chris Crane: Well nothing has been linked to the investigation and the legislation. Right now, there is -- to run any legislation we've got to see a FERC order and we probably won't see the FERC order of PJMs response. Both of those tied together till sometime in the first quarter which will enable us to refine a legislative path going forward. If for some reason we don't garner support as a coalition in a large group of stakeholders to go forward with the legislation by what we see in the market forwards today, plants will start to shut down. That's the reality if something doesn't happen in the Spring. Because PJM will run there are auctions, and if there is lack of legislation or our ability to withhold the load and the generation from that auction, the expectation of clearing megawatts you've seen the trend. So without being able to get capacity revenue for those eight reactors and the market forwards being as low as they are right now. It's uneconomic and the one thing we are not going to do is sit around and damage the balance sheet and create a situation that's unrecoverable. The responsibility of the balance sheet is very felt very strong by the management team and the actions that we will take. If lack of cohesive and complete resolution path forward. We can't sit here for years and bleed cash and build up debt and damage the HoldCo and further damage the Genco.
Praful Mehta: Understood. That's very helpful. Thank you so much.
Operator: Thank you. I will now turn the call back over to Chris Crane, President and CEO for closing remarks.
Chris Crane: I just want to thank everybody for participating in the call today and the questions. And I understand that we can't answer everything right now, but rest assured, we're taking all the actions that are necessary to ensure we can put this behind us. So thank you. With that, I'll close out the call.
Operator: Thank you for joining us today. This concludes today's conference call, you may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-08-01 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and welcome to 2019 Second Quarter Exelon Earnings Call. My name is Laura, and I will be facilitating the audio portion of today’s interactive broadcast. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I’d like to turn the show over to Dan Eggers, Exelon’s Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance. Please go ahead, sir.
Daniel Eggers: Thank you, Laura. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Leading the call today are Chris Crane, Exelon's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Joe Nigro, Exelon's Chief Financial Officer. They're joined by other members of Exelon's senior management team who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. We issued our earnings release this morning, along with the presentation, both of which can be found on the Investor Relations section of Exelon's website. The earnings release and other matters, which we discuss during today's call will contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today's material and comments made during the call. Please refer to today's 8-K and Exelon's other SEC filings for discussions of risk factors and factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts and expectations. Today's presentation also includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for reconciliations between the non-GAAP measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures. We scheduled 45 minutes for today’s call. I'll now turn the call over to Chris Crane, Exelon's CEO.
Christopher Crane: Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before I turn to the financial results for the quarter, I'm going to spend a few minutes providing some key updates on a number of positive developments in our businesses over the last three months. First, we continue to move forward on our utility regulatory strategy, filing distribution rate cases at BGE, ComEd, and Pepco, DC, reflecting our safety and reliability investments across those service territories. In DC, we filed our first multiyear rate case. The plan provides the necessary framework to align Pepco system investments with DC policy goals, including grid modernization and further improvements to customer service and reliability. Joe will discuss the details in his remark. Second, last week, Pepco and other parties filed a settlement agreement at FERC for PECO’s formula rate, transmission rate. The settlement includes a 10.35% ROE inclusive of a 50 basis point ROE adder. PECO made the original filing in 2017 and we expect the final order from FERC in 2020. Third, in June, we issued our annual corporate sustainability report, marking our performance and sustainability goals and priorities. In addition, the Benchmarking Air Emissions report that found Exelon is the largest generator of zero emissions energy in the U.S., producing 12% of the nation's clean energy. Also that we have the lowest emissions rate admitting at a rate that is 4x less than the next cleanest generator. Fourth, the New Jersey BPU approved ZEC payments for the state nuclear units including our interest in sale. We appreciate the state support for the carbon-free power produced by these units. Fifth, we are unable to get legislation done in Pennsylvania in time to reverse the decision to close TMI this fall. Since then, there have been continued discussions on a path forward for the remaining nuclear plants in the state, including consideration of placing a price on carbon through the regional carbon trading. Six, we are also pleased the Trump Administration decided not to impose quotas on uranium which would have jeopardized the continued operation of commercial nuclear reactors in the United States. And finally, last week, FERC issued an order directing PJM not to run the capacity auction in August. We agree with FERC’s decision to delay the auction until the rules are finalized. The delay provides PJM and the state policymakers’ time to adjust to the commission’s changes. Before I turned to the financial results, I also want to address two matters, you have raised with us recently. First, we received a number of questions from investors about the impact on our business from a steep decline in power prices. The decline presents a considerable challenge for us, but as you know, our hedging disclosures are a point in time estimate. If you have seen them move up and down in the past, we need to be thoughtful and deliberate about our response if these prices persist, and we have a variety of levers that we can pull and decisions we can make if this is the future of energy markets. We are pursuing a number of market reforms addressing the financial challenges many of our plants space. Against this backdrop, I can also again assure you that we will not operate our unprofitable or negative free cash flow plants. You've seen us closed money losing plants in the past. You should expect that discipline to continue if reforms are not inactive. The bottom line is that fundamental market reforms in either the United States if we want to meet the nation's clean energy climate goals, maintain fuel security and reliable system. We need to sustain and increase electrification, preserving a significant economic value through good paying jobs in property taxes. We'll continue to work at the state level and the national level with birth the Congress and the administration to make this happen. Second, we've had – we received numerous questions from our investors about the subpoena in Illinois from the U.S. Attorney's Office. We are cooperating fully and provided all or providing all information requested by the U.S. Attorney's office. We simply can't comment further on the investigation and we're not going to speculate on whether it may affect legislative efforts in Illinois this fall. What we do know about this fall session is there are a number of stakeholders who want to see clean energy legislation enacted. Illinois lacks behind other progressive states on clean energy policy, passing the clean energy legislation as a priority for many stakeholders include in Illinois, including the Citizens Utility Board, Labor, the Clean Jobs Coalition, and the Renewable Community. These stakeholders want to greatly expand the renewable penetration, so the state will be able to achieve the 100% clean energy target by 2030. Kathleen and her team are working with the stakeholders to help craft the legislation or legislative package and the Board members of the General Assembly on the benefits of this legislation. It's important to remember that while we are putting a real effort into preserving the value of the generation pleat, our focus remains on the utilities. The bulk of our capital investment in growing a majority of our earnings are coming from the regulated business where we continue to see great opportunities to invest and grow to the benefit of our customers and communities. Now I'll turn to the financial results on Slide 5. We had a good quarter delivering earnings at midpoint range of our guidance. On GAAP basis, we earned $0.50 per share versus $0.56 last year. On a non-GAAP basis, we earned $0.60 per share versus $0.71 last year. Joe will cover these drivers in his remarks. Turning to Slide 6, operational performance of the utility was mixed during the quarter. We continued to perform at top quartile levels of costs for reliability and customer operations metrics or safety performance has slipped. Safety is the priority and we are focused on ways to improve our safety culture and performance. Outage frequency and outage duration performance is in the top quartile for three of our four utilities with ComEd performing in top decile. So, on the customer operations side, all of our utilities performed in top quartile for service level and call abandonment rate. Our relationship with our customers is improving due to the investments we are making to improve reliability and the customer experience. This could be seen in our customer satisfaction scores and then the recent J.D. Power electrical of residential customer satisfaction ratings. BGE and PECO, and ComEd achieve top decile performance and customer satisfaction index. We improved or maintained our rankings in the J.D. Power rankings. Delmarva ranked first in the east mid region – a mid-size region, the first excellent utility to ever be ranked first. BGE and PECO maintained their first quartile performance in the East Large segment and ComEd improved in its ranking to the second quartile. Generation perform well during the quarter nuclear produced 38.8 terawatts hours of zero emission electricity with the capacity factor of 95.1%. And Exelon power and had a gas and Hydro dispatch match of 99.7% exceeding our plan and the wind and solar capture on the plan was 96% - was weaker plan of 96%. Now I'll turn it over to Joe.
Joseph Nigro: Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover our second quarter result, our quarterly financial updates, including trailing 12-month ROEs at the utilities and our hedge disclosures. Turning to Slide 7. We earned $0.50 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.60 per share on a non-GAAP basis, which is at the midpoint of our guidance range of $0.55 to $0.65 per share. Exelon utilities delivered a combined $0.39 per share net of holding company expenses. Utility earnings were modestly higher than our plan largely due to O&M timing at ComEd, BGE and PECO, which will reverse itself over the course of the year. This was partially offset by milder weather than expected in the Philadelphia area impacting PECO by about $0.01 per share. ExGen earned $0.21 per share behind our plan. This was a result of lower load volumes that constellation due to mild weather any extended outage of Salem. These factors were partially offset by a favorable O&M, strong performance of our Generation fleet and realized gains in our nuclear decommissioning trust funds. We are reaffirming our full-year guidance for $3 to $3.30 per share and for the third quarter we are providing adjusted operating guidance, earnings guidance of $0.80 to $0.90 per share. On Slide 8, we show our quarter-over-quarter walk. The $0.60 per share in the second quarter of this year was $0.11 per share lower than the second quarter of 2018. Exelon Utilities less holdco earnings were up $0.04 per share compared with last year. This earnings growth is driven primarily by higher distribution rate associated with completed rate increases and higher transmission revenues at ComEd and PHI relative to the second quarter of 2018. This was partially offset by unfavorable weather at PECO. ExGen earnings were down $0.13 per share compared with last year. The decrease was driven by lower realized energy prices, partially offset by higher ZEC revenue from the increase in New York ZEC prices and started of the New Jersey’s ZEC program. Moving to Slide 9. Our utility ROEs remain strong and we continue to exceed our 9% to 10% earned ROE targets across the utilities. The consolidated PHI utility earned 9.1% ROE for the trailing 12 months, compared to last quarter and we had some help from the constructive distribution rate case settlement at ACE, Pepco DC and Pepco Maryland offset by equity infusions across PHI. Legacy Exelon Utilities maintained a strong 10.5% earned ROEs in the quarter. Importantly consolidated our ROEs across our utilities were 10.2%. We remain focused on meeting our utility earnings growth targets by maintaining the earned ROEs at PHI and sustaining the strong performance at our other utilities. Turning to Slide 10. On May 24, BGE filed for a combined $148 million rate increase in electric and gas distribution revenues. The requested rate increase included $81 million and almost $68 million for electric and gas revenues respectively, based on rate based of $5.4 billion and a requested ROE of 10.3%. The increase is primarily driven by the ongoing need for capital investments to maintain and modernize the electric and gas distribution system. It also reflects moving $15.8 million of revenues currently being recovered via the stride in electrical liability investments surcharges into rate base. We into base rates and we expect to receive an order in the fourth quarter. On May 30, Pepco filed a multi-year plan in the District of Columbia, requesting a revenue increase over three years to recover capital investments made during the 2019 period and planned investments over the 2020 to 2022 time period. The request provides the necessary framework to allow Pepco to align its system investments with policy goals set by the commission and enable us to continue to make the investments needed to modernize the energy grid, support the district's energy goals, and sustain first quartile reliability performance, and enhanced programs and tools that have resulted in improved satisfaction among our customers. The multi-year plan includes five Performance Incentive Mechanisms or PJMs focused on system reliability, customer service and interconnection of distributed energy resources. The inclusion of the PJMs with the multi-year plan provide a performance based rate making approach designed to strengthen general incentives or good utility performance can penalize or underperformance. The multi-year plan provides customers with rate predictability and reduces the administrative costs to customers caused by frequent filing with traditional rape cases to recover costs. On July 9, the Chief Public Utility Law Judge issued his proposed order in the Pepco Maryland distribution rate case. The Chief Judge recommended at $10.3 million revenue increase and in 9.6% allowed ROE, which is 10 basis points higher than Pepco Maryland's current ROE. A final order by the Maryland PSC is expected by August 13. Finally, ComEd annual formula rate update filing is expected to be decided in December of this year. More details on these rate cases can be found on Slide 20 to 23 in the appendix. Turning to Slide 11. We are continuing our robust capital deployment program at the utilities and during the second quarter we invested $1.4 billion of capital to the benefit of our customers. We expect to exceed our capital plan in $5.3 billion by $100 million this year. We have been able to take advantage of the favorable weather, so fund investments in our gas business at BG&E, plus we had some additional storm-related work. As Chris mentioned, these investments are improving our infrastructure, increasing reliability and resiliency, which results in a better customer experience. Today I'd like to talk about two projects that are part of these efforts and will bring improved operations to our customers in DC and Northern Illinois. The first project is District of Columbia Undergrounding project or DC PLUG. A DC PLUG initiative is a $500 million multi-year partnership between the District's Department of Transportation and Pepco focused on the underground placements of more vulnerable distribution power lines. Over the course of the initiative, up to 30 feeders where replaced underground with six during the first phase. The underground placement of these lines will make the electric distribution system more resilient during severe weather events, reducing the duration and frequency of electric outages. The second project featured is the expansion of ComEd Itasca Substation, this $48 million projects installed the new distribution terminal and associated equipment, including an indoor switchgear building, three medium power transformers at 12 138kV circuit breakers. The expanded substation provides capacity to power the equivalent of 45,000 homes. It will support three new data centers in the Itasca/Elk Grove technology corridor near O'Hare airport. These customers chose the Greater Chicago area after several years of discussions with ComEd's Economic Development team, part of our continuing efforts to bring additional investment in jobs in Northern Illinois. On Slide 12, we provide our gross margin updates and current hedging strategy as a generation company. Before discussing the gross margin update, I'd want to spend a minute talking about the drop in the illiquid forward power curves during the second quarter, particularly in June. Prices in PJM in 2020 and 2021 declined sharpen. Now I have around-the-clock power prices fell nearly $3 per megawatt hour or approximately $0.11 – 11% in 2020 and approximately $2.40 per megawatt hour or close to 10% in 2021. PJM West Hub prices fell more than $4 per megawatt hour and approximately 13% to 14% in 2020 and 2021 respectively. Jim can cover in more detailed during Q&A, but at a high level we think these declines reflected some combination of the following. Lower natural gas prices, a mild start to summer then weighed on crop prices, which thing cascaded out to the forward curve, which we have seen before. Some market anticipation of plants targeted for retirement looking less likely to retire and hedging activity likely including market participants selling based on changes in the economic value of revenue put options sold or written to support newbuild power plants over the last few years driving down prices. Despite the mild weather and low price environment. 2019 total gross margin is flat to our last update. During the quarter, we executed $100 million in power new business and $50 million in non-power business. We are highly hedged for the rest of the year and well-balanced on our Generation to load matching strategy. In 2020 and 2021 our total gross margin is down $100 million and $250 million respectable. Open gross margin declined $550 million and $500 million respectively primarily due to lower energy prices at PJM West Hub, New York Zone A and PJM NiHub. Mark-to-market of hedges we're up $500 million and $300 million respectively. As our hedge position mitigated, part of the impact of the price declines. We also exited $50 million of power new business in both 2020 and 2021. We continue to remain behind our ratable hedging for protecting and added less than a ratable amount of hedges across our regions during the quarter. We ended the quarter 10% to 13% behind ratable in 2020 and 7% to 10% behind in 2021 when considering gross commodity hedges. Our Generation the load matching strategy remains a competitive advantage, contributing positive margin and providing a vehicle to bring our Generation output to market in a disciplined manner. We remain comfortable with this strategy to hold open market length given the continued strength of our balance sheet. Finally, moving onto Slide 13. We remained committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet in our investment grade credit ratings. Even after June 30 pricing marks given the levers, we have available, we are confident that we will stay within our consolidated at that voted debt metrics in our disclosure window 2019 to 2022. Our consolidated corporate credit metrics remain above our targeted ranges and meaningfully above S&P thresholds. Looking at ExGen, we are well ahead of our debt to EBITDA target of 3x. For 2019, we expect to be at 2.5x debt to EBITDA and 2x on a recourse basis. With that, I will now turn the call back to Chris for his closing remarks.
Christopher Crane: Thanks Joe. Turning to Slide 14, we recognize the current power of markets are creating headwinds for us. We're prepared to meet them head on and take thorough or thoughtful action if necessary. In the meantime, we are accomplishing the things we committed to do including maintaining industry-leading operations, leading our financial commitments effectively, deploying more than $5 billion in capital across our utilities this year, and advocating for policies that support clean energy. Our strategy remains the right one and we're committed to our value proposition. We continued to grow the utilities targeting a 7.8% rate-based growth in a 6% to 8% earnings growth through 2022. We continue to use free cash flow from the Genco to fund that incremental equity needs that the utilities paydown debt and one part of the growing dividend. We will continue to optimize the value of ExGen business by seeking pair compensation or our zero-emitting Generation fleet, closing uneconomic plants like we're doing with TMI and selling assets where it makes sense to accelerating our debt reduction plans and maximizing value through the generation – through the generation to load match strategy constellation. We will sustain strong investment grade credit metrics and we will grow our dividend annually 5% through 2020. The strategy underpinning this value proposition is effective. We remain committed to optimizing the value of our businesses and earning your ongoing support of Exelon. Operator, we can now open the call up to questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon of Evercore ISI.
Gregory Gordon: Hey, good morning.
Christopher Crane: Hey, Greg.
Gregory Gordon: So one high level question and then maybe one or two in the weed’s questions. And I don't want to ask you anything that you're maybe not comfortable delving too deeply into, but I'm going to anyway. You mentioned the concept of levers that you have full in order to stay on track to generate the free cash flow and credit metric targets that you laid out for us at the beginning of the year despite the fall on the forward curves. And you talked about how you won’t run power plants that aren't cash flow positive. And look, I've covered the stock for a long time and covered the company for a long time. We've been in this situation before, and nothing is ever as good or as bad as it looks in the moment, but can you tell us should this persist? What some of those options are in a little bit more detail please?
Christopher Crane: Yes. I'll let Joe go through the list of what we've got laid out right now. We've been talking quite a bit about it, meeting on it as we watch the markets. So Joe?
Joseph Nigro: Yes. Good morning, Greg. Greg, you mentioned one of them. I think we've proven through our time with our financial discipline that we're not going to run power plants in perpetuity that are in economics. So that would be the first lever. Obviously, you've seen us continue to drive efficiencies in our business and continue to look at ways to streamline our costs and we would continue to do that and that would be across our Exelon generation business as well as at the business services company. At our disposal, I won't speculate on what at this time, but we obviously have the opportunity if necessary, to look at asset sales. We do have a small amount of growth capital in our ExGen business. We would look at that and take a hard look at that. And then there were alternative forms of financing. When you think about project financing, you know, they're saying. So I think when you look at it, this is a point in time estimate over our financials. As you said, we've seen the markets move up or down. We're comfortable, like I said; with our credit metrics through the disclosure period and we continue to allocate capital in the ways we've laid out. And if we had to, if this continued, we would look at these levers.
Gregory Gordon: Yes, I'm very cognizant that some of those plants are large nuclear units in the state of Illinois. And I'm also cognizant that you're having a dialogue with legislators and other constituencies in the state around an Omnibus energy strategy that takes into account and contemplates certain actions with regard to those plants. Can you tell us how that broad that coalition is, as we get into the veto session and whether you think that the state policymakers understand the implications of the lack of necessarily market reforms in PJM and the need to take back control of the market?
Christopher Crane: As you can imagine, we have a significant communications drive with the legislative and the administration on the situation and we are prepared to present them with the coalition. I'll let Kathleen to describe who she's working with that will balance out the needs for the state, the goals that the governor set after election to get to 100% cleaned by 2030 and be able to do that in an economic way that does not harm our customers. But you want to talk about the coalition?
Kathleen Barrón: Yes. Good morning, Greg. There are a number of stakeholders that are very focused on getting clean energy legislation enacted in Illinois. As you know, a number of states across the country have already set 100% clean energy targets. And it's not just states like California, New York, it's across the country. And so Illinois has a lot of emphasis on making sure that Illinois, which is already the cleanest state in the country, has an equally aggressive target. So on that question, we have folks in the environmental community have heavily focusing on environmental justice players. The renewable developers are very focused on addressing those flaws in the prior version of the states clean energy targets to make sure that they can achieve the goals that have been set previously. But also as I said, set a more ambitious new targets for renewable development in the state. The consumer advocate is heavily focused on this policy as well because the question of state having to pay twice for capacity has been very much in the forefront, and ensuring that if we're going to incentivize clean energy. We can count our capacity towards our obligations for PJM. And then finally the labor community, very focused on what these policies mean both for new construction and preservation of things clean energy resources. So that's the correlation we're focusing on putting the package together. There are a number of parties who will come together in the end to help – communicate the message that Chris mentioned that this is important for the state, but it's not going to be possible if we can't allow these resources to count as capacity and that's why the FRP is foundational to getting this policy done.
Gregory Gordon: Thanks. And my final question was actually, a numbers question on the update on the mark-to-market, Joe. There was $50 million decline and how our new business to go. Is that because that moved into hedges because you executed sales or are you assuming either lower volumes or lower margins in the out years significantly retail business?
James McHugh: Hi Greg. Yes. This is Jim McHugh. That is just executed. That's executed business that now has moved into the mark-to-market of hedges. So when you net that all together, that numbers – those two lines would be flat from last quarter, it's just executed now.
Gregory Gordon: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Steven Fleishman: Yes, thanks. I got -ups to both the Greg's question. So first of all, just I know in the past when prices have fallen a lot and certain times you've talked about actually how much money losing plants there are and potential offsets. Can you give any flavor on that on just, hey, if prices stay this low, if we shut certain plants or generally shut plants, what the potential offset could be?
Christopher Crane: If you're asking in market prices, we don't calculate the effect of uneconomic plants being shut down on the effect of the market. If you're asking about the effect of removing the negative free cash flow, we haven't got those numbers to be published right now. It's something that we're looking at, but we're trying to evaluate, unit by unit and then in aggregate, as we've said publicly right now, you can see a challenge in the future if this market persists between the capacity and the energy market that Dresden, Byron, and Braidwood are financially challenged. Now do you think we've got a clear path that that with good coalition to support, fixing that at some of it at the state level and we still are working very hard with PJM for FERC to continue on base-load scarcity in the capacity market reforms that should correct, and make a fair market. So, but short of those things happening, those three sites, you can look into the future and see the challenges that they have.
Steven Fleishman: Okay. And then I guess that the point there is if we're just using current forwards and taking it down that we're including basically losses on plants that you would not just sit and take forever.
Christopher Crane: Right.
Joseph Nigro: Correct.
Christopher Crane: That's right.
Steven Fleishman: Okay.
Joseph Nigro: Either we have a clear path to securing them or the units will be shut down. We will not damage the balance sheet, sitting around for years with negative free cash flow or negative earnings.
Steven Fleishman: Okay. And then just specific question to the Illinois coalition, can you just give any color if possible that since this news from a few weeks ago came out about the subpoena. Has there been any – have these talks or continued and is there any kind of public process we'll be able to see kind of those talks? Or is it just going to kind of be suddenly in legislative proposal?
Joseph Nigro: Steve, [indiscernible] the activity that has started and continued for a number of months on advancing the clean energy legislation among the coalition that was referenced by Kathleen and by Chris remains unchanged. We're meeting regularly, we're doing the stakeholder outreach, we're trying to craft a package and educate members of the legislature. And dependency of the grand jury and subpoenas had no impact on the level of activity or the intensity of the activity in that regard.
Steven Fleishman: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Turner of JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Christopher Turner: Good morning. I was wondering if you could just help us with some background of your franchise agreement in Chicago, kind of when that expires, the terms of renewal, et cetera and kind of how you're thinking about that right now.
Ann Berzin: Well, I'll start. Hi, this is Ann. And Joe to make guesses here as well. But basically the expiration date is the end December of 2020. The city needs to give us an indication by the end of the year as to whether they want to maintain status quote renegotiate or terminate the franchise agreement. So we'll know by the end of the year, but we're in discussions with them, we started to have discussions around that. We understand what their priorities are and there, I think priorities are very much aligned with ours. They want to see more clean energy in the city of Chicago. They are concerned about vulnerable populations, in particular in terms of pricing. And those are all – those are both, strong strategic elements of our focus going forward at all our utilities. But that's the status right now.
Joseph Nigro: Yes. And just to supplement what Ann said, we've been in the process of these negotiations for some time. We've exchange terms and have detail discussions about, how the agreement would be structured going forward. We had a slowdown in those negotiations during the transition to the new mayor. But those negotiations have resumed in full at this point.
Christopher Turner: Okay. And right now that is your set of assets and you would need to be compensated if anything changed there.
Joseph Nigro: Yes, that's correct. But again, the focus here is I'm getting the franchise agreement done. Our expectation is it will be fully negotiated and Dan will address the issues that Ann talked about, to the extent municipalization is what that will come with a very hefty price tag as you know, and I don't think realistically that's a path we're going to go down.
Christopher Turner: Okay. And then I guess just more modeling here for the balance of 2019, you put out the third quarter guidance there, which was I think a little bit less than we had expected. How are you thinking about the fourth quarter right now and what I guess might look like O&M headwind at least in the back half overall?
Joseph Nigro: You heard me say in my – it’s Joe, good morning, you heard me say in my prepared remarks that we reaffirmed our guidance, range of $3 to $3.30. That's inclusive of the earnings guidance. We gave you obviously for the third quarter and we're comfortable with those numbers.
Christopher Turner: Okay. Anything to think about that might be kind of one-time or non-recurring in nature for the third or fourth quarter that could help you year-over-year?
Joseph Nigro: Hi. I mean you saw some of the drivers in the second quarter when we talked about the lower load volumes that constellation driven by the unfavorable weather and we continued to as Jim sits were talked about. We continue to execute our new business at constellation and we continue to manage the utility business accordingly and we're comfortable with full-year guidance.
Christopher Turner: Okay, great. Thanks Joe.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Michael Weinstein: Hi, guys. I just one quick follow-up on the guidance. The guidance for $4.2 billion of cash flow Generation from ExGen over the next four years? What does that assume in terms of uneconomic plants and might be operating or I guess retirement is going to go where to those types of plants? What's built into that $4.2 billion number?
Joseph Nigro: Good morning, Michael. It's Joe. As Chris mentioned when you just said, inclusive when you look at the three plants in Illinois that he mentioned, Byron, Braidwood and Dresden, those plants are running in those cash flow forecast. And then to the extent, these power prices continue there's obviously challenges financially with those. And as I said in my remarks, we won't continue to run those plants in perpetuity on economically. Having said that, we haven't provided the numbers specifically, but we will. We put out a forecast on our fourth quarter call for $7.8 billion of free cash flow from 2019 to 2022 coming off generation that we're still working with that number.
Michael Weinstein: So I mean would it be accurate to say that there's upside either way at this point with the forward curves where they are?
Christopher Crane: We’ll give you an update at our fourth quarter call and you're getting like one side of the story here obviously, because in the numbers we provide, we're showing you the mark-to-market. You see our gross margin disclosures and they change quarter-over-quarter this quarter driven by the price drops we saw in the second quarter. I also discussed their other levers at our disposal. Those are reflected in our disclosures, but you can go back to what we've modeled on the fourth quarter call and that's what we've disclosed at this point.
Michael Weinstein: Okay, great. Thanks.
Operator: Your last question comes from the line of Praful Mehta of Citigroup. Your line is open.
Praful Mehta: Thanks so much. Hi guys. So maybe just following up a little bit on the power markets, it was very helpful to get the levers that you've talked about. But just to understand from a PJM perspective, do you see more happening on the market side as in other players shutting down other plants or other form of rationalization like you also talked about regulation. Where do you see PJM going? Because if it stays this way, clearly, it's unsustainable. So wanted to understand how you thought the market would play out?
James McHugh: Yes. Praful, this is Jim McHugh. I'll start. I think from a market's perspective, first of all, the one thing, I want to highlight to Joe's point about this as a point in time. We've already seen the Nighthawk market move up $1 on the forward curve since the end of the quarter and the West Hub markets moved up about $0.75 since the June 30 pricing. So we've seen a pickup in prices so far. I think when it comes to what we're working on; we've talked over the last several quarters on the market reform side. Fast start pricing is willing to be enacted. There is some work being done on reserves and scarcity pricing and the ORDC curve in PJM. And then in the long run it's a little bit lower priority right now for PJM, but the focus on the baseload price formation and Entergy relaxation. Those are some of the things. I think we have new build and retirements both happening over the next four or five years as natural course of business and our fundamental analysis. So there will be a little bit of that, but I think, by and large the reforms are around price formation and then in the long run, if we're able to come up with a market solution to have carbon pricing in the market would be another thing in the long run. That would be something we would all continue working on. The one thing that's interesting to me about where we've seen these prices in that $22 area, which you look at Cal 21, Cal 22, Cal 23, that's trading down where the quarter two just cleared. Quarter two Nile just cleared $22.25 with very, very mild weather. So the entire curve is trading where a very mild quarter just traded. It's an interesting note to me and I think it gives us some insight into why we think those prices on the forward curve have already responded slightly higher in the last couple of weeks.
Praful Mehta: That's super helpful color. And maybe just one follow-up more strategic. If you do see these profiles, does that mean that you think more retail would be helpful to the business? Do you look to expand on the retail side or maybe acquire more retail businesses? Is that something that you think would work?
James McHugh: Yes. So I think from a retail perspective, our customer facing businesses are doing pretty well. The margins are hanging in, our win rates are strong and we're holding our market share, our retail customer facing business and our wholesale load auctions and wholesale origination businesses have performed well. I think as far as acquisitions and expanding it, we've talked for a while now about having grown really what is the best in class platform. So we will love to acquire books of business, if there is value proposition there that we can absorb it into our best in class platform and just take a retail book of business. We'll look for those opportunities and we certainly would take a hard look at them.
Praful Mehta: All right. Really helpful. Thank you, guys.
Operator: I would like to turn the call over back to speaker Chris Crane. Please go ahead, sir.
Christopher Crane: Thank you all for participating in the call today. We remain on track to meet our commitments to our customers, communities, and shareholders. With that, we'll close up the call.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now all disconnect.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-05-02 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. My name is Lindsey and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the 2019 Q1 Exelon Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Dan Eggers, Senior Vice President, Corporate Finance, you may begin your conference.
Dan Eggers: Thank you, Lindsey. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining our first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Leading the call today are: Chris Crane, Exelon's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Joe Nigro, Exelon's Chief Financial Officer. They're joined by other members of Exelon's Senior Management team who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks.  We issued our earnings release this morning along with the presentation, both of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of Exelon's website. The earnings release and other matters, which we discuss during today's call, contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today's material and comments made during this call. Please refer today's 8-K and Exelon's other SEC filings for discussions of risk factors and factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts and expectations. Today's presentation also includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for reconciliations between the non-GAAP measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures. I'll now turn the call over to Chris Crane, Exelon's CEO.
Chris Crane: Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. During the quarter, we achieved success on several key fronts and reached a couple of milestones. First, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the ZEC cases clearing the last legal challenge at the federal level for the Illinois and New York programs. The decision affirms that states have the right to protect their citizens by favoring clean energy and it is a win for the consumers, policymakers and the regulators. Second, we received credit upgrades from both S&P and Fitch. These upgrades recognizes successful execution on our utility-driven growth strategy and reduction in business risk while maintaining strong financial metrics. Third, we reached settlements in New Jersey, on the ACE rate case and the infrastructure investment program. These outcomes reflect the continued positive evolution of our partnership with regulators built on improvement and reliability and customer satisfaction. Finally, turning to slide 5, in March, we celebrated the seventh anniversary of the Constellation merger and the third anniversary of the PHI merger. Each merger has positively contributed to our strategy of increasing our regulated business mix and providing more stable earnings. Before these mergers, Exelon earned a mix of 28% utilities, 72% generation. In 2021, we project that mix will have flopped with nearly 70% earnings coming from the utilities. Through the Constellation merger, we grew our regulated earnings with the addition of BGE and also benefit from the combination of Exelon and Constellation's competitive business creating an industry leader integrated business that supports sufficiently hedging of plans while capturing incremental margins and cash flows. The PHI merger further advanced our strategy to become more regulated, while creating value for customers and communities we serve. We are meeting or exceeding all of our reliability merger commitments and customer across the PHI service territory and experiencing record reliability. The frequency and duration of outages have improved at each utility. Customers are out of power less frequency – with less frequency and are restored the service much faster when out of power. In 2018, Delmarva customers had lowest frequency of outages. At Pepco, customers saw the fastest restoration time. And customer satisfaction is at all-time high at ACE, Delmarva and Pepco. We're also delivering on our promise to be a true partner with the communities we serve. The PHI utilities have contributed more than $470 million in total economic impact since the merger closed. In 2018 alone, these utilities spent $313 million with minority and women owned suppliers, which is between 22% and 29% of each utility's total procurement spend. Each utility has made investments in workforce development programs, including partnering with the District of Columbia to create the DC Infrastructure Academy. We are also an important community partner for hundreds of organizations in the PHI service territory, contributing more than $15 million in financial support and volunteering approximately 85,000 hours since the merger was approved. Because of the improved service and enhanced partnership with our communities, we are building trust in our jurisdictions and are seeing a more positive regulatory environment develop. Since the merger, we have reached constructive settlements in each of the PHI jurisdictions including Pepco, Maryland and DC, and we've had our first settlements since 1980s. Exelon has delivered on the promises we made to our customers and the communities and the shareholders when we merged with PHI in 2016. Turning to our financial results, on slide 6, we had a strong quarter. On a GAAP basis, we earned $0.93 per share versus $0.60 per share last year. On a non-GAAP operating basis, we earned $0.87 per share versus $0.96 per share last year. Joe will cover the drivers in his remarks. Turning to slide 7, at the utilities, we continue to execute the top quartile levels across key customer satisfaction and operating metrics. The investments we are making are resulting in improved reliability, which is strengthening our relationship with our customers and the regulators. We remain focused on helping our customers and communities become more energy efficient, saving energy and money. We have been doing this for years, and I'm happy to say once again the EPA named all five of our eligible companies, BGE, ComEd, Delmarva, PECO, and Pepco as 2018 ENERGY STAR partners of the year. Generation performed well during the quarter. Nuclear produced 39.2 terawatt-hours of zero emission electricity with a capacity factor of 97.1%, the best quarter performance in more than 10 years. During the polar vortex where the temperatures were significantly below zero, our fleet ran at full power keeping families in our markets safe and warm. Exelon power and gas and hydro dispatch match of 97.8% and wind and solar capture of 96.5% exceeding plan. Moving on to slide 8, since the beginning of the year, there has been a number of important developments. U.S. Supreme Court upheld the clean energy programs. Illinois is looking to advance its clean energy goals. Pennsylvania is considering adding nuclear to its alternative energy standard. New Jersey awarded zero emission credits. PJM has made scarcity filing in March with the request approval date by mid-December, and first act on fast-start energy pricing reforms. These actions recognize the importance of preserving existing resources of carbon-free energy, addressing the -- and addressing the underlying deficiencies in the market. In Illinois, legislation was introduced that would require the Illinois Power Authority to procure clean capacity for ComEd customers using that fixed resource requirement mechanism that is currently in the PJM tariff. In addition, to supporting a course of truly clean energy future in Illinois, the legislation will also ensure that consumers pay less than they do today. The concept of the FRR has a wide support and has been endorsed by the Illinois CUB, the Clean Jobs Coalition and organized labor. Another piece of legislation has been introduced into Illinois to extend the formula rate. ComEd's formula rate provides tangible benefits to the consumers as well as certainty we need to make investments and improve reliability and resiliency in customer service, while keeping the bills affordable. In the nine years that ComEd has filed the formula rate, we have asked for rate decreases four times. It's a busy legislative season as Governor Pritzker and the General Assembly tackle Illinois' significant budget problems. However, we are optimistic these two priorities can get done this year. In Pennsylvania, bipartisan group in the House and Senate introduced legislation that would treat nuclear equal to other non-emitting resources by adding it to the ultimate energy portfolio standard. Several hearings have been held in the House and Senate on the bill, but it's not clear the action will be taken in time to reverse our decision to retire TMI. We also achieved two important milestones for our existing ZEC programs in April. First, as mentioned, the US Supreme Court declined to hear the challenges, the New York and Illinois ZEC programs, consistent with the resounding decision we received from the district and the circuit courts. Second, the New Jersey BPU awarded ZECs to all three New Jersey – units in New Jersey allowing them to continue to provide zero-carbon energy to the state. We are pleased to see the states moving forward with thoughtful energy policy that preserves the rights to chart a clean energy future. Finally, turning to FERC and PJM, we are pleased FERC acting on the fast-start reforms that expand the price setting eligibility for block loaded resources. FERC has requested that PJM submit a compliance filing by July 31st and we expect the reforms to be implemented shortly after that. In addition, PJM filed, they a 206 petition to improve the pricing of reserves, which we have previously referred to as scarcity or ORDC reforms. These reforms along with base load price formation are essential to preserve an effective competitive market in PJM, and we're happy to see the programs being made to address these clear needs. Turning to slide 9. Much of the policy work, we've engaged in including preserving zero-carbon generation, we have viewed as necessary to bridge a comprehensive carbon policy, in the past time, not just for the government, but for every business, most particularly energy businesses along with their customers and stakeholders to take action on reducing carbon emissions. For several decades, Exelon has been positioning itself for a carbon-constrained world and acting as a leader advocating for carbon policy at the state and federal level. We have built the cleanest power generation company in the country, we have divested or retired all of our coal generation and invested in renewables and increasing our output of our nuclear fuel. As a result, Exelon has produced more clean energy than any other company in the United States by a factor of two, and out of nine—every nine clean megawatts in the U.S. comes from an Exelon plant. We've avoided 67.8 million metric tons of greenhouse gas, the equivalent of making or taking 14.5 million cars off the road through two previous carbon reduction goals, and we are on track to meet the most recent goal of 15% additional reduction of emissions from internal operations. We're a leading voice in supporting policies and regulations that require reduced emissions and encourage technology changes, and across our businesses, we working to enable clean energy solutions for our customers and communities. In 2018 alone, our energy efficiency program saved customers 21.9 million megawatt-hours of electricity avoiding 9.9 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emission. We're investing in electric transportation and charging infrastructure at both utilities and Constellation. Exelon is also involved in grid scale energy storage development to enable faster and greater reliability for the use of renewables. One example of this is through our efforts to launch the Volta Energy, which works with the national labs and research universities to commercialize new technologies. The world is changing in terms of awareness of the scope of climate change and the need for new potential solutions. Our customers, our cities and our communities, as well as our employees are demanding clean power. So that is what we intend to provide. We still have a long way to go, but the engagements that we're seeing at the state level affirms our view that these policies will be part of our country's future. With that, now I'll turn it over to Joe to continue the call.
Joe Nigro: Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover our first quarter results and quarterly financial updates including trailing 12 months ROEs at the utilities and our hedge disclosures. Starting with slide number 10, we had a strong quarter financially. We earned $0.93 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.87 per share on a non-GAAP basis, which is at the upper end of our guidance range of $0.80 to $0.90 per share. Our performance in the quarter was consistent with our expectations, including a positive $0.01 of net benefit around timing of expenses. Exelon utilities delivered a combined $0.56 per share, net of holding company expenditures. Utility earnings were modestly lower than our plan due to O&M timing at ComEd and PECO, which will reverse itself over the course of the year. Exelon Generation earned $0.30 per share, outperforming plan. This was a result of some realized gains in our nuclear decommissioning trust fund and favorable timing of O&M. We are reaffirming our full year guidance of $3 to $3.30 per share. For the second quarter, we are providing adjusted operating earnings guidance of $0.55 per share to $0.65 per share. On slide 11, we show our quarter-over-quarter walk. The $0.87 per share in the first quarter this year was $0.09 per share lower than the first quarter of 2018. Exelon Utilities less HoldCo earnings were up $0.10 per share compared with last year. This earnings growth is driven primarily by higher rate base, new rates associated with completed rate -- and lower storm costs at PECO and PG&E relative to the first quarter of 2018. Generation earnings were down $0.19 per share compared with last year. The biggest driver was the absence of $0.10 per share of ZEC catch-up payment from 2017 due to the timing of the final Illinois ZEC approvals. Generation was also impacted by lower realized power prices. Moving on to slide 12. As Chris mentioned, we celebrated the third anniversary of the merger with PHI in March. We have seen tremendous improvement in PHI's operational performance, customer satisfaction, and relationships with our communities and regulators, which is leading to more constructive outcome. Given our progress on the commitment of our 9% to 10% ROEs across our utilities and the quarterly variability at the individual PHI utilities, depending on rate case timing, we are now consolidating the PHI utilities trailing 12-month ROEs. We have also changed the format of the slide to show the relative size of the aggregate PHI utilities when compared to legacy Exelon utilities and the consolidated Exelon utilities. In total, the PHI utilities represent approximately 26% of our total rate base of $41.2 billion. On a consolidated basis, the PHI utilities earned a 9.3% ROE for the trailing 12-months. This is a 90-basis point improvement over consolidated 8.4% from the fourth quarter of 2018. The improvement is due to 2018 distribution rate case settlement at both Delmarva and Pepco, favorable transmission revenue from the higher peak load in true-ups, the roll-off of higher storm costs, and favorable O&M timing at Delmarva and Pepco, which will reverse over the course of the year. At the legacy Exelon utilities, our earned ROEs are modestly better, largely driven by the roll-off of the March 2018 winter storm costs as well as new rates associated with completed rate cases at PECO and PG&E. Including PHI, the combined Exelon utilities have a 10.2% earned ROE, which is above our 9% to 10% earned ROE target and 50 basis points higher than last quarter. We remain focused on meeting our utility earnings growth target by maintaining the earned ROEs at PHI and sustaining strong performance at our other utilities. Turning to slide 13. Since the last call, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities approved the Atlantic City Electric settlement agreement, which provides for a $70 million revenue increase. The new rates went into effect on April 1st. In addition, the BPU approved recovery of $96 million of capital over a four-year period through the infrastructure investment program to improve reliability. On April 8th, ComEd filed its annual distribution formula rate update with the Illinois Commerce Commission seeking a $6.4 million decrease to base rate, representing the fourth requested rate reduction, under the formula rate design. We expect to receive an order in the fourth quarter. Pepco Maryland filed its latest rate case in January, requesting a $30 million revenue increase, which has been updated to $27.2 million with the test year updated to actuals. The request is based on the continued infrastructure investments to enhance reliability in customer service. We expect to receive an order in the third quarter of this year. More details on the rate cases can be found on slides 21 through 24 in the appendix. Turning to slide 14, during the first quarter, we invested $1.2 billion of capital across the utilities and are on track to meet our $5.3 billion commitment for 2019. These investments will improve the reliability and resiliency of the grid to the benefit of our customers. This quarter, I would like to highlight two projects. The first is the modernization of Pepco's Harrison substation in Washington D.C. This $190 million project will renovate aging infrastructure to more reliably serve important loads including two metro stations. It also expands regional transmission capacity supporting future load growth. The other project is the second phase of BG&E's large gas line replacement program in Baltimore that will be recovered through STRIDE capital recovery mechanism. The second phase includes $732 million of investment and we will replace approximately 240 miles of gas lines by the end of 2023. Replacing these lines will improve the safety and reliability of the distribution system. During the first phase of the program, BG&E replaced 208 miles of gas lines. Since the program started in 2014, STRIDE has created 600 full-time jobs in BGE service territory. On Slide 15, we provide our gross margin update and current hedging strategy for the generation company. As a reminder, our disclosure previously reflected planned retirement of TMI and include New Jersey's ZEC revenues. Since last quarter, total gross margin has flattened every year. In 2019, open gross margin decreased by $150 million, primarily due to lower prices at West Hub, New York Zone A, and NiHub. During the quarter, we executed $150 million in power new business. In 2020 and 2021 respectively, open gross margin is up $50 million relative to our prior disclosure, primarily on the back of higher power prices at NiHub and New York Zone A which was partially offset by lower ERCOT spark spread. Mark-to-market of hedges were down $50 million due to our hedge position offsetting the increasing gross margin and we executed $50 million of power new business in both years. Our generation to load matching strategy continues to yield positive results. We ended the quarter 8% to 11% behind ratable in 2020 and 1% to 4% behind ratable in 2021, when considering cross commodity hedges. Our open position is primarily concentrated in the Midwest and Texas. Given the strength of our balance sheet, we are comfortable with our strategy to hold if the market want. Moving on to slide 16, we remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and our investment grade credit ratings. As Chris mentioned, our working has been rewarded with credit upgrades at S&P and Fitch in the first quarter. S&P upgraded Exelon's issuer credit rating from -- to BBB plus from BBB. In addition, all subsidiaries were raised one notch. According to S&P, the rating upgrades reflect the successful execution of our business strategy, which has reduced business risk while maintaining strong financial metrics. Fitch also upgraded Exelon to BBB plus based on similar reasoning. Looking at ExGen, we are well ahead of our debt to EBITDA target of three times. For 2019, we expect to be at 2.4 times debt to EBITDA and 1.9 times debt to EBITDA on a recourse basis. With that, I will now turn the call back to Chris for his closing marks.
Chris Crane: Thanks Joe. Turning to slide 17, we remain committed to our strategy and are pleased that our consistent execution is being recognized by the rating agencies and others. I'll close on Exelon's value proposition. We continue to grow our utilities targeting 7.8% rate base growth and between a 6% to 8% earnings growth through 2022. We continue to use free cash from the GenCo to fund incremental equity needs at the utilities, pay down debt, and fund part of our growing dividend. We will continue to optimize the value of our ExGen business by seeking fair compensation for our zero-emitting generation fleet, selling assets where it makes sense to accelerate debt reduction plans and maximizing value through the generation to load matching strategy of Constellation. We will sustain strong investment grade credit metrics and grow our dividend annually at 5% through 2020. The strategy underpinning this value proposition is effective and providing tangible benefits to our stakeholders. We remain committed to optimizing the value of our business and earn -- earnings your ongoing support for Exelon. Operator, we can now turn it over for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.
Greg Gordon: Thanks, good morning.
Chris Crane: Good morning, Greg.
Greg Gordon: Two questions. First, can you just give us a little more detail on the status of the bills that relate to energy policy in Illinois? What processes for moving them to vote? And I think you know you intimated that given the pressures on the legislature with regard to other Illinois issues that there might be a chance that this slips from the regular session for the veto session. So, could you just talk through all those issues, please?
Chris Crane: Sure. And as you pointed out, there is a lot of activity in the session right now, as the Governor prioritizes all of this his issues, a lot of it's focused on the budget and revenue sources. Those bills are moving and being debated as we discussed. He also has a priority on achieving zero-carbon generation fleet by the 2020-2030 time frame -- to 2030 time frame. So there are numerous energy-related bills to get to that point. Our bill for the FRR, and there's one that's path to 100 and then there's one that's the Clean Jobs Coalition. So we're in the process right now of negotiating with all the bills, so we can come together and provide the legislature with coalition that agrees on many things right now just working through the details. We hope to be done. Meetings are constant. I've met with the leadership of both House and Senate, talking about what we need to do and them showing their support for us going forward. And so we're just going to keep working on it as we always do. If it's not done in the regular session because of the other priorities, we will have it positioned to move through during the veto session, that's the generation bill. The other bill in Illinois that will affect Exelon is the extension of the ComEd formula rate for 10 years, that bill is proceeding. We've been able to work with stakeholders to gain support and recognition as I mentioned, out of the nine past filings that we made with the formula rate; we've had four rate reductions. So it's very balanced for the consumer, it's very balanced for our investment strategy and we are able to do so in a predictable way to serve our customers. So that's Illinois. Pennsylvania
Greg Gordon: Thank you. Sorry, you might as well cover Pennsylvania too, I interrupted you. I apologize.
Chris Crane: I believe that was coming, so I was going to do it. So, Pennsylvania, as you know, we've been working with the other nuclear operators there to create an alliance to continue and allow those assets to compete in with the other non-emitting assets. The bill continues to garner support and we'll continue to work through that. As we've told folks, we need clarity on this by the end of May or we're going to have to make the final steps and shutdown. We won't be able to adequately procure -- design procure and manufacture fuel for continued operations without that certainty and would not want to make that investment without that. So we'll continue working on it and as you can see the Governor has shown recognition that he wants to have a low-carbon future for the state and all recognize that that cannot be done with the current technology without including the existing nuclear assets. So we'll work on that one and combine with the Illinois effort.
Greg Gordon: Thanks. And one other real quick one for Joe, just looking at slide 19, It looks like the free cash flow profile mainly at the utility portfolio is lower than you projected, lower now for the year than you projected at year-end by $300 million or so. What's the cause of that because you didn't look -- it doesn't look like you've changed your overall guidance for the long-term cash flow profile of the company? 
Joe Nigro: Yeah, Greg, you're correct, the variance versus our Q4 disclosure is $300 million lower. It's being driven by increased working capital to utilities and we're funding that with commercial paper. I think it's important to note though from a GenCo perspective, on a cash flow profile basis, we're still well -- we're in line with the forecast that we've provided you on the fourth quarter call, I mean I think that's an important element.
Greg Gordon: Okay. Is that working capital increase a permanent structural issue? Or is that related to things like storms or other things that might flip in future years?
Joe Nigro: Yeah, it’s the latter. It's more than just the ongoing business itself. And we had some favorable weather points in the quarter and we took advantage of that from a work basis perspective.
Greg Gordon: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning, everyone. 
Chris Crane: Good morning.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: So just to follow-up a little bit on Greg's question, can you elaborate a little bit on the scenarios around capacity auction participation, particularly if it happens in August, and I'm thinking that given your commentary in the prepared remarks around the timing of Illinois legislation that it'd be difficult to implement any full FRR or anything else coming out of this Illinois legislation in time for the next upcoming capacity auctions. So I suppose there's a litany of scenarios. How do you think about them, particularly if FERC does indeed act around something else, say a partial FRR, for instance?
Chris Crane: So, we've put our input into FERC that we believe it's very inefficient to execute an auction when -- with the previous FERC ruling that for PJM to execute an auction in the August time frame with the previous FERC ruling, we actually need to get guidance from FERC on what the construct should be. So we think it should be an April time frame, but FERC feels -- the PJM feels like they are compelled to run forward and hopefully we'll hear something from FERC to clarify PJM's letter requesting clarification. The most likely scenario for an FRR in Illinois would be the 2023 auction time frame from everything we're looking at. We need to get the legislation passed. We need to have the IPA who we've been working with the Illinois Power Authority be able to build the construct and be able to run it. That estimate is aggressive on our side, but probably about eight months our folks have been in communications with the IP agency how reasonable that is, and so we'll continue to work down that path, but to run an auction is going to be potentially rejected without clarification, does not seem like the most efficient use of all of our resources at this time.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Maybe even if it is delayed into 2020, and that is for the 2022 auction, how do you think about the choices before you?
Chris Crane: Kathleen, you want to cover it more?
Kathleen Barrón: Sure. Hey Julien, it's Kathleen. As Chris said, we do know that the FRR bill once enacted will take a period of time to implement. The IPA has to write the rules, the ICC has to approve them, then the IPA has to conduct a procurement. And so if the auction is not delayed, there clearly is not enough time for that to occur before the auction if it happens in August. If it happens next April then the bill is enacted this spring, there would be enough time for it to be implemented by, let's say, the auctions delayed to next April. And then the big wildcard is, what if the -- we don't know what FERC is going to do and we don't know when the -- exactly when the coalition, that Chris mentioned, together with the other clean energy package -- packages will come together in Springfield. So we can't really speculate on what would happen, because we have a couple of variables that are just unknown at this time.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: All right. Fair enough. And then just to follow up on the business risk improvement in the credits out of the equation. Can you comment a little bit more about where you see that going over time, in terms of added latitude from absolute perspective and just where you would like to see the credit rating over time? Just perhaps following on some of the recent improvements?
Joe Nigro: Yes, Julien, first of all, we're happy with the upgrades by both S&P and Fitch, and we continue to work to stabilize the earnings and the cash flows of the company. We talk about how we're transitioning the earnings and the cash being driven from the much more regulated outcome, and we're really focused on that and we'll continue to manage accordingly and continue to take -- work closely with the rating agencies.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Okay, great. Thank you all very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.
Steve Fleishman: Yes. Hi. Good morning.
Chris Crane: Good morning.
Steve Fleishman: So just, I guess, on Pennsylvania, if -- obviously, something needs to get done there by the end of May to save Three Mile Island, but if it doesn't get done by then, does that -- I mean could something come back later on for the other plants? Or is it -- how should we just think about that?
Chris Crane: We don't plan on stopping and the coalition doesn't plan on stopping, if the TMI deadline has passed. There are other critical assets in the state that need to be recognized for the governors low carbon future. And so we'll continue to work as hard as we are right now, after the end of May, for the other reactors in the state. So you've got eight other reactors that are very critical that are highly reliable, but their environmental benefits cannot be replaced with technologies available today without any significant cost. So we'll continue to work on it and we believe that we'll end up successful at the end.
Steve Fleishman: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Stephen Byrd: Hi. Good morning.
Chris Crane: Good morning.
Stephen Byrd: I wanted to just drill into the Illinois Clean Energy Progress Act a little further. I'm thinking through the procurement process, and I've read through the legislation but I'm trying to understand the procurement process in terms of the clean bundled capacity. Is it possible to talk a little bit more about the generation that would be eligible? The mix of energy that would be procured? I'm thinking about zero carbon versus renewable, just to make sure I understand the nature of the clean bundled capacity that's going to be procured under this legislation, if it passes?
Chris Crane: Kathleen, you want to go through that?
Kathleen Barrón: Yes. Thank you, Stephen. The way that we have envisioned this is that the State would be able to conduct a clean energy procurement, as you said, and then any zero carbon resources will be allowed to complete to provide that capacity. And as you know, the bill is not specific about the exact timetable or there -- or other details that we believe are important, including how prices will be overseen by the IPA. And the reason for that is that the reason the Future Energy Jobs Act was so successful is, it brought together a number of parties together towards a common future and what's exciting about this is that FRR concept is integral to all the other clean energy bills that are being considered right now, because everyone appreciates that, is that exact authority, letting that IPA conduct a clean energy capacity procurement and then having the ability to set its core towards the zero carbon future will give it more flexibility than it has under current market rules, where every asset gets the same capacity payment, whether it's emitting or non-emitting. So we have left some room to have that discussion among other stakeholders to make sure that we have the right group who are supporting it and, as Chris said at the top of the call between the Clean Jobs Coalition including this in their bill, the consumer advocates see the tremendous benefit associated with this, we think that's a winning combination.
Stephen Byrd: That's extremely helpful. Just as a follow-up there. In terms of the state's overall energy mix in terms of clean energy versus fossil, I know there is an objective to move towards clean energy over time, what would that energy mix broadly look like over time, how should we think about that evolution in the state?
Chris Crane: So you're starting off right now with 60% of the generation statewide being zero-carbon emitting, 90% of that statewide is nuclear. The concept that Kathleen talked about is we would, in the ComEd zone, currently we can account for 100% carbon-free, but we would have a transition period where you would have the carbon-free assets bidding in at a greater percentage each year or being taken as a greater percentage each year as you build into 2030 when the procurement would become a 100% carbon-free. And those details, the finite details there will have to be worked out, but that's the concept.
Stephen Byrd: That's super helpful and that's all I had. Thank you.
Chris Crane: Sure.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Jonathan Arnold: Good morning, guys.
Chris Crane: Hey.
Jonathan Arnold: Could I just -- just coming back to Illinois and the discussion about timing, if I understand you correctly, the ability to implement the FRR for the next auction, should the next auction happen in April, that would only be the case, if it passes in the spring. Am I right about that?
Chris Crane: Yes.
Jonathan Arnold: Okay. And so to that, I mean, Chris, what exactly are you saying about the spring session. Are you -- you said you are optimistic in your prepared remarks about this year, and I just wasn't clear in the previous answer if you're saying you think we're more likely in the veto session, or do you think you're still kind of in play for the spring depending on how things go?
Chris Crane: We are working with the coalitions as hard as we can to have something presentable to the legislature supports to move in the spring. But what I've cautioned in our road shows and on the calls previously, there is a very aggressive legislative agenda in Illinois this spring, they are talking about a graduated tax legislation that is needed to pass for constitutional amendment under 2020 election, the work on legalization of recreational marijuana, the work on the gambling and the sporting issues to continue to increase revenue. Those are the top three priorities. We come after that. We need to be ready to be able to tell our story, communicate and have that coalition that we're building endorsing where we're heading. But we need to be realistic. We do think if it doesn't happen in the spring, we'll be ready to move it in the -- a veto session in the fall.
Jonathan Arnold: Okay, great. So you're not saying it's impossible. You're just making us aware of the priorities and the pullback on the fall.
Chris Crane: Right.
Jonathan Arnold: Okay. And then just one other thing I wanted to ask on the slide 10, you call out the NDT realized gains was one of the driver in ExGen versus guidance, but it doesn't show up as a factor in the waterfall. So could you -- any chance you guys could quantify that piece and sort of explain that discrepancy there?
Joe Nigro: Yes. The waterfall you're looking at a year-over-year change and the NDT gains in the each of the years was roughly the same.
Jonathan Arnold: Okay.
Joe Nigro: So there would be no delta on the waterfall.
Jonathan Arnold: Got it. Roughly how much, Joe, if you are willing to share?
Joe Nigro: $0.02 -- its $0.02 a share.
Jonathan Arnold: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: That is all the time we have for questions today. I will now turn the call over to Chris Crane, President and CEO of Exelon, for closing comments.
Chris Crane: Thank you all for participating in call today. I think we're off to a very good start for the year. And so with that, we'll close the call out and thanks again.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2018 Q4  (2019-02-08 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. My name is Carol and I will be your operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the 2018 Fourth Quarter Exelon Earnings Call. All lines have been place on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, we will have a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like turn the call over to Mr. Dan Eggers, Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance for Exelon. 
Daniel Eggers: Thank you, Carol. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Leading the call today are Chris Crane, Exelon's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Joe Nigro, Exelon's Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by other members of Exelon's senior management team who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. We issued our earnings release this morning along with the presentation, both of which can be found in the Investor Relations section on Exelon's website. The earnings release and other materials which we discuss during today's call contains forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today's material and comments made during this call. Please refer to today's 8-K and Exelon's other SEC filings for discussions of risk factors and factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts and expectations. Today's presentation also includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the information contained in the Appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for reconciliations between the non-GAAP measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures.  I will now turn the call over to Chris Crane, Exelon's CEO.
Chris Crane: Thank you, Dan, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us for our yearend 2018 call. Before I begin, I would like to take a moment to thank our employees in those of other utilities who worked during the extremely cold weather to keep our communities safe and warm during the recent Polar Vortex. Our nuclear plants ran at nearly 100% during the week.  The investment reliability made on our system made a difference and we had more than 500 crews out restoring service to customers in temperatures that reached a negative 23 degrees without including the wind show factor.  I’ll start on Slide 5. 2018 was a great year for Exelon and its operating companies. We executed on our strategy and delivered on our commitments to customers, communities and shareholders. We are in a solid position to continue to bring value to our stakeholders in 2019.  Our financial performance was strong. Full year GAAP earnings were $2.07 per share and adjusted operating earnings were $3.12 per share, well ahead of the original guidance range.  Joe will walk through the details later in the call. Last year we shared our goals for 2018 and are proud to report we are able to meet those commitments. Utility and generation operations had best performance in multiple categories. I’ll get those details in a few minutes.  Last year, Exelon Utilities invested more than $5.5 billion in capital, primarily in infrastructure and technology to provide a premier customer experience, as well as improve reliability and resiliency, which resulted in higher customer satisfaction scores. We are also effective on the regulatory front completing 13 distribution and transmission cases in 2018.  PHI was able to reach constructive settlements in all of its cases, including Pepco, and in Maryland – at Pepco in Maryland and D.C for the first time since 1980s. We shared the benefit of the tax reform with our 10 million customers returning more than $675 million on an annual basis. Working with stakeholders to realize timely and fair regulatory outcomes helped us fund future investments in our system and continue to improve customer service.  On the policy front, the Second and Seventh Circuit Court upheld the ZEC program in New York and Illinois. Although the plaintiffs have appealed to the Supreme Court, we expect these rulings to stand. New Jersey enacted the ZEC legislation which will start this spring and we are still focused on preserving nuclear plants in Pennsylvania.  The Public Utility Commission of Texas adopted the changes to the ORDC curve earlier this year. We are awaiting a decision from FERC on PJM’s fast start proposal and on PJM’s capacity market reform and PJM is expected to file its reserve market reforms in coming months. These policies, each in their own way better compensate our zero carbon nuclear fleet for the value it provides by addressing flaws in the existing energy and capacity markets.  We are growing our dividend by 5% each year through 2020 with the Board raising the annual dividend to $1.45 per share on Monday. We are dedicated to corporate responsibility and supporting the communities we serve in an important part of who we are and what we do.  As part of our partnership with the UN HeForShe Initiative, we held an inaugural STEM initiative leadership academies for teenagers in Chicago and Washington D.C. 95 girls participated in a week long program designed to empower them through mentorship and creating opportunities to learn about STEM. We are expanding this program in 2019.  And 2018 was another record year for employee volunteerism and contributions. Our employees volunteered more than 240,000 hours last year on average seven hours per employee and donated nearly $13 million. In addition, Exelon donated more than $51 million to charitable organizations throughout our footprint.  We are committed to providing a diverse and inclusive environment for our 34,000 employees. We were named a Best Company for Diversity by Forbes, Black Enterprise Magazine, DiversityInc and the Human Rights Campaign. We are also recognized for environmental stewardship. We received a score of A minus on both the CDP climate change and water surveys, the highest by any utility for each.  We were named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the 13th year in a row and we had a series of commitments for the 2018, we delivered on the task is for 2019 is beginning as big and I will cover those at the end of the call.  On Slide 6, we show the impact that Exelon management model has had on our utility operations. Each of our utilities have materially improved their operation since the merger with Constellation or PHI. To put this chart in perspective, ComEd has improved its overall reliability 60% since 2012, the hard work of our employees and the ability to share best practices across a large platform is paying off.  In 2018 all four of our utilities ended up in top quartile for safety, or outage frequency performance with ComEd at top decile and PHI matching its best performance on record. Each utility achieved top quartile on CAIDI or outage duration except PECO which missed top quartile by only one minute. BGE and ComEd performed in top decile.  BGE and PECO had top decile performance in Gas odor response for the 6th consecutive year and PHI delivered top decile performance for the second year in a row. This level of reliability demonstrates that the investments we are making in our system are yielding positive results for our customers, but we still have more to do to confront climate change and our customer demands.  Customer satisfaction was top quartile at, at least three of the four utilities ComEd, BGE and PHI had the best performance on record in call center satisfaction. ComEd and PHI scored in top decile for service level and BGE and PHI had their best performance on record.  Our utilities in the Mid-Atlantic operated extremely well in the phase of record-breaking rainfall. D.C. saw more than 5.5 feet of rain, Baltimore 6 feet and Philadelphia, 8 feet of rain during last year.  Our safety metrics improved over the year as a result of the actions we are taking to correct course. We will continue to focus on improving our performance in this area.  Turning to our competitive business on Slide 7. Our Generation fleet performed very well in 2018 providing abundance of clean electricity that our country needs. In fact, Exelon generated one out of every nine clean megawatts in the United States, more than twice as many of any other generator. Our best-in-class nuclear fleet operated very well last year.  Our capacity factor was 94.6 exceeding 94% for the third year in a row in five out of the last six years. We generated the most nuclear power ever at 159 million megawatt hours avoiding more than 82 million metric tons of Greenhouse Gas Emission in 2018. Our average outage duration was 21 days, a new Exelon record and 13 days better than the industry average.  Exelon Power’s gas and hydro dispatch match 98.1% and wind and solar captured 96.1% or better than plan. In October, we acquired the Everett LNG import facility and in December, we received a cost of service order from FERC for Mystic unit 8 and 9, which together will allow us to provide fuel security in New England market through May of 2024.  Our Mystic units are critical in keeping the lights on during the extreme cold temperatures we saw in January and February of last year. At Constellation, our C&I operating metrics remains strong. 78% customer renewal rates, average customer duration of more than six years and power contract terms of 24 months on average.  We continue to see stable unit margins with our power customers and continue to focus on cost is helping us support operating margins. Constellation strength lies in its durable relationship with its customers. That relationship is more than just power and gas, but is built on Consteallation’s unique ability to help our customers meet their energy needs, while also reaching their environmental and sustainability goals. Now I will turn it over to Joe. 
Joe Nigro: Thank you, Chris, and good morning everyone. Today, I will cover our 2018 results, annual updates to our financial disclosures, and 2019 guidance. Starting with Slide number 8, we had another strong year. For the fourth quarter, we earned $0.16 per share on a GAAP basis, and $0.58 per share on a non-GAAP basis.  For the full year, we earned $3.12 per share on a non-GAAP basis, which is at the midpoint our revised full year guidance of $3.05 to $3.20 per share and $0.07 above our original midpoint.  Exelon Utilities outperformed our full year plan due to higher distribution and transmission revenues with the early resolution of rate cases at Pepco and favorable weather. This was partially offset by the first quarter winter storms.  ExGen performed in line with guidance. Realized gains realized gains at our nuclear decommissioning trust funds were offset by several factors unique to 2018 including higher allocated transmission costs. Overall, we delivered well on our financial commitments.  Turning to Slide 9, it shows an overview of our 2018 rate case outcomes. Across our utilities, we received final orders in eight distribution cases. We reached settlements in six of the cases at PECO, Delmarva, Delaware on the electric and gas sites. Delmarva, Maryland and PEPCO Maryland and D.C. which is the first time we’ve had settlements at PEPCO since the 1980s.  Additionally, ComEd received a 100% of its ask for the second year in a row and finally in early January, the Maryland PSC approved 78% of the ask in BGE’s gas distribution case. Our focus on improving the reliability and service levels is reflected in our rate case outcomes across our jurisdictions.  On Slide 10, we compare the 2018 trailing 12 months blended transmission and distribution earned ROEs to 2017. Our constructive rate case results and the roll-off of the FAS 109 charge drove the improved earned returns this year. We are encouraged by PHI’s ongoing improvement with earned ROEs improving by 70 to 140 basis points.  Exelon Utilities earned a combined 9.7% ROE, up year-over-year. We remained focused on achieving our Utility earnings growth targets by improving the earned ROEs at PHI and sustaining strong performance at our other utilities. We expect that all our utilities will earn in a 9% to 10% range in 2019.  On Slide 11, we roll over to our outlook for Utility CapEx and rate-based growth covering 2019 to 2022. Since the merger with PHI in 2016, we have invested more than $16 billion in our utility and plan to invest nearly $23 billion over the next four years. As Chris said, these investments are improving our system reliability, service experience by our Utility customers and preparing us for the future.  As a reminder, the CapEx budgets we share with you reflects identified and approved projects. As we move through time, we generally find more investments due to additional system needs. When we compare our 2019 to 2021 CapEx outlook, versus the same period last year, we plan to invest an additional $1.5 billion of CapEx for the benefit of our customers.  This additional capital is spread across our utilities with the biggest increase at our largest utility ComEd. Since the PHI merger, we have added nearly $6 billion in rate base across the utilities.  Over the next four years, we will grow our rate base 7.8% annually to $50.7 billion, adding $13.1 billion to rate base by 2022 or the equivalent of adding a utility almost the size of ComEd without paying a premium, issuing equity or obtaining merger approvals. Rate base is growing slightly faster than the 7.4% growth we projected last year.  As a reminder, the bulk of our rate base growth is covered under either formula rates or mechanisms like capital trackers. These support our ability to make additional investments to strengthen our system and have the opportunity to earn a fair and timely return on our capital where we do not have these mechanisms; we will continue to work with stakeholders to establish more timely recovery tools.  In the appendix, we provide a more detailed breakdown of the capital and rate base outlook for each utility starting on Slide 22.  As you turn to Slide 12, we continue to forecast strong Utility less holding company EPS growth of 6% to 8% even for the elevated – even from the elevated 2018 starting point, where we executed the midpoint of our guidance range – we exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.09 per share.  Compared to last year, the outlook for 2019 to 2021 has improved with all bands increasing by $0.05 per share. The durability of our industry-leading earnings growth reflects a combination of strong rate base growth to support system needs for more digital economy and growing environmental goals along with concerted efforts to manage loss and a focus on modest customer bill inflation.  On Slide 13, we provide our gross margin updating current hedging strategy at the Generation company. There is no change in total gross margin in 2019 from our last disclosure. Open gross margin increased $50 million due to improving spark spreads at ERCOT, as well as higher prices at New York Zone A and NiHub, which were offset by our hedges. During the quarter, we executed $50 million in Power new business.  In 2020, open gross margin is up $150 million, due to higher prices in most of our regions. Given our hedged position and execution of $100 million of new business, total gross margin increased by $50 million since last quarter.  We are showing you 2021 for the first time today, which is down $250 million compared to 2020. The decline reflects lower power prices in PJM and ERCOT, plus lower capacity revenues in New England and PJM.  Our Power and non-Power new business To Go numbers for 2021 are consistent with prior years. I should point out that these disclosures are based on 12/31 pricing and do not reflect any impacts from recently approved ORDC curve changes in Texas.  We remain behind our ratable hedging program in all years. We ended the year 9% to 12% behind ratable in 2019 and 8% to 11% behind ratable in 2020 while we are $0.02 to $0.05 – 2% to 5% behind ratable in 2021. When considering cross-commodity hedges, our open market length is primarily concentrated in the Midwest in Texas. We are comfortable maintaining a more open position given our balance.  Slide 14 shows our O&M and capital outlook at Generation. Our O&M forecast has been updated since our third quarter call, primarily to reflect increased pension expense and the acquisition of the Everett Marine Terminal that serves our Mystic units. Like the others, the returns on our pension investments did not meet our planned returns resulting in increased cost going forward.  In total, these updates have added $75 million in O&M costs or about a 6% - or $0.06 per share drag in 2019 through 2021. However, even with these cost pressures, we expect to see a 1% annual decline in O&M over the next four years. Compared to our previous disclosure, our 2019 to 2021 CapEx is up modestly. In 2019, due to timing delays for our Midway plants and some retail customer-sited solar. In 2020, with modest increases in nuclear fuel cost related to the rising uranium prices where we had hedged with colors. We continue to look for ways to be more efficient in how we work and spend while maintaining the safety and reliability of our fleets.  Slide 15 rolls over to ExGen’s available cash flow outlook for 2019 through 2022. We expect cumulative available cash flow to be $7.8 billion, which is $200 million higher than our previous four year outlook. We will use the available cash flow from ExGen to primarily fund the increased utility investment, pay down debt, and cover a small portion of the dividend.  We will invest approximately $600 million in growth capital which is primarily customer-sited solar projects at Constellation and as I mentioned the completion in the West Medway plant in New England this quarter.  As I mentioned earlier, we have identified additional capital investment at our utilities. As a result, we have significantly increased the amount of equity going into the utilities from ExGen by $700 million to a range of $4 billion to $4.4 billion. We will use between $300 million and $500 million of ExGen’s free cash flow to fund the dividend not covered by the utilities. As utilities continue to grow, ExGen’s portion of the dividend decreased as even as the dividend itself grows.  Finally, we have planned to retire between $2.2 billion and $2.8 billion of debt with our strong credit metrics exceeding our internal targets, we felt it made more sense to shift cash, plans for debt reductions to instead support the higher value-added and need investments at our utilities.  A big part of our value proposition is our unique ability to redeploy strong free cash flow from generation to fund Utility growth without needing to go to the equity markets. This remains a differentiated advantage to our peers.  Moving on to Slide 16, we remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and our investment-grade credit ratings. We are comfortably ahead of our corporate targets for FFO to debt and well above the agency’s downgrade thresholds. As you are aware, Exelon and its operating companies are on credit watch positive at both S&P and Fitch.  Looking at ExGen, we are well ahead of our debt-to-EBITDA target of three times in 2019. We expect to be at 2.4 times debt-to-EBITDA and 1.9 times debt-to-EBITDA on a recourse basis. We are actively following the PGE bankruptcy process. PGE is a sole off-taker of our Antelope Valley Solar Ranch or AVSR facility which was funded by Exelon DOE loans and project financing at our non-recourse to Exelon.  We, along with other owners of renewable generation under contract with BG&E recently received a FERC order affirming the Commission’s role to approve any modifications to existing PPAs which BG&E has challenged in the bankruptcy court. We will remain diligent in protecting the contractual value of AVSR and the role what assets like ours have in California’s clean energy future.  From an earnings perspective, AVSR provides $0.03 per share to Exelon in operating earnings and is not significant to our credit metrics given the non-recourse project nature.  Finally, I will conclude with our 2019 earnings guidance on Slide 17. We are providing 2019 adjusted operating earnings guidance of $3 to $3.30 per share. Growth in earnings at the utilities is driven by the continued increase in rate base as we deploy capital for the benefit of our consumers, last year’s completed rate cases and improvements in PHI’s ROEs. The decline in Generation earnings is a combination of normalized Illinois ZEC revenues as we recognized $0.11 of 2017 Illinois ZEC revenues in the first quarter of 2018 and lower realized energy prices which are partially offset by increased ZEC revenues in New Jersey and New York as well as fewer planned nuclear outages.  As you think about our 2019 earnings, the most notable new updates include, the $0.05 per share increase to our Utility earnings band, the $0.02 to $0.03 of pension expense at ExGen due to worst than expected plant performance in 2018, as well as a roughly $0.03 per share drag from the recent Everett LNG facility acquisition, which represents a negative near-term impact, but is a positive value driver in the future with the Mystic cost to service contract beginning in 2022. These impacts are reflected in our O&M and other expense data in the appendix.  We expect first quarter operating earnings to be in a range of $0.80 to $0.90 per share. More detail on the year-over-year drivers by operating company can be found in the appendix starting on Slide 61.  I will now turn the call back to Chris for his closing comments. 
Chris Crane: Thanks, Joe. Turning to Slide 18, I want to discuss our key focus areas for 2019. We will continue to deliver operational excellence across our businesses focusing on modernizing the grid and improving the customer experience at our utilities and running our generation fleets safely and reliably.  We will meet or exceed our financial commitments including achieving earnings within our guidance range and maintaining our investment-grade rating.  At the Utilities, we will prudently and effectively deploy $5.3 billion of capital to benefit our customers and we will file rate cases with the goal of achieving the 9% to 10% earned ROEs across Exelon Utility families by year end.  Building upon successes in Delaware, D.C., Maryland and Pennsylvania, we will advocate for policies in our state legislatures and our commissions that will enable the utility of the future and help meet the needs of our customers.  At Generation, a number of our nuclear plants are economically challenged due to market flaws that failed to value zero carbon nuclear energy for its environmental and grid resiliency benefits. As you know, we plan to retire TMI later this year and as a reminder, all of the Dresden and portions of the Braidwood and Byron plants did not clear last year’s PJM auction.  We will continue to engage with stakeholders on state policies while advocating broader market reforms at the Federal level. We will support PJM price formation changes like fast start and reserve market reforms with our states to implement the expected FERC order on PJM capacity reforms and preserve the authority of our states to advance their clean energy policies and continue our efforts to seek fair compensation or zero emitting nuclear plants.  We will continue to grow our dividend at 5% annually through 2020 and we will be a partner and ally in the communities we serve. Being a good corporate citizen for our customers, communities and employees is key to who we are.  Finally, turning to Slide 19, I will close on the value proposition that highlights our strategy and our commitment to shareholders. We have updated some of the numbers, but the proposition remains the same. We will continue to focus on growing our utilities targeting a 7.8% growth - rate base growth and a 6% to 8% earnings growth through 2022 rolling forward another year at above the Group trajectory.  We continue to use free cash flow from ExGen to fund incremental equity needs of the utilities, pay down debt, and fund part of the growing dividend.  We will continue to optimize value of our GenCo business by seeking fair compensation for zero emitting generation fleet, selling assets where it makes sense to accelerate debt reduction plans and maximizing value through the gen to load match strategy at Constellation. We will sustain strong investment-grade metrics and we will grow the dividend annually of 5% through 2020. This strategy underpins this value proposition is effective in providing tangible benefits for our stakeholders. We are well positioned for growth to capture additional upside though needed policy and market reforms are required.  We are very confident about the prospects for Exelon in 2019 and beyond and we remain committed to optimizing the value of our business and earn your ongoing support at Exelon.  With that operator, we can now open the call up to questions. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question this morning comes from Greg Gordon from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. 
Greg Gordon : Thanks. Good morning.
Chris Crane: Hey, Greg. 
Greg Gordon : On the Utility side of the business, obviously, pretty meaningful increase in capital opportunities across the entire set of companies. What’s the expected bill impact of the increase in spending?  And as you look at the long-term and how much more sort of customer experience enhancing types of capital programs are you contemplating that are also affordable as we think about the opportunity, not just this year to execute on this new capital plan, but to continue to evolve your plan.
Anne Pramaggiore: Good morning, Greg. It’s Anne Pramaggiore. I will start with your first question. We – when we put our capital plans together, LRPs each year we look at what the needs are in front of us. We challenge ourselves on O&M and if you can look at the O&M trajectory, it’s about 0.3% increase over that four year period.  And we always look at affordability. And we’ve got eight bills on the distribution rate side and four of them – excuse me, three of them are roughly flat over that period that we’ve showed you. Four of them are trending less than inflation and one of them will come in right at inflation and that’s a combination of managing our O&M and also our energy efficiency programs which are becoming a bigger and bigger part of our package here.  So, that’s basically what we are looking at in terms of affordability. The other question that we ask ourselves is, are there vulnerable groups inside that average that we look at in terms of billing and rates. And we – so, we’ve been looking hard at the low income side and a lot of our initiatives include enhanced low income programs along with it.  So, that’s what we are looking at in terms of affordability, bills that are staying at or well below inflation and also looking at low income. In terms of looking forward, we think about investment in really three buckets.  One is, reliability and resiliency, just the core basics and improving the material condition of our systems, the safety of our systems and as the economy changes, and we’ve got more and more parts of the economy leaning on the electric system, how do you ensure that that’s reliable and resilient. The second area is, really adapting to renewables and distributed generation.  We’ve got a lot of flexibility and dynamism to add to the grid in order to be able to deal with the kinds of changes that we will see in terms of supply coming from many different places and many different actors and demand being much more volatile.  So, thinking about sensors on the system, artificial intelligence, distributed intelligence on the system that allow us to move operations on our assets from 16 to 18 cycles down to 6 to 8 cycles, that sort of thing. And then the last area is really thinking about electrification of transportation and what we need to do the system to – in expectation of that kind of shift.  So those are the areas that we think about and look out. We watch our stakeholders very closely. We are starting to see legislation and policy come out of D.C. in December, big piece of policy there. The Pennsylvania came out with a clean energy and greenhouse gas reduction, executive order in January. And so we watch what our stakeholders and our policymakers are telling us and how they are directing us. 
Greg Gordon : Great. Thanks. And I’ll ask one more and then go to the back of the queue. Joe, I know that you were focused on the strong 2018 performance and the 2019 outlook. But I think it’s sort of déjà vu all over again with people just focused on the 2021 rollout of sort of the guidance pieces for ExGen.  And once again we see as we have in prior years, pretty significant backwardation and what the current state of players for the earnings outlook for ExGen based on the algebra you gave in the deck, it’s $0.20 headwind on total gross margin, probably a $0.05 offset through prudent O&M.  But still much like we’ve seen in past updates that are sort of two years forward. There looks today, significant pressures on ExGen margin, what can you tell investors about how you feel about that as you think you roll into real-time over the next two years? 
Joe Nigro: Hey, Greg. I appreciate the question. The first thing is, we are not in the business of giving EPS guidance beyond the prompt here, but having said that, I think as you’ve seen through time, our earnings have improved each year when you look at forward years and by the time we get to those in the realized time period.  When you look at the gross margin in 2021 versus 2020, there is a – the two big drivers very simply are, as you mentioned, one is the backward-dated price curve and obviously, for us the biggest impact is at NiHub and West Hub and Jim could talk for a while about what we are doing. We are aggressively managing our portfolio.  You see that were behind our ratable plan. Actual spot prices last year obviously, were very, very strong. And then, secondly, Kathleen and her team are working very aggressively on policy reforms as well as PJM and others. So, I don’t think this story has been fully written there and obviously we have a very large open position.  The second piece of it is driven really by capacity and some of it’s in New England where the prices were lower year-over-year and in PJM where we had lower volumes clear year-over-year. But from my lens, I think, the strength of our balance sheet affords us strategic and operational flexibility and hedging is – less hedging is an example of that and t through time, we’ve continued to improve our earnings and we will continue to work hard to do that in 2021. 
Greg Gordon : Okay. Thank you guys. 
Chris Crane: Yes, just to add on. I mean, just to summarize that. You have got low or minimal liquidity in those years, 2021 and out – 2021 and out – you build the liquidity as you go through the prompt year in to the next year and you see the curves come up and that’s been the pattern.  Until we get these market reforms in, if it’s moving the plants in Illinois or some amount of the plants in Illinois to FRR, so we can get better capacity treatment that matches state’s environmental needs or if you look at price formation that's working through you look at reserve curves being revised, there is a lot of activity going.  So, that’s why we are keeping more of an open position. We believe the market will strengthen. 
Greg Gordon : Thank you, Chris.
Chris Crane: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Steve Fleishman : Hi, good morning. Couple market structure questions. 
Chris Crane: Hi.
Steve Fleishman : Hi, Chris. The – first of all in Pennsylvania, in terms of any chance to get to x. Could you give us an update there? And when would something have to happen for you to not have to close TMI?
Chris Crane: So, the activities that Kathleen is leading with the other operating companies in Pennsylvania are promising. We have some strong support. It’s going to have to move this spring. We have to order a core by May, and we’ve let the stakeholders know that. So, if we can get this through in that period of time, we will be able to save the unit short of that we would be beyond the return at the end of May. 
Steve Fleishman : And is there any sense on what the value – targeted value of the ZEC is going to be in Pennsylvania? 
Kathleen Barrón: I’ll take that one, Steve. This is Kathleen. I think that is subject to discussions that are ongoing among the lawmakers now. So we don’t have an estimate for you on how the program will look. How it will be priced. Those are discussions that are progressing as Chris said with some promising outlook. 
Steve Fleishman : Okay. And then, just, have to ask and probably hard to answer. Just, any better sense of where FERC may come out on the capacity market reforms? Is there any hinge from the changes at FERC and what happened with the New England auction and things like that where you might have a better idea? 
Kathleen Barrón: I’ll take that one, as well. I don’t think we have a better idea than we did on our last call of how they are going to come out. Clearly, there has been some delay in the schedule and I think that’s a function of the transition at FERC. The unfortunate death of the Chairman integrating a new Commissioner, Commissioned with floor announcing her plans for retirement.  So, while they have been able to get out a number of important orders others have lagged and the capacity market order among them. So, I think, as we are doing as you are doing, looking at the key leads and trying to make an estimate of where we think things will land but we really have no single yet from them as to when we will see their final decision in that docket.
Steve Fleishman : Okay. Great. Thank you.
Chris Crane: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith : Hey, good morning. Can you hear me?
Chris Crane: Yes. Hear you well. Good morning. 
Julien Dumoulin-Smith : Excellent. Congratulations again. I wanted to follow-up a little bit more on the utilities side, can you walk through some of the more specific dynamics for the longer-dated 22 year. I mean, that’s just a pretty impressive jump at the end there.  What exact dynamics? And also what kind earned ROEs are you embedding out there within the ranges? I mean, just perhaps once you get the 22, what are we going to talking about with respect to the position of the utilities and also rate case schedule et cetera?
Anne Pramaggiore: Hi, Julien. It’s Anne Pramaggiore. Let me start by giving you sense of what the investment patterns look like and what sort of – I think driving the trending that you are seeing and then, between Joe and I we’ll talk about the ROEs. So, we are – there is a couple of things that are happening there. One is the things that we have done in the last year.  So we’ve gone through and accelerated our Gas main replacement program as we move them from 30 years to 20 years. And so, you are seeing an acceleration of the Gas investments. So, that’s one of the pieces that you are seeing trending there. One of the things that we are doing at PECO now is we are looking at some material conditions upgrades.  But we are also doing a program to upgrade 4 KV feeders to 12 KV feeders in anticipation of more and more distributed generation coming on the system. You just can’t put that stuff on the kind of some of the feeders we’ve got in place in right now. So that’s one of the areas we are looking at. And another program at PECO is, really enhancing the underground replacement program.  Again, underground cable program. Again, some material condition work. I think you are pretty familiar with the – most of the PHI work we’ve got, D.C. plug that we are getting started and we also are looking at some work potentially coming through off of the new legislation that was passed in December.  At BG&E, we’ve got some new EV investment that’s coming through after the order that just came out of the commission. So, some additional capital investment there. At ComEd, we are expanding the distribution automation program that we have in place. We are doing some more underground cable work and starting to invest across the utilities on security investments.  We got about a program for security on our substations and cyber security, that’s about $900 million across the utilities over that period and some investment in some of our IT systems to get ready for, again, more flexible dynamic grids. So those are – I think some of the things that you are looking at that's driving that capital trend. 
Julien Dumoulin-Smith : And just to jump on quickly in that, what’s driving that uptick from 21 to 22 though? What are the dynamics there, specifically? That’s a pretty big jump. 
Joe Nigro: Julien, it’s Joe. Good morning. Specifically to your question, the jump from 21 to 22, Anne went through at each of the utilities the investments that we are making in the rate base. That compounding of that investments is one component of it. The second thing is we have a rate case in PECO in 2021 that has benefits in 2022 and then the third thing is there is additional spending under the formula rate at ComEd. So, those three things together gets you to that outcome. 
Julien Dumoulin-Smith : Excellent. All right. And then, turning back to the other side of the business real quickly. Can you talk a little bit about Everett and the contribution on the ExGen side? As you see that cost of service kick in 2022? And then also, how do you think about that asset has aligned, even at Mystic we are ultimately be pulled out of the market, how do you think about the LNG asset itself contributing kind of more structurally even?
Joe Nigro: Yes, I think, first of all, Julien, we acquired the Marine Terminal in Q4. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the acquisition is earnings negative from 2019 to 2021 driven by the increased O&M amounts with about half of the $75 million increase in O&M or $0.03 a share being driven by Everett.  The gross margin from the facility is included in our open gross margin calculation in our hedge disclosure and isn’t really material. What I would say is, obviously the Mystic cost of service contract arrangement begins in 2022 and effectively the whole thing is bundled and it becomes accretive at that time.  We committed, we had a capacity commitment prior to the last auction and we were committed to honoring that commitment and one way to do that was to acquire the facility. We were also very clear – to your question about how would we treat it in the future?  We are very clear that with any type of asset that is economically viable, we are going to work for solutions and ways to try to make that asset viable. But I think you’ve seen with our financial discipline that when we’ve had to, we’ve taken the stance of making the necessary change.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith : Excellent. Thank you very much. Congrats again. 
Joe Nigro: Thanks. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Weinstein from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Michael Weinstein : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. 
Chris Crane: Hi, Michael. 
Michael Weinstein : Hey, just to be clear on the ROEs at PHI, you are saying that for all of 2019 you will be at the 9% to 10% range or are you going to be – or is that like a runrate at the end of the year?
Joe Nigro: That will be - by the end of the year, we will be in that range of 9% to 10% and effectively that will be the trailing 12 months at that time. 
Michael Weinstein : Gotcha, okay. And then, on the ORDC, I understand that’s a dynamic issue and you are not going to provide a point number on that, but is one of the things we’ve tried to estimate it ourselves here around $25 million, perhaps of improvements for Exelon. I am just wondering if that’s in the right ballpark. Perhaps you can give some kind of hands as to where what kind of impact you are thinking this might have on you? 
Jim McHugh: Right. And to be clear – hi, it’s Jim McHugh, Michael. To be clear, we are talking about ERCOT?
Michael Weinstein : Yes.
Jim McHugh: Okay, ERCOT ORDC, it is hard to put a pinpoint on a number on it. The way we are looking at it right now is, even before the ORDC change, we’ve been talking about the tighter reserve margins. And you’ve seen the CDR reports and we are in agreement with where they are coming in now. The reserve margins for this upcoming, somewhere look like they are somewhere between 7% and 8%.  So, I think with the ORDC changes, you are just making the likelihood that scarcity is going to play a bigger role in where the summer prices go. We’ve seen the forward market move up since the end of Q3 about $15 for summer on peak. Over the last month so, it’s been more up and down and maybe a little higher, but more flattish.  So, I think the market has been moving around its expectation of just how many scarcity hours there is going to be, which – to your point is the hard to predict. Obviously, it depends on where coincident or high loads with generation outages are variable win. The one way to think about it perhaps is, a single hour at $9000 is a dollar on the CAL ATC price. It's about $13 or $14 on the summer on peak price.  So, I think what we are going to see the market do is really trade on a pretty volatile range as the assessment of how many scarcity hours there may or may not be can drive that summer $15 at a time just by adding an hour or two. So, putting an estimate on it right now is really just say how many hours we think there is going to be.  But I think the way we like to think about it is increase the likelihood and sends the right price signal in times of tight market conditions.
Joe Nigro: And Michael, Jim is keeping a relatively significant open position and capability to extract value as we see volatility occur both in the forwards for the summer in 2019, as well as we will position ourselves well during that summer period. 
Michael Weinstein : Thank you, very much for the help.
Operator: Our next question comes from Shahriar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. 
Shahriar Pourreza : Hey, Joe and Chris.
Chris Crane: Hey, Shar. 
Shahriar Pourreza : So, just real quick on the O&M profile change, post 2022, should we kind of assume this is the new normal? And then, as we are sort of thinking about some of the incremental revenue items that’s not within plan that could help mitigate or at least support some of this O&M pressures, especially they are closer to 2021, can you provide some color there?  I mean, I think you mentioned, Mystic is obviously is one of it and LNG is another one. Is there sort of anything else we should be thinking about from the revenue offset side?
Joe Nigro: Yes, the one thing I would say and obviously, we haven’t given you a forecast of O&M, 2022 and beyond, but the one thing I would say, and I made it the comment in my prepared remarks, the cost to service agreement at Mystic kicks in, in the middle of 2022 and that would more than offset those cost to the O&M that we show in 2021 or so. So, effectively, it turns into an accretive outcome as I said in my prepared remarks.
Chris Crane: And then pension, as you know, the market for 2018 was not great on equities. The December was pretty tough. We got some of that – a portion of that back in January. So, we will watch the pension. We will watch the pension investments, the interest rate and the return on the fund is what will drive the other half of what we saw the increase on this year, so, Everett and the pension.  As far as the O&M discipline, we worked through the out years. We are far less than 1% all across the company and you know that’s dealing with labor contacts, at 2.5% wage increases and other inflations forces.  So, we do have a good plan on continuing to drive efficiency, hold the cost down and maintain that inflation rate as much lower at the generating company than utilities. But still the utilities are less than 1%. 
Shahriar Pourreza : Got it. Got it. And then just lastly, Chris, that’s helpful. And then, as we are sort of thinking about the ExGen gross margin, I know we’ve talked about in the past maybe taking somewhat of a different approach when it comes to managing the portfolio, i.e. maybe operating some of the units more – from a portfolio portrait, so, like maybe FitzPatrick or Nine Mile, right?  Are we sort of seeing any impact from this in your outlook or is this sort of something you guys are still going through internally? And then, I guess, what I am asking is, also beyond FitzPatrick and Nine Mile, is there any sort of things we should be thinking about from taking a more holistic approach to the assets?
Jim McHugh: Yes, it’s Jim. I mean, if you are talking about New York, I think the way we are thinking about the portfolio in New York is, the capacity and the ZEC payment that we receive in New York has somewhat of an offsetting nature as energy prices rise.  So we're in the – out in the outer years. So we are looking to make sure we are hedging our portfolio along the lines of where we think that index is going to set as the ZEC price sets according to the structure, the index structure in the ZEC. So, really there is not much of a shift in our strategy.  I think what we’ve been doing is finding opportunities in the nearby year to on the energy side to understand if we think the market is slightly underpriced or slightly overpriced. And right now, recently, we’ve seen a pretty strong move in New York prices and we've been getting some good hedges off in CAL 2019 and CAL 2020 area to take advantage of those higher New York energy prices.
Shahriar Pourreza : I guess, what I am asking is, have you seen any synergies for having these two assets so close to each other more from – less from a dispatch and hedging, but more from taking these systems, taking the units and operating as one. So there is clearly some synergies in there for owning these two assets so close to each other, right?
Chris Crane: Yes, I didn’t get your question, first. I am sorry. 
Shahriar Pourreza : No, it’s okay. 
Chris Crane: So, the nuclear team is evaluating that. What they can do as far as management or what they can do as far as warehousing we have looked at combining security of plants. That’s a cost prohibitive item. But they are continuing to drive through that.  There is definitely more synergies that we will be continuing to work on there as we complete the integration and the team has time to work through the regulatory process and we have time to make the investments to make these consolidations. 
Shahriar Pourreza : Perfect. And those synergies are incremental to plants?
Chris Crane: Right. They will be – if the ones aren’t included now, but there also are initiatives that are underway across the nuclear fleet. We are looking at how we centralize warehouses versus having overstock warehouses each site.  There is a lot of initiatives underway right now to take advantage as technology advances in – built into the cost savings numbered. Now as an assumption that we centralize engineering since we have much more digital information and we can trend the equipment remotely versus having the engineers in the plant on the site. So there is things like that across the fleet that we are working on. 
Shahriar Pourreza : Perfect, Chris. That’s what I was trying to get at. Thanks so much. 
Chris Crane: Thanks. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Jonathan Arnold from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. 
Chris Crane: Hey, Jonathan.
Jonathan Arnold : Couple of things. On the O&M at ExGen, just when you look behind the numbers that obviously have these new incremental pieces. Are you still going after the $200 million in additional cost savings?
Chris Crane: Yes. 
Jonathan Arnold : And $100 million at services that you shared at EEI?
Chris Crane: Yes, that’s still in the plan. We have line of sight on that and we will continue and just to reemphasize, we are not going off plan on savings or efficiency.  Two factors, pension, underperformance in the market required us to higher state O&M and Everett, which reverses out and provides greater revenues in the 2022 timeframe. So, these are the things we have line of sight of, it’s not that the efficiency programs have been taken to pedal off of. 
Jonathan Arnold : Yes, I just want to check Chris, because you are showing it slightly differently. So, thank you for that. 
Chris Crane: Okay. We will get with you to clarify that. 
Jonathan Arnold : And secondly, I see you removed the disclosures on New England and sensitivities and we realized the Mystic contracts out in 2022. But is that just small enough than to make it simpler or something else going on there?
Chris Crane: There is really nothing else going on, Jon. That we made a decision to collapse the New England region into Open Gross Margin, because, with the changes to that facility and the inputs of Gas and so on, and the associated contract change, the volume of our power generation output is falling.  And then, you’ve got the gas acquisition of Everett that we’ve talked about and that would all factor into that EREV calculation and you would see changes that were quite variable quarter-to-quarter. Most importantly, the overall gross margin is very small compared to the total gross margin we provide you in the disclosure. 
Jonathan Arnold : Perfect. Okay, thank you. And then, could – I don’t know, this is timely or not but, Chris any update on sort of efforts to engage the legislature in Illinois coalition building, et cetera. We did notice the bill that seem to be very – renewables-only got floated this week. So I was just curious if you have any comments you’d like to share on that? 
Chris Crane: Yes, it’s very, very early in the legislative cycle. As you can imagine, we work within the coalitions, within the state on what’s needed to continue to advance the environmental stakeholders, the customers and sound investments.  So, we have our folks communicating in those coalitions and communicating with the legislative folks. It’s premature to say, what it looks like at the end of the day. But they are at the beginning of the f the sausage-making right now. And we will continue to have productive conversations. 
Jonathan Arnold : In the FERC order, sort of a pre-requisite for actually something happening this year? 
Chris Crane: Not on the utility side and we are looking at other methods on the generation side. The FERC order definitely would be helpful to get out in a timely manner. But we don’t need it. You can go to use the current statute and achieve what we think we can do – want to do.
Jonathan Arnold : Okay, I’ll leave with that. Thank you, Chris.
Chris Crane: Thanks. 
Operator: Our final question comes from Praful Mehta from Citigroup. Please go ahead. 
Praful Mehta : Thanks so much. Hi, guys. 
Chris Crane: Hey, Praful. How are you?
Praful Mehta : Good. Thanks for this marathon session. So quickly on PJM, I guess, one last piece that was left was Fast Start. So just wanted to get any color or a view on timing of when that will come. We’ve been waiting for it for a while at this point.
Kathleen Barrón: Yes, this is Kathleen. And I think that’s within the scope of what I said earlier on the call. Unfortunately, there are – excuse me, a number of matters that are lagging and that’s one of them. And I think the transitions at the commission have affected their ability to get big orders out.  But just going back to the beginning of the Fast Start docket, recall, this is something that the FERC ask PJM to file. So, we continue to feel confident about how it will turn out even if it’s going to take a little bit longer than we expected. 
Praful Mehta : Gotcha. Fair enough. And then, Slide 15, that’s a very helpful capital allocation slide that you provide. In that, if we think about all of these benefits that are potentially coming on the ExGen side, right with Fast Start, ORDC, ZEC, all of them are incremental to the plan.  How would we think about the allocation given you’ve kind hit your utility investment targets, you are hitting your debt reduction targets, where does the incremental capital that potentially comes through go in your mind going forward?
Chris Crane: Yes, the answer in my mind I think is very similar to what you saw with the plan – with the increase at the utilities. Anne talked about the way she is thinking about the three buckets of investment at our utilities. And the benefits to our customers as it relates to those three buckets. We would continue to look at ways as we see projects that are beneficial for that.  We would continue to look at investment there and then I think, additionally, that incremental – those incremental dollars continue to provide us operating and strategic flexibility and we’ve talked about what that’s worth in the sense of our hedging and the opportunity to be more aggressive with that and other things. So, we are going to continue to work hard to get those and I think it gives us a lot of opportunity. 
Praful Mehta : Gotcha. But share buyback is not one of those that’s in the plan right now, or contemplated in the plan?
Chris Crane: Not contemplated in the plan, but all investments are bounced off to share buyback before they are made. 
Praful Mehta : Gotcha. Perfect. Well, I appreciate it guys. Thank you so much. 
Chris Crane: Well, I want to thank everybody – all of you for participating today. I want to thank you our employees for another good year both operationally and financially. So with that, we will close out the call and all have a good weekend. 
Operator: This does conclude today's conference. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to Exelon 2018 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. My name is Jerome and I will be facilitating the audio portion of today's interactive broadcast. All lines have been place on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I'd like turn the show over to Mr. Dan Eggers, Senior Vice President, Corporate Finance. The floor is yours. 
Daniel Eggers: Thank you, Jerome. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Leading the call today are Chris Crane, Exelon's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Joe Nigro, Exelon's Chief Financial Officer. They're joined by other members of Exelon's senior management team who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. We issued our earnings release this morning along with the presentation, both of which can be found in the Investor Relations section on Exelon's Web site. The earnings release and other matters which we'll discuss during today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today's material and comments made during this call. Please refer to today's 8-K and Exelon's other SEC filings for discussions of risk factors and factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecast and expectations. Today's presentation also references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the information contained in the Appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for reconciliations between the non-GAAP measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures. We scheduled 45 minutes for today's call. I'll now turn the call over to Chris Crane, Exelon's CEO.
Chris Crane: Thanks, Dan, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us. Flipping to slide five, we delivered another strong quarter with earnings again at the upper-end of our range, which allows us to raise the lower end of our full year guidance. The utilities performed well with strong earned ROEs and largely first quartile operations. As we stated previously, the Federal Courts of Appeal in Illinois and New York strongly affirm the legality of the ZEC. And our focus on cost continues identifying an additional $200 million in gross savings, which are $150 million of that will flow to the bottom line, bringing our six-year total savings to more than $900 million. Combined, this performance demonstrates our growing value. For the quarter, on a GAAP basis, we are at $0.76 per share versus $0.85 per share last year. On a non-GAAP operating basis, we are at $0.80 per share, and again above the midpoint of our $0.80 to $0.90 range guidance that was provided. Turning to slide six, our utilities continue to perform at higher levels across key customer satisfaction and operating metrics. The investments we are making in technology and infrastructure continue to improve reliability, which leads to greater customer satisfaction, and ultimately supporting strong relations with our regulators and our legislators. PECO and BG improved their JV power residential gas and electric scores over the last year with PECO receiving its highest ranking ever, placing second in the residential electric survey. Our customer service metrics is strong. BGE and ComEd are in the top decile for customer satisfaction, and PHI is in top decile for its service levels. Each of our utilities achieved top quartile reliability performance in SAIFI, or outage duration in CAIDI, which is -- the outage frequency is SAIFI, and CAIDI which is outage duration. ComEd and PHI performed in top decile for CAIDI. SAIFI as we've discussed in the past is our highest priority and remains that our metrics have continued to improve since the beginning of the year. At ExGen, in our third quarter was -- excuse me, 39.7 terawatt hours of capacity factor at 93.6%. During the fourth hottest summer in nearly 125 years, we performed at 96.7% capacity factor, and avoided 33 metric tons of carbon. Our gas and hydro fleet performed well, but below plan with economic dispatch match at 95.8%. This lower performance was primarily the result of our CCG's account Colorado Bend and Wolf Hollow being offline because of some turbine blades defects. The blades have been replaced. Wolf Hollow came back into service in late September. One of the Colorado Bend units returned to service in October, and the other will be back in service shortly. It's in the process of restart as we speak. We took advantage of the outage time performing normal maintenance that would have been required to have that shut down for next spring. From a financial perspective, all repairs were covered under a warranty, and the markets impact from the plants being down are well within our full range outage contingency plan. The plants ran very well over the summer prior to the outages, and we're very pleased with the performance of the design and their durability. They remain an integral part of our Texas strategy. Turning to slide seven, as you know, we've had a strong track record of finding efficiencies in the business and driving cost savings, which is why we created the business transformation team earlier this year to focus on our business services company. As part of that effort with additional savings from our nuclear fleet, we are announcing a $200 million reduction to our run rate 2021 costs of which $150 million will reach the bottom line at ExGen. Joe's going to cover this in more detail during his remarks. I'll turn it now to the policy updates from that quarter and start with the ZEC programs. As I said both the Seventh and the Second Court of Appeals dismiss challenges to the ZEC programs in Illinois and in New York respectively. In doing so each court found that the states have a right to choose generation sources based on attributes they prefer such as environmental performance and that these programs are not tethered to the market. The plaintiffs are rehearing an Illinois case which the court denied last month. The rulings were consistent with our expectations we're happy with the resigning information on these importantly stay clean energy policies. In New Jersey, the process for implementation of the ZEC program that remains on track to take effect early in the second quarter of 2019. The Board of Public Utilities has finished his hearings on implementation of the ZEC program and the utilities have well tariffs to recover the ZEC related charges. We expect BPU to approve the changes later this month On the federal policy front, we think that FERC's June order took an important step followed by empowering the states to continue prioritizing zero carbon energy throughout the state-led procurements outside of the PJM capacity module. Number of proposals were filed in response to the order, including from a diverse coalition of which Exelon is a member in PJM. We see all of the major proposals is putting our generation fleet in a better position financially than the current market construct. We are pleased to have followers part of a coalition to support the rights of states to advance their clean energy goals. Slide 22 gives a lot more detail on the coalition, but it includes consumer, ratepayer, advocates, attorney generals, national environmental groups, renewable energy trade associations, public power and the other nuclear generators in PJM. Our proposal will provide states with flexibility to conduct a capacity procurement of resources they list to support for the public policy reasons, and would protect consumers for paying thrice for capacity resources fits straight to a balance and the FERC is looking for to ensure states can meet their environmental goals, while protecting the competitive market. We plagued the comments are due November 6, and it will be important for FERC to issue an order early next year to give the markets guidance going forward. As you know, we are still waiting for orders from FERC on the vast start and resiliency examination.  But with that, now I'll turn it over to Joe to walk through the numbers. 
Joe Nigro: Thank you, Chris, and good morning everyone. Turning to slide eight, we had another strong quarter financially delivering adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings of $0.88 per share, which is at the upper end of our guidance range of $0.80 to $0.90 per share.  Exelon's utilities less Holding Company expenses earned a combined $0.55 per share. Compared to our plan, we benefited from reduced storm activity and favorable weather in our 00:10:17 non-decoupled jurisdiction including PECO, Atlantic City Electric and Delmarva Delaware. Generation earned $0.33 per share in the third quarter which was slightly behind our plan. The third quarter was impacted by lot of realized lower realized ERCOT prices versus the end of the second quarter, lower-than-expected generation performance with the unplanned outages that ERCOT CCGT as just discussed as well as one at [indiscernible] in addition to higher allocated transition costs. These were partially offset by realized gains from our nuclear decommissioning trust fund. On slide nine, we show our quarter-over-quarter walk. The $0.88 per share in the third quarter this year was $0.03 per share higher than the third quarter of 2017. Overall the utility earnings were collectively up $0.07 per share compared with last year driven primarily by higher rate base, new rates associated with completely rate cases, and favorable weather. Generation earnings were down $0.03 per share compared with last year driven largely by the absence of EGTP gross margins from the deconsolidation in the fourth quarter of 2017, and higher planned nuclear outage days, partially offset by contribution from a full quarter of Illinois ZEC revenues and savings from tax reform. Turning to slide 10, we are raising the lower end of our 2018 EPS guidance range from $2.90 to $3.20 per share to $3.05 to $3.20 per share. We are pleased with the strong operational results at both the utilities and generation businesses that are pushing us up into the upper half of our range, particularly as we have overcome unexpected headwind including the challenging winter storms. Moving to slide 11, improved operation at PHI and positive rate case outcomes are driving better earned ROE. Pepco's higher ROE reflects last fall's distribution rate cases as well as the recent Pepco Maryland with DC settlement that took effect in June and August respectively. Delmarva's earned ROE include the benefits of interim rates came effective during the first quarter with final rates for Delmarva Electric effective September 1, and favorable weather at Delmarva, Delaware during the quarter. At Atlantic City Electric, we saw higher earnings from last fall's rate case settlement as well as favorable weather during the quarter, which improves 12-month trailing ROEs significantly from last quarter. As we have previously discussed trailing 12-month ROEs for all of our PHI utilities should continue to improve next quarter as the FAS 109 charges from the fourth quarter of 2017 drop out of the calculation. For the legacy Exelon utilities, our earned ROEs remained over 10% were modestly dipped from last quarter. Our overall earned ROEs for Exelon utilities were modestly higher than last quarter at 9.6% well within our earned ROE target of 9% to 10% that underlies our earnings outlook for 2019 and beyond. We are pleased with our overall utility performance but have plans for continued improvement to bring PHI closer to the rest of our utilities.  Turning to slide 12, we remain busy on the regulatory front. On October 18, the Administrative Law Judges presiding over PECO's electric distribution base rate case recommended the settlement with all parties be approved. The deal provides for an increase of $96 million in annual electric distribution revenues offset by $71 million in tax saving benefits for customers for net $25 million revenue increase. We expect to receive an order in the fourth quarter.  On August 9, the DC commission approved the settlement that was reached in April based under $24.1 million revenue deduction after incorporating tax reform May 20 backed on August 30. A final order which received on August 21 to the settlement we reached in June on the Delaware, Delmarva electric distribution case. The case will provided $7 million revenue decrease including the benefits of capture firm for customers. On September 7, Delmarva Delaware entered into a settlement agreement in pending gas distribution base rate case that provides for revenue decrease of $3.5 million including tax benefits for customers. A final order is expected in the fourth quarter. We also have number of rate cases still in progress. We expect an order for BG&E spending gas rate case in January of 2019. As a reminder, the case include the request that $60.7 million increase to its gas revenues for infrastructure investments since 2015 and moving $21.7 million in revenue currently being recovered with the STRIDE surcharge engine into base rate. We expect to receive an order from the Illinois Commerce Commission on standard formula rate case in the fourth quarter. And finally, on August 21st Atlantic City Electric filed a distribution base rate case with the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities seeking of a revenue increase of $109 million and we expect an order in the second half of 2019. The utilities and the regulatory teams are doing a lot of hard work to improve system reliability and performance for our customers and for support of regulatory backdrop that in turn we helping the lift earned ROE source their allocated levels across the Exelon utility levels. More detail on the rate cases that are scheduled to be found on slide 24 through 30 in the appendix. Turning to slide 13, we invested $1.4 billion in capital at the utilities during the third quarter and around $3.9 billion year-to-date. We remain confident in our ability to meet our $5.5 billion capital budget for 2018. This quarter I would like to feature two projects within our portfolio and utility investors. The first is the early completion of ComEd to $920 million Smart Meter Installation program. ComRD installed more than 4 million smart meters in just over seven years, which is three years ahead of the original schedule and more than $20 million under budget. To help put this program in to the context, our ComED installed on average 2,400 smart meters per day over that seven year span. In fact, one of our workers personally installed over 25,000 meters as part of this program. The installation of smart meters on the ComEd System will allow customers to be better informed about their energy consumption that can help them save money and will allow ComEd to further improved it service offerings. In addition, we tried over $100 million in annual operational savings, primarily from increased efficiencies in the field operations, such as meter reading and avoided truck rolls. The smart meter installation program is part of the $2.6 billion Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act Program. The second project I want to highlight is Atlantic City Electrics Churchtown Substation Expansion project in Pennsville, New Jersey. This $50 million projects entailed equipment upgrades for reliability and 230 kV, 138 kV and 69 kV expansion for additional transmission capacity. Construction also included installation up 2.1 miles of transmission line consisting of 59 new structures. The expansion improves reliability for our customers by replacing and upgrading our stated equipment and by expanding regional transmission capacity which has the benefits of reducing congestion to our customers. Turning to slide 14, relative to our last update, total gross margin was flat in 2018 and up $50 million in both 2019 and 2020, primarily as a result of our higher power. For 2018 open gross margin was up $100 million primarily due to higher NI Hub, PJM West Hub and New York Zone A prices and offset by weakening ERCOT spark spread. Total gross margin is offset by lower mark-to-market of our hedging due to the higher price spikes. For 2019 and 2020, open gross margin was up $250 million and $100 million respectively with a higher PJM West Hub prices and stronger ERCOT spark spreads. In 2019, open gross margin was also up on higher NI Hub and New York Zone A prices. Similar to2018, the mark-to-market of our hedging is gambled in 2019 and 2020 due to higher prices. We also executed $50 million of Power New Business in both 2018 and 2019 and executed $50 million of non-Power New Business each year. From a hedging perspective, we ended the quarter in line with our ratable hedging program in 2018 and 9% to 12% behind ratable in 2019 and 8% to 11% behind ratable in 2020 when considering cross commodity hedges where we have increased our concentration. Turning to slide 15, as Chris mentioned, we are announcing another round of OEM cost reductions as part of our continual efforts to evaluate our work practices, looking for ways to being more efficient teams and better in portraying evasion and technology. With this new program, our gross run rate savings in 2021 will be $209 which we will ramp up over the next two years. These incremental savings will come from our Exelon Generation business primarily through even great efficiencies in our nuclear operations and at the Business Services Company or BSC, which is part of the transformation efforts that Jack has been leading. The $200 million of savings with the gross number with about half from ExGen and half from the BSC [indiscernible] and since BSC costs are shared roughly 50/50 between Exelon Generation and Exelon Utility, we would expect our Utility customers to benefit from $50 million in annual savings over time, with the other $50 million flowing through Exelon Generation bottom line. When we include the $50 million of incremental direct savings at ExGen, we expect a $150 million of savings to flow through our bottom line is 2021, relative to our previous guidance, which we show on the lower left chart. Exelon continues to embrace the culture of cost discipline and operational excellence. These costs updates our consistent with these cultural values. If we look at all the cost savings amounts since 2015, we have now reduced the O&M by over $900 million. It's due to hard work of all of our employees, we [indiscernible] every day to run the company more efficiently, while I'm hearing to our commitments to safety, reliability and community stewardship. Turning to slide 16, we remain committed to our strong balance sheet and investment grade credit ratings. And to that end since our last earnings call S&P has placed our ratings for ExGen index one corporate on credit watch positive, recognizing the improvements in overall strength of our balance sheet. Turning to the metrics, our consolidating corporate credit metrics remain above our target ranges and meaningfully above S&P thresholds. We are forecasting ExGen's leverage to be 2.5 times debt-to-EBITDA at year-end 2018 which is below our long term target of 3.0 times. On a recourse debt basis, we are at 2.0 times, which is well below our target range. We will continue to manage our balance sheet at ExGen over time for the 3.0 times debt-to-EBITDA level, so look for us to focus on debt reduction at both the HoldCo and GenCo. I will now turn the call back to Chris. Thank you.
Chris Crane: Thanks, Joe. Turning to slide 17, as we have shown you, we have a strong quarter financially and operationally. We continue to get stronger on both fronts. This is due to the hard work and dedication of all of our employees every day. We also had important wins and of course to preserve the ZEC programs, and are finding ways to operate more efficiently providing incremental cost savings as discussed. Our value proposition remains unchanged. We're focused on growing our utilities starting at 6% to 8% EPS growth through 2021. We continue to use free cash flow from the GenCo up on the incremental equity needs at the utilities, pay down debt over the next four years at the GenCo and HoldCo and funds part of the faster dividend growth rate. We will stay focused on optimizing value at the ExGen by seeking fair compensation for our carbon free generation fleet, supporting proper price formation in PJM and resiliency efforts at FERC, and supporting capacity market reforms that will allow states to continue to protect citizens from carbon in air pollution, while benefiting from regional markets. We will close uneconomic and sell assets were it does not make sense to accelerate our debt reduction plans, and maximize value to generation to the load matching strategies We continue to sustain strong investment-grade credit metrics and grow our dividend consistently at 5% through 2020. Operator, now we can take it -- open to the call up for questions. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon from Evercore. Greg, your line is now open.
Greg Gordon: Thanks. Good morning guys, couple of questions.
Chris Crane: Good morning.
Greg Gordon: First, on the quarter, everything seems really good on the utility side and the underlying operations at the GenCo look decent too, but it was a little squishy around some of those operational issues. Can you just talk us through that and get us comfortable that they're sort of temporal and not structural?
Chris Crane: Are you talking about the operational issues around the GenCo in the power…
Greg Gordon: Yes, and Texas, the interruption in Massachusetts, the higher FDR costs. I just want to make sure we can be comfortable that they're not going to sort of run out into the future and impact your ability to get your numbers?
Chris Crane: Let me start out with the Texas assets. So, I'll let Joe fill in on the rest of it. Those GE 7HA.200, these were the first serial numbers one and two. We were aware as GE was that there was some difficulty with the first stage blades. We had approximated a run period that we could operate the assets before putting in the fix. The fix was already underway and then designed. GE did give us very strong warranties on those assets, and responded very well on the first failure on the one CT at Colorado Bend. We proactively shut the other three CTs down, replace them with the new design, had them back up and running, and as I said, we expect -- we're in the roll out phase now and the start-up phase of the fourth unit, and we feel confident in the design. GE has put us in inspection program together, that will be borescoping after so many hours of operation. They've responded well, the solid engineering confirmed by independent assessments, so we feel that that is behind us. And we'll be able to continue those assets to operate at incredibly high capacity factors and efficiencies going forward. On the FDRs and the other issues, I'll let Joe cover it.
Joe Nigro: Yes. So Greg, I think first thing is as Chris mentioned the generation issues drove some of the underperformance at Exgen. In addition to that when you looked at how prices in Texas, at the end of June and where they realized for the quarter, there was an impact with the difference there. As you know, the spot market prices were lower than when we walked into the quarter. On the transmission side, the costs were associated with orders for 494 at FERC, and that had a negative impact. So from our lens when you talk about the generation performance both at Mystic and at Ercot, those are one-time occurrences similarly on the transmission side. The favorability was driven on the realized liquid decommissioning trust gains. So I think when you look at it from our lens, you see these one-time items that are driving the overall results.
Greg Gordon: Great. Thanks. And one follow-up on Exgen and then one more if you let me, looking at the cost cuts, it's really quite an impressive, incremental change, you've got the costs declining from $4.65 billion to $4.175 billion in 2020 and a little bit more in 2021, $450 million savings, but that gross margins declined by $700 million. And so, skeptical investors look at this and say, "Well, you guys are doing Yeoman's job here, right-sizing the cost structure, but earnings aren't getting better." I would argue that cost cuts are permanent than -- and these back-wardated [ph] power prices are hopefully temporary, but can you give us some confidence that there's positive operating leverage here as we move through time and that these lower commodity prices and capacity prices are not structural?
Chris Crane: We talked about this before that we've lacked liquidity in the out years. It's a softer market. Our fundamentals still tell us that this back-wardated curve is not what we'll see as the prompt years come in. And so, we're managing the book in that manner maintaining as much margin open and using cross commodity hedges to be able to manage that. We will constantly look at driving efficiencies. You can't have a company and operate with any aspect or entity within the company being inefficient. So, driving efficiencies has multiple benefits, but one of them is a reduction in expense, and we'll continue to focus on that as we serve the customer. As far as the market issues, Jim or Joe, do you want to cover any more on that?
Jim McHugh: Yes. I think the only one I would add about the backwardation of the curve is, with the next couple of years showing 25 and 24 deal like in liquidity we're seeing net retirements of new builds over the next year between 20 and 23 that would lead us to believe that backwardation won't really subside. We've seen stock prices and I have even in some of the lowest delivered fuel price years cleared north of $26, $27. So you know the backwardation to your point is seems temporal great.
Greg Gordon: Okay. And then final question is you know given that the balance sheet is so strong and that the rating agencies are finally coming around to considering higher credit ratings how much balance sheet capacity does that create and/or does it give you more latitude to have a more aggressive risk management policy and take hedge less and take more of your power into the spot and therefore try to get those better prices?
Joe Nigro: Greg, it's Joe. The short answer is with that balance sheet capacity we can't be more aggressive. And as I mentioned in my remarks when you look at how far behind we are a ratable plan and when you overlay the fact that we're using gas as a proxy for power we are carrying a very long opening power position in 2019 and 2020, and when we're able to do that think given the strength of the balance sheet that we have. We continue to challenge ourselves in this regard as well. And as Jim mentioned on our use of power, we're going to continue to be constructive in the way we manage the portfolio relative to what we think fair value is in the out years and that leverage on the balance sheet allows us to do that. 
Greg Gordon: Thank you, guys.
Joe Nigro: Thanks, Greg.
Operator: Thank you, Greg. Your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Julien, your line is now open.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning, everyone.
Chris Crane: Good morning. How are you doing?
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Good, excellent. So I wanted to follow a little bit up on the utility activities, obviously good progress of THI, and again but I wanted to elaborate a little bit further on this. Obviously the cost reductions of say $50ish million accrued in the utilities. How does that play out in terms of again increasing your ROE, right, I gather the bulk of that would be moving back to customers over time, although clearly you're under earning relative to authorized level still. And then in tandem with that question if you could elaborate a little more on the sort of initial utility CapEx planning, certainly there is growing discussion of legislation in Illinois as well as a litany of other smaller programs. I think you've already alluded to a little bit elsewhere across your utility system?
Chris Crane: Yes, I'll let Anne take that.
Anne Pramaggiore: Sure. Good morning, Julien. Yes, so a couple of responses to your questions. As we think about moving forward, obviously we're going to blend $50 million into the LRP over time, and it's not sitting with there right now, but we'll look at that as we do the next LRP iteration. And certainly our focus on O&M is to be flat-to-declining at the utilities and that that's the goal as we move forward to manage that side of the equation. As we think about what we're doing on ROEs and sort of developing that at the PHI utilities and the other utilities, you know the first thing we're doing is to looking at how -- we're filing annually how do we reduce lag? What are the ways is we file it annually, we've got to stay our provision at DPL until 2020, but with the rest of the utilities we'll be filing annually. We're looking at other mechanisms to reduce lag riders. We've got the stride rider in Maryland, disk rider in Delaware and the IIT rider in New Jersey that we're looking to place about $358 million of capital investment in right now Interim rates at New Jersey is helping us to close that lag gap, and we're looking at multiyear rate plan in DC. We've been invited to make that filing, and we'll be doing that shortly. So we've just got an outright provision at PECO authority for the commission to look at that. So that's something we'll be looking at going forward.  So those are all the ways we're looking to close in on that ROE number. Obviously, we're looking at lags are biggest sort of currency allowed GAAP that also looking at other disallowances too, but really trying to take enough on the lag. So that's how we're thinking about on the ROE going forward. On the capital side, the question that you asked, we've got - we look at $5 billion a year, a little bit plus north of that going forward for the foreseeable future.  We have continuing modernization work at the utilities. PECO afford 12-kV conversions were closer work, at ComEd, we've got the 00:36:31 voltage optimization work that's about $500 million right there. BG&E's got big DaaS investment, and PHI's got a lot of material condition work 00:36:41 refurbishments, substation rebuilds, and that sort of things. We've got $1.5 billion in our gas program over the next LRP period. We've got close to a $1 billion in security programs across the utilities over the LRP. So there's a lot of work to do. We always, always book-ended with questions of affordability, and that's why we stay tight on O&M. And we look at energy efficiency programs to give customers the ability to reduce usage and manage those more tightly. So we're always looking at the affordability side of it and our utilities fit pretty nicely, when you look at the national average on a percentage of income or percentage of proportion of build to income. We're pretty good, we're below the national average on four and we're right at the national average on the other two builds. 
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. A quick clarification as a follow up here in PJM, I know I appreciate your comments at the outside. Just timing related, how do you see this going down with respect to a, getting an approval out of FERC, but then b, actually implementing the MOPR just real quickly if you can?
Kathleen Barrón: Hi, Julien, it's Kathleen. I can take that question. As you know, the five comments are going into FERC on November 6 with the expectation that the commission would address the paper hearing sometime in the January timeframe. I think the commission is well aware that the market is looking for guidance. As Chris said on what the rules are going to be going forward and importantly the states need to know what changes they need to make to their clean energy policies to accommodate the new rules coming out of FERC. So we will look to them to provide that guidance in the January timeframe. As you know, we have to leave the auction until August to give states sometime to react, not just your question was specific to MOPR, but important for us is the ability of states to carve out the [indiscernible] they wish to support and to procure them directly to state led procurement that is going to be an important change that we're looking for FERC to make in the next order based on the record in front of them as overwhelming amount of support from all supporters of the stakeholder community and the states. To put that change into the tariff and to give states options going forward to continue to support the clean generation that will help them achieve their carbon reduction goals.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: So you don't see an issue with respect to getting clarity out of the states sometime?
Kathleen Barrón: Obviously the states have different structures that will need to examine and obviously the states have different structures, that they'll need to examine and some may be able to use existing structure, some may need to adopt new structures, including through legislation. So there will be a in the states where there is a need for legislation a premium on moving quickly. Now that being said, I think it's also incumbent our effort to take that into account and to make sure that they have adequate time before the rules change in the tariff.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, Julien. Your next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Steve your line is now open.
Steve Fleishman: Thank you. I will actually just ask one question. The PGM from a standpoint of not obviously you have different stakeholders in relative here your states customers, investors et cetera. Just from an investor standpoint and not everyone else, do you see the changes as proposed or as you would like to see them being kind of good for shareholders, neutral how should we think of it, just from an investor standpoint?
Chris Crane: No, we definitely see this as a positive to create clarity and a more rewarding market going forward. We've lacked the clarity, we've [indiscernible] the times on programs, I think this is where we'll be able to create clarity, capital allotment will allocation will be much clear on what we're - where we'll be putting capital, what units will be operating, and what units won't be operating. So, but we see this as definitely a benefit to the markets which will be a benefit to the consumer, which will be a benefit to the shareholder. 
Steve Fleishman: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, Steve. Your next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein from Credit Suisse. Michael, your line is now open.
Michael Weinstein: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions.
Chris Crane: Hey, Michael.
Michael Weinstein: Hey, two quick questions. The first one is do you think that the uncertainty surrounding FERC and surrounding new rules for capacity and energy taking also some uncertainty is delaying a new build or new start construction plans, if this is going to have an effect on tightening the market going over the next year or two. And my second question, I'll just ask it right now is a public service enterprise group just announced that they're pulling out of the retail business. Is this a potential opportunity for Constellation? 
Chris Crane: First question, new builds are driven based off of market needs in economics and unless we get the economics to support new asset entry, you will get to see what we've seen in the last couple of years, the decline then we have to see what comes out of the resiliency review on how the market values different sources from fixed view. So, there will be an evolution before we'll see a real opening or a market response to the demand need for assets or investments to be made to come in. It's basic economics right now. The market is barely supporting the assets that are operating today. So, why would you invest into new assets when you are not going to get a recovery or return on your capital? Just a second you can…
Michael Weinstein: Okay, understood.
Chris Crane: -- into new assets when you are not going to get a recovery or return on your capital. 
Michael Weinstein: Okay.
Jim McHugh: Hi, Michael, it's Jim here. I can speak to that question. I think you know with the announcements of folks leaving or coming into the retail market, we're always on top of that and looking for opportunities to look for value and acquire books of business. In this case, I think you know if you think it's noted, that they're going to supply their contracts as they roll off. We'll obviously there to serve customers as the number one C&I customer and the number two resi customer in the country, so a lot for the business and they will alone. I think for us, we have that scale, we've developed that scale over the years through acquisitions and in organic growth and our platform is very capable of acquiring new customers and retaining existing customers pretty easily. We've been having a lot of success also just finding new products and solutions for customers in both the residential space and C&I space, so we'll keep taking advantage of those opportunities that are in front of us. 
Michael Weinstein: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you, Michael. Your next question comes from the line as Jonathan Arnold from Deutsche Bank. Jonathan, your line is now open. 
Jonathan Arnold: Good morning, guys.
Chris Crane: Hi, Jon.
Jonathan Arnold: Just to pick up on the discussion around the state legislation and potentially not leading legislation, and Kathleen I heard your comments that you know there could be different answers depending on which state you're talking about. But is it fair to say, the way you said today that you think Illinois would have to legislate and then I'm curious, what you think about the state of play in New Jersey?
Kathleen Barrón: You're correct, Jonathan. I agree with your assessment in Illinois, there will be a need for legislation legislation to adjust those changes in rules. And I think a positive for us is that we are seeing not just here but across the country our growing sentiment among environmental groups and policymakers that the fastest and cheapest path to de-carbonizing is a policy that uses all zero carbon resources. And so to the extent states want to act to increase their clean energy ambition. We would be expected -- we would expect that all assets including ours would be able to participate in that type of policy as FERC for allowing the states to go ahead and procure a clean capacity directly allows them to do so in a way that's going to be able to keep costs down per customers and achieve clean energy goals at the same time. So we would look to that kind of structure to the extent you know the FERC puts this car down in the tariff you know in Illinois. And here in New Jersey given the way that the state law is written there and the authority at that DPU level to do the capacity procurement through the existing BGS structure, there would not need - there would not be a need for a incremental legislation to allow that state's procurement of that to flow through the BGS. So that's why I said I think the answer is different depending on which jurisdiction you're in.
Jonathan Arnold: Okay, great. I was just waiting to see if you provide that on the individual states. So thank you. Could I just ask one quick follow-up on the cost savings, you've obviously laid out how you expect that to be timed the Q3 2018 cost reductions? Can you remind us how much of the $250 million you've announced last year was flowing into Exgen and maybe what the sort of sequencing is there in terms of how those ramp up as we're trying to unravel the numbers I guess is slide 15.
Chris Crane: Yes, that is in a numbers. I think we're looking for the page now Joe's got it.
Joe Nigro: The 250 last year all of it is flowing into ExGen, the reductions were taken at ExGen across the platform nuclear constellation in our…
Jonathan Arnold: And the timing, Joe, is it kind of across the period until 2020 or most of it going to already there in… 
Joe Nigro: 2019, you'll get to run rate year.
Jonathan Arnold: Okay. All right. Thanks for that.
Operator: Thank you, Jonathan. That concludes the question and answer session of today's webcast. I'll hand the call over back to Mr. Chris Crane, CEO of Exelon Corporation.
Chris Crane: Thanks again everybody for joining. Thanks for the questions. Hopefully, we covered everything. Any other concerns, please get a hold of IR or myself, and we'd be glad to continue to discuss them, but thanks to the team. All the 34,000 plus employees at Exelon for delivering another strong quarter and talk to you soon. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And that concludes today's webcast. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning and welcome to Exelon 2018 Second Quarter Earnings Call. My name is Nora and I will be facilitating the audio portion of today's interactive broadcast. This event also features streaming audio which allows you to listen to the show through your PC speakers. And for those of you on the stream, please take note of the option available in your event console. At this time, I'd like turn the show over to Dan Eggers, Exelon's Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Daniel L. Eggers - Exelon Corp.: Thank you, Nora. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our second quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Leading the call today are Chris Crane, Exelon's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Joe Nigro, Exelon's Chief Financial Officer. They're joined by other members of Exelon's senior management team who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. We issued our earnings release this morning along with the presentation, both of which can be found in the Investor Relations section on Exelon's website. The earnings release and other matters which we'll discuss during today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today's material and comments made during this call. Please refer to today's 8-K and Exelon's other SEC filings for discussions of risk factors and factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecast and expectations. Today's presentation also includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the information contained in the Appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for reconciliations between the non-GAAP measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures. We scheduled 45 minutes for today's call. I'll now turn the call over to Chris Crane, Exelon's CEO.
Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.: Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us today. We understand it's a busy earnings release period. So thanks for being with us. Starting on slide 5, we're pleased to deliver another great quarter. We achieved strong financial results while continuing to enhance our operational performance and make meaningful gains at our utilities on both the regulatory side and the legislative fronts. Taken together these advances will support our continued strategy to invest in infrastructure, in technology at our utilities delivering better service for our customers. For the quarter, on a GAAP basis, we earned $0.56 per share versus $0.10 last year. On a non-GAAP basis, we earned $0.71 per share versus $0.56 last year, which is above the midpoint of our $0.55 to $0.65 per share in the guidance range and puts us in a strong footing for the year. Turning to slide 6, at the utilities, we continue to execute at top quartile levels across key customer satisfaction and operating metrics. The investments we are making are paying off in improving reliability, strong customer satisfaction, which in turn strengthens our relationships with our regulators. All of our utilities are achieving top decile performance in KD, which measures the average speed, which we are able to restore power when outages occur. We are also delivering leading performance across the utilities on customer service metrics as we share best practices and give customers more tools to connect with the utilities when they need service. Safety still remains our highest priority and the targeted programs implemented last quarter are driving improved results. At ExGen, nuclear generation output was 39 terawatt hours with a capacity factor of 93.2%. We had 41 fewer outage days compared to last year. Our gas and hydro fleet continue to perform very well with economic dispatch match rate of 97.8%. Turning to slide 7, I'm happy to report that the tax savings from our FERC regulated transmission assets will benefit our customers by an additional $175 million, adding these benefits to the $500 million of savings from our distribution operations that we discussed on last call. Our 10 million utility customers will realize over $675,000 of an annual benefit from tax reform. We're pleased that our constructive relationships with our state regulators in FERC allow us to pass these benefits back to our customers in a very timely fashion. Flipping over to slide 8, in June, Delaware and Pennsylvania both passed important legislation that reflect our utility priorities in the present and for the future supporting infrastructure investment and positioning for the utility of the future, respectively. In Delaware, state regulators passed the Distribution System Investment Charge. This will support needed infrastructure investment to enhance the system improve service to our customers. It will provide a mechanism for a more consistent and gradual rate increase for our customers, while also allowing for a more timely recovery on our infrastructure investments. Delmarva Power, Delaware plans to make its first filing in the fourth quarter with new rates effective by the first quarter of 2019. In Pennsylvania, Governor Wolf signed legislation authorizing the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission to review and approve alternate rate mechanisms that will better position PECO to make investments in the utility of the future. The forward-looking regulatory design options in the legislation include a decoupling mechanism, formula rates, multi-year rate plans and performance-based rates. Both of these laws will help to ensure that our utilities can deploy much needed capital to support reliability and performance of the grid for our customers, while also decreasing the frequency of traditional rate cases. I want to especially thank the broad group of stakeholders in both Delaware and Pennsylvania for the support of these laws. We look forward to finding common ground across all our jurisdictions, as we focus on improving customer service and investing in the utility of the future. Slide 9, turning to the ZEC programs, in both Illinois and New York, we are awaiting final decision from the Federal Appeals Court. We are pleased with the Solicitor General's brief filed in the Illinois case in the Seventh Circuit, which agreed that the states have the authority to enact the ZEC programs. We remain confident in our legal position in both the cases, and continue to collect the ZEC revenues as they are being adjudicated. In New Jersey, following Governor Murphy's signature, the Board of Public Utilities is beginning to implement the ZEC program there, which we expect to take effect around the end of the first quarter 2019. On the Federal Energy policy front, FERC issued an order on PJM two capacity market mitigation proposals. The order rejected the two-stage capacity re-pricing of multiple RECs proposal submitted by PJM and it also determined that the existing tariff is unjust and unreasonable. Instead FERC established a new proceeding to introduce a two part proposal. The first proposal is to expand the current MOPR to ensure that most if not all plants that receive out-of-market payments will be subject to a minimum offer requirement. The second proposal, however, would allow the plants receiving out-of-market payments to avoid the MOPR and instead be withdrawn from the market along with the commensurate amount of load. This asset specific FRR can be implemented by the states to align with the state's environmental policies. FERC has set a schedule to allowing 60 days for comments, 30 days for replies, and a goal of reaching the final decision by January 4. We disagree that the MOPR is necessary. We are encouraged that FERC has now said that all assets receiving out-of-market payments should be treated the same. The implementation details will matter but we believe that the partial FRR design could allow states to advance their energy policy goals, which we think is critical to ensure the needed reduction in carbon emissions. With respect to PJMs work on price formation, we continue to look forward for a decision from FERC on the fast start by September and PJM has committed to implement the rule changes in a timely fashion after the FERC order, including reengaging stakeholders on a full integral relaxation. PJM continues to work through reforms to which storage pricing rules included those related to reserves in the operating reserves demand curve pursuant to the deadlines it had set for those rule changes. Finally on resiliency, PJM has taken the input and the assumptions and the scenarios that it needs to model in order to assess fuel security of its generation fleet. This will allow PJM to move forward on evaluating potential changes to market design to ensure that it is properly valuing the fuel security, while it awaits further direction from FERC in the open resilience docket. We see all these changes as essential to preserve the effective competitive market in PJM and we applaud the ongoing efforts to design and implement these changes. Now, I'll turn it over to Joe and he can walk through some of the numbers.
Joseph Nigro - Exelon Corp.: Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Turning to slide 10, we had a strong quarter financially, delivering adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings of $0.71 per share which is above the $0.56 per share we earned in the second quarter of 2017 as well as our guidance range of $0.55 to $0.65 per share. Exelon's utilities less Holding Company expenses delivered a combined $0.37 per share. Compared to our plan, the utility results were better on higher distribution revenue from the approval of the Pepco Maryland settlement, a transmission revenue true-up at BG&E and favorable weather impacts at PECO. Generation earned $0.34 per share in the second quarter, which was also better than planned. Upside came from realized gains from our nuclear decommissioning trust. Our nuclear plants had another strong quarter with fewer outage days compared to both last year and what was budgeted for this year. And we benefited from favorable market conditions including FTR settlements in PJM. These were partially offset by higher allocated transmission costs. We are reaffirming our full year guidance range of $2.90 to $3.20 per share, which you can see on slide 19. We expect to deliver operating earnings of $0.80 to $0.90 per share in the third quarter compared with $0.85 last year. Turning to slide 11, the $0.71 per share in the second quarter of this year was $0.15 per share higher than the second quarter of 2017. Our utility earnings were collectively up $0.04 per share compared to last year, driven primarily by higher rate base and mill rates associated with completed rate cases. Generation earnings were up $0.12 per share compared with last year benefiting from fewer planned and unplanned nuclear outage days, contributions from the Illinois ZEC program and higher realized nuclear decommissioning trust gains partially offset by lower power price realizations. Moving to slide 12, our utilities continued to execute financially as we look at our trailing 12-month earned ROEs. Starting with PHI, we made modest gains at each utility as we continue to deliver improved operational and financial performance since the merger. Pepco's higher earnings reflect the distribution rate cases from last fall and the recent Pepco Maryland settlement that took effect on June 1, 2018. Looking to next quarter, Pepco's earned returns should benefit from a full quarter of the Maryland settlement reached in April and a partial quarter benefit from the pending DC settlement. Delmarva's earned ROEs now include the benefits of interim rates in Delaware that took effect in March 2018, and at Atlantic City Electric we saw higher earnings from the ACE settlement effective October 2017, which was largely offset with higher O&M and depreciation expense. We expect to see ROE improvement with full flow through of the October 2017 settlement. For all of the PHI utilities, trailing 12 month ROEs in the fourth quarter should show additional uplift as the FAS 109 changes from the fourth quarter of 2017 drop out of the calculation. For the legacy Exelon utilities, our earned ROEs remained over 10%, lifting the consolidated utilities platform to nearly 9.5% including PHI. We are happy with our overall utility performance but still see room for improvement at PHI as the better operating performance translates into higher earned returns. And as we have said before, we are confident in our ability to deliver on our plan and still expect earned ROEs in 2019 to be in the 9% to 10% range across the utilities. Turing to slide 13, we remain busy on the regulatory front. On the last call, we discussed settlement arrangements in April at both Pepco DC and Pepco Maryland, providing revenue decreases of $24.1 million and $15 million respectively after reflecting tax savings benefits for customers. On May 31, the Maryland PSC approved the settlement for Pepco Maryland with rates effective on June 1. For Pepco DC, the Commission is expected to approve the settlement in the third quarter with rates effective shortly thereafter. We are also able to reach a settlement in our Delmarva, Delaware electric distribution case on June 27, 2018 making it the second consecutive electric case we have settled in recent history. The case will provide a $7 million revenue reduction inclusive of tax benefits. We expect a final order in the third quarter. As Chris noted earlier, Delmarva Power, Delaware expects to make its first filing under the Distribution System Investment Charge tracker in the fourth quarter of 2018, with the new charge appearing on customer bills by the first quarter of 2019. We also have a number of rate cases still in play. On June 8th, BG&E filed for a $63 million increase to its gas revenues and a $22 million STRIDE surcharge reset with an order expected in January 2019. BGE's continued investments in STRIDE and gas systems safety and reliability programs are driving the need for this requested increase. In Delaware, we have an outstanding gas distribution rate case at Delmarva that is scheduled for completion in the fourth quarter. In Pennsylvania, PECO filed for an electric distribution base rate case in March for the first time in three years. We expect to receive an order in the second half of this year. Finally, on April 16th, we filed for rate updates at ComEd as part of the standard annual formula process. We expect to receive an order in the fourth quarter. We appreciate the hard work of our utilities and regulatory teams. Our investment is focused on improving system reliability and the customer experience are having positive benefits in the communities we serve. By delivering on a regulatory strategy, we're able to make these investments, while also earning a fair and timely return on the capital being deployed. More details on the rate cases and their schedules can be found on slides 27 through 33 in the Appendix. Turning to slide 14 and continuing on the topic of capital investment at our utilities, we invested $1.3 billion of capital at the utilities during the second quarter and are at $2.6 billion year-to-date. We remain on track to meet our $5.5 billion capital budget for 2018. Today, I would like to highlight two additional projects that are part of our overall budget and offer real benefits to our customers and communities. The first is PECO's gas main and service replacement program. The project will replace nearly 1,800 miles of gas mains and service lines of which 520 miles has already been completed. We continue to work with the state to accelerate the implementations having shortened the replacement cycle at the start of the program from 30 years to 20 years, today. These efforts will reduce risk on the distribution system by replacing aged materials, which we believe is good for our customers. The second project relates to BGE's investments in Trade Point Atlantic or TPA. Over the next five years BGE will invest $150 million in transmission and distribution infrastructure including construction of a 93 megawatt substation. These investments will support the new 3,100 acre commercial industrial TPA development in Baltimore County, which is projected to generate 17,000 permanent jobs, plus an additional 21,000 during construction. This project is another example of our efforts to continuously work with our states to identify and support development efforts that drive economic growth in our service territories. Turning to slide 15, it provides our gross margin update for ExGen. This quarter we have included the New Jersey ZEC revenue in our 2019 and 2020 disclosures for the first time. Relative to our last update, we saw some movement within the buckets. Our total gross margin in each year is unchanged from our last update with the exception of an additional $50 million in both 2019 and 2020 associated with the New Jersey ZEC revenue. For 2018, open gross margin was up $100 million primarily due to higher NI Hub and PJM West Hub prices, offset by weakening ERCOT spark spreads and our hedges. We had a strong quarter in new business execution creating $200 million of Power New Business in our retail and wholesale channels as we capitalized on ERCOT volatility. In 2019 and 2020, total gross margins are up $50 million in each year with the New Jersey ZEC revenue, which shows up in the capacity and ZEC line. Open gross margin is up $100 million in 2019 due to higher prices in New York Zone A and PJM West Hub. Open gross margin is flat in 2020. We also executed $50 million of Power New Business in 2019 and 2020. We ended the quarter basically in line with our ratable hedging program in 2018 and 10% to 13% behind ratable in 2019 and 6% to 9% behind ratable in 2020 when considering cross commodity hedges where we have increased our concentration. We remain comfortable being more open when we look at the market fundamentals compared to forward prices particularly at NI Hub. Turning to slide 16, we remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and our efforts on this front have been noticed with Fitch placing Exelon, PECO, and BG&E all on positive outlook in June. Our consolidated corporate credit metrics remain above our target ranges and meaningfully above S&P thresholds. We are forecasting ExGen's leverage to be 2.6 times debt-to-EBITDA at year-end 2018, which is below our long-term target of 3.0 times. On a recourse debt basis, we are at 2.1 times, which is well below our target. We will continue to manage our balance sheet at ExGen over time to the 3.0 debt-to-EBITDA level. So look for us to focus on debt reduction at both HoldCo and GenCo. I will now turn the call back to Chris. Thank you.
Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.: Thanks, Joe. Turning to slide 17, again, we had a strong financial quarter and operationally that is a testament to the hard work and dedication of our employees. Our financial footing and sounding continues to gain momentum. Here again, I'll restate our proposition value. We continue to focus on growing our utilities targeting 7.4% rate base growth and 6% to 8% EPS growth through 2021. We continue to use free cash from the GenCo to fund incremental equity needs at the utilities, pay down debt over the next four years at ExGen and the HoldCo and fund part of the faster dividend growth. We continue to focus on optimizing value for the ExGen business by seeking fair compensation for our carbon free generation fleet, supporting proper price formation in PJM and resiliency initiatives at FERC and working to develop capacity market reforms at PJM pursuant to the recent FRR order. We continue to close uneconomic plants and sell assets where it makes sense to accelerate our debt reduction plans and maximize value through the gentle load matching. We continue to sustain strong investment-grade credit metrics, as Joe pointed out, in our growth driven consistently at 5% through 2020. With that operator, we can now open it up for questions.
Operator: Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Ali of SunTrust. Your line is open.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning.
Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.: Good morning, Ali.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Good morning. The first question on the PHI utilities, what's the aspiration there? I mean, are those utilities and the way the system is set up, are they set up that they can ultimately earn their authorized ROE or will there be a permanent lag in the system and when do you think you will be at the maximum in terms of your earned versus allowed ROE (24:22)?
Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.: So there is a lag component at a couple of the PHI utilities now that we're working on. We've talked about ACE. We think we have the right legislative package to help that reduce that in Delaware and we're also working on different proceedings at Pepco Maryland and Pepco DC. We project it to be within the 9.5% range by the end of 2019. We're on track to do that. We have the developed activities that are helping. We also have the efficiency programs we're putting in place. So, I think we're well on plan. We recognize the legacy issues that were happening around that and are having constructive dialogue with our legislators as we've done in Delaware, our regulators, as we're doing with the filing in New Jersey and we'll continue to focus on that.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And then Chris to the extent that Forex proposal for PJM and the FRR aspect of it does become law and moves forward. How do you look at that relative to your portfolio and what that means for Exelon?
Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.: Well, you can imagine. I'm going to let Kathleen Barrón cover that. But, as you can imagine, there's a lot of evaluation that we have to do right now to really choose the path that benefits our customers and our fleets. So, Kathleen?
Kathleen L. Barrón - Exelon Corp.: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Ali. I think what we're facing here is markets that because they're not pricing pollution are making emitting resources look less expensive and they're pushing out clean resources, including ours, as you know, 10.6 gigawatts of uncleared nuclear in the last auction. I think what FERC is saying in this order is that rather than letting RPM continue to push those units out, they're giving safety opportunity to pull them in and instead of paying PJM to support units that perhaps they don't want to support they can directly pay those assets. And so, as Chris said in the opening of the call, implementation details certainly matter. But we think this is an extremely constructive approach to allowing states to choose the resources, the clean resources that they need to continue to keep running to achieve the our goals of reducing carbon and air pollution for their citizens.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And last question with regards to the pending litigation in New York and Illinois, any marker we should be keeping an eye on to give us some framework of when the decision might come from either of those states?
Kathleen L. Barrón - Exelon Corp.: Unfortunately, we have no way to know exactly when those orders will issue but the cases have been fully briefed and we expect them to issue any time. There is nothing that we know that's holding them up.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Greg from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI: Hey, good morning. I'm happy we're on a first name basis now.
Daniel L. Eggers - Exelon Corp.: Thank you, Greg.
Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI: Joe, just a question for you with regard to the quarter. I mean, obviously the numbers were quite robust, but there was $0.05 of positive earnings from NDT. I mean that's not necessarily – I know that that moves around every quarter, but I wouldn't consider that necessarily the highest quality earnings. But even if you exclude that, you were still ahead of your prior guidance range. So can you just walk us through what you think sort of a clean basis and was that still in excess of your expectations?
Joseph Nigro - Exelon Corp.: Yeah. If you subtract the $0.05 for NDT, Greg, what I would say is, when you look at it overall, the midpoint of our range was $0.60. We obviously earned $0.71 on an operating basis. A little more than 50% of that was coming from the utilities. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, it is driven by three things: the transmission settlement at BG&E, the yearly implementation of the rate settlement at Pepco Maryland, and as well as stable weather at PECO were the big drivers there. And then the balance was GenCo and NDT was a big piece of that but we also had favorable market conditions related to the FDR option during the quarter. Our Generation performance was stellar, and then it was offset by some transmission costs. So you could see even subtracting out the NDTs, the performance was very strong across the operating businesses.
Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI: Right. And I heard you indicate that you're – and show that you're running well below your debt to EBITDA target and thus you can address that by using your cash to – in addition to funding rate-based growth, dividend, not just think just think about paying down ExGen debt, but also working down parent debt. But there's a bigger issue here, which is that you know the FFO to debt targets that the rating agencies are holding you to seem excessively high relative to the declining risk profile of the company. What has to happen to evolve the conversation with the rating agencies to get a lower threshold? And is it really dependent on getting more certainty on capacity and energy market reforms at this point since you've shown demonstrably that you're one of the best operators on the utility side of the house in the country?
Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.: Yes. So Greg, we have been and will continue to have dialogue with all the rating agencies. You heard Joe's conversation on Fitch. We've had a good dialogue with S&P. They understand our strategy, they're wanting to see it consistently implemented. They recognize that it is being consistently implemented. I think you know a couple of milestones coming through with the final approval from the Appellate Court on the ZECs, making that revenue look much more like regulated revenue, continuing to follow our path on debt reduction, which part of that is building balance sheet space, de-risking, but also part of it is liability matching with the nuclear assets and their life into the 30s and 40s. So we just have to continue to execute on our plan. We're having very positive dialogue. We appreciate the Fitch positive. We look forward to hearing from the others and hopefully shortly that they're seeing it and we'll be able to talk about not only moving thresholds, but potentially a more positive rating.
Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI: Okay. My last question you may have already demonstrably answered previously, but if in fact, you're given – you and the states are given the option of pursuing an FRR type structure for plants that are deemed to be important in those regions. Does the legislation that you currently have in Illinois and New Jersey for instance create the flexibility to do that or would you need to go back to your legislators and engage them in a restructuring of that legislation to give them the flexibility they would need to bring those assets out of the capacity market and properly compensate them?
Kathleen L. Barrón - Exelon Corp.: Hey, Greg. It's Kathleen. We're currently looking at existing legislative authority in all of our states. And so I think it's going to depend on the jurisdiction. And it's also going to depend on what FERC's order ultimately says about what authority states will be to exercise in order to take advantage of this option. So I think, it's going to differ depending on the state. But we're currently evaluating the best path forward in each of the states that have clean energy targets that we think this order will help them meet.
Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI: Okay. Thank you all. Have a great day.
Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.: Thanks, Greg.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC: Hi. Good morning. Hey, Chris.
Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.: Hi.
Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC: Just I guess, you know it's hard to kind of interpret a lot of these FERC proposals in different directions. You also had the Mystic decision. And so, maybe you can just give a broader perspective of what they're trying to achieve here and just what could change versus this initial proposal before we hear kind of I guess a final structure by early next year?
Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.: Yeah. So the fight – the disagreement within the stakeholders is around the supplemental income that is being received for the social benefit of carbon reduction within our states. We lack a federal policy as you know on carbon, although the conversation continues and that would be the ultimate fix. That would really level the playing field and allow the states to skip (34:15) support of federal policy. Short of that, the states have deemed – the majority of states that we operate in that they want to preserve the low carbon output that they have. They understand that 60% of the power in the State of Illinois is carbon-free, 90% of that is nuclear. We start shutting down nuclear plants like you look at the FE announcement, every penny that's been spent in PJM and outside of PJM on REX to achieve a lower carbon output would be wiped out. It's like we threw the money away. So you've got a very passionate belief within some of our states that they want to keep these assets. PJM has been unable under the current tariffs to be able to separate and support at this point the environmental needs of their stakeholders. So what this allows from FERC is a positive move to say if the administration and the legislation in New Jersey wants to preserve a low carbon future for its state and for its citizens. It allows Illinois to do the same thing. If New York wanted to look at something, it could do something for New York. So I think, this is finally setting the final decision on how we manage these assets that may be out of the capacity revenue stream, not clearing, but the state wants to keep them. We had Secretary Perry at the FitzPatrick Plant yesterday with Congressman Katko and it was very positive. I mean we are gaining momentum, but not only in his opening comments, in the press conference and with our tour in discussion with local officials, is he concerned about the economic benefits of the plant. He's concerned about the reliability and the resiliency on the fuel diversity and he's also commented on their capabilities for low carbon. So you've seen us go back and forth between ZECs and between other programs to try to save. We've seen the arguments from other stakeholders against it and I think this gives us a path to finally put it to bed.
Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC: Okay. That's helpful. And just one other question on it, if you were to get into kind of an FRR structure like, do you have any sense on like how long that would be i.e., you know if that's kind of a form of reregulation of the plant, is that for good, is that for you know a set amount of time like the ZECs are?
Kathleen L. Barrón - Exelon Corp.: Yeah. Steve, I'll jump in on that, that's certainly one of the implementation details that will be worked out through the FERC docket, but it's important to know we're not talking about reload (37:27) regulation, we're talking about an alternative way to pay the units for capacity, and let the states choose which units they'd like to pay for capacity as opposed to letting RPM select the assets. So it's a step towards the future that Chris identified, that we anticipate will be short-term. The current FRR structure as you know allows units or zones to step out of RPM for a five year period with the option to come back in. And ultimately if we get this to the longer term carbon solution that Chris identified, then these decisions will be made by the market through a carbon price and that will be a longer term structure that will benefit our customers.
Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC: Got it. Thank you very much.
Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.: Sure.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Julien of Bank of America. Your line is open.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hey, good morning.
Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.: Good morning, Julien, how are you doing?
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Good. Great. Thank you. Just to clarify the last question actually if we can start there. I just want to make sure I'm hearing this correctly. Is your expectation that states would actually move through the motions to file for this FRR or is it rather that your expectation that status quo would maintain itself with respect to just continue to clear assets or attempt to clear assets given wherever your avoided costs might be?
Kathleen L. Barrón - Exelon Corp.: Julien, it's Kathleen. I think it's the former that we would expect states to be looking very closely at this opportunity, not just because of course of the nuclear [Technical Difficulty] (39:02) the renewable fleet effects, any asset efficiency demand response that's receiving support from customers directly. And so there are a lot of stakeholders who have an interest in making sure that the states are going to be able to do clean capacity procurements and have that capacity recognized by RPM – by PJM rather.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: And you've confidence that you can indeed find a way from a regulatory path to support an FRR implementation including compensation for the units, if that's where it goes in both Illinois and New Jersey, to be clear?
Kathleen L. Barrón - Exelon Corp.: Yes, sir.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: All right, excellent. Now, let me turn back to the utility side of the equation here where things are booming obviously. Can you comment on the New Jersey side with CapEx? I mean we've talked a lot about New Jersey in the context of the nuclear plants, but obviously the Governor is implementing a lot more than that, maybe energy efficiency filings, offshore wind seems to generate some opportunities at ACE. Just curious how you're thinking about that and what's reflected in the budget as it stands today?
Anne R. Pramaggiore - Exelon Corp.: Hi, Julien, it's Anne Pramaggiore. How are you?
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Good, thank you.
Anne R. Pramaggiore - Exelon Corp.: Good morning. On the New Jersey side, obviously with the new legislation, there's a couple of areas that we're looking into, it's subject to – a lot of it's subject to regulatory proceedings that are yet to come. So you would not see what we would be looking at reflected in the budgets or the earnings to-date. But there's an area around energy efficiency, we traditionally have not been involved in energy efficiency programs except for some program funding in the past, and that's one of the things we'll look toward going forward. So to the extent that there's capital investment in energy efficiency, voltage conservation programs, you could start to see those reflected going forward. We also have opportunity to invest in storage and solar going forward in New Jersey. But again, these are all subject to proceedings, at the commission before we have a sense of exactly what that looks like. But we think there's tremendous opportunity here especially as we think about utility of the future, the kind of businesses that we can be in looking forward, serving customers with the types of programs and products and services that they like. So we think there's a great platform there, but some work to do with the regulatory agency.
Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.: The only thing I'd add to that is, we have a very high sensitivity to rates on our customers. As you know that that part of the state has gone through a downturn. And so as we make the investments which we can do efficiently, we're going to keep a constant focus on those rates. So we're not impairing the future development of commercial, industrial or residential customers.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Excellent. Thank you all very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my call.
Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.: Hi, Mike.
Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hey. Can you talk a little bit about what your expectations are for the summer power market in Texas, given I guess it's gotten off to kind of a mild start? And then also talk about the recent acquisition on the retail side that you guys executed with FES and what the implications are for Constellation from that?
James McHugh - Exelon Corp.: Okay. Hi, Michael. It's Jim McHugh from Constellation. As far as ERCOT summer, what we've seen is some volatility in the forward markets and the weekly markets going into delivery and even in the day ahead markets, we've seen some pricing that exhibited on the ORDC curve, some higher price spikes. In the real-time market, it hasn't come to fruition. So it's led to a large spread between day ahead and real-time. In real-time, we really saw great operating conditions. The wind performed at or better than forecast. There were minimal generation force outages, so the generators all performed very well, and there were some good demand response availability. But prior to going into the period, we saw weeks trading as high as $800 or $900 and the month of July and August trading in the $200 range. As far as our portfolio, performed well, we're able to take advantage of some of that market volatility we saw in the forward markets. You saw that we executed $200 million of new business this quarter for 2018 on the power side, a good chunk of that is represented by our activity in Texas and what we're able to do and our gen-to-load strategy proved valuable once again. We were able to serve the high load and the high demand with our peaking fleet and the options that we owned. Going forward, I think we expect that volatility to continue. You'll have continued demand growth of 1 gigawatt to 1.5 gigawatts a year with really some wind and solar build out and very little thermal gas combined cycle generation build out. So that volatility will continue, next summer is trading right around the $100 right now and we would expect you would see the same exhibited volatility on the forward curve between now and delivery period of next summer. For the acquisition of FirstEnergy, it's a great fit for our portfolio. We would be paying $140 million subject to price adjustments based on market moves before the process is over. But there's 900,000 customers on the C&I side and residential side across six states. It'd be a great fit for our gen-to-load and gen-to-customer strategy that we've been deploying. We'd also be buying some certain power in basis hedges as part of the process. So it's a strong complement to our existing portfolio and it would provide repeatable and sustainable customer business through renewals and brand recognition for us.
Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hey, just a quick follow-up. I think you said that earlier in the call that you're a little closer to ratable in hedging for 2020 I think it was versus 2019. And I'm just wondering, should I be reading anything into that that you're becoming closer to ratable as you go further out, is that sort of a negative take on the power markets or?
James McHugh - Exelon Corp.: No, Michael, it's not. It's actually we're just building that position, as we hedged the third year of our three year program, we'll continue to grow that behind ratable position. We're currently about 7% or 8% behind ratable in 2020. We've added some gas hedges and cross-commodity hedges to further expose ourselves to upside in power markets. The concentration of our behind ratable position is largely in NI Hub and ERCOT. So I wouldn't read into that. I think our position is similar and growing to be similar across both those years.
Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Praful of Citigroup. Your line is open.
Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks so much. Hi, guys.
Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.: Hi.
Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: So just wanted to get a sense for getting back to the capacity auction on the capacity market reform piece. If the states are required to kind of support the asset both from the ZEC payment as well as (46:33), are there any winners, losers in terms of states, I think would make it more difficult to get done especially in this timeframe. Are there some states who will be more inclined to get this versus others?
Kathleen L. Barrón - Exelon Corp.: I can take that one as well. It's certainly going to depend on the state's readiness, how quickly this gets implemented. So I take the question to be one of what kind of transition period might we be looking at, and I think that's going to be a subject of active debate in the paper hearing at FERC, as to whether there needs to be some sort of transition period to allow states to understand what the rules are and take advantage of them. So I think you should look for that to play out as part of the FERC process.
Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you. Thank you. And then in terms of ERCOT, if the volatility clearly has been high, should we expect that if there are retail players struggling at the back end of extreme volatility that you're looking to expand your retail position or is there any goals that you see to kind of expand your portfolio position in ERCOT at all?
James McHugh - Exelon Corp.: Hi Praful, it's Jim again. I think we did see going into the summer, one small retailer go out of business with the new collateral posting requirements by ERCOT, which include a look at the forward markets. It might be harder for some of the smaller retail providers to manage their balance sheet if they're undercapitalized through those collateral requirements. For us, I think strategy is the same. We'll look for good value propositions. Our track record with Integrys and Con Ed and what we're looking at now with the FES book will continue to be the same to look for value. As far as the lag effect, you may see the impact of the volatility for the larger players impact maybe in the longer term as the contract tenures and the extended start dates are further out in the curve. So they're currently contracting for load out two or three years forward.
Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you. Thanks. And just quickly just, I mean, ExGen O&M cost reductions, I noticed their target, I think 75% in 2018, 50% by 2019. Is that all on track right now?
Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.: It's not only on track, it's Crane, Praful, it's not only on track. We are continuing to work to become more efficient, continue to compete in the markets we're in. We are on track to achieve those if not to exceed those, so we're in good shape.
Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Excellent. Good to hear. Thanks so much, guys.
Operator: Thank you so much. I would like to turn the call over back to speaker, Chris Crane. Please go ahead, sir.
Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.: Yes. Thanks. And thanks again for everybody joining the call. As you can see from the strategy that we put together years ago, we're right on track, if not ahead of schedule and we will continue to keep you updated. Look forward to the third quarter calls, but also Dan and Joe and I are getting back out and making sure we drop in and answer any of your questions, so making ourselves available during the third quarter will be a big part of our plan to continue to communicate. We thank you very much and have a good day.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the 2018 Q1 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. Mr. Dan Eggers, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your call.
Daniel L. Eggers - Exelon Corp.: Thank you, Geneva. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Leading the call today are Chris Crane, Exelon's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Thayer, Exelon's Chief Financial Officer. They're joined by other members of Exelon's senior management team who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. We issued our earnings release this morning along with the presentation, both of which can be found in the Investor Relations section on Exelon's website. The earnings release and other matters which we discuss during today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today's material and comments made during this call. Please refer to today's 8-K and Exelon's other SEC filings for discussions of risk factors and factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecast and expectations. Today's presentation also includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for reconciliations between the non-GAAP measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures. It is scheduled 45 minutes for today's call. I'll now turn the call over to Chris Crane, Exelon's CEO.
Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.: Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We have had a productive few months since our last earnings call, making important steps in reinforcing our value proposition. At our PHI utilities, we reached settlement in both Pepco Maryland and Pepco D.C. rate cases. With these settlements, we are now reached constructive settlement in all PHI jurisdictions since the close of the merger and accomplished that legacy PHI has not achieved in many years. This reflects a positive evolution of our engagement in these states. Our employees' hard work to improve system reliability and performance have led to rising consumer satisfaction. The progress we have made is reflected in our constructive partnership with our regulators. There's always more work to do particularly on our earned ROEs, but we are encouraged by these developments. In New Jersey, state legislators passed three important energy policy laws with strong majorities on April 12. Most impactful to Exelon was the New Jersey ZEC program, similar to that in New York and Illinois. It'll be more fairly compensating our nuclear generating assets in New Jersey for clean energy attributes of these plants. In March, our East Coast utilities were battered by three northeasters that resulted in about $200 million of spending between capital and operating expenses. Thanks to the tireless efforts of our employees and contractors, we were able to restore power to the effective customers safely and quickly. These storms were challenging and the benefits of our scale were on display in March. We were able to return customers to service days faster than we would have as a standalone utility. Finally, we had a strong quarter financially. On a GAAP basis, we earned $0.60 per share versus $1.06 last year. On a non-GAAP operating basis, we earned $0.96 per share versus $0.64 last year, just above the midpoint of our $0.90 to $1 guidance range while overcoming a $0.06 storm cost through March. Turning to slide 6. At the utilities, we continue to execute at top quartile levels across key customer satisfaction and operating metrics. The investments we are making are paying off in improved reliability, which is strengthening our relationship we have with our customers and regulators. These numbers follow the standard industry practice of excluding major storms, although the benefits of our scale, health (00:04:42) and recovery efforts, which I'll discuss in the next slide. I would note that Pepco D.C. has achieved a record reliability in the past two years since joining Exelon family of companies. We continue to make gains as we share best practices across all utilities. We also continue to focus on helping customers and communities becoming more energy-efficient, saving energy and money. We have been doing this for years and I'm happy to once again announce that EPA named all five of our eligible companies; BGE, ComEd, Delmarva, Pepco and PECO, as 2018 ENERGY STAR Partners of the Year. Our companies also received the Sustained Excellence designation for being named partners three or more years in a row. Safety is always our highest priority and we review our OSHA recordables in the first quarter. We've identified a number of areas for improvement and have implemented a series of our actions to get those numbers back on track. At ExGen, nuclear generation this quarter was 40 terawatt hours, with capacity factor of 96.5%. Our Texas CCGTs continue to perform very well with an economic dispatch match rate of 96.6%, ramping up and down to optimize hour-by-hour the variability in ERCOT pricing. Turning to slide 7. I'd like to take a moment to highlight our utilities' performance and the outstanding work from our crews as they battled three consecutive nor'easters in March. These storms blanket our East Coast utility with heavy wet spring snow and high winds that are especially hard on the system. Over the span of these storms, we faced 1.7 million cumulative customer outages and shared over 1,600 Exelon employees and contractors with our sister utilities. ComEd alone provided an additional 1,200 workers and contract crew members. We also incurred, as I said, $200 million of operating capital expenses. To help put this in context, we replaced approximately 1,200 power poles and handled more than 1.8 million customer calls. With that context, let me share with you the success story of the combined Exelon utility families. Because of our employees are trained on common practices, we're able to seamlessly incorporate workers from different utilities more quickly to get work and return service to our customers. Each storm impacted the service territories differently, but the last of the three storms significantly impacted Atlantic City Electric. We were able to bring in crews and contractors from ComEd, PECO, Pepco, Delmarva and BGE to assist in the restoration effort. Our scale and performance notably sped up the recovery and allowed us to send over 250 employees and contractors into New Jersey to aid in the restoration effort. The storms that occurred this quarter provide a great example of how our model directly benefits our customers. The scale of the Exelon utilities and how we run these businesses continue to contribute to higher quality, more responsive and cost-effective service for our customers. Turning to slide 8. Last call, we provided an update on the impact of tax reform, but I want to revisit it as we have been working with our regulators to pass these savings on to customers. We've identified over $500 million in savings to be returned to our customers related to lower corporate tax rate from our distribution utility operations. As we've said from the start, the benefit of the lower income tax rate will provide a meaningful savings to our 10 million utility customers. We appreciate the constructive relationship with our state regulators in that are allowing us to pass along these benefits to our customers in a timely fashion. Turning to slide 9, we made additional progress in establishing compensation for our nuclear generating fleet that recognizes the value of the emission-free generation and the underlying deficiencies in market design. The most significant development was the New Jersey legislation as I spoke of enacting the ZEC program into law, establishing a path forward to preserve the at-risk nuclear plants in New Jersey. I want to thank our team and our partners at PSEG leadership, the leadership in the Senate and the Assembly and the Governor for working together to pass this important legislation. Once the Governor signs the bill, the ZEC program will go to the BPU for its review of the applications. There is a 330-day deadline for completing the process, putting the program implementation likely at the end of the first quarter in 2019. At that time, we will start realizing the New Jersey ZEC revenues. We are pleased that New Jersey has joined New York and Illinois and Connecticut in recognizing the clear environmental attributes of the nuclear generating fleet. We still see need for more comprehensive solutions to compensate for this clean energy, but we think expanding the ZEC program is a key interim step to preserving our most challenged assets, extending their useful lives and the long-term value of this fleet. Turning to the existing ZEC programs in New York and Illinois, we have had oral arguments in both cases at the federal appellate court levels. In Illinois, the court requested and now waiting for the U.S. Government to provide a view on the case. In New York, the decision is with the judges as they had no outstanding items following the oral argument. We remain confident in our legal position in both cases and continue to collect the ZEC revenues. With respect to PJM work on price formation, FERC has committed to ruling on PJM's fast-start price formation by September, if not sooner, as many parties have requested. PJM is committed to operationally implement the rule as soon as FERC gets approval. FERC's decision on fast-start will dictate the process for additional reforms aimed at eliminating flaws in the current pricing formation rules that currently prevent some units from setting price. In addition, PJM has now set deadlines for stakeholder reviews of reforms to its shortage pricing rules, including those related to reserve and operating reserve demand curves. We see these price formation changes as essential to preserving an effective competitive mark in PJM and apply the ongoing efforts to design and implement these changes. Finally, just yesterday, PJM committed to study fuel supply vulnerabilities that could arise if the grid became dominated by natural gas generation. In its white paper, PJM called for reforms of its capacity market to better value fuel-secure resilient resources. We have seen this as a positive first step where we urge PJM to model the carbon and air pollutant implications of greater reliance on fossil fuels, particularly oil-fired power plants to meet electrical demand. Our states and customers communities expect us to develop policies that will lead to less pollution, not more, so we believe PJM should study the emissions consequences as well. Now, I'll turn it over to Jack to walk through some of the numbers.
Jonathan W. Thayer - Exelon Corp.: Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Turning to slide 10. We had a strong quarter financially, delivering adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings of $0.96 per share, just above the midpoints of our guidance range of $0.90 to $1 per share. This compares to $0.64 per share in the first quarter of 2017. Better results from Generation offset the storm-related cost pressures at the utilities. Exelon's utilities delivered a combined $0.47 per share net of HoldCo, which includes $0.06 of higher storm costs. Since we've not had significant winter storms like these in years, let me remind you how major storms are treated in our different Mid-Atlantic jurisdictions. In New Jersey and Maryland, excluding BG&E, we have a tracking mechanism for major storms, so the costs incurred during the first quarter are deferred as a regulatory asset and will be recovered in the future, thereby not impacting our reported earnings. In Delaware, Pennsylvania, Washington D.C., and for BGE and Maryland, when we file our rate cases, we use an average of major storm costs from previous years that is included in our rates and assumed in our budgets. In years when major storms exceed the historic average, Exelon absorbs the additional storm costs, but future rates will be adjusted to reflect these costs. With March's winter storms, we exceeded our storm budgets, which left us $0.06 per share behind plan in the first quarter of 2018. As we look out to the remainder of the year, we will have to find offsets at the utilities to mitigate any additional major storm expenditures, which historically have come in the first and third quarters. Looking beyond the storm impacts, our utility results did benefit from additional revenues associated with resolved rate cases. We would also expect PHI to catch up on some of their normal course O&M expenses over the balance of the year. Generation had a strong quarter relative to plan, earning $0.49 per share. We had good performance from our nuclear assets with better capacity factors than budgeted. We also benefited from lower O&M expenses and favorable spot market prices. We're reaffirming our full-year guidance range of $2.90 to $3.20 per share, which you can see on slide 19, and expect to deliver operating earnings of $0.55 to $0.65 per share in the second quarter compared with $0.54 last year. Turning to slide 11. The $0.96 per share in the first quarter of this year was $0.32 per share higher than the first quarter of 2017. Generation earnings were up $0.32 per share compared to last year, with ZECs representing the most significant source of uplift, as we recognized the true-up of the 2017 Illinois ZEC revenues in the first quarter, which added $0.11 per share, and we realized full quarter contributions from the Illinois and New York ZEC programs, including the acquisition of Fitzpatrick, which were not in effect during the first quarter of 2017. Relative to the first quarter of 2017, Generation also benefited from higher capacity pricing in New England, the Midwest, and the Mid-Atlantic regions. As a whole, the utilities were largely impacted by higher storm cost, which was partially offset by increased electric distribution and transmission revenues due to higher rate base at ComEd, increased transmission revenue at BG&E, rate increases at PHI and favorable weather at PECO. Moving to slide 12. On a trailing 12-month basis, our overall earned ROEs slipped modestly from last quarter, but are near the midpoint of our targeted 9% to 10% earned ROEs that underpin our target returns for 2019 and beyond. The biggest drag in overall ROEs compared to last quarter came from the increased major storm expenses that I discussed earlier. In total, the storms reduced earned ROEs by 10 basis points for our total utility businesses on a trailing 12 months basis. We remain diligent in managing our operating expenses to dampen the effects from the storm costs. Turning to the PHI utilities, the absolute levels of earned ROEs still have room for improvement, even when we adjust for the 60 basis point drag from the fourth quarter's FAS 109 write-off. That said, the recently filed settlements at Pepco D.C. and Pepco Maryland should start to lift Pepco's earned ROEs in the second half of 2018. We also experienced higher O&M in the first quarter than budgeted, which is due to timing issues, and should reverse over the remainder of the year and help to lift earned ROEs. As we look at our earned ROEs for the rest of 2018 for the overall utility, tax reform is positive to earnings, but also creates ROE headwinds this year due to the timing of equity injections to fund deferred tax returns before the higher equity is reflected in rate cases. The ROE impact is primarily a 2018 timing issue and is already captured in our earnings outlook. We still expect earned ROEs in 2019 to be solidly in the 9% to 10% range. Turning to slide 13, we've had a constructive regulatory quarter. Starting with the most recent developments, we were pleased to reach settlement agreements in April at both Pepco D.C. and Pepco Maryland, providing revenue decreases of $24.1 million and $15 million, respectively. The decreases include adjustments for forecasted tax benefits to customers with the recent tax reform legislation. The settling parties have proposed a procedural schedule that would place rates in effect by June 1 for Pepco Maryland and July 1 for Pepco D.C. We're happy to have reached constructive settlements with key interveners in both jurisdictions that provide bill relief for customers, while also providing a return on our investments and being resolved months earlier than if the cases had been fully litigated. On March 29, we filed our first case at PECO in three years, where we requested an $82 million rate increase, with a scheduled completion by December 31. The filing is focused on supporting PECO's strong reliability performance, strengthening system resiliency and supporting physical security and cybersecurity. I should also note that the $82 million is net of $71 million tax credit for 2019 tax reform benefits and that the five-year average storm cost in the filing includes the costs incurred in the first quarter. On April 16, ComEd filed its annual distribution formula rate update with the ICC seeking a $22.9 million decrease to distribution base rates. The decrease is primarily driven by an adjustment for forecasted tax benefits resulting from the recent tax reform legislation. On February 9, we closed out the Delmarva, Maryland rate case with a $13.4 million revenue increase effective immediately. Finally, we have outstanding cases in Delaware at Delmarva electric and gas that are scheduled for completion in the third and fourth quarters, respectively. More details on the rate cases and their schedules can be found on slides 22 through 27 in the appendix. Turning to slide 14. In the first quarter, we invested $1.2 billion of capital at the utilities and are on track to meet our $5.5 billion budget to the benefit of our customers. Considering the significant number of projects that go into our overall capital budget, we thought a more regular update on specific projects would be useful to appreciate how these investments are benefiting our customers and communities. Today, I'd like to highlight two projects. The first is DPL's Cedar Creek to Milford Transmission Rebuild. This $75 million project entails replacing approximately 43 miles of 230 kV transmission poles as well as new conductor and optical ground wiring. The 230 kV line is critical for the transmission network in the Delmarva region and will improve reliability by eliminating the potential for outages due to structural failure of the line. The second project I'd like to highlight is ComEd's future new substation in Elk Grove. The $90 million greenfield substation is expected to be in service by the third quarter of 2021. The project will support transmission line reliability and projected load growth, primarily from data centers in the Elk Grove Village area by adding over 300 megawatts of additional new capacity. Slide 15 provides our gross margin update for ExGen, which saw some movement within the buckets, but total gross margin in each year is unchanged from our last update. For 2018, open gross margin was up $250 million, primarily due to strengthening ERCOT spark spreads, offset by our hedges. We also had a strong quarter in execution creating $200 million of Power New Business. 2019 and 2020 gross margins are also flat relative to our last disclosure. In both years, open gross margin increased by $50 million on strengthening ERCOT spark spreads, which was offset by our hedges. We were also able to execute $100 million and $50 million of Power New Business in 2019 and 2020, respectively. We ended the quarter approximately 6% to 9% behind our ratable hedging program in 2018 and 8% to 11% behind ratable in 2019 when considering cross-commodity hedges. We remain comfortable being more open when we look at market fundamentals. Turning to slide 16, we remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and our investment-grade credit rating. We are forecasting ExGen's leverage to be 2.5 times debt-to-EBITDA at year-end 2018, which is below our long-term target of 3 times debt-to-EBITDA. On a recourse debt basis, we are at 2.1 times, which is well below our target. We will continue to manage our balance sheet at ExGen over time to the 3 times debt-to-EBITDA level, so look for us to focus on debt reduction at both HoldCo and GenCo. I'll now turn the call back to Chris.
Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.: Thanks, Jack. Turning to slide 17, we remain firmly committed to our strategy and see progress in the first quarter. Whether it'd be the rate case settlements of PHI, the benefits of the scale on our storm restoration or establishing ZEC programs in New Jersey, our financial footing is very strong. Here again is our value proposition. We will continue to focus on growing our utilities targeting 7.4% rate base growth and 6% to 8% EPS growth through 2021. We continue to use free cash flow from ExGen to fund incremental equity needs at the utilities, pay down debt over the next four years at ExGen and the HoldCo and part fund a faster dividend growth rate. We continue to focus on optimizing value for ExGen business by seeking fair compensation for our carbon-free generation fleet in Pennsylvania as we have done with the ZECs in New Jersey, Illinois and New York. And this adoption of price formation in PJM and resiliency initiatives at FERC will also benefit. We continue to close uneconomic plants, sell assets where it makes sense to accelerate our debt reduction plans and maximize value through the gen-to-load match strategy. We continue to sustain strong investment-grade credit metrics and grow our dividend consistently at 5% through 2020. With that, operator, we can now open it up for questions.
Operator: Our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore.
Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI: Thanks. Good morning. Great quarter considering all the storms you had. I've got a few questions.
Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.: Sure.
Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI: The first is, looking at your gross margin slide, you did comment that you had some puts and takes and that the total expected gross margins are the same. I see from looking at the prior quarter's deck that your sort of NI Hub's around-the-clock pricing is down, Mid-Atlantic's a little better, ERCOT sparks are a lot better. But when you show us the open gross margin and you roll down to the total expected gross margin, how are you thinking about current forwards in ERCOT rolling into spot pricing? And are you just giving us sort of a theoretical naked mark, assuming you can roll all the current run-up in spark spreads into spot or is there some sort of a holdback there, given the uncertainty with regard to summer volatility (00:25:21)
Joseph Nigro - Exelon Corp.: Hey, Greg. Good morning. It's Joe Nigro. It's a good question, Greg. And as you've mentioned, there is a lot of volatility expected in ERCOT this summer. And for us, it's not as simple as just selling the Generation output. As you know, we have a very big load book of business. So, we have to take that into account as well. And we look at those scenarios under a lot of different outcomes, be it higher prices and/or lower prices, and we try to set up the book accordingly. When you look at the disclosure here, we're simply mark-to-marketing the value of our open position in the open gross margin calculation, and there was a large uptick to the tune of about $300 million if it had been a fully-opened book. Offsetting that obviously is the mark-to-market of our hedges that are on the book, given the strong move and the sales we've made. And that nets to a gain in the portfolio of about $50 million. As for a holdback, any holdback would be relatively small in the overall total gross margin of the – over $8 billion that's expected, and we would do that given some of the uncertainty of outcomes that we expect.
Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI: Okay, great. Thanks. Jack, I've got a couple questions for you. Looking at the slide where you give the projected sources and uses of cash, since I compare that to the last quarter disclosure, it looks like regulated utility investments – expected investments are up a little bit, but the overall free cash flow profile into the end of the year actually looks like it's still net-net improved even after a slightly higher CapEx. Is that a fair synopsis? And I know it's a small increase, but what are those capital expenditures being directed to?
Jonathan W. Thayer - Exelon Corp.: It is a fair synopsis and I think the CapEx is really related to the storm investment. Chris talked about the significant investments that were made in the Mid-Atlantic utilities during that storm, so that's why you see the increase in CapEx there. To your point, the overall cash flow profile of the company looks quite strong.
Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI: Great. And my last question actually goes, because you didn't put it in this deck, back to the Q4 deck where you had EPS sensitivities related to interest rates. And it looks to me like the 30-year is up about 37 basis points since year-end, and you guys put in here the interest rate sensitivity for ComEd ROE and pension expense is $0.03 in each instance for every 50 basis points at least looking at 2019. So, is it fair to say that these sensitivities still hold because that would mean you might be as much as a $0.05 ahead of where you were in 2019 at the beginning of this year?
Jonathan W. Thayer - Exelon Corp.: I think the $0.05 sounds a little high, but they do hold. And as you know, we benefit from rising interest rates relative to other utilities because of the types of the formula rate in Illinois, but also because of our significant pension liability. And as the interest rates increase, the liabilities shrink. So, no question. This rising environment is helping our costs as well as our revenues and EPS, but $0.05 does seem a little bit aggressive.
Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI: Okay. Thank you, Jack. That's all I've got.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.
Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning, guys. Just hoping to follow-up on the ERCOT comment just now. I think I heard you say $300 million is roughly the gross margin. And then, with the hedging value, it sort of offset down to $50 million. Was that a 2018 comment? And if so, could we get some sort of sense on 2019 and 2020 because the sort of hedge sparks (00:29:21) numbers that you gave, finding a little difficult to unpack those.
Joseph Nigro - Exelon Corp.: Yeah. The comment I made was in relation to 2018, Jonathan, but you could think similarly not in magnitude of dollars because we haven't seen the absolute price change that we saw in 2018.
Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah.
Joseph Nigro - Exelon Corp.: But you had a pickup in open gross margin in 2019 and 2020, and similarly, we had a mark-to-market drop in 2019 and 2020, given that we've sold in obviously at lower prices. Given that those market prices haven't moved nearly as greatly on the back-end in 2019 and 2020, just the absolute value of the dollars isn't going to be as great. I think the other element, though, is you've seen this market move pretty appreciably in the front-end and rightfully so, given where reserve margins are and the announcements of the retirements. I think you could expect some extreme volatility this summer and that will be obviously weather dependent and depending on unit performance as well as our wind performance. I think the other element, though, is if we see some of that volatility that's expected, it wouldn't be unreasonable to think that you would see price appreciation in 2019 and 2020 on the back of it just because it hasn't moved. And as you could see from our disclosures, we're not only carrying a long position in 2018, we have quite a bit of power still opened in 2019 and 2020 as well.
Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Sure. Thank you, Joe. But can you just – when you look first quarter versus year-end, the effective realized energy price spark number you gave is down. So, just remind us sort of how that works because I think the message is the margin's up so somehow that indicator goes down.
Joseph Nigro - Exelon Corp.: Yeah. And it's slightly different for the base load regions, I'll call the Midwest and the Mid-Atlantic, versus the calculation in ERCOT. As you know, ERCOT, we're trying to give you a view of our spark spread which is more relevant to our machines. And the formula is laid out here. It's very simple. We take a gas price using Houston Ship Channel, multiply it by heat rate and add some variable O&M to set the reference price. What we then do is we got to add back or subtract from the mark-to-market value. And the way to think about that is that's a dollar amount. So, we calculated the reference price in a unit of dollars per megawatt hour. We've now got a bucket of dollars on a mark-to-market basis that we need to divide by the volumes sold to bring it back to that same unit of dollars per megawatt hour. It just so happens in 2018, when you look at the effective realized energy price, it's next to zero. We've seen it in the past to actually go negative in ERCOT if we have a large mark-to-market loss with very small volume sold. And then, you could see in the out-years 2019 and 2020, that's a positive outcome or a positive spark.
Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: But the net-net is that your expected margin is higher, correct?
Joseph Nigro - Exelon Corp.: Yes. Our expected margin in ERCOT is higher in each year given that we're carrying an open position in all those years and the market is going higher. Now, that was offset, as we mentioned in the first question from Greg, with some of the changes on the rest of the portfolio to keep the gross margin on the bottom-line balanced.
Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Thank you. And then, just one other little issue. So, we noticed that there were particularly low tax charges at both PECO and PHI in the quarter. So, was there something unusual going on there? What should we be thinking as we sort of push those through the year?
Jonathan W. Thayer - Exelon Corp.: PECO, I think is where it's specific and it's tax repairs. So, as we invest capital for the storms that shows up later in the benefits and tax repairs same is true in certainly the PHI jurisdictions.
Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So, what would be – should we see continued effect through the year, Jack, or is it really just like a Q1 one-off?
Jonathan W. Thayer - Exelon Corp.: It's a Q1.
Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay.
Jonathan W. Thayer - Exelon Corp.: And depending on what storm activity we see in Q3 or Q4.
Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Okay. Thank you very much, guys.
Jonathan W. Thayer - Exelon Corp.: Sure.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.
Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC: Yeah. Hi. I'm curious just there's a lot of retail businesses that looks like are on the market these days. How interested might you be in expanding retail through acquisition?
Joseph Nigro - Exelon Corp.: Steve, we're always – good morning, first of all. It's Joe. We're always interested in looking at whatever opportunities exist in the marketplace. As you know, we have a history of acquiring companies in our recent past when you look at Integrys and Con Ed, for example, and we'll continue to do that. To the extent we can add something that we think will be accretive to the bottom line and fits with the value proposition that we're trying to bring both to our shareholders and our customers, we're going to be aggressive with doing that. There has been some change of hands with retailers in the near-term here and we would expect that to continue given some that are on the market now and we'll continue to hunt for them.
Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC: Okay. And then just the continued comment on staying more open due to your view that power prices are, I guess – upside you see in power prices. How much of that is the potential market reforms versus just expecting better price kind of without them or is it a mix of both?
Joseph Nigro - Exelon Corp.: It's a mix of both. I think you have to take the whole picture into account. When you look at our portfolio, from my lens, I think about risk reward. And when you look at where the power curve is, like, for example, in the Midwest now and where gas prices are, we think about it from a heat rate perspective and we see upside to that. And that's driven by some of the reforms that PJM themselves is talking about, and obviously, Joe and a number of folks here at Exelon are working on very closely, and we stay very tied to that. And then, in addition to that, we look at history and changes in the composition of the Generation stack and the transmission stack. I still go back to some of the easy examples, though. We had gas prices two years ago at $1.70 and we had power prices that were almost $26. You have gas curves at $0.75 or $0.80 higher than that, and you see power prices that are lower than where they were. So it becomes a question of risk reward when you overlay just the fundamentals of the market itself and then obviously some of the regulatory reforms that are out on the horizon.
Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hey. Good morning.
Jonathan W. Thayer - Exelon Corp.: Good morning.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hey. So, perhaps, to follow up on Steve's question a little bit. Can you talk a little bit about expanding margins on retail and just what you're seeing out there? Obviously, some of your peers of late have really been adamant in seeing an opportunity there. Just would be curious to hear your latest assessment. I know you guys have seen a variety of different dynamics in the retail markets in recent months. So, I'll leave it there.
Joseph Nigro - Exelon Corp.: Yeah. Julien, good morning. It's Joe. I guess, I really can't speak to what my competitors are actually achieving. I have an understanding of what they're saying, and we know how they're reacting in the market. What I would tell you is, we think about our load serving business across the wholesale perspective, when we think of polar auctions, as well as our independent retail business. It's tied very closely, obviously, to our Generation portfolio. I think, first of all, the volatility during the quarter, especially in New England and PJM was good to see. We've got an expectation of volumes and margins that are in our disclosure, and we're comfortable with those, and they remain – the margins remain in line with what our expectations have been historically for C&I margins. We're comfortable with our projections overall. I will tell you we've seen some competitive behavior change on the retail side. Some folks, I think, were hurt last year with low volumes. And when you get into some of the non-energy charges and how they're calculated on a volumetric basis, and we've seen some of our competitors move away from fully fixed price contracts in certain markets. And we'll continue to offer those products, and we're going to remain disciplined to our approach. We spend a lot of time analytically evaluating data and using that data to inform our decisions both from a generation to load matching strategy, from a pricing perspective and a product development perspective. And as you know, last year, we had some challenges in our retail business. We're comfortable where we are now. I will tell you on the wholesale polar auction side in the first quarter, we have had some success. And I think it's directly attributable to the volatility that we saw in late December and early January, and quite frankly, in March as well in Eastern PJM with higher prices. So, overall, we're comfortable with what's reflected in the disclosure, and we're comfortable with the margins and the volumes. And we'll continue to work hard, and it is a very competitive marketplace.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: And just wanted to follow-up on one specific plant here, Mystic in New England. A lot of different dynamics playing out right now, but it would seem as if you need to clear your asset at all of the units, if you will, and then keep them around or would you actually look to retire select units here if they don't actually get picked up with an RMR or otherwise?
Joseph Nigro - Exelon Corp.: Well, I think we've been very clear, right? I mean we announced the acquisition of the Marine Terminal. We have an obligation for capacity that we are going to honor. And that's part of the reason that we're driving towards that acquisition of the terminal. We've also been very clear that absent market reforms, we don't see profitability for these units into the future. And we're working very closely to try to rectify that. I mean, the ISO themselves put out a study recently saying that there were five assets in New England needed to ensure reliability into the future, one being the Everett Marine Terminal and the others being the Mystic asset. So, putting all that together, as we've done in PJM and other areas with the capacity market, I think we take a very prudent approach to how we manage this looking into the future, and we're going to do the same thing in New England. We'll honor the commitment for capacity and we're going to look to get to the right reforms to make these assets more economic in the future.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: All of it needs to clear, right?
Joseph Dominguez - Exelon Corp.: Julien, this is Joe Dominguez. Actually, no. That's wrong. We don't have to clear the units to participate. And in fact, absent successful filing by the ISO on this waiver that they filed last night to offer a cost of service rate to Mystic, we will not clear. We will not participate in future capacity auctions.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Excellent. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.
Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning.
Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.: Hey, Steve.
Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I wanted to touch on your additional leverage capacity. And I guess what I'm thinking about is, as you continue to shift your earnings mix more towards regulated earnings and you're certainly doing that organically, but I guess I'm also thinking about inorganic ways to do that as well. Could you talk at a high level in terms of what that might mean in terms of a different risk profile with the rating agencies, a different targeted credit metrics, et cetera, if you pivot increasingly more towards regulated earnings?
Jonathan W. Thayer - Exelon Corp.: So, Stephen, I think you know, we've been incredibly conservative with our balance sheet in taking that approach and I think it's worked well with the agencies. As we do get more regulated contribution, certainly the earnings mix of the company shifts as does the risk profile. That married with the 3 times debt-to-EBITDA target at the GenCo, which we're well below now, I think, positions the company quite well. We have, in the past, spoken with the agencies, particularly S&P, about upgrading us at the holding company level and we will continue to pursue that. As the mix shifts occurs, I think our case strengthens. So, that's kind of the conservative approach we're taking.
Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Understood. And then, shifting gears to the PJM white paper, Chris, that you had mentioned in your prepared remarks and thinking about fuel resiliency, fuel security. Procedurally, sort of how do we think about how PJM might approach that from a process point of view? I know it could take quite a bit of time to do more work, more analytics on that at PJM. But is there anything you can tell us in terms of just thoughts on how that process might unfold?
Joseph Dominguez - Exelon Corp.: Yes. Stephen, it's Joe, and let me just start off with an observation. It's interesting. Secretary Perry in the 403 last fall identified a resilience problem in these markets. And as you know, that proposal was widely panned with a number of parties indicating that there is no resilience issue. Yet, in the last 48 hours, we've seen a filing by the New England ISO to retain Mystic on fuel security resilience grounds, and of course, we saw this white paper from PJM on Monday indicating that it too may have a resilience problem that would require capacity market changes. From our perspective, turning to that white paper, the things that are going to be important is to understand the analytics, the inputs into the analyses that PJM runs and in particular, how they think about the unavailability of natural gas pipeline service and for what duration. What Chris mentioned at the top of the call is that in addition to those constraints or those modeling parameters, we'd like to see them model environmental impacts associated with this fuel mix. We kept the New England system running this year really on the back of oil-fired units. And while we succeeded in keeping the lights on, it was a disappointing outcome for environmentalists in New England, where we burned 2 million barrels of oil and a disastrous, frankly, outcome for the stakeholder process in New England, where they want to get to lower air pollution, carbon and conventional pollutant emissions. So, we think that needs to be incorporated as well into PJM's analysis. And until we get those environmental externalities incorporated, we're not going to have a complete market. So, we see this as a positive step forward. We're going to look very carefully at how they intend to model this situation, again, the unavailability of gas and for how long. And we think if they do that right, they're going to find that they, too, like New England, have a significant number of fuel constraints on the system that will require them to preserve fuel secure resources. Now, that could be gas plants on Marcellus Shale's storage, it could obviously be nuclear plants and it could be coal plants, but then we need to take another look at that mix and make sure we're meeting the expectations of our customers and communities in terms of environmental impacts. In 2018, emissions need to be going down. And any resolution of this issue that results in emissions going up is going to continue to create incentives for state actions and indeed, for other federal actions to correct the flaws in those market.
Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.: I want to just follow up on one thing. I want to make it clear. We are not anti-gas. We think that the consumers in the country have really benefited from the plentiful low-cost gas. But as we look at the transmission system designs in the country, the N minus 1 concept that coordinates power flows across our system in the loss of major lines is a design basis. What we need is a design basis threat on the gas system to the electric system and ensure either redundancy in capacity for getting the gas to the plants or limit the dependency on the gas so we can keep the system up along with what Joe said on the environmental attributes. So, we don't have a combined gas- and electric-day coordination. We don't have a design basis threat to the gas system that would affect the electric system properly. And that needs to be worked out.
Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Very thoughtful response. I mean, it seems like the analysis, as you said, it's important to get the parameters set. That process could take a while. But I appreciate your point about what that analysis could result in. Thanks so much for the color.
Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.: Sure.
Operator: And our final question comes from the line of Praful Mehta with Citigroup.
Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc..: Hi, guys. Thanks so much.
Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.: Hi.
Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc..: So, a quick question on price formation. Could you just remind us what is the impact that you see for price formation for your assets? And how does that net out against the asset that are receiving zero-emission credits? Is there any net out of that as well?
Joseph Dominguez - Exelon Corp.: So, I'll jump in. What we have talked about is really what PJM has modeled. And as a grouping of two different initiatives, the fast-start initiative and the full (00:48:09) relaxation for baseload units, PJM has modeled a $3.50 impact to energy markets. We haven't published or discussed any numbers different from that. In terms of how it interfaces with the ZEC program, remember that the units that we presently have in the ZEC program are in New York, which would be unaffected by that change. Clinton, which is in MISO, again unaffected by that change. So, the only unit presently we'd be talking about is Quad Cities. And yes, as energy prices go up either as a result of energy market dynamic changes, policy changes, carbon being in the market, there would be potentially an offset to the ZEC payment with the plants that are participating.
Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc..: Okay. That's helpful. And that'll apply to New Jersey as well?
Joseph Dominguez - Exelon Corp.: In New Jersey, the mechanism is going to be different. But if prices recover for other reasons, the program also will have the BPU look at pricing in future years and potentially make adjustments. The key in all of these states is to preserve the zero-emission resources for the customers.
Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc..: Got you. That's helpful. And just quickly connecting that with capital allocation, right? If you do have the upside from price formation and zero-emission potentially in Pennsylvania as well, you've already kind of laid out a plan which allocates all the capital into all the different kind of criteria you've mentioned from debt reduction to dividend. Where do you see the incremental capital, if it does come through, get allocated in your plan covenant? (00:49:54)
Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.: Yeah. We have good capital resources today. We have good sources of investments to make for customer satisfaction and reliability, so we'll continue on that path, but we have to maintain a very strong sensitivity to the consumer impact on excessive capital going on the system. We can install $8 worth of capital and keep rates the same by reducing O&M by $1. And that's what we have to be focused on is customer service, reliability and the impact on our consumers. So that will be our approach as we go forward.
Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc..: Got you. Thanks. Thanks a lot, guys.
Operator: I would now like to turn the call over to Chris Crane for closing remarks.
Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.: So, I want to thank everybody again for attending the call and the questions. We're always available for any further details that you want going through Dan. We've had a good first quarter. We anticipate a good 2018. The work that's being done by all our operating groups continue to ensure that we maintain a strong balance sheet and deliver on the value proposition. I won't wear you out with my opinion of the valuation of the stock. We have had some improvement but as we execute we expect to see more improvement on that in the following quarters and year. So, with that, thank you very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Analysts: Gregory Gordon - Evercore ISI Julien Dumoulin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley Steven Fleishman - Wolfe Research Michael Weinstein - Crédit Suisse AG Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG
Operator: Good morning. My name is Sarah, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the 2017 Q4 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. Mr. Dan Eggers, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.
Daniel Eggers: Thank you, Sarah. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Leading the call today are Chris Crane, Exelon's President and Chief Executive Officer; Jack Thayer, Exelon's Chief Financial Officer; and Joe Dominguez, Executive Vice President and Government Regulatory Affairs and Public Policy. They're joined by other members of Exelon's senior management team who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. We issued our earnings release this morning along with the presentation, both of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of Exelon's website. The earnings release and other matters, which we discuss during today's call, contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today's material and comments made during this call. Please refer to today's 8-K and Exelon's other SEC filings for discussions of risk factors and factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts and expectations. Today's presentation also includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for reconciliations between the non-GAAP measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures. I'll now turn the call over to Chris Crane, Exelon's CEO.
Christopher Crane: Thanks, Dan, and good morning to everybody and thank you for joining us today. Let me start by apologizing first for my voice is recovering from a cold. There's some of our other speakers who are in the same place. So we'll try to make it through clearly without too much distraction. 2017 was a great year for Exelon, and I'd like to take a moment to talk about our business performance and some of our major accomplishments over the past 12 months. First and foremost, I'm pleased to report that Exelon delivered $3.97 per share of GAAP earnings, and $2.60 per share of operating earnings for 2017. Jack will walk through the details, but I'd note that the earnings are solidly within the guidance range as we saw better utility performance and cost discipline absorbed $0.09 timing shift from 2017 to 2018 related to the Illinois ZEC contracts. It absorbed $0.04 from FERC-related accounting changes. Last week, the board approved our updated dividend policy, targets 5% annual growth for 2018 through 2020, builds on our previous plan of 2.5% growth from '16 through '18. It keeps our recently shared goals of offering competitive dividend growth rate in providing multiyear visibility. We're comfortable with the faster dividend growth rate, particularly in light of the significant positive business developments since 2016. We completed the PHI acquisition, increasing our earnings mix from utility operation. Our New York and Illinois ZEC programs have preserved and extended useful lives of our most valuable nuclear plants and consistent with our inherent cost discipline, our forecast OEM spend will be approximately $725 million per year lower in 2020 and the cost reduction initiatives identified since 2015. Jack will discuss our capital allocation plan shortly, but we are confident in our ability to grow our dividend competitively, while meeting all our other capital commitments. I'm proud that we are able to share more of our financial success with our shareholders throughout this updated dividend policy. Tax reform passed at year-end is clearly a positive for us. Allows for significant savings for our utility customers as the new tax rate flows through each of lower bills. ExGen will benefit from lower tax rate and 100% expensing, in total, we see the run rate EPS benefit of $0.10 in 2019. Operationally, we executed well in each area of our business. At our utilities, we invested a total of $5.3 billion of capital in infrastructure and technology to provide a premier customer experience, fewer outages and faster expiration times. That all contributed to higher customer satisfaction scores. In fact, our utilities achieved multiple best on record operational metrics, and received national recognition for exceptional customer satisfaction. Meeting with our better service and performance, we're also busy on the regulatory front, completing 7 distribution and 5 transmission rate cases in 2017, and receiving a total of approximately $400 million in revenue increases. Timely and fair regulatory outcomes helped us to fund the future investment in the grid and improved the customer experience. Our generation fleet also performed well. The nuclear fleet produced 157 million megawatt hours, a record-setting year for Exelon, and we brought into service a turbine CCGTs in Texas. I'm pleased to tell you that our fleet performed very well during December and January cold spell in the northeast, once again demonstrating the value of liquid generation as a highly reliable and carbon-free source of power. On the regulatory policy front, the ZEC programs in New York and Illinois were implemented preserving several of our most of at-risk nuclear stations in the reliability economic and environmental benefits they provide. We will continue to defend these programs as we work on similar programs in New Jersey and Pennsylvania to benefit our customers, our communities and our employees. We also saw recognition of the need to address the resiliency of the power system, an effort that bases with FERC's order in January, we believe FERC order is an important step in addressing new resiliency and concerns. We urge FERC to adopt PJM's proposal around power price formation and adopt a comprehensive resiliency solution that we will realize that will take some more additional time to resolve. Joe Dominguez will discuss this in more detail later in the call. We can talk about our successes this year without -- and we can't talk about our successes this year without noting our strong commitment to corporate responsibility improving and supporting the communities that we serve building on prior years' recognitions. In 2017, we were the first utility named to the $1 billion roundtable which recognizes companies that spend above $1 billion of Tier 1 diverse and minority-owned suppliers. Being an active part of our community is a central tenant of Exelon and this award reflects what we've been able to do for years. In addition, DiversityInc named us 1 of the top 50 companies for diversity and U.S. Veterans Magazine named Exelon to its Best of Best List of Veteran-Friendly Companies. We also made a lot of progress in areas that will bring great value to our communities in 2017. We announced a new job training center in Washington, D.C. modeled after the center we operate in Chicago. We were named to the Civic 50, a list of community-minded companies by [indiscernible] Life Foundation, and singled out as utility sector leader. Exelon and its employees set new records in field operating activities, committing over $52 million in giving and volunteering more than 210,000 hours in 2017. Turning to Slide 6, we'll show you the impact of Exelon's management model that is add on our utility operations. Looking back to the Constellation merger for the legacy Exelon Utilities or since the merger with PHI, we've seen material improvement in operations across our utilities. The hard work of our employees and the benefit of our scale are clearly paying off. Our utilities primarily operate at first quartile levels across our key success of reliability, safety and customer service. However, this does not tell the whole story of our performance with many performance at top decile levels across in many of these measures. And many, being the best on-record performance in 2017 BGE, ComEd and PHI had the best performance on SAIFI and CAIDI and Pepco and BGE and ComEd on customer satisfaction. Customer service remains central to our strong utility performance and we did extremely well in this front in 2017. In J.D. Power's customer satisfaction study, BGE earned the top rank for business electric service among the large utilities in the East and was the best of 11 utilities in the region and was ranked highest nationally among 87 utilities on employee professionalism. Kudos to the hard work of our utility professionals who strive every day to provide service levels for our customers.  Turning to Slide 7. We also had another strong year in Generation and Constellation. Our nuclear assets continue to perform at top-tier levels. We had a combined capacity factor of 94.1% marking -- over 94% utilization rate for the 4 of the past 5 years. In 2017, we had 13 refueling outages with an average duration of 23 days. With addition of the FitzPatrick plant in high utilization, we generated a nuclear fleet record of 157 billion megawatt hours. On the Constellation side, our C&I operating metrics remain strong. 74% customer renewables, average customer duration of more than 5 years, and power contract terms of more than 25 months on average. These statistics speak to our deep customer relationship that has been a bedrock of the Constellation business. We continue to see stable unit margins with our C&I customers and our aggressive cost management is helping to further support operating margins. And now I'd like to turn it over to Jack to walk through some of the numbers.
Jonathan Thayer: Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. My remarks today will focus on 2017 results, 2018 earnings guidance and annual update through our financial exposures. Turning to Slide 8, as Chris stated, we had a strong year financially and operationally across the company. For the full year of 2017, our adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings were $2.60 per share and comfortably within our guidance range. We're pleased with our full year results, particularly considering the unexpected $0.09 timing drag from the Illinois ZEC contracts they were signed this January rather than in December as well as a $0.04 impact from our FAS 109 asset impairment related to income taxes for our FERC-regulated assets. For the fourth quarter, we earned $0.55 per share. Utilities less holding company EPS was $0.29 per share, benefiting from favorable storm expense and lower O&M expenses, which were offset relative to our plan by the FAS 109 impairment. Generation performed mostly in line with our expectations as our cost optimization efforts offset some market softness experienced earlier in the quarter. Turning to Slide 9, we are providing full year 2018 adjusted operating earnings guidance up $2.90 to $3.20 per share. The growth in utility earnings reflects continued rate base growth as we deploy capital to benefit of our customers as well as improvement in PHI's earned ROEs. And Exelon Generation year-over-year increase is primarily driven by the full year recognition of ZEC revenue from New York and Illinois; the $0.11 recognition of the 2017 Illinois ZEC payments, which is higher than in 2017 drag due to the now lower tax rate; the impact of tax reform; and cost-optimization efforts, partially offset by lower energy prices. We expect our first quarter earnings to be in the range of $0.90 to $1 per share. More detail on the year-over-year drivers by operating company can be found in the appendix, starting on Slide 59. On Slide 10, we rolled forward our outlook for utility CapEx rate base, which now covers 2018 for 2021. We plan to invest $21 billion into our utilities over the next 4 years to ensure reliable, more resilient and more efficient transmission and distribution of electricity and gas that improves the customer experience. Our 4-year capital program is up from what we shared with you last year as we accelerate our gas payment replacement programs at BGE and PECO and take advantage of opportunities to further improve reliability and resiliency, all of which allows us to provide our customers with safe, reliable service. This results in a capital plan across the utilities with a $5 billion annual run rate. Turning to rate base. We now project annual growth of 7.4% compared to 6.5% at the last update, which reflects the expanded CapEx budget and the impacts of tax reform. Tax reform will increase rate base by approximately $1.7 billion in 2020, relative to our previous expectations. For your convenience, in the appendix, we provided a more detailed analysis of capital and rate base outlooks by individual utility beginning on Slide 27.  Turning to Slide 11. Equally important deploying capital strength in our systems is timely revenue recovery. Of $11.5 billion of rate base projected -- rate base growth projected for 2021, approximately 70% is covered either under formula rates or mechanisms supporting our ability to make additional investments and earn a fair return on our capital. Where we do not have mechanisms, we will continue to work with stakeholders to enact and implement these types of tools. I would also note that over 70% of our rate base is in jurisdictions that are decoupled from volumes improving our earnings visibility and aligning with the ambitious energy efficiency goals or space. Slide 12 shows a trailing 12-month blended transmission and distribution earned ROEs of the utilities. Our utilities continue to execute, delivering strong earned returns for the year in addition to the robust operational performance, Chris already discussed. Over the past year, PHI's earned ROEs improved at Delmarva and Pepco and remained flat at Atlantic City Electric, although I should point out that the FAS 109 impairment cost about 60 basis points borrowed at each utility. We're encouraged by the improvements of PHI and we expect to see further gains as pending rate cases are resolved throughout 2018. The legacy Exelon utilities had a strong 2017, earning 10.3% as a group, helped by favorable storm expense and O&M, partially offset by the FAS 109 regulatory asset impairment in the fourth quarter of 2017. Improving the earned ROEs of PHI is sustaining strong performance at the legacy Exelon utilities will be a core focus on our efforts to meet our overall utility earnings growth targets. We expect to earn 9% to 10% ROEs across our utilities in 2019. Turning to Slide 13, we remain busy on the regulatory front. Since our last earnings call, ComEd received an order authorizing the revenue increase of over $95 million. Since implementing the formula rate structure, we've recovered 90% plus of our assets with this year being the 100% for the first time. Pepco filed electric rate cases in Maryland and the District of Columbia with orders expected in the third and fourth quarters of this year, respectively. In addition to the recently filed Pepco Maryland and BGE rate cases, we have pending rate cases at Delmarva with orders expected in 2018. Combined, we're asking for $133 million of revenues, which reflect recovery on multiple years of reliability, smart meter and other capital investments that have been made to improve performance across these jurisdictions. Later this spring, we plan to file a rate case at PECO for the first time in 3 years, and we'll file our standard formula update at ComEd in April. More details on the rate cases and their schedules can be found on Slide 65 through 71 in the appendix. Slide 14 provides an update on our outlook for utility EPS, where we continue to forecast 6% to 8% EPS growth. Compared to last year, our EPS bands in 2019 and 2020 have both increased. The uplift from tax reform in utilities from an increased rate base is mostly offset in the first couple of years by the drag from higher holding company expense since a lower tax rate provides less tax shield. As we look toward the back half of this period, we should start to see net benefit from the change in tax policy. Overall, the combination of strong rate base growth, timely regulatory recovery and tax reform leave us on a path to sustain our leading utility EPS growth. Slide 15 provides our gross margin update for ExGen, and on Slide 38, we provide more detailed bridges compared to the previous quarter. I should point out that our decision to retire Oyster Creek, a year earlier than previously planned, is now factored into all of our disclosures for gross margins, O&M and depreciation expense, with the collected EPS uplift being $0.03 in 2018, $0.07 in 2019 and $0.01 in 2020, relative to our previous expectations. Now turning to our gross margin updates. Our 2018 total gross margin is flat relative to our last disclosure. As lower Oyster Creek contribution is offset by the inclusion of the Handley Generating Station. The 1,265 megawatt paper in Texas that we bought out of EGTP portfolio it serves as cost-effective resource to our Constellation retail operations. Total gross margin in 2019 is up $50 million since the last quarter, driven primarily by higher West Hub and NiHub power prices, strengthening our ERCOT's spark spreads an additional Generation related to Handley, partially offset by the early retirement of Oyster Creek. Since we've not previously disclosed 2020 gross margins, let me help with the 2020 disclosures in context by bridging a few changes compared to the 2019 disclosures. Total gross margin is now $300 million, and to be bucketed in two, One, $150 million reduction to open gross margin, primarily from the already announced retirement of TMI. We have offset some O&M and depreciation expense so its closure is net EPS-accretive to us. Secondly, $150 million decrease to the capacity in ZEC line which largely reflects the role-off of the robust and previously disclosed PJM capacity prices from 2018 and '19 option. From a hedging perspective we ended in the quarter, approximately 13% to 16% behind our ratable hedging program in 2018 and 8% to 11% behind ratable 2019 when considering cross-commodity hedges. We remain comfortable being more open when we look at market fundamentals and particularly as we see opportunity for PJM price formation changes. Turning to Slide 16, our O&M expense outlook is consistent with the third quarter earnings call disclosures. That included our expanded $250 million cost-reduction program, plus an additional $50 million and $120 million of O&M savings in 2018 and 2019, respectively, due to the earlier-than-planned closure of Oyster Creek. Turning to CapEx. Our liquid fuel baseline capital spend projections continue to decline. Our base CapEx benefits from a proactive investments we made across the fleet in prior years. Further focus on investment priorities, any impact of closing uneconomic plants. Our nuclear fuel expenditures are falling as we take advantage of well-supply during [indiscernible] markets in excess fuel processing capacity. We continue to run an efficient organization, we'll always look for ways to reduce cost and run our fleet more cost-effectively while maintaining the highest premium on safety and reliability. The combination of ZEC programs in New York and Illinois have extended the useful lives of our most vulnerable assets and we continue to produce ongoing capital needs for the plants, which we think makes a more compelling case from a long-term value of these assets, which the market still seems slow to flat.  Turning to Slide 17. We're rolling forward the free cash flow outlook for ExGen to cover 2018 through 2021. We expect the cumulative free cash flow to be $7.6 billion, which is $800 million higher than our previous 4-year outlook. Our forecast takes into account power price forwards at year-end, the current gross margin outlook for Constellation, the benefit of the cost cuts outlined at the third quarter call, the planned closure of TMI and earlier closure of Oyster Creek, our updated base CapEx and nuclear forecast and the impact of tax reform. We're also updating how we plan to use ExGen's strong free cash flow generation. We'll invest approximately $700 million in growth capital, which is primarily cited solar projects in support of our Constellation business, the Medway plant in New England and some final payments around the Texas CCGTs. We plan to inject between $3.3 billion and $3.7 billion of capital in the utilities to fund the outsized growth without the need for external equity funding. With faster dividend growth, we will use approximately $400 million to $600 million of ExGen free cash flow to fund a dividend not covered by the utilities. We're comfortable with this dividend funding from ExGen, particularly considering that the 4-year needs are less than 10% of our total free cash flow generation. Finally, we plan to retire between $2.7 billion and $3.3 billion of debt which will be spread between ExGen and holding company at that. We'll continue to manage ExGen leverage to our 3x debt-to-EBITDA commitment. Turning to Slide 18, we've already shared with you the impact of tax reform on Exelon in our 8-K from January 5, but we want to highlight that we are clear beneficiary from tax reform and offer a few additional details. We expect to pass through meaningful savings to our utility customers across the different jurisdictions, reflecting the lower tax expense recoveries and the refund of deferred income tax regulatory liabilities, partially offset by the impacts of higher rate base. We're thrilled that our customers will benefit so much from tax reform. Our 2018 EPS guidance is inclusive of tax reform, and we expect a $0.10 per share uplift to 2019 earnings. Generation earnings will benefit from a 22% effective tax rate, the utilities will benefit from an increased rate base, up $2 billion by 2021; while the lower tax rate will create less tax shield for our holding company interest expense. We expect to be a very modest cash tax payer through 2021, and you can see the cash tax rates by year. We expect much stronger free cash flow from ExGen, with a lower tax rate and 100 -- it's 100% expensing of capital, which will more than cover the additional equity needs of the utilities associated with the increased rate base and we expect the consolidated metrics will remain largely unchanged as a result of tax reform. Our ExGen tax reform has a positive impact in 2018, with a more meaningful impact in the outer years that provides the company with additional financial flexibility. On utility side, we do see some modest erosion in network over debt, although all of our utilities remain at or above rating agency thresholds. We frequently made the case that our Generation business provides distinct competitive advantage to the overall company with the ability to recycle significant free cash flows. Our positive uplift to credit metrics and no need for external equity are additional examples relative to other utilities that are being pressured due to the tax reforms.  Turning to Slide 19, we remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet in our investment-grade credit rating. I hit on this in the previous slide, but we remain comfortably ahead of our corporate targets for FFO to debt and well above the downgrade thresholds. Looking at ExGen, we're well ahead of our debt-to-EBITDA targets in 2018. On a total basis, we expect to be at 2.5x debt-to-EBITDA and only 2x debt-to-EBITDA from a recourse debt perspective. We'll continue to manage our balance sheet in ExGen over time to the 3x debt-to-EBITDA levels. So look for us to set our debt reduction at both holding company and Genco. Turning to Slide 20, as Chris mentioned earlier, the board has decided to increase the dividend growth rate policy from 2.5% to 5% annually through 2020. Chris spoke to the positive business developments that gave us the confidence to increase our dividend growth rate to be more competitive with utility peers, so I want to take a moment to talk about our financial thought process. Slide 20 shows the hypothetical portion of the dividend being funded by the utilities, if we assume their piece of the dividend, it's based on a 70% payout ratio on utility, let's holding company expense. The residual dividend is then covered by ExGen. When we consider that the utilities are growing EPS at 68% per year, and represent the growing majority of our earnings, we're comfortably growing the dividend at 5% based on a 70% utility earnings payout ratio, we have to keep space with this earnings growth. On this approach, ExGen is funding around $0.20 of dividend depending on the year, which is a payout ratio in the teens of our 2018 EPS guidance for the business and substantially less amount on a free cash flow basis. We're very comfortable committing the small portion of ExGen's financial output to supporting the dividend and are excited to be returning more capital to our shareholders through the dividend. And now, I will now turn the call over to Joe Dominguez to walk through -- walk you through the latest on our regulatory and policy initiatives.
Joseph Dominguez: Thanks, Jack, and good morning, everyone. I'll cover Slides 21 and 22 of the materials. Since our last earnings call, we continue to see positive momentum for policy changes that at State, FERC and RTO levels. The value to 0 emission numbers will increase resources that benefit our customers and the environment levels. As Chris said on the call, we remain focused on three areas, first, ensuring that resilient resources are compensated fairly. Second addressing the price formation flaws that PJM has identified and spotted; and third, preserving and expanding state policy initiatives like the ZEC programs and include nuclear energy within the umbrella state-sponsored in the energy programs. I'll walk through each of these. On resilience, FERC issued its order on January 8 in response to the DOE number. Consistent with Exelon's recognitions, the order initiated a new resilience proceedings, and directed the RTOs to immediately examine grid resiliency and provide a report within 60 days. FERC noted that the report should include any recommended changes toward the [indiscernible]. In our filings at FERC, we urged the commission and the RTOs to be resilient as the broader scope of issues than with traditional reliability concerns that's centered around electric generation and transmission and unit performance and whatever does, in particular, as we've talked about in earlier calls, we urge FERC to consider the risk on a cash dating loss of the elect system caused by natural gas infrastructure failure. We expect that the resilience proceedings and tracking solutions will take some time, as Chris indicated earlier. The FERC's order clearly gives PJM the opportunity to address near-term solutions, including medium price formation reforms. PJM had said it can implement those reforms within the course of this calendar year. Based upon PJM's comments, including [indiscernible] the testimony before the Energy Committee of the U.S. Senate a week ago, we expect that PJM will continue to make a strong push for price formation reforms in its court filings. In terms of next steps, we continue to see two alternative pathways that are going to be more simultaneously. One, achieving a FERC-directed PJM filing as a by-product of the resilience docket; and two, a stakeholder process at PJM, followed by a 206 filing successful through its existing enhanced liaison committee process. PJM already has the price formation stakeholder process underway, and it is scheduled to conclude that process in the third quarter. In the meantime, PJM is pursuing more limited changes to price formation in the [indiscernible] docket for filings that are due next week. In summary, the commission's focus on resilience and the chairman's call for urgent action, coupled with PJM's commitment to address market for us, continues to give us confidence that reforms will be implemented in 2018. With that said, there's a lot of work ahead of us as PJM continues to engage with stakeholders and refine its proposal. Turning to the next slide in our outgoing efforts concerning state policies that value 0 emission nuclear resources, Jack already noted that we reached an important milestone last month in Illinois, with the completion of the state procurement process in New York ZEC and Quad Cities and Clinton. Now both the Illinois and New York programs are fully up and running. We remain confident that we'll successfully defend these legitimate state programs in Federal appeals courts and state courts because they preserve for our customers the lowest cost at most reliable 0 emission resources in the market. The New York and Illinois policy precedent that we established has been filed now with [indiscernible] and is under consideration in New Jersey and I'll talk about New Jersey in closing. As many of you know, the bill had made it through 2 committees in the New Jersey Legislature in late 2017. Votes were unanimous in support of the nuclear provisions. However, because then governor-elect Murphy had indicated a desire for more comprehensive package, a floor vote was not held. Since December, we've continued to work with our partners at PSEG and all stakeholders on new legislation. I can report that we are making big progress and I hope for legislative action in early 2018. And with that, let me turn it back over to Chris.
Christopher Crane: Thanks, Joe. Turning to the Slide 23. We have an updated -- we have updated some of the numbers behind our value proposition, which highlights our strategy and commitment to our shareholders. We will continue to focus on growing our utilities targeting 7.4% rate base growth and 6% to 8% EPS growth through 2021. Rolling forward, another year at above group trajectory. We continue to use our free cash flow from ExGen to fund these incremental equity needs at the utilities, pay down debt over the next 4 years at ExGen and the holding company, and one part of a faster dividend growth rate. We will continue to focus on optimizing value for our ExGen business by seeking fair compensation for our carbon-free Generation fleet in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, as we have done with the ZECs in New York and Illinois. We will continue to pursue adoption of price formation of PJM in resiliency initiatives at FERC; closing uneconomic plants, including GMI in 2019 and now an early retirement of Oyster Creek in 2018; selling assets where it make sense to accelerate our debt-reduction plans and maximizing value through our GEN to load matching strategy at Constellation. We continue to sustain strong investment-grade credit metrics, and now growing our dividend consistently at 5% through 2020. However, turning to Slide 24, I want to leave you with some key focus areas for 2018. We will continue to deliver operational excellence across all our businesses, focusing on modernizing the grid and improving our customer experience at the utilities, running our Generation fleet safely and reliably and same discipline in our retail business to capture fair margins. At utilities, we plan to invest $5.4 billion of capital to benefit our customers. We will file a total of 5 distribution rate cases with the goal of achieving our targeted 9% to 10% ROE across the utility families in 2019. In Generation, we will work to establish the PJM price formation changes in 2018, we will start working on a broader resiliency initiative at FERC, which will take more time. We'll continue to defend the Illinois and New York ZECs in courts and we'll work with our stakeholders to establish fair payment for the environmental attributes in our nuclear plants in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Financially, we will being to grow the dividend as discussed at 5% annually, continue to execute on our previously announced cost-management initiatives, and finally, we will continue with our corporate responsibility initiatives including the focus on gender parity issues through participation as the only energy company in the UN HeForShe campaign building on last year's expansion of pay leave policies and our signing of the Presidents Equal Pay Pledge. The strategy underpinning the value proposition we rolled out a couple of years ago is proving very robust. We are well positioned to capture additional upside and feel confident about the prospects for Exelon in 2018 and beyond. With the many successes we've had in recent years and the relative stock outperformance, we still believe our stock is undervalued in absolute terms and in particular, compared with our peers. We remain committed to optimize the value of our business and earning your ongoing support of for Exelon. Operator, we can now open it up to questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Greg with Evercore ISI.
Gregory Gordon: On the stock valuation, Chris, you and I definitely agree. A couple of questions. Just to be clear on the rollout of the 2020 disclosure, when we look at that, the lower gross margin associated with the TMI shutdown is actually earnings -- just to be clear, these are earnings-accretive, so we should think about the year-over-year to sort of negative comp as falling from the other 2 items? Is that correct?
Christopher Crane: The TMI, Greg, it is EPS accretive.
Gregory Gordon: So now that will be offset by $200 million of energy price and capacity revenues. But then, you also have the cost-cutting on Page 26 that we have to factor in to come up with a sort of a net impact from the Q3 call, right? There was a...
Jonathan Thayer: That's correct. So there's a full breakout of O&M expenses that we detailed in the appendix. You'll see the impact both in '18 as well as '19 and beyond from Oyster as well as TMI.
Gregory Gordon: Great. And you also said, you plan on retiring some impairment maturities now. Looking at the maturity schedule on Page 40, I see that Holdco, $6.3 billion of the Holdco debt, there's a $900 billion maturity -- $900 million maturity in 2020, $300 million in 2021. Should we think about that as the timing? Or is there other debt that's callable or revolver capacity that you can bring down in the interim?
Jonathan Thayer: I apologize I'm turning those slides. So in terms of the holding company maturities, you should expect us to tilt more heavily towards holding company in '20 and '21. You will also see us pull -- retire some 365-day paper we have in '18 that retires in '19 and then you'll see us work down the ExGen maturities as we get up the curve as well.
Gregory Gordon: Okay. So I have 1 for Joe Dominguez and 1 for Joe Nigro. Joe Dominguez, is it your expectation and, clearly, you can't speak for PJM. So is it your expectation to kind of get this stakeholder process completed at -- that may go through the enhanced liaison process? Or in fact, they would probably have to go through the enhanced liaison process to get a stakeholder process done in '18? Or is it too soon for us to sort of call that? And then the alternative, is it legally viable -- is the legally viable possibility that at the end of the resiliency proceedings that the FERC actually has the record in place to call PJM in to change its tariff?
Joseph Dominguez: Yes. Let me answer the second question first. And just simply say yes. I think they may have to open in different proceeding, but obviously, they could issue a 206 order at any point in time. And we believe that they have sufficient record already to do so. Very clearly, PJM is going to supplement that record here in March, and I expect that other parties in their response, 30 days later, will do the same. Greg, it's my expectation that PJM is going to continue to their urge for us to do exactly that, to give it some direction to come in and resolve the price formation issues that it's identified. But at the same time, they have this alternative pathway that they're going to walk down in parallel with when they conclude the stakeholder process. And my expectation is that as the order of the tariffs that PJM continues to believe that they have significant price formation flaws. And they've said that repeatedly in many forums, then the next step for them is to bring it to FERC and utilize the enhanced Liaison Committee process if the stakeholder process doesn't work.
Gregory Gordon: And then for Joe Nigro, the initial option parameters for the next capacity auction came out several days ago. There was a significant change in FERC capacity and into ComEd. And some concern from investors that perhaps, that would disadvantage the incumbent generation vis-à-vis your capacity price outcomes. Can you give us some color on your thinking there?
Joseph Nigro: Greg, we expected to see an increase in both into Eastern PJM and into ComEd and increase into the import capability and it may have been slightly higher than what we expected. There were obviously other variable changes as well, when you think about the increase and the impact all of the things equal that could have on the demand curve and shifting the demand curve. We're still, like everyone else, in analyzing this. I think at the end of the day, that what's we've said for years. The big thing it's just going to come down to bidding behavior and it always does. So I -- there's a lot of variables in play here, including those changes to the imports, but the bidding behavior won't matter.
Joseph Dominguez: It's Joe Dominguez, if I can just chime in. That sequel has moved around over the last few auctions. So we're going 1.7 gigawatts the other way now. A year ago, we had two options to go, 1 gigawatt of that was already in the transmission limit. So we've seen the zone separately toward work with these higher [indiscernible] numbers.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Julien Dumoulin: I wanted to follow up a little bit more strategically on the ExGen side. Obviously, well done on Handley. Curious as to your thoughts about the desire to hold on to the Texas combined cycles. Can you read into some of the commentary around the desired to back that Constellation here? Or is there still kind of a broader thought process around looking for Generation we just kind of wanted you to elaborate on that.
Christopher Crane: Those assets, as we've discussed in the past, are highly efficient and they're very good match for our load book in Texas. The capabilities, that we have, that heat rates on the ramping, they are very practical. Their capacity factors have been some of the highest for the CCGTs in Texas. So we'll continue to operate in this part of the fleet and be able to reap the benefits of their efficiency as we manage that book in Texas. As always, we look at all of our assets on an annual basis, but the previous review of those assets said they're more valuable in the fleet than not.
Julien Dumoulin: Right. And then secondly, I know you commented on New Jersey with respect to legislation. But can you comment a little bit on how the Oyster Creek development reflects on the profitability of the nuclear units in that region? Just curious if you can give us a little bit of a sense of the latest on those assets and the profitability, maybe from an ROE perspective. Obviously, your peer in the region comments on that thing and current.
Christopher Crane: The Oyster Creek decision was simply a site-specific. The market has tightened over the years in that location. But running at another year with losses in the investments that we would had to have made, was not financially prudent. Knowing that the reliability in the system can be sustained in that area without that asset, we're comfortable in, most importantly, we have an employee transition program that we're implementing that allows us, for those that are not at retirement and wish to retire, ability to grow into the rest of our vast fleet and continue to pursue their career. So employee-wise, right thing to do. Moving forward, allowing people to make the transition. And economic-wise, no sense in continuing for losses for another year. So it was an easy decision. The other assets have been openly discussed, as the challenges happen in that part of the market. And that's why we're pursuing and supporting our co-owner on that legislative agenda.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Stephen with Morgan Stanley.
Stephen Byrd: Just wanted to hit on the retail business and just overall, get your sense for the competitive environment in the retail business. Any trends you're seeing on that side of the business?
Joseph Dominguez: Steven, its Joe. I'll talk a bit briefly about that. You see the metrics on our business on Slide 7 and Jack talk to those in his comments -- prepared comments. And we still have the best and the largest customer-facing business in the industry and as recently is late December, and early January, our generation to load strategy continues to serve us well. The market remains competitive. It's still too early to see if what if any impact, the current cold snap or the previous cold snap had on competitive behavior. As we've said all along, we're going to remain disciplined to what we think is fair pricing and not just chase volume. What we have seen now from competitors, which is kind of interesting, is two things. One is, we've seen one of our large competitors back away in certain regions from selling a full pitched price for requirements products to the customers. And we will continue to do that as we have historically, and one that obviously all the commitments we have. In addition to that, we've seen some of our competitors try to pass through cost that we've honored through our contractual arrangements with our customers costs that we will bear. So I won't say we've seen the competitive aspect if the market change. And as I said, we'll remain disciplined, but we have seen some things from competitors that we haven't seen in the recent past, which may or may not lead to different outcomes in future.
Stephen Byrd: Very helpful color. And just shifting over to the ZEC litigation in Illinois. We continue to sort of like your overall legal position. It seems like there's some chance that the court might actually kick the decision over the FERC effectively. Is that a fair reading as interims of a possibility? And what's your sense in terms of your outlook should sort of the decision go back to FERC?
Joseph Dominguez: It's Joe Dominguez. Let me address the last one. I think all of the 5 FERC commissioners were asked during -- or excuse me, the 4 new commissioners were asked during confirmation hearings what their view is concerning the state programs. They've all indicated that they did not see the situation as something where FERC needed to really put a hold to these programs or claim preemption but rather that they could use tools like mitigation to address any impacts in the market. So we would expect that if the matter does go over to FERC consistent with the new testimony before the U.S. Senate, the commissioners would indicate that they could mitigate the market through their existing tools of that they would not be in favor of preemption. And quite obviously, plaintiffs in Illinois feel the same way and they've urged the court not to send it to FERC for that reason. In terms of your reading the argument, I think you're exactly right. [Indiscernible] brought in this question of primary jurisdiction which is a discretionary tool that allows the court has its discretion to send the matter to FERC. At this point, both parties agree to that.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Steve with Wolfe Research.
Steven Fleishman: So first on the may be high level at ExGen. So obviously, you have the gross margin numbers and then 2020, they fall sort of out. Is it fair to say kind of at the high level, all the below the line stuff O&M interest as you're paying down debt, depreciation as your closing plants, or all those kind of offset? So you'll end up mitigating some chunk of that gross margin hit?
Jonathan Thayer: Steve, so if you look at Slide 54, we provide the additional ExGen modeling data. And as we look at the ExGen's EPS profile out the curve, to your point, the lower depreciation, the lower operating O&M all leads to these retirements being accretive. So we should see strong and better than last quarter performance anticipated from ExGen as we look out the ERP.
Steven Fleishman: Okay. And then one other question, just in the event that the energy price formation changes are just done at PJM through the enhanced liaison process, could you just clarify that the time frame on that in process?
Christopher Crane: So again this is, as Greg said earlier, ultimately PJM's discretion when to pull the trigger on that. But right now, it's said to conclude its stakeholder process in Q3. At that point, PJM will have all the input from stakeholders. And as usual, we want to refine its proposals along the way. And at that point, in our view, we'll be in a position to make a filing with FERC.
Steven Fleishman: And then how long FERC takes to rule, I guess, depends on -- that's FERC's call?
Christopher Crane: That's FERC's call. This is a 206 proceeding so there's no mandatory clock like we see in the 205 proceedings.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Michael with Credit Suisse.
Michael Weinstein: Hey, the target for ExGen is still 3.0 debt-to-EBITDA. Is that -- I mean considering that you're already below that, is that something that used to come down at some point? Or is there a reason why it would increase over time?
Jonathan Thayer: So Michael, as you see the gross margin expectations for -- and EBITDA expectations for the ExGen business go down, that 2x nonrecourse or 2x recourse debt-to-EBITDA, 2.5x gross debt-to-EBITDA number will move up. We will be paying down debt as maturities come, but we'll also be shifting our focus to the holding company that using the flexibility we have around strong balance sheet of ExGen to target retirements of other portion of our good amount of holding company bonds as they mature.
Michael Weinstein: I see. I mean what's the purpose of having a 3.0 target? Is there something you're trying to achieve with ExGen at that point?
Jonathan Thayer: I think differentiation from our IPP peers, we have, I believe, the strongest balance sheet in the integrated space. That takes the risk of that overhang that we've seen, come pop up from time-to-time among semesters off the table that positions us to maintain a strong investment-grade rating from all the agencies. It's an important competitive advantage in the Constellation business. And as we clarified, the longevity of these nuclear assets, we believe, over time, that while we trade currently at 5x EBITDA from valuation standpoint, we are making the case that we should trade in line with our IPP peers, which should be 7x to 8x. So and the market is not recognizing that now, but certainly it's all part of our strategy to accomplish that.
Michael Weinstein: Great that you guys mentioned the enhanced liaison process. Just wondering, if that's something that you simply expect PJM to use? Or is that's something that PJM is telling you they will be using for sure?
Joseph Dominguez: As I said in earlier, PJM has made no announcement in that regard. The point I'm trying to make here is that PJM and a lot of different audiences has now come forward and said we have major flaw in price formation. And the PJM work historically, where it has significant issues in its market design faster performance being the most recent example. As we use the enhanced liaison committee process mechanism to get matters to FERC where stakeholders can agree on supporting a particular proposal. Given the gravity of this issue on the significance of it, and its connection to the resilience issues that FERC is already looking at, it would be our expectation that PJM would follow its strong words to the U.S. Senate, to FERC and others, and proceed to making a filing at the conclusion of the stakeholder process. That's the point I'm making.
Operator: And our final question comes from Jonathan with Deutsche Bank.
Jonathan Arnold: Strategy-wise, I mean, Chris, Jack, you've both alluded to the value disconnect. And it's hard to imagine that you could be doing that much more to execute the current plan, which seems to be going along. What's your level of patience to see the market reflect this under the current kind of dual strategy and just can you give us a refresh on how you're thinking?
Christopher Crane: As I've talked about this for a couple of years, our patience is probably not at a high point. But we understand it's our responsibility to deliver on these results and improve the [indiscernible]. We took on 5.5 years ago the road to greater regulated revenues coming in, greater certainty around balance sheet, total optimization of the gen-to-load match at Constellation, while running a world-class operations and efficient from a cost-standpoint operations. And today's call, reflects that. But let me go a little bit further, and take a minute to give you more details on why we see our stock undervalued. Simplistically, with the $3.05 midpoint for our 2018 EPS, the stock trades at around 12% PE versus our cheapest comp at peg, which is 15% and the regulated utility complex around 16%. Even on a consensus for 2019 and 2020, we trade around 12% to 13% versus peg, roughly around 15%, and the utilities, roughly around 15% to 16%. With our dividend growth at a competitive 5% rate, a 3.7% dividend yield is similar to much of the others in the group. And our utility operations accounting for 70% of the 2020 EPS, if you're using midpoint of our utility guidance range and consolidated Exelon estimates from the Street. We look more similar to the business model to our peers than the 2% to 4% PE multiple discount that's -- that we see or suggested. If you think about our valuation, looking at the business is more specifically, our regulated utilities less holding company expense implies a fair market value of $31 to $32 per share using a consensus PE in 2019 and 2020. When I think about our utilities growth base, at 7%, our EPS growth at 6% to 8%, which we expect to continue, and we have, through this conversation, next year from lower risk T&D utilities having the mechanisms covering 70% of our rate base additions that and 70% of our load decoupled, so we have less volumetric risk, but collective -- our collective earnings of 9.5% ROE, with strong credit metrics exceeding agency requirements. And doing all this without meeting outside equity to fund any of this growth. I think they should be treated as a premium utilities for the valuation, but the $31 to $32 is based off a peer valuation, which leaves us with an implied value of ExGen of approximately $4 per share, which we believe is entirely too low. The implied multiples for the business at around 6x PE and 5x EBIT and EBITDA, respectively, using our disclosure in the Street estimates, looking at the IPP is trading at 7 to 8x EBITDA today, we try to bridge the valuation disconnects, especially when you consider our leverages well below our 3x net to EBITDA target at 2.5x and it's really running at about 2x on recourse debt. Our FFO debt is going to stay north of 40% -- FFO to debt ratio is going to stay north of 40% due to planning horizon as ZEC programs in New York and Illinois have preserved most of our at-risk nuclear plants in our Constellation business provides a gen-to-load match advantage and our discipline around bidding margins is proving wise again as we are starting to hear others taking on pay in the recent months. Our free cash flow Generation from this business is $7.6 billion over the next 4 years, which represents more than half of the implied enterprise value at ExGen where the assets with operational visibility well into the 2030s. We believe we have done a lot of -- in this in the past years to create value for the shareholders, where the stock is outperformed. We do not see the share price reflecting anywhere near the value we see. We are focused on executing this long-term commitments in our value proposition and near term, our 2018 business priorities, which we believe will deliver substantial value to our investors. So yes, I feel strongly about the stock being achievable.
Jonathan Arnold: You sound impatient with the market too to me.
Christopher Crane: Jonathan, that doesn't even build in the fact that where there is price formation in New Jersey, the facts, in fact there are lot of incremental catalysts even beyond the robust story that Chris just described in the valuation where we currently see. So this is the strongest, long-range plan that we've had since coming together as Constellation and Exelon. And we're excited about the outlook, the market is just not paying for it right now.
Jonathan Arnold: What kind of agree with you, but I guess, so how long do you give us?
Christopher Crane: But we're not going anywhere.
Operator: And at this time, I would like to turn it back over to Chris Crane for any closing remarks.
Christopher Crane: Well, again I want to thank you all for participating today. I want to thank the team here and the employees of Exelon for really delivering on a strategy that's taken a few years to get here, but we are operating in all cylinders and appreciate the dedication. So with that, I'll close it out and thank you.
Operator: And this concludes today's conference call. We thank you for your participation, and ask that you please disconnect your line.

Operator: Good morning. Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Exelon Corporation 2017 Q3 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Dan Eggers, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for Exelon, you may begin your conference.
Dan Eggers: Thank you, Tony. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Leading the call today are Chris Crane, Exelon’s President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Thayer, Exelon’s Chief Financial Officer. They’re joined by other members of Exelon’s senior management team who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. We issued our earnings release this morning along with the presentation, both of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of Exelon’s website. The earnings release and other matters which we discuss during today’s call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today’s material and comments made during this call. Please refer to today’s 8-K and Exelon’s other SEC filings for discussions of risk factors and factors that may cause results to differ from management’s projections, forecasts and expectations. Today’s presentation also includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for reconciliations between the non-GAAP measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures. I’ll now turn the call over to Chris Crane, Exelon’s CEO.
Chris Crane: Thanks, Dan, and good morning and thank you, all, for joining us. We had a solid third quarter of 2017, with GAAP earnings of $0.85 per share, up versus the prior year. Our adjusted EPS was $0.85 as well, reaching the midpoint of our guidance. Strong utility and Genco performance more than offset headwinds from the mild summer weather that impacted our PECO, ACE utilities as well as volumes at Constellation. As we head into year-end, we have a lot to be encouraged about. Our regulatory utilities are continuing to execute very well, running ahead of plan for the year operationally, we are performing in top quartile across most performance measures. We are registering significant improvements at PHI, even relative to last year. We are doing exactly what we said we would do as part of our merger commitments, improving performance and reliability for our customers. We are executing on our CapEx program for 2017. We’re excited about the valuable technologies investments we’re deploying to our customers’ benefit. The FERC is making strides to address pressing resiliency needs for the power system, we see that in a two-step process. Starting with empowering PJM to fix deficiencies in the power price formation by the summer of 2018, and then a longer term FERC process to address resiliency. The Department of Energy Section 403 filing noted a clause in the current price formation are part of the reason that nuclear units, the most resilient and cost effective Zero Emission resources in PJM are being lost of premature retirements. Given our size of our PJM fleet, each dollar or megawatt hour of distortion caused by a flood market design undermines the Genco’s economics by approximately $135 million per year on an unhedged basis. We believe that DOE’s focus on price formation will lead to a successful process at FERC that will eliminate these distortions by the summer of 2018. We have not reflected the value of these reforms in our forecast that we’re showing you today, but we do believe they could be a significant positive for us starting in 2018. Finally, we are executing on our management plan, focused on strengthening our operation and continuing to find efficiencies. To that end, we lowered our costs by $250 million on a run-rate basis in 2020, primarily at the Genco, including today’s announcement we’re in our cost, our O&M cost versus planned by over $700 million annually from initiatives identified since 2015. We continue to challenge our businesses to evaluate cost and today’s announcements savings are part of that ongoing effort. We’re confident in our previous announced plan to generate $6.8 billion of free cash flow at the Genco through 2020. That will fund our utility growth, grow the dividend and meet our debt reduction commitments. It is this deliberate work that positions us well to face some headwinds. After a series of mild summers and winters, we have seen decline in power market volatility, which is weighing on the forward price – power prices, impacting the Constellation business. Just as we experienced during periods of low volatility, we’re again seeing less disciplined by some of the wholesale and retail competitors in the market as they become more aggressive with their pricing. We have been through low discipline, low volatility periods before, and they end up in the same way. Those without discipline fail, that is when we can grow our market share by winning business a good margins or acquiring low business is offered for sale. We expect volatility to return to the markets with normal weather conditions, which will benefit our Constellation and Generation business. In the meantime, we remain disciplined in our bidding strategy and remain behind our ratable hedging in our generation. Last week, the Illinois Power Authority shifted its schedule for finalizing the procurement of the Illinois ZEC contracts by one month from late December 2017 to late January of 2018. Based on our assumptions, this delay will shift $0.09 of EPS from 2017 to 2018. Even with the unanticipated EPS shift, we’re narrowing our 2017 guidance to $2.55 to $2.75 per share, keeping us on path to the midpoint of our original guidance at the utilities outperformed our plan. Moving on to Slide 6, I want to highlight our excellent operational performance for the quarter. The color block chart continues to show strong quartile – top quartile performance across all of the utilities in most categories. I particularly want to call out the tremendous improvements at PHI compared to last year. With the 22% improvement in reliability, with PHI on track for their best year ever in reliability and a 17% improvement in speed of restoration of outages. Performance improvements like these really highlight the benefits going to our customers with the integration of PHI into Exelon. And finally, as in prior quarters, our best-in-class nuclear and power fleets performed with very high reliability in the quarter. Moving to Slide 7. Now let me turn to the proposed rule issued by Secretary Perry in September. The order is aimed at protecting our customers from outages, resulting from man-made and natural interruptions on the gas system by preserving resilient generation sources, including nuclear. We commend the Secretary for focusing attention on the need to reform the energy markets, and ensure that our customers continue to benefit from the resilient system. FERC is currently considering the DOE’s proposal, with the first round of comments filed on October 21, reply comments due on November 7 and the final order scheduled for December 11. We have shared our perspective on this important policy initiative. First, we think the FERC should direct PJM to evaluate and correct any deficiencies they see in energy price formation, which have put baseload generation asset at a disadvantage. We believe timely action on price formation could be implemented by as early as mid-2018. These reforms will be valuable first step in preserving resilient baseload generation as well as delivering economic and environmental benefits, the nuclear power uniquely provide. We expect 135 terawatt hours of our generation output in PJM to benefit from price uplift that were layer in over coming years at the existing hedges roll off. Second, we think FERC can take on – take the time to fully evaluate market reforms that will ensure power supply resiliency. This is a multi-fast that exercise that should take into account the cost and impact to our customers and economy of the long-term interruption of a natural gas fuel supply – interruption of the natural gas fuel supply. We believe these are important issues that need to be addressed for our country’s future, but they require more analysis to ensure the right reforms are implemented. We are encouraged by the process being made at FERC and PJM, support for price formation changes. Between these efforts and state initiatives, we’re optimistic about the path to preserve nuclear power plants and their critical economic environmental and reliability roles that they have in the communities that we serve. I’ll now turn the call over to Jack to take us through the numbers.
Jack Thayer: Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 8. For the third quarter, our adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings were $0.85 per share, which was at the midpoint of our guidance range of $0.80 to $0.90 per share. Exelon’s utilities less Holdco expenses delivered a combined $0.49 per share. Versus our plan, utility results were slightly favorable due to lower O&M and reduced storm activity over the third quarter. Generation earned $0.36 per share, which was a little behind our plan. The third quarter was hurt by mild weather that reduced Constellation load volumes and a lack of price volatility, which reduced optimization opportunities. We did offset some weakness for payable O&M timing. Turning to Slide 9. Our $0.85 per share in the third quarter of this year was $0.06 per share lower than the third quarter of 2016. Overall, utilities benefited from improved earned ROEs and higher rate base, partly offset by adverse year-over-year weather impacts. ExGen was down primarily on lower power prices, lower load volumes due to mild weather and fewer optimization opportunities, partially offset by the addition of New York ZEC revenue and higher capacity prices. Turning to Slide 10. We are updating our 2017 guidance range. We had expected the Illinois power authority to finalize procurement for the ZEC programs in December, which based on our assumptions, would have contributed $0.09 of EPS in 2017 since the revenues are retroactive to the beginning of program on June 1. However, last week, the Illinois power authority updated their schedule pushing the final contract date to January 30, 2018. The delayed timing has no impact on the amount we expect to receive or our free cash flow outlook. But it will change the timing of earnings recognition, shifting EPS into 2018. With that in mind, we are updating our 2017 EPS guidance range, heightening the top and bottom of the range by a nickel. So we’re now at $2.55 to $2.75 per share. Strong performance of utilities is allowing us to still target the midpoint of our original guidance range of absorbing the $0.09 of ZEC timing impact. Moving to Slide 11. Our utilities continue to execute delivering strong earned returns in the quarter, in addition to the robust operational performance Chris already discussed. Looking at the trailing 12 month book ROEs, we saw improvement at PHI compared to last quarter across all jurisdictions except ACE, where they roll out favorable weather in the third quarter of 2016 for the less beneficial summer weather this year. Our efforts to improve operations and the contributions from the rate cases resolved over the past year are driving a better earned ROEs at PHI. For the legacy Exelon utilities, our earned ROEs remained over 10%, but abated a bit from last quarter with less favorable year-over-year weather impacts at ComEd and PECO that you can see on Slide 9 quarter call. Overall Exelon utilities ROEs are still nearly 10%, including PHI. We’re proud of the performance of our overall utility business and we still see opportunity to improve our returns at the PHI utilities as we bring their performance to levels more consistent with the rest of our utilities. On Slide 12, we update the status of our rate cases. At Atlantic City Electric, we reached a settlement for the second case in a row. The settlement provides a 4% rate increase, with new rates implemented earlier than what would have occurred if the case was fully litigated. The timing rate making in New Jersey is helping us make beneficial investments for our customers. While still a work-in-progress, the investments are having an impact with outages down 33% and average customer outage time down 35% compared to 2011. We also received an order for Pepco Maryland that granted an electric distribution base rate increase of $32.4 million based on an allowed ROE of 9.5%. The improved electric delivery rates became effective on October 20, 2017. We filed rate cases in the third quarter for Delmarva Delaware electric and gas and expect orders by the third quarter of 2018. We’re proud of the hard work from our utilities and regulatory teams. These efforts are helping to bring PHI’s earned ROEs allowed levels while we simultaneously improve performance for our customers. More details on the rate cases and their schedules can be found on Slides 34 to 42 in the Appendix. Turning to Slide 13. We regularly update you on our progress on the regulatory front, but another essential aspect of the business is a effectively deploying capital on behalf of our customers. We’re currently on course to deploy our targeted $5.3 billion of capital in 2017. We’ve highlighted on this slide, two of the many notable projects we’re developing to benefit our communities and customers. The first is Pepco’s Waterfront Substation. This substation is part of the larger capital grid project and is currently under construction with expected completion in 2017. Once complete, it will improve reliability to existing customers and support the plan growth in the Capitol Riverfront and Southwest Waterfront areas in the next 20 to 30 years. The other project I’d like to highlight is ComEd’s Grand Prairie Gateway transmission line that was energized earlier this year. It’s a $200 million, 60 mile-long transmission line in Northern Illinois that provide structural benefits to the market, resulting in lower energy and congestion charges to customers and an increased import capability of approximately 1,000 megawatts. Over the next 15 years, customers collectively will save over $120 million and carbon emissions will be reduced by nearly 500,000 tons. These are just a couple of examples of how we continue to invest prudently across all our utilities and look forward to sharing more as we go forward. Slide 14 provides our gross margin update for ExGen. Before I get into the market developments impacting gross margins, let me first discuss the impacts from a shift and revenue recognition for the Illinois ZEC from 2017 to 2018, which we also show in the Waterfalls in Slide 21 in the appendix. The capacity in ZEC line declines by $150 million in 2017 and increases by a $150 million in 2018, offset by $50 million in other capacity declines, which I’ll discuss in a moment. The rest of the bars help to then isolate movements in underline gross margin not related to ZEC timing. In 2017, gross margin is down $50 million compared to last quarter, partially reflecting the effect of the mild summer and reduced optimization opportunities. We are highly hedged for the rest of this year and are well balanced for our generation to load matching strategy. Turning to 2018 and 2019, separate from the Illinois ZEC timing, our gross margin is down $200 million for each year and can be bucketed into two categories. The first relates business and our unhedged power position. We are lowering our assumptions from MISO and New York capacity prices based on recent spot year options and bilateral fields in the market. This lower the capacity in ZEC line by $50 million on a rounded basis from last quarter. For 2018, the line shows up as a positive $100 million after the timing uplift from $150 million of Illinois ZEC, while the $50 million decline in 2019 just reflects the lower outlook for past revenues. During the third quarter, we also saw declines in energy prices, including some adverse news and basis differentials in the PJM east sum, which costs another $50 million in 2018 and 2019. However, with the recent rally in power prices, we have already recovered about half of the $100 million of 2019 gross margin declines for Generation. We also see $100 million decline in gross margins in 2018 and 2019 from the Constellation business, reflected in the lower power new business to go live. A series of mild summers and winters have contributed to reduced power market volatility, which in turn is impacting the competitiveness of our load business. As we’ve witnessed in prior periods with low price volatility, some of our competitors are mispricing risk in an effort to win business. In the wholesale load business, we’re seeing other players mispricing risks as we consider the market risk from weather volatility, basis variability and the likely impact of energy market reforms that Chris talked about earlier. Against this backdrop, we are clearing at margins near the low end of historical realizations. In the C&I business, the consolidation of the suppliers since the polar vortex has led to better margin discipline with unit margins holding consistent with prior years. We are however, seeing revenue renewal rates compared to last couple of years, moving from something closer to 80% to low 70%. These lower renewal rates, we still expect our volumes to be flat year-over-year whereas our previous guidance assumes higher renewal rates that will drive volume growth to Constellation in 2018 and 2019. Notably, even against the challenged market backdrop, we’re holding volumes and margins flat, which is a testament to the strength of our retail platform and our disciplined approach to bidding business. The updated gross margins for 2018 and 2019 incorporates C&I renewal rates from the low 70s and the wholesale margins hovering around the bottom end of what we’ve realized over time. We’ve been through these periods of low load pricing, lower load price in the past and as previously created opportunities for us. A return to normal weather will inject some power market volatility, which will positively impact forward power prices for Generation. Retailers and wholesalers in mispriced risk have consistently been driven from the business when we go from a period of low volatility to a volatility event. When the market corrects, we’ll be there to win business at good margins and grow volumes and market share, just as we had in the past. Even against the current market backdrop, Constellation continues to generate strong earnings and free cash flow. Our gen-to-load matching strategy remains it competitive advantage relative to our peers, contributing positive margin and providing a vehicle to bring our generation output to market in a disciplined manner. From a hedging perspective, we ended the quarter approximately 11% to 14% behind our ratable hedging program in 2018 and 10% to 13% behind ratable in 2019 when considering cross-commodity hedges. We remain comfortable being more open when we look at market fundamentals. Spot natural gas prices this year at $3 per Mcf, which is $0.50 higher than last year in spite of mild weather this past winter and summer. However, these higher prices have provided only modest uplift to spot power prices this summer, while the forward prices have decreased slightly. We think that a return to more normal weather and volatility in the market will help reverse this. And as Chris discussed, we see a path power market reforms that represent real value uplift for us. We’re maintaining a additional link to be able to monetize these reforms. Turning to Slide 15. We continually challenge our organization to find operating efficiencies and focus on managing our cost. To that end, we’re announcing another wave of O&M cost reductions, building on previous years’ efforts. We will ramp these new initiatives over the next two years, as shown on the lower-right table, reaching a $250 million annual run rate in 2020. The savings will come primarily from ExGen and the corporate center. If you look at this initiative together with the programs we’ve announced since 2015, we’ll strip out over $700 million of annual run rate cost providing significant earnings of free cash flow benefits. Turning to Slide 16. We appreciate that there are many puts and takes this year in ExGen, but have both benefited on our free cash flow outlook through 2020. When we take into account the movement in power price forwards through the end of October, updated gross margin outlook for Constellation, the benefit of further cost cuts, the early closure of TMI and exit of EGTP plants and changes to base CapEx in working capital associated with all these business updates, we remain confident in the free cash flow outlook and capital allocation commitments we made at the beginning of the year. We’re also committed to meeting or beating our 3 times debt-to-EBITDA target for ExGen’s balance sheet, which we will meet over planning horizon. On the fourth quarter call, we will roll forward the free cash flow outlook for the next planning period. And with that, I’ll turn the call back to Chris.
Chris Crane: Thanks, Jack. Turning to Slide 17, I want to take a moment to highlight the contributions made by Exelon and our employees to help the impact by hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria. Exelon utilities sent more than 2,200 employees and contractors and support personnel from our six utilities to help with the recovery efforts at Hurricane Irma. Our crews travel to Florida and Georgia where they, for more than two weeks, worked in very difficult conditions. We’re very proud of our employees and the hard work that they do to help the communities come back from after these disasters. A very special thanks to all those who helped in the restoration and support efforts. Exelon employees also stepped up from a volunteer perspective. Our employees have donated their time and resources to communities impacted by the storms. We also had a number of our Constellation employees in Houston directly displaced by the storms and to see coworkers come to their aid illustrates the value that we embody here at Exelon. Slide 18, we want to reinforce our value proposition, which remains the foundation of our commitment to our investors. We’ve continued to grow the utilities rate base at 6.5% and the regulated EPS to 6% to 8% annually through 2020, underpinning the capital investments that directly benefit the customers in each of our jurisdictions. We continue to use free cash flow generated at the Genco to fund incremental equities at the utilities and pay down debt over the next four years at ExGen in the holding company. We’re focused on optimizing the value of our ExGen business by seeking fair compensation for our carbon-free generation fleet, closing uneconomic plants, selling assets where it makes sense to accelerate our debt reduction plans, and maximizing our value through gen-to-load matching strategies. We continue to focus on sustaining strong investment-grade credit metrics and grow our dividend in a stable consistent manner. As many of you are aware, our dividend growth as of October end gets for 2.5% annually from 2016 through 2018. We are working with our board and expect to provide an update on a multiyear outlook for the dividend growth plan as part of our planning and budgeting process that are undertaking currently. Before I go to questions, I want to come back to where we started off in the call. We have a number of positives underlying our outlook. The utilities are growing and executing well. We are confident that the FERC actions around resiliency will facilitate needed power price reforms in PJM that will fairly compensate our generating assets. We continue to improve operations where we’re finding ways to run our business more efficiently and taking out an additional $250 million in cost as discussed. And we’re still on track to generate $6.8 billion of free cash flow through 2020 at ExGen that will support our utility growth, reduce our debt and facilitate growing our dividend. Thank you again for your interest and now we’re ready for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon from Evercore ISI.
Chris Crane: Hey, Greg good morning.
Greg Gordon: So just to summarize here, you gave us a negative adjustment on several – I think ExGen that totaled $200 million, but since that mark, you’ve seen $50 million come back. So 2019 is negative $150 million and if you achieved your cost-cutting goals, you essentially have eliminated that. And so we’re at the push in 2019 with those offset, is that correct?
Jack Thayer: Yes, Greg. And I think as you think about it and you listen on our comments on the low volatility period we’re in, we believe that with the return to normal weather and even potentially future volatility events that, that’s decline in Constellation business could prove temporary. Obviously, the $250 million are permanent cost savings and capitalize all in terms of value creation.
Greg Gordon: Okay. So as per usual protocol, you’re using the current forward curves for power – what the current margin outlook looks like for retail, you’re not assuming any changes, no volatility premium coming back in the market, no PJM price reform, et cetera?
Joe Dominguez: Hi, Greg its Joe. Yes, we are using the current forward curves for power. I think the big thing to note on the retail side and Jack said this in his script, when we did our planning at the first of the year, our renewal rates for C&I power were up close to 80%. As was the case back in 2012 and 2013, we have seen a downturn in most renewal rates down close to the 70%. And we’re marking this closer to that 70% number. I think the big thing though is back in 2012 and 2013, we saw power – C&I power margins dipped below $2 per megawatt hour. And we’ve said historically our origination margins for that business are somewhere between $2 and $4. We’re still within that $2 to $4 range. So I think the big thing, the takeaway is, we’re going to serve about 200 million-megawatt hours of load this year across our platform between retail and wholesale. And we expect to do the same thing next year. The thing is, we’re just not going to achieve the growth that we expected in our C&I power business. And as Chris said and Jack said, the reason for that is, we don’t think it’s prudent to chase the market. And we’re going to remain disciplined what we think value is and that has served us well historically and quite frankly, has allowed us to acquire companies a few times as well. So we’ll continue to remain disciplined.
Greg Gordon: Thanks. Sorry, go ahead.
Chris Crane: I’ve just said so, the beginning of the question, all the numbers that you hear are on the gross margin are marked at the end of third quarter. So it’s the end of September 29 or 31, whatever the market closed on.
Greg Gordon: Got you. One – two more questions. One, looking at Slide 20, your cash flow profile, looks slightly better and looks like it’s mainly coming from the utilities and specifically from ComEd. Can you comment on what the changes in the improved cash flow profile there?
Chris Crane: So it’s primarily related to the collection of the ZEC regulatory asset as well as cash taxes.
Greg Gordon: Okay. Final question, when looking at your – at the value proposition you guys are delivering, if we get PJM price formation improvements and you hit on your other financial goals, you’ll start to have a earnings growth profile that looks more comparable to the regulated peer group. They trade at 18 times earnings you’re trading at 14 times current expectations. But your dividend growth – their dividend growth rates average around 5% and yours is 2.5%. I know you said you’re reviewing this, but what do you need to see in terms of your financial outlook to be able to close or eliminate that dividend growth half gap, because I think it’s one amongst several things that keeps your stock from trading at a higher valuation?
Chris Crane: Yes, great. We do believe we’re undervalued. And everything that we’re doing is to drive that improvement in valuation. As you can see from the free cash flow, the debt reduction plan, the recovery and rate case, we’re positioning ourselves much better for a potential to have the board conversation in the upcoming LRP planning process to evaluate the dividend. And our expectation is – and has been since we have to cut the dividend four years ago is to get it back to build the business on a strong balance sheet to get the dividend to be in line with our peers. And that is our pursuit and as you can see from these numbers, things are improving that have us – able to have a much more positive conversation with the board. Ultimately, it’s the board’s discretion, but that’s where we want to be.
Greg Gordon: Thank you very much. Have a great morning.
Chris Crane: Thanks, Greg.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold from Deutsche Bank.
Jonathan Arnold: Good morning, guys.
Chris Crane: Good morning.
Jonathan Arnold: I wanted to just make sure, at the beginning, Chris, I believe you just gave $1 of market price improvement sensitivity based of your volumes to PJM price reform was $135 million. Did I hear that correctly?
Chris Crane: Yes. For a $1 of fully opened position in PJM, 135 terawatt hours, $135 million, so you can – that was just the dollar reference.
Jonathan Arnold: Okay. So my question is, I mean, as you look at the kinds of reforms that PJM is considering in flexible unit and the like, what’s your view of the range of potential uplift to any translated into ATC basis that we would rather than view?
Joe Dominguez: Hey Jonathan, this is Joe. We’re still waiting to see some additional details from PJM. But – and so we’re not going to put out a number until we get all of those details. But I have seen the reports that a number of you have compiled on this subject with the range that is somewhere between $2 and $5 ATC movement as a result of the elimination and discrimination. And I think that’s the right range to be thinking about and probably the middle part of that range makes a lot of sense to us.
Jonathan Arnold: Okay, that’s helpful. Thank you for that. And then Chris, you’ve said, I think earlier in the year, this dividend revisit in the longer-range growth outlook would be a Q1. And I believe what you’ve just said is pretty consistent with that if you do at is part of the LRP. Is that correct?
Chris Crane: Yes. I think we’ve said back in 2016 when we have our dividend strategy, we want to give you a multi-year plan. We gave you 2016 through 2018. That would be the time in the first quarter to be updating, in my belief, set the board’s discussion, and where we go with that, but that would be our timing in my mind in our current plans and communicating with all of you.
Jonathan Arnold: What should we be expecting you to give us next week the EEI. No, no [indiscernible]
Chris Crane: Yes. EEI, I think we’ll be able to have more of the one-on-one details, get into more of the details on the capital investments and the growth and the rate case strategies as we improve the customer experience at the utilities. We’ll also have more time to go into the detail on the numbers on the free cash flow, debt reduction plans, and the optimization of gen-to-load growth. I’m sure more people are going to want to talk in detail about the basis for our 250, and we can do the deep dive on that, but it will be detailed on what you’re seeing today and an opportunity to have some one-on-one dialogue about it.
Jonathan Arnold: Great, thank you. And then I guess, just one other – did you have any thoughts? I know it’s all a bit moving target you’ve been talking. But what’s your level of confidence that you’re going to get to things that you want to see out of the tax reform?
Chris Crane: Well, its 11:15, I think or 11:30 Eastern when we see the draft. And we’ll have to rally together with EEI and take a look at how – we as a sector have been positioned. Kind of early to say now if you’ve gone over the last 24 hours, things have been all over the board. So I think to speculate, but we work together in a sector at EEI, and I’m sure Tom Kuhn will be getting us all together and figure out. Our next steps as of the rewrites as they discuss our finalized and getting our input as a sector in there. We’re totally unified at EEI on what we’re looking for and what we think will benefit our customers the most in tax reform. So more to come on that, and maybe we’ll have a little bit of insight of that in EEI as we work through the weekend and see the effect on the proposed and still we got to go back to this is proposed. You don’t know what’s going to happen in D.C., but we’ll be ready to talk about it more, as not only a company, but as a sector.
Jonathan Arnold: Sure. I’m sorry to put you on spot on that on a real-time issue.
Chris Crane: No, that’s okay.
Jonathan Arnold: Thank you, guys.
Chris Crane: Sure.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research.
Steve Fleishman: Yes. Hey, good morning, Chris.
Chris Crane: Hey, Steve.
Steve Fleishman: So just – curious how are you strategizing on your retail business with respect to these potential DOE, PJM changes? And are you doing things to make sure that you don’t have like a big delay in capturing the uptick because of retail hedges, like are you making sure your back to backing your retail and the like I mean just curious how you’re thinking about that?
Joe Dominguez: Hey Steve, good morning. It’s a Joe. We are thinking about that and I think the first thing is, when as Jack said in his script and we said for a while, we’re carrying the longer position relative to our ratable sales plan. So we have the opportunity to capture any upside associated with price increases related to the reforms you’re talking about. I think specifically though the retail, there’s a couple elements to that. The first one is, we’ve done some preliminary remodeling and we take into account kind of the seasonality as well as the differences between on and off peak. So we try to be more surgical in just saying, we’re going to buyback this. We have a view of the things we need to do. I think as it specifically relates to our retail contracts there is two elements. One is obviously, we have contracts from the books already. And we have some hedges on the books already, so there will be a feathering in effect to the value proposition of this. But most importantly, from our perspective, I think one of the things we offer our customers, and it’s really important, is transparency. And what I mean by that is, when they’re signing a contract with us, they completely understand what they’re doing and what the components of that are fixed-price and the components that are going to be passed through in time. And I’m not sure that’s always the case across the industry. So from our perspective, there’s lot of elements, and we are thinking about it and we are really managing our portfolio from a natural long position as well as the seasonality and the products. And we’re keeping the customer in mind.
Steve Fleishman: Okay. And just in terms of just the – that’s helpful. In terms of just the power new business change that you made, what – your sense in making the change. Do you feel like you’ve encompassed kind of a pretty conservative case here at this point, so that this doesn’t become like a series of changes?
Chris Crane: Yes. I think – yes. The answer to your question is, yes. We think we’ve covered it and I’ll tell you why. When you look at it, it’s really all driven by load business. About 60% of it’s on our retail C&I business at about 40%. It’s associated with our wholesale polar business and there’s really two elements that is different one on each side. On the retail side, as we said, our renewal rates are lower than we expected them to be, but our margins are well within the range that we expect it. And that’s very different when we have these challenges five years ago, where our margins and our renewal rates both dropped pretty appreciably. On the wholesale side, it’s much more of a margin story, where the volumes are there, but the margins are lower than they’ve been historically. I mean, it’s a very competitive environment. Quite frankly, it’s being driven by a lot of smaller players on the retail side and not the bigger players. On the wholesale side, we’ve seen kind of competition across the spectrum. But we’re confident that we’ve captured the changes we need to make.
Steve Fleishman: Great. And I just finally – I guess in the hindsight, congratulations on adding your Texas gas plants months before all the coal plants shut. But – I’m sure you planned that out. But did you plan that out? But, I’m just curious given that fact just have your thoughts on the Texas kind of market and potential there changed for you? How you’re thinking about that?
Joe Dominguez: It’s Joe again. And we’ve talked about this for a while. When you look at ERCOT reports on what they thought reserve margins were going to be. We never really thought they were going to get the generation group that they expected. And in our own modeling, we have sensitivities, we ran some sensitivities looking at the possibility for retirements. And if you look at our positioning in ERCOT, we’re carrying a long position there relative to our ratable plan as well. And we see the opportunity for volatility. I think this summer, we’ve skewed the some, obviously, with the problems with the hurricane in August and, quite frankly, the biggest thing down there as we continue to see load growth, which is really important. And we don’t see a lot of kind of newbuild of gas generation. You have continued growth on the renewable side, but it’s more concentrated in South Texas than it is West Texas. And when you put all that together, we see the opportunity for increased volatility, and we think we have a fleet that will benefit that.
Steve Fleishman: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey good morning.
Chris Crane: Good morning, Julien.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, so couple of quick questions, may be going back a little bit on some of the previous discussion here. But with respect to the dividend, how do you think do you think about the stability of cash in the various businesses the various businesses? Obviously, there’s a certain legacy here, but how do you think about the stability from ZEC’s and the retail business? And how do you think about that, at least into the conversation around dividend policy? i.e., can you bank on cash flows out of businesses that are not utilities and/or think about of a higher payout on the core utilities?
Chris Crane: Sure. So – as we’ve talked about 4 years ago, 4.5 years ago now, as we restructure the dividend and put our strategy and our focus on really growing the utility business through the acquisition of BGE and then the acquisition of PHI. And it was to theoretically watch the growth in those businesses and have a 70% – 65% to 70% dividend policy, theoretically, at the utilities. Now you know that’s going to cycle during different growth periods. But that was the way we had the dividend set to grow. In the first couple of years, we were starting to get closer to that, giving that accomplished in the early 20s. And so that’s when we came up with the growth policy at 2.5%. As you can see, the utilities are continuing to grow, although right now, it’s taking cash infusion – equity infusion from the Holdco through the Genco. But they’re continuing to grow. So our stability of the dividend is very well anchored. Our growth – potential growth for the dividend is well anchored. As we come through the last couple of years and started to see more reliable or consistent cash flows from the Genco on programs that compensate for the other benefits besides just the energy, you’re seeing a potential that, that can be a dependable cash flow, that can be used for potential return of value to the shareholders. So that’s the way we’re looking at it and we’re presenting it to the board, but the cyclical nature of the commodity market will not leave us, but the certainty of that certain elements on those revenue streams give us the opportunity to look at the world a little bit differently. So that’s how we’ll continue to model it, and we’ve gained greater flexibility with programs like the ZEC.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. And then, let me ask you this. With respect to the utilities, right? I know we’ve had a lot of conversation on the other side of the business. But obviously, you’ve had some reasonable success of late in ComEd around – how do you say, scaling some of the smart grid efforts? How do you see the ability scale that further? And obviously, this might be getting ahead of the annual process and the CapEx budget, et cetera. But maybe this is more to Anne and thinking about the ComEd prospects beyond 2020 here.
Chris Crane: So let me start off and I’ll let Denis jump in here or Anne on the call. The advent of digitalization of the distribution system and the transmission system is offered us an opportunity for capital investments that directly benefit the customers and drive reliability. We have now put in communications backbones to reach smart meters to help us with fault isolators, fast reclosers, that’s the kind of spend, along with replacing antiquated cable and updating the system with new components. Now, as we go into the 2020 and beyond, there is a significant amount of work being done on what else can be done to develop into the smart city that we can better serve the communities while investing and driving efficiency into the systems. And the work that’s being done on microgrids, the experimental work there, to see what the societal benefit in certain microgrids in certain locations. What we can do to integrate with more of the community is there an assistance within the street light programs or assistance that we can provide with our infrastructure on the meter reading of water or gas or other types of systems is where we’ll be going. And I think, this technology is morphing faster than it ever has in our sector. And with our design teams, data scientists, the work that we’re doing on big data, digitization is going to provide us many opportunities for continuing to optimize the system for the customers’ benefit. Denis, I don’t know if I covered it or...
Denis O’Brien: This is Dennis. Chris, I think you covered it pretty well. We’re spending about $5 billion year-end capital. We still see opportunities to continue to invest in convergence relative to our systems to build the systems of the future, whether that’s billing systems, transmissions data systems or others. We see opportunities to continue invest in resiliency and security. We’re seeing opportunities relative to the transmission system as we look at resiliency and security and to build the transmission system of the future. Chris hit on smart cities and other things like that. And the last thing as you look at the grid of the future and we think about distributed generation, in order to get our system ready for that, that really means about converting some of our lower-voltage circuits into higher-voltage circuits. And so that’s an opportunity for further capital deployment. So we’re deploying about $5 billion of capital a year. We see that continuing and see lots of opportunities to continue to invest in utilities as usual.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: But does that enable kind of accelerating CapEx spend overall? And perhaps, that the core of the question.
Chris Crane: I don’t see – it’s accelerating the plan. I think we’re at a point that we’re managing efficiently the spent that we have. We also have to balance the impact to the consumer. Spending capital for the sake as spending capital without finding the efficiencies in the delivery into the benefit of the customer, it wouldn’t be prudent. Right now, the projects that we have on schedule, the cash flow that supports that are managed well and they do support what our bottom line. It needs to be as to the benefit of the customer.
Jack Thayer: And one thing I’ll add to that. Our focus on we’re 18 months into PHI acquisition. Our focus now is to get the performance to the right level. We had our best year ever in reliability at PHI last year, which we only had the company since March. We’re going to blow it through that level of reliability this year in a good way. So the first couple of years, how do we get the performance to a good place? How do we write the image and reputation, and improve our regulatory outcomes at PHI.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. Thank you all.
Chris Crane: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd from Morgan Stanley.
Stephen Byrd: Good morning and congratulations on the – announcements and the utility performance.
Chris Crane: Thank, Steve.
Stephen Byrd: I wanted to drill into the idea of resiliency laid out as part of energy. Is there a way for us to conceptually think about the valued resiliency or a framework for assessing – how to appropriately value resiliency? It’s been a tricky thing, I think, for all of us to really think through the high-level idea to make sense just sort of how to go about trying to value that. Is that any suggestions you have in thinking about that?
Joe Dominguez: Steve, it’s Joe Dominguez. If you’ve seen our fleeting, you know that we have a multi-phase process where, in the first instance, we need to get analytics from new RTOs. Can they run without pipelines? What’s the impact for the consumers? We can move from there to design basis for the system that we think is going to iterate between NERC, FERC and kind of the Department of Energy sometime after we get the data. In terms of how we ultimately implement that into the system, I think once we’ve the design basis, is what we are trying to avoid, we will start looking at mitigation solutions, maybe the retention of additional fuel secure resources to avoid this outage risk. But I think it’s premature to get there. One way you can think about is, though, you can take a look at the capacity performance program. We were able to value the cost of incremental reliability associated with dual fuel. So if the design basis ultimately ends up being we need 90 days of fuel, we have a mathematical way of calculating what’s the market solution to get dual fuel resources to 90 days of fuel with it. That would probably be the $8 or $10 of megawatt hour in terms of doing that based on the cost we saw in CPAY. So that’s one approach. But from our perspective, we need to drop back here, take a look at the data, make sure we have the right definition of resiliency, the right design basis and then we come back with market solutions or other solutions that we would ensure resources to mitigate that risk and provide the security we need that we provide to our end customers in the nation.
Chris Crane: And I think the key to that, what Joe said, is a market solution.
Stephen Byrd: Understood. Within that market construct that we have that makes sense. So I want to just shift over the retail business. There’s been a lot of discussion on this call around. Just the competitive playing field, if we do see FERC performs on power price formation and if power prices do rise, would you expect to see a bit of a shakeout amongst smaller retail players? You are not backed up by physical generation. You may misprice the upside risk to power prices. How do you assuming again that we do see kind of formation we expect? Would you say a shakeout there?
Chris Crane: Yes. I think history tell us we would ends up in a volatility of event. And then go back for a number of years. We’ve seen players whether the big or small, whether they are on the C&I side, the residential side or quite frankly, the power loads on the wholesale side. We’ve seen folks who aggressively price the risk or the ultimate price to the customer have been hurt. And as I said, earlier, we had opportunities to acquire companies in that type of environment. We’ve the opportunities to grow our business organically. And we think remaining disciplined to what we’re doing is the right thing to do. We still have almost 25% of the C&I market. We’re the number one C&I marketer by a huge amounts. We’re the third largest residential marketer in the United States and we compete in all the wholesale power options. So the underlying business is strong. The growth we expect we’re not achieving and I think what discipline will serve us well and we have opportunity to capture some of that back when we see the volatility of event.
Stephen Byrd: That’s great, that’s all I have. Thank you.
Operator: And your final question comes from the line of Praful Mehta from Citigroup.
Praful Mehta: Thanks. Good morning. So my question goes back a little bit to the dividend discussion. And what I was trying to connect the dots on was, you’re already kind hitting your leverage targets, your free cash flow targets, right now, with the current plan. If you do have price reform and if you do have further ZECs coming from other states, then you have that incremental free cash flow. How should we think about that capital allocation? Is that more to both of dividend or way do you think that capital allocation go?
Jack Thayer: First of all, we will look at it in a disciplined way on what is the best way to return value to the shareholders, while maintaining our commitment to the customers. So the plan, as I said, earlier that we started out on over 4.5 years ago is working. We’re reducing our debt. We’re strengthening our balance sheet. We’re reducing our cost. We’re able to make solid investments in our utilities, and we’ve been able to do a part of a dividend increase program as we were doing that. As you can see, as we get stronger and stronger, opportunities for us to deploy the capital are coming our way, and we’ll make sure that we will look at it in a disciplined fashion. If there are more accretive ways to spend the capital in the utilities, and in a low risk area, that will be something we look at. But as we’ve committed previously, and as we’ve signaled, it’s a conversation that’s ongoing right now. There is opportunities to revise the dividend policy and give you another multi-year plan as we work through the LRP planning process. And we work with our board heading into 2018.
Praful Mehta: Got it. That’s very helpful. And secondly, in terms of the ZEC’s, if you could just touch on how you think of ZEC’s plays out in different states – in other states obviously, very high in there. And secondly, how does that fit in with the price formation and the DOE reform. Do you see them interacting? Or if you see them as completely independent?
Joe Dominguez: And this is Joe, again. We’re pleased to see the upcoming in the Connecticut the other day, where all the different structure, the type of premises the same nuclear units are critical for our customers. And we need to preserve them. So that means as set forth on policy front there. We have been very productive discussions both in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. We’ll continue to do that. In terms of the interaction, I see between programs, if we get an upside in price formation, I think that will ultimately be taken into account in the process. So it will not be a double dip here. If prices increase as result on price formation, the cost of the ZEC’s or the cost of the support payments will go down. That’s anticipated.
Praful Mehta: Got it. And you think that’s a dollar per dollar adjustment? Or do you think there’s some benefit that you do keep?
Joe Dominguez: No. I think it’s a dollar per dollar adjustment.
Praful Mehta: Got it. That’s super helpful guys. Thanks so much.
Operator: And for closing remarks. I will now turn the call over to Chris Crane.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Kayla and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Exelon Corporation 2017 Q2 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there'll be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. Mr. Dan Eggers, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference, sir.
Daniel L. Eggers - Exelon Corp.: Thank you, Kayla. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Leading the call today are Chris Crane, Exelon's President and Chief Executive Officer; Joe Dominguez, Executive Vice President, Government and Regulatory Affairs and Public Policy; and Jack Thayer, Exelon's Chief Financial Officer. They're joined by other members of Exelon's senior management team who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. We issued our earnings release this morning along with the presentation, both of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of Exelon's website. The earnings release and other matters which we discuss during today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today's material and comments made during this call. Please refer to today's 8-K and Exelon's other SEC filings for discussion of risk factors and factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts and expectations. Today's presentation also includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for reconciliations between the non-GAAP measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures. I'll now turn the call over to Chris Crane, Exelon's CEO.
Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.: Thanks, Dan. And good morning and thank you, all, for joining us. We're pleased to deliver another good quarter. We achieved strong financial results, while continuing to enhance our operational performance and make significant gains on the policy front. I'll begin by highlighting our financial performance and then briefly discuss some of the key policy and strategic objectives that are top of mind to many of you and us. Joe Dominguez will then cover in more detail the status of our recent wins in New York and Illinois, as well as our thoughts on potential PJM market reforms. Jack will walk you through the numbers. As shown on slide 5, on a GAAP basis, in the second quarter, we earned $0.09 per share versus $0.29 last year. On an operating basis, we earned $0.54 per share versus $0.65 last year, which is near the top of our $0.45 to $0.55 guidance range. These are strong results relative to our expectations and led by ExGen. Moving to slide 6. We continue to execute very well operationally with the second quarter extending some of the best-evers. On our color block chart shows key operating and customer satisfaction benchmarks for the utilities. Legacy Exelon Utilities again remained almost entirely in the first quartile, BGE and ComEd achieving first decile in CAIDI performance. BGE also delivered its best-ever SAIFI and CAIDI performance, and ComEd experienced its best-ever SAIFI performance. And I'm proud to say that Pepco was identified in the J.D. Power study as one of the most improved utilities in customer satisfaction from 2016 to 2017. This is a great achievement and shows we are delivering on our commitments to our customers. The scale of Exelon Utilities platform again significantly benefited our customers in the second quarter. We leveraged our management model and our geographic overlap to deliver better and faster service, particularly in the East. For example, in May, we dispatched Delmarva and PECO crews to assist BGE with the restoration of a multi-day natural gas outage that affected customers in West Baltimore. The assistance provided by the other crews not only helped to reduce the outage time by a full day, but also allowed BGE to operate the balance of the system safely with a 100% gas odor response during the outage. We're glad to see our customers are benefiting from the Exelon Utility platform. The nuclear team also had a great quarter. They achieved 90.9% capacity factor and completed six refueling outages. Nine Mile 1 registered its shortest outage duration on record. In the power business, our assets performed well. Our two new Texas CCGTs, about 2,200 megawatts, are now online and fully operational. These plants are state-of-the-art and able to ramp up quickly to better serve the load that may come with the hot summer weather in Texas. Moving to slide 7. We have seen several key developments in markets and regulatory matters. We had significant wins on the ZEC programs. As many of you already know, we prevailed on our motions to dismiss in both Illinois and New York, with both judges finding in favor on standing and legal merits. These wins are strong affirmations of the ZEC program design. More importantly, these wins will support the continued operation of at-risk nuclear plants providing clean, affordable energy for our customers for many years to come. Needless to say, we are pleased with the results. Joe Dominguez will cover more of the details in a few minutes. With respect to PHI, we wrapped up our first cycle of rate cases as part of Exelon with the DC order last week. Jack will discuss in more detail, but we're happy with the progress we're making at PHI operationally and on the regulatory front. We are pleased that in July the DC Court of Appeals affirmed the DC Commission approval of the PHI merger, resolving an open item. PJM capacity results were announced on May 23 in all of our nuclear plants and PJM cleared the auction, except Quad Cities and Three Mile Island. The RPM results show considerable variability by year in the RTO zone. However, our disciplined bidding approach in recent years continues to provide greater stability in realized capacity revenues, which Jack will discuss shortly. With Three Mile Island failing to clear PJM capacity auction for the third consecutive auction, we came to the difficult decision to close the plant in September of 2019 at the end of the next fuel cycle. A program that fairly compensates the plants for zero-emission energy, similar to what we have seen in New York and Illinois, is needed in order to continue operations. It's important to note that the economic challenges facing TMI impact all nuclear plants in Pennsylvania. We remain hopeful that the state policymakers can find a solution that preserves these important assets. The total Pennsylvania nuclear fleet injects $2 billion into the state's economy each year and supports 1,600 direct and indirect jobs. With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe Dominguez, who will provide some details on ZEC challenges and other items.
Joseph Dominguez - Exelon Corp.: Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everybody. As Chris said, I'm going to cover the ZEC rulings, the current status of ZEC legislative efforts in other states, the DOE study, and PJM operational and market reforms. Let me start with the court cases. Obviously, we're pleased with the decisions in the district courts. The Illinois District Court decision has been appealed to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. We expect the New York Court's decision to be appealed to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. I want to make a couple of points about why we are very confident in the ultimate outcome of those cases. First, the district court decided these cases at a very preliminary stage, where as a legal matter the courts had to assume all of the facts that the plaintiffs pled were accurate. Those facts were not accurate. But even under the plaintiff's versions of the case, the courts found that they had no legal claim whatsoever. Second, as you may know, often times where a party prevails in a case on a procedural or standing issue, the court will not proceed to decide the substantive legal issues. That wasn't the case here. In both decisions, the district courts rejected the entire waterfront of the plaintiff's claims through the substantive and procedural issues. I think that speaks to how high a hill they will need to climb on appeal to reverse those decisions. At the heart of it, the decisions reject the plaintiff's arguments that state policies that favor cleaner sources of generation violate federal wholesale markets. The district court for the Southern District of New York summed it up this way. It said that competing generators have no complaint that they don't qualify for state programs because "they made business decisions about how they generate electricity." Policymakers and customers increasingly want reliable, low-cost, zero-emission electricity. That's what we do at Exelon. The ZEC policies begin to recognize that nuclear energy plays an important role in meeting those customer needs and we're going to continue to advance that argument in Pennsylvania and other states. We're actively developing coalitions and we're working with policymakers to educate them on the issues. And as Chris said, the issues don't just face TMI but the entire nuclear industry as a whole and the entire industry, of course, in Pennsylvania. Let me be clear, we're not just working on ZEC issues. We don't think that's the only approach. We have said for a long time that we think that the best market outcome is to price attributes directly into the market in the case of greenhouse gases and price on carbon. And it's more clear to us now than ever that federal wholesale markets need to evolve to fully incorporate attributes like resiliency, fuel diversity, and environmental qualities of the generation resources. If the markets don't evolve, then the markets are going to have a diminished role in energy policy going forward. I know that in the past we fielded questions on these calls about whether as a company we remain committed to markets. We are committed but the markets have to be well-functioning. Our commitment to markets only extends so far as it provides the best outcomes for our customers. We have said for years that the markets have problems. Those problems are undisputed. We have had many workshops at FERC and other places talking about price formation as an example. Yet those issues have remained unresolved, and the consequence has been that some of the most valuable resources for our customers are being forced out by a market that hasn't been working. That's why we feel confident that the DOE study and a reconstituted quorum at FERC is going to address some of these longstanding issues. Now, let me talk about the study and some of the PJM market reforms that I'm hinting at here. As you know, the study has been worked on for a number of months. Everybody wants to see it. We hope to see it at some point in time this month. We think that it is going to focus on baseload resources, on the critical role of nuclear and the critical role of other fuel sources that have resilient on-site fuel. We think that the DOE study is important because it will frame the objectives for the administration for the next four years and we think it's going to be an important signpost to inform the agenda at FERC. Here's what we hope to see in the report. First, we want to see a recognition of the value of nuclear and an appreciation of the state programs in Illinois, New York and the other places that are going to adopt these programs. Let me be specific. We expect the FERC to respect those programs and not to tamper with the functioning. There are a couple of MOPR complaints that need to be addressed. The ISOs do not support those complaints, but that is on the docket and ready for action by a new FERC. And we have talked to the Department of Energy about those issues and we've had productive conversations. The second issue is that we need to look at the market design changes that have been long pending. As many of you know, PJM has recently put out a white paper on this issue, talking about energy price formation primarily in the off-peak hours, and the need for all forms of generation to be able to set price. From our perspective, this is a very important issue, and we appreciate PJM's timeline which calls for a FERC filing sometime in the first quarter of 2018 and full implementation of the market reforms by the summer of 2018. We're going to push very hard to make sure that happens. Third, we hope the Department of Energy puts a spotlight on the issue of resiliency. Let me spend a moment talking about that. We have talked about reliability in the form of being able to run the system even in the event that we have major electrical components that fail. But as increasingly the system depends on both intermittent generation and natural gas-fired generation that don't have the ability to secure fuel for long-term operations, we need to make sure that our customers get electricity even in the event of a long-term disruption of the natural gas pipeline system. That's something that currently is not being modeled and needs to be modeled. So, PJM has recently put out a white paper on this subject with a schedule of activities. The first activity is to address operational reserves beginning this winter. Importantly, that doesn't require any FERC activity or any stakeholder support. That within the tariff is within PJM's full province. And again, we are pushing to make sure these things are done. That's an important start and should begin to be reflected in pricing this winter for baseload resources that provide the kind of resiliency that I'm talking about. But that's not the end of this subject. We have to, as an industry and as a country, come to grips with this potential risk to our system and examine the possibility of multiple pipeline failures. And the policies that come from that should favor fuel generation sources that have on-site fuel, like nuclear plants, that could run for a year or two in the event of these emergencies. So we're going to continue to focus on that, and those are really the three areas that we're hoping that the DOE will provide some guidance on. So, obviously, we have a lot going on in the policy space, we're making very good progress, but a lot of work remains to be done. I'll look forward to taking your questions after Jack concludes his part of the presentation.
Jonathan W. Thayer - Exelon Corp.: Great. Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. My remarks today will cover our second quarter results, an overview of our current rate cases, an update of our gross margin disclosures and a review of some of the key events that occurred this quarter. On slide 9, as Chris mentioned earlier, we had a strong second quarter financially and operationally across the company. Our non-GAAP operating earnings were $0.54 per share, near the top of our guidance range of $0.45 to $0.55 per share. Exelon's Utilities less HoldCo expenses delivered a combined $0.33 per share. Relative to plan, utility results were slightly favorable, primarily driven by O&M timing across all of the utilities. Generation earned $0.22 per share in the second quarter. This was favorable versus the plan, driven by the timing of O&M and realized gains from our nuclear decommissioning trusts. Our nuclear plants had another strong quarter with higher capacity factors than budgeted, and the Constellation team continued to deliver strong results with good customer wins. Turning to slide 10. The $0.54 per share in the second quarter of this year was $0.11 per share lower than the second quarter of 2016. Overall, the utilities benefited from increased rates and higher rate base, partly offset by year-over-year weather impacts. ExGen was down year-over-year, primarily on the known impacts of lower power price realization and more planned refueling outages, partly offset by New York ZEC revenues. On slide 11, our year-to-date earnings of $1.19 per share are $0.14 per share lower than the same period last year. The decrease is primarily driven by lower realized energy prices, partially offset by the New York ZEC revenues, with partial offsets from our utilities with higher rates supporting our ongoing reliability investments and a full-year contribution from PHI. Turning to slide 12, we are reaffirming our full-year guidance range of $2.50 to $2.80 per share. We expect to deliver operating earnings of $0.80 to $0.90 per share in the third quarter, compared with $0.91 per share last year. Our third quarter results will include a full quarter of contributions from the New York ZEC program that started on April 1. In Illinois, the ZEC program went into effect on June 1, but the ICC has yet to conduct its ZEC procurement process. It's anticipated that the procurement events and the execution of contracts with winning ZEC suppliers will occur in the fourth quarter. Therefore, no revenues will be recognized until that process concludes. We would then include all of the Illinois ZEC revenues retroactive to June 1. Moving to slide 13. Our utilities continued to execute, delivering strong earned returns in the quarter in addition to strong customer-focused operational performance. Looking at the trailing 12-month book ROEs, at PHI we saw some of the utilities register lower trailing ROEs relative to what we showed last quarter. The degradation was expected, primarily due to the timing of equity infusions that Exelon made into PHI in 2016 following the merger close. For the legacy Exelon Utilities, our earned ROEs remain over 10%, lifting the consolidated Exelon Utilities platform to nearly 10%, including PHI. We still have work to do with the utilities to continue improving the product we're delivering to our customers, but we're happy with where the overall business is performing. As we've said before, we're confident in our ability to deliver on the plan that we put in place at PHI. On slide 14, we updated the status of our rate cases. Since our first quarter call, the unanimous settlements in Delmarva, Delaware electric and gas cases were approved, with a combined revenue increase of $36 million. We also received a commission decision in the Pepco DC rate case during the quarter with a revenue increase of $37 million. We've now completed our first cycle of planned rate cases in the PHI jurisdictions, with the second cycle already underway. We filed rate cases at ACE and Pepco Maryland last quarter, and just recently filed again at Delmarva Maryland during the second quarter. Combined, we are currently asking for $168 million in revenues, which reflect recovery on multiple years of capital investments that have been made to improve the reliability of the grid across these jurisdictions. We expect the final ruling on Pepco Maryland in the fourth quarter of this year, and decisions on ACE and Delmarva Maryland in the first quarter of 2018. We plan to file second rate cases in the remaining PHI jurisdictions later in 2017, and expect to have them resolved by the end of 2018, helping to put us in a position to earn our targeted ROEs in 2019. We're proud of the hard work from our utilities and regulatory teams. These efforts are helping to bring PHI's revenues and earned ROEs back on course, while we simultaneously improve performance for our customers. More details on the rate cases and their schedules can be found on slides 35 through 42 in the appendix. Turning to slide 15. The PJM base residual auction results were announced in May. We cleared 16.2 gigawatts of capacity in the auction, with the bulk of our capacity clearing in the ComEd and Eastern MAAC zones, which cleared above the rest of RTO pricing at $188 per megawatt day. We continue to follow a disciplined approach to bidding our plants based on their specific cost profiles. We believe this bidding discipline is the right strategy for our plants and has led to more stability in our capacity revenue streams than seen in other generators that have not been as disciplined. Our Three Mile Island nuclear plant failed to clear in the PJM capacity auction for the third consecutive year with this auction. We've been losing both cash and earnings at the plant in recent years, and do not see a path to profitability as the market backdrop exists today. Accordingly, earlier in the quarter, we announced plans to retire the plant in the fall of 2019. We are engaged with stakeholders in Pennsylvania to find ways to preserve the plant, but we're still early in that process. From a financial perspective, the closure will add $0.04 to $0.07 per share of EPS annually beyond 2019 depending on the refueling year. We expect to realize positive cumulative cash flows of approximately $225 million through 2021 with the closure. Slide 16 provides our gross margin update for ExGen. In 2017, total gross margin is flat to our last disclosure. During the quarter, we executed on $200 million of power new business and $50 million of non-power new business. We're highly hedged for the rest of this year and are well-balanced on our generation to load matching strategy. Total gross margin decreased in the second quarter by $150 million in 2018 due to the removal of EGTP from a portfolio as well as the impacts of lower capacity revenues in MISO and New York. Total gross margin in 2019 is down $150 million from last quarter, driven by the removal of EGTP from the portfolio and the forecasted closure of TMI in September of 2019. Let me be clear that, although gross margin is down due to the divesture of EGTP and plant closure of TMI, the impacts of both are accretive to EPS and cash flow. The elimination of EGTP lowers gross margin by roughly $100 million in 2018 and 2019, but is EPS-accretive by $0.02 to $0.03 per share in each of those years. So there are cost offsets you should consider. And while we do not expect to close TMI until the fall of 2019, the retirement lowers our 2019 gross margin by roughly $50 million, although the EPS impact is roughly $0.05 positive. And as I said earlier, the retirement will be $0.04 to $0.07 EPS-accretive annually beyond 2019 depending on the refueling year. From a hedging perspective, we ended the quarter approximately 11% to 14% behind our ratable hedging program in 2018, and 8% to 11% behind ratable in 2019 when considering cross-commodity hedges. The majority of our length is concentrated in the Midwest to align with our fundamental view of spot market upside in NiHub. We remain comfortable being more open when we look at market fundamentals. Turning to slide 17. On the topic of power market forwards, you have heard us and many others talk about the reduced liquidity in the forward power curves that arguably can create price distortions. We do not mean for this chart to be comprehensive, but it's illustrative of what has been happening in the forward power markets. The top chart shows the volumes created on a cumulative two- and five-year forward period for PJM West on peak power using a six-month average to smooth some of the seasonal volatility. I would flag in this context that overall volumes have been on a pretty consistent decline, both in absolute terms and particularly when looking beyond two years, which can be seen in the narrowing of the two lines on the chart. Arguably more interesting when thinking about forward power price transparency is the amount of transactions in those years. Looking at the lower right chart, prompt year volumes are over 71% of the five-year cumulative volumes, with 2019 representing another 23%. The volumes created in 2020 and beyond are only 6% of the total volumes, with 2021 nearly non-existent. Compared to last year, total volumes are lower and the amount of volumes in the out-years is even less. We wanted to share some of this data with you, particularly as folks were thinking more about the roll forward of 2020 earnings estimates. We would note that our fundamentals group has a more constructive view on power markets than these illiquid forward curves suggest, but we appreciate that there is perceived safety in using the forwards. However, when running your numbers, we would just encourage you all to appreciate what is underpinning those forward prices. Turning to slide 18, we remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and our investment-grade rating. We have now removed EGTP from our credit metrics, which in turn has improved our consolidated net debt to EBITDA at year-end 2017 to 2.9 times, which is below our target of 3 times. If we focus only on recourse debt, our leverage is at 2.5 times EBITDA. We're pleased with the improvements in our balance sheet and we'll continue to focus on a combination of debt pay-down between ExGen and the holding company. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Chris.
Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.: Thanks, Jack. In closing, I'd like to remind you all that Exelon's success is a direct result of our people and the culture of performance and service that we've created as an organization. In June, we held our sixth Exelon Innovation Expo in Washington D.C. This annual event brings together employees, vendors, and other key stakeholders to share all the ways Exelon is working to embrace and advance the future of the energy industry. The expo is also an excellent opportunities for our employees across the company to share ideas, explore new technologies, drive collaboration, and push each other to do even better for our customers. On slide 20, Exelon culture is also built on serving our communities, both externally and internally. We accomplished a lot on this front during the quarter and several awards really do stand out. First, Exelon is being added to the Billion Dollar Roundtable, which recognizes companies that spend over $1 billion with Tier 1 diverse and minority-owned suppliers. In 2016, we spent nearly $2 million with these important partners. We are only one of 27 companies to be named to the roundtable, and the only utility or energy company. I especially want to thank Bill Von Hoene and Bridget Reidy for their leadership on expanding our supplier base to benefit our communities. For the first time, Points of Light named us to the Civic 50, which recognizes the 50 most community-minded public and private companies in the United States. Our company strives everyday to better serve our communities, so this award is especially gratifying. We're also named to DiversityInc's Top 50 Companies for Diversity, adding to our previous position as the best utility. We embrace diversity in all forms, so this represents an important distinction for our company. On slide 21, the value proposition. We once again want to reiterate our value proposition, which remains the foundation of our commitment to the investors. We continue to grow the utility rate base at 6.5% annually through 2020 and regulated EPS by 6% to 8% annually through 2020, through capital investments that directly benefit our customers in each of our jurisdictions. We continue to use the free cash flow generated at ExGen to fund incremental utility needs at the Utilities of $2.5 billion and pay down approximately $3 billion of debt over the next four years at ExGen and the holding companies. We're focused on optimizing the value for our ExGen business by seeking fair compensation for our carbon-free generation fleet, closing uneconomic plants, selling assets where it makes sense to accelerate our debt reduction plans, and maximizing value through the gen-to-load matching strategy. We will continue to focus on sustaining strong investment-grade credit metrics and growing our dividend in a consistent, visible manner. So I'd like to thank you, all, for joining again and for your interest. And now, we're ready to take questions.
Operator: Our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon from Evercore ISI.
Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI: Thanks. Good morning.
Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.: Hey, Greg.
Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI: I think you covered this in the script, but I just wanted to make sure I heard it clearly. You went through the puts and takes associated with the changes in the gross margin outlook. And despite it being lower, a lot of that is coming from assets that are removed from the portfolio. And then there's obviously offsetting costs below the line that make that cash and earnings accretive. So you don't have the slide in your deck, but you've periodically put it in the slide that shows the 2017 to 2020 ExGen free cash flow profile. Should I presume that you're still on track to generate enough cash to create the $2.8 billion to $3.2 billion in ExGen/HoldCo debt reduction that you've articulated?
Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.: Yes.
Jonathan W. Thayer - Exelon Corp.: Greg, we've been – yeah.
Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI: Okay. And then my second question is, given that how much you've improved your debt to EBITDA, both on a recourse and non-recourse basis, I know that you've talked about thinking about pivoting from ExGen debt reduction to parent debt reduction. But there's also a point in time here in the future where I think you guys were going to revisit the board with a conversation about the dividend growth rate. So, given that you seem to be ahead of schedule on achieving your debt reduction goals, can you give us an update on how you're contemplating the conversation around the dividend to evolve?
Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.: So, as we've discussed in previous calls, we gave you a three-year window, a three-year look on our dividend and the annual increase. We'll be in discussion with the board through the next couple of board meetings on what our continued dividend strategy would be for a period of time. We'd like to give you a three- to five-year look ahead and that would be timed somewhere around in the first quarter, as the board deliberates on that. So we are balancing, looking at (32:27) the strong balance sheet, any drag from interest expense at the HoldCo, the value that we can create through either dividend increase or debt reduction. It's top of mind and going through the analysis phase right now, and hope we'll be able to give you positive news very soon.
Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI: Great. One final question. From time-to-time, investors contemplate with a greater or lesser degree of certitude the thought process around whether you guys would ever consider splitting ExGen from the Utility business and under what circumstances that would be appropriate? And I guess, the water cooler talk around that, frankly, went up demonstrably after the successful floatation of Vistra on the New York Stock Exchange and the valuation at which they're trading. Can you talk about how you think about and contemplate sort of significant long-term changes in strategy like that and whether that is, in fact, something that would be now an increased probability, given the facts as they lay today?
Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.: Yeah. I wouldn't say there's an increased probability. As you would imagine, we need to look at our business strategy on some routine basis, as we do. We look at the combination of the ExGen and the Utility business right now, and our capabilities, while maintaining strong balance sheets, be able to do significant investment for our customers around reliability and innovation on the Utilities. So, having a free cash flow machine that's being given more certainty on its capabilities by programs like the ZEC and the fantastic work that Constellation achieves through the margins that they create, we like what we're doing right now. What we have said in the past is we believe that we're undervalued and that we need to be seeing that value increase in the market as we make these accomplishments. We felt we're at a prove-me (34:51) state on PHI that not only do we have to integrate them successfully into our management model and drive the performance to our operational standards that we've set at the other Exelon utilities, but also achieve what is a fair and reasonable recovery on rate cases. And we're executing on that now. And I think we're proving ourselves. And we think that that should be translated into a more reasonable valuation not only at the Utility level, but at the ExGen level. So we'll strive to continue to really achieve some lofty goals and secure what we think is solid revenues and be able to reinvest those revenues into creating greater returns for the investors.
Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI: Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold from Deutsche Bank.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning, guys.
Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.: Hey, Jon.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So, Greg asked one of my questions, the strategy question. But if I could just – is there a timeframe, Chris, on when you would want to see that sort of realization and validation of your strategy and value? What sort of timeframe would you kind of want to succeed by before you'd consider an alternative?
Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.: Yeah. I think, Jonathan, we're seeing it this year. You can see that the stock is starting to perform better, which reflects a better valuation. We think there's more room to grow over the next year to two years, as our programs are solidified around the nuclear assets and new potential programs are put in place around price formation and other value-creating mechanisms. The multiple that we see at the Genco should improve. We differentiate our sales from any other merchant generator with not only the class of assets we have, but the programs that recognize those class of assets. So we should see those come to strong fruition over the next year to two, and we'd like to see the compensation for it. We also believe that we're doing a really great job on what we've committed to to the customers around reliability and service at all our utilities and gaining fair returns. Catching up a little bit on the PHI utilities in productive rate cases should also be a catalyst for achieving a better multiple on the EPS. So, next couple of years, we should be where we want to be at.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So is it fair to say that P/E multiple is your main yardstick, then, you're looking at in terms of determining whether you've closed the gap to your satisfaction?
Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.: Well, as you do, we do a sum of the parts and look at the valuations and look at where we think we should be. That is one of the indicators. But the EBITDA multiple on the Genco is also a key indicator for us.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you. And just on one smaller item. It looked like the financing needs at ExGen versus last quarter for this year came down about $300 million. Is that to do with asset sale or something else, what's driving that change? The cash flows...
Jonathan W. Thayer - Exelon Corp.: It's the proceeds from the joint venture.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: But the number is lower, though, Jack, is the...
Jonathan W. Thayer - Exelon Corp.: We had a tax gain on the sale.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I got it. Okay. Thank you very much, guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research.
Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC: Hi. Good morning. Couple quick questions. The comments on 2020 and the forwards, I guess we'll see in time, but just in the event that your fundamentals are wrong and the forwards are right, is there more that the company can do on costs and the like to deal with that?
Jonathan W. Thayer - Exelon Corp.: Steve, it's Jack. We have a long history of being proactive on costs. And our cost reduction programs are just generally part of our corporate DNA. So, over the past five years, we've saved $500 million of synergies from the Constellation merger, another $75 million from the integration of CENG. $350 million of cost reductions from our November 2015 program, another $125 million of savings from the November 2016 program, and we're on target for $130 million of synergies from the PHI deal. And just from a philosophical standpoint, we manage our business for the worst, Steve, while expecting a better outcome. And you can and should expect us to continue focusing on opportunities to run our business more efficiently and pull out additional costs. We view cost management as incremental each year and building on what we've already done rather than a big one-time transformative event. Our regular increases in cost savings opportunities we think have added up to real economic value, and you should continue to see us focus on continuous improvement and driving further savings in the future.
Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC: Okay. Good. And then, just on the PJM market structure changes, any sense on what they could possibly do to market pricing? Like, how much they could impact market?
Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.: Joe?
Joseph Dominguez - Exelon Corp.: Yeah. Steve, we're not there yet. We're evaluating that, but we need some more details out of PJM around the program design. I think, as a general matter, you'll see some improvement in around-the-clock energy, specifically off-peak. And you'll see some benefits for the consumer on the capacity market side as those prices ought to go down. But for machines that drive most of their revenue in the energy market like the nuclear machines, this will be a good outcome and we'll be supportive of keeping those lowest cost options available for our customers long-term.
Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC: Okay. One final question, I guess, maybe for Chris. Just with the announcement earlier this week of the summer shutdown or abandonment, I'm just curious kind of from a nuclear support overall, does this better make your case of supporting existing nuclear or does it somehow make the other case that this is going to phase out over time anyway? Just thoughts there.
Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.: No, I think there are two different issues. One, it's not good for the industry to have the next wave of plants go through financial stress and the mismanagement by the suppliers to the industry. That is unfortunate. And we understand the decision that's been made to not go forward with the risks that they still have around it and the financial burdens that it would create for their customers. So, that's one thing. If you look at what we're talking about with our nuclear assets, they are definitely providing a product and a service unlike any other generating assets, not only is it the reliability that we load a core for 18 to 24 months and they can run through any weather cycle and are not dependent on a fuel delivery that allows a baseload generation, a level of reliability to the system. The compensation that should be sought and granted for their environmental benefits to the communities they serve. An example of Illinois' power stack, 60% of the power in Illinois is carbon-free. 90% of that comes from the nuclear facilities. It allows the state to make its goals that it wants to make on carbon reduction. And without these assets being fairly compensated, that would go in the opposite direction. And finally, these assets that do provide the societal benefit around carbon and the societal benefit around reliability and sustainable national security, they also are great economic supporters of the communities they serve, the tax bases for the schools, the parks, the employment base. So, on many levels, they've been evaluated as critical and should be compensated for the lifespan that they have remaining to provide a bridge to what could be that source of energy that provides that same level of the great attributes going forward.
Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Praful Mehta from Citigroup.
Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks so much. Hi, guys.
Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.: Morning.
Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Morning. So, looking on the ZEC, has the win in New York and Illinois help set the framework or ease the discussion with other states, as in are you having more productive conversations given the legal win? And secondly, I guess linked with that, if it does roll out in other states over time, how do you think about capital allocation at that point, given you've already kind of hit your metrics from a credit perspective at ExGen with the current plan? Is it more just de-leveraging at the parent company or what else do you think in terms of capital allocation?
Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.: I'll let Joe cover the first part and Jack can go through our plans on the second part.
Joseph Dominguez - Exelon Corp.: Yeah, I think the answer to the first part is yes. It does provide a bit of a catalyst for better discussions in other states. One of the themes that the opponents often roll at is that these policies have questionable legal merit. And so they talk to politicians and they say, why would you take a tough vote on this only to have it overturned in the court. So these decisions resolve that issue and we expect, as these decisions get solidified in the appellate courts, that it'll provide additional catalysts for those discussions in other states.
Jonathan W. Thayer - Exelon Corp.: And then, Praful, just in terms of capital allocation, as you mentioned, our balance sheet is in a stronger position this quarter than it was last quarter. We're effectively at the target that we set in the fall of last year. And what that allows us to do is much greater flexibility on where we focus our debt retirement plan. So I think you'll see us, depending on maturities, look at both the holding company as well as ExGen for future retirements. And it obviously gives us a much greater degree of visibility and certainty around those cash flows, which I think plays into Chris's response on the valuation. We would expect that the valuation metrics for our generation company reflect the reduced volatility that's associated with these important assets.
Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you. But then, after the debt reduction targets are hit at the HoldCo, from either buyback or even dividend perspective, is that on the table as well?
Jonathan W. Thayer - Exelon Corp.: I'd say we have plenty of holding company debt to retire and that provides us with considerable flexibility, and it's one of the items we'll be looking at, as Chris mentioned, in our review with the board of the outlook for the company and its strategic plan around dividend and other capital allocation decisions.
Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you. And secondly, just the interesting slide you provided on the market liquidity and what that means in terms of forward curve, does that also mean that acquiring more retail footprint or a larger retail footprint is a good way to mitigate some of those liquidity risks, given forward curves are just not there and you need to hedge? Or do you think this will just play out with spot prices being higher than forward curves over time?
Joseph Nigro - Exelon Corp.: Praful, good morning. It's Joe Nigro. It does imply that the best way for us to get to market with our generation is through our load serving business. As you know, we have a very substantial commercial, industrial and residential business, and that we also participate in all the wholesale load serving auctions, and we'll continue to do that. And our portfolio of output on the generation side is well-balanced with our power load portfolio. And we use the standard product market to what I would call filling gaps geographically or for timing or other things. But the balance with our gen-to-load matching strategy is very strong and we'll continue to do that.
Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. So you don't need incremental retail at this point. What you have already is fully matched is what you think.
Joseph Nigro - Exelon Corp.: If we see an opportunity and it makes economic sense, I think you've seen in the past with the acquisitions of both Integrys as well as ConEd, they've been value enhancing to the bottom line and we've been disciplined in how we'll do it and we'll continue to take that approach. And if there's an opportunity in the future to bolt-on more retail, it'd be a good fit for our portfolio, we would definitely do that.
Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you. Thanks so much, guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein from Credit Suisse.
Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi, guys. Hey. Just to follow up a couple of earlier questions. Could ExGen be spun just publicly, even a small amount of it, just to establish that independent validation evaluation, and while still enabling you to benefit from its cash flows and other innovation benefits at the Utilities?
Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.: We'd have to think through that one. Right now, we have a very solid strategy on growth and value creation with the ExGen cash flows. So it differentiates us and we're not issuing equity at the holding company to support this growth. There's no dilution coming in with this growth. It is very strong organic growth. We're adding another PHI over the next couple of years without paying a premium. So, in Q2, want to validate its value by spinning it off would not be probably the approach that we would go for. If we ever found that the value is constrained or our strategic growth was hampered based off of the companies being together, you could have that conversation to create value. But there's no reason that having them together and using the synergies that we have between having the two companies, that we shouldn't be valued fairly for that as we execute on our strategic plan. So, could you physically possibly spin a Genco? You could, and then you'd have to consider when you did that what's its investment grade, what's the impediment on its trading business, what's the issue with going to the capital markets to maintain your nuclear plant, all kinds of hair around that. But we like what we're doing right now. We like the way that we're creating the value. And we think we are differentiating ourselves, as I've said, from any other merchant generator in the business. Strong balance sheets, different class of assets, fairly – very well run, and fairly matched to our load book. So we like where we're at and wouldn't speculate on anything else, and really can see the value creation and want the market to recognize it as we do execute on what we say. We tell you we're going do something, we do it, and it comes in in value creation to you.
Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: And also, just to clarify on Jack's earlier remarks, with ExGen's projected gross margins a bit lower in the forward curve and also from the removal of other assets, the offset that allows you to achieve $3 billion of debt pay-down, that that target has not been changed, it's mostly efficiencies, cost savings, and that kind of thing?
Jonathan W. Thayer - Exelon Corp.: It hasn't been changed.
Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.: It's cash flow-positive, the retirement of TMI.
Jonathan W. Thayer - Exelon Corp.: Yeah.
Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.: It's...
Jonathan W. Thayer - Exelon Corp.: $225 million through 2021. With EGTP, we have the debt – what's that?
Joseph Nigro - Exelon Corp.: JV.
Jonathan W. Thayer - Exelon Corp.: All right. And we have the proceeds from the renewables JV. Where EGTP is $0.02 to $0.03 accretive, TMI is $0.04 to $0.07 accretive. So I think we're very comfortable with our outlook for free cash flow. And we'd expect to update the number that we provide in the Q4 call in next year.
Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners.
Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Morning, guys.
Jonathan W. Thayer - Exelon Corp.: Hey, Shar.
Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC: So, most of my questions were answered. But let me ask, what's sort of the viability within your long-term plans around Colorado Bend and Wolf Hollow, especially given the fact that you're doing much more contracted cash flows at ExGen? Is there an opportunity to either look to hedge these out with the munis or sell it to other IPPs?
Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.: These are assets that are unlike the rest of the stack in Texas with their efficiency, their flexibility on ramping. They do provide a good support to our load book. We built them from way below what market costs are for greenfield sites or even brownfield sites, with our work through our venture with GE and our contractors. So they were built at a good price. They operate very well. We do have a load book in Texas that they serve well. And there's no need, as you can see from our debt metrics, for a fire sale. So our origination folks are constantly looking at longer-term contract sales, and they'll be doing that as they continue in Texas and match some of the book that we have to those potentials. So, Joe can add any more onto that.
Joseph Nigro - Exelon Corp.: No, I think you covered it, Chris. I think the big thing is, when you think about what we're doing with the disposition of the assets we currently own in EGTP, the fill-in of these two assets to our load book is very helpful when you think about the volatility in Texas and you think about ancillary services and how these units are able to ramp in such quick rates. I think it's a very nice fit. And from an origination perspective, as Chris said, we look at all corners of the market and we serve all types of customers and we're open to all opportunities. and we'll continue to explore those, especially with these two new state-of-the-art assets.
Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Got it. And then, Joe, might as well just ask you is, with the pending potential policy initiatives in Pennsylvania, and obviously made some great headwinds in Illinois and New York, how are you sort of thinking about you layering on hedges in Pennsylvania pending potential legislation that may come about?
Joseph Nigro - Exelon Corp.: Yeah. We think about that a lot, and we've talked quite a bit about how we run our hedging program. It's not an independent decision. We work very closely with all the finance organizations, the risk management organization. And we have a program where we're looking at the needs of the cash flows and the earnings of the company, and we match our hedging profile to that, and make sure that we can maintain the credit ratings that we have and we focus on our liquidity. And all of those things put together drive some of the decisions with our program. As you can tell, looking at our numbers, we're well behind our ratable hedging plan in both 2018 and 2019, and you could see that's the case in the Midwest and that's the case in Texas as well. And it aligns to our market views. But those aren't independent decisions. They're tied in directly with what we're doing with debt reduction and managing our balance sheet, and we will continue to do that.
Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Terrific. Thanks, guys.
Operator: And our final question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski from Macquarie.
Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thank you. So, one more question about the retail book. So I understand that this is a preferred way of hedging your generation portfolio, but most of your retail book is C&I and those are sophisticated customers who basically look at the forward curve and then add probably a margin to what they see in the curve. So, that wouldn't necessarily help you with the forward curve not fully reflecting supply and demand fundamentals. So, how about shifting maybe towards mass retail customers or increasing your presence in that business?
Joseph Nigro - Exelon Corp.: We are the fifth largest residential marketer in the country now on the power side, and we will continue to focus on growing that business, similar to the way we're continuing to focus to grow our commercial industrial business. Like C&I marketing, it is a competitive market and you have headroom that you have to take into account and customer behavior. But we continue to focus on all of that and our mass market business continues to grow each year and we've been very successful on that regard and we'll continue to push it.
Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.: With reasonable margins.
Joseph Nigro - Exelon Corp.: Absolutely.
Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.: The discipline that's required to continue to grow in residential versus some competitors that may not have the same pricing margin, we don't need to chase volume, we chase margin.
Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. And the second question is about your disclosures for ExGen. So, obviously, as you're pointing out with retirements or deconsolidations of your gas plants in Texas, there's an offsetting change in O&M. Why not show EBITDA projections instead of gross margin? Just to capture that O&M production which would then fully show the financial backdrop that the business has?
Jonathan W. Thayer - Exelon Corp.: So, Angie, we think we give you transparency into the operating costs of the company. We update that on an annual basis at the beginning of any given year. And you can back into effectively the operating costs of EGTP and TMI with the EPS disclosure that we give you. And then, I guess, finally, we give you some incremental data on slide 33 that also should help you. So I think we're very comfortable with the gross margin disclosures that we have. It allows us to update it on a quarterly basis without having to update the entirety of the income statement, and that's the plan going forward.
Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. Thanks.
Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.: Well, I'd like to thank you, all, for your interest in joining us today on the earnings call. We look forward to seeing many of you at the fall conferences and hear your questions on the earnings call in November. So, thank you very much and that will end the call.
Operator: This is the end of today's call. You may now disconnect, and have a great day.

===== 2017 Q1  (2017-05-03 11:00:00) =====
Executives: Daniel Eggers - Senior Vice President of Investor Relations Christopher Crane - President and Chief Executive Officer Jonathan Thayer - Chief Financial Officer. Joseph Nigro - Exelon Corp.
Analysts: Greg Gordon - Evercore Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners
Operator: Good morning. My name is Josephine, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Exelon Corporation 2017 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Dan Eggers, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Daniel Eggers: Thank you, Josephine. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Leading the call today are Chris Crane, Exelon's President and Chief Executive Officer, and Jack Thayer, Exelon's Chief Financial Officer. They're joined by other members of Exelon's senior management team, who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. We issued our earnings release this morning along with the presentation, both of which can be found on the Investor Relations section of Exelon's website. The earnings release and other matters which we discuss during today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today's material and comments made during the call. Please refer to today's 8-K and Exelon's other SEC filings for discussions of risk factors and factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts, and expectations. Today's presentation also includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for reconciliations between non-GAAP measures to the nearest equivalent GAAP measures. We have scheduled 45 minutes for today's call. I'll turn it now over to Chris Crane, Exelon's CEO.
Christopher Crane: Thanks, Dan, and good morning, and thank you all for joining us. We are off to a great start in 2017. In March, we marked our one year anniversary of the merger between Exelon and Pepco Holdings. Since they closed, PHI has successfully executed on merger commitments achieved synergy savings and made significant progress towards full integration. We also continue to work hard on the regulatory front. Since the beginning of the year PHI closed up the Delmarva Maryland rate case and reached a settlement for our Electric and Gas rate case in Delaware. We are now down to just a Pepco DC cases from our first plant cycle of rate case filings. That said, our regular team is already started the second cycle of rate cases at Pepco Maryland and ACE’s plant. At ExGen we completed the acquisition of FitzPatrick power plant representing the 25th nuclear reactor where we have ownership stake. We welcome the new employees to the Exelon family. We also announced the Exelon Generation renewable joint venture which is allowing us to recycle capital at evaluation meaningfully above the value implied for our ExGen at our current share price. The JV allows us to make even faster progress on our debt reduction goals without diminishing our commitment to renewable power. We continue to focus on the legal challenges to the zero emission credits or ZEC in New York and Illinois we remain confident that our arguments will prevail. We’ll cover these points in more detail on the call, but I wanted to highlight what we have done while staying focused on the day to day operations. As shown on slide 5, on a GAAP basis we’ve earned a $1.07 versus $0.19 a share last year and on an operating basis we earned $0.65 versus $0.68 last year which puts as top of our $0.55 to $0.65 range and above consensus of $0.62. Moving to slide 6, our first quarter operational report was strong, our colored block charts highlight operating performance and customer satisfaction for the utilities. Legacy Exelon utilities remain almost entirely first quartile. PECO actually had its best customer satisfaction rating ever during the first quarter. BGE experienced the best ever CAIDI and SAIFI performance of all time. At PHI we are encouraged by the progress we are making and our customers are seeing the benefits. For example, by using a common Lockout-Tagout process, a procedure that establishes a zone of protection while restoring equipment we are able to send over 400 employees and contractors from BGE, ComEd and PECO to support the storm restoration at Delmarva during winter storm Stella. As a result, Delmarva customers had their power restored two days sooner. Our thanks to everybody that helped in accomplishing that speedy recovery. The power of Exelon utilities platform has significant benefit to our customers. We continue to improve upon these metrics to meet reliability commitments we have made to provide better service to our customers. The nuclear team had a great quarter also. They completed three refueling outages and achieved a capacity factor of 94%. They had also had the fastest refueling outage ever for Calvert Cliffs nuclear station 2 running 20 days. In the power business, we realized renewable energy capture rate of nearly 96% and a power dispatch match over 99%. Our two new bills, CCGTs in Texas have both achieved [first flyer] and are now selling test power onto the grid. The state of the art plants which are totally nearly 2,200 megawatts are on budget, on schedule for full commercial operations in the second quarter. We expect that they will be ready to participate in Texas this summer. At Constellation, our highly hedged portfolio in 2017 mitigates the impacts of weaker power prices and lower low given their mild winter weather. Even in this recent low volatility environment our C&I business has been able to hold on to the margins and keep customers renewables. On slide 7, we view 2016 is a great success in delivering our commitments and preserving some of our -- nuclear units by securing compensation for their clean energy attributes. For 2017, we are focused on executing on these gains we made last year and more importantly affirming the ZEC programs in the quarter. In New York, litigation is further along at this point. On March 29, the judge in New York Federal court heard all arguments on our emotions to dismiss. We made strong arguments of this hearing and believes it lies clearly on our side. We do ask that – we do did ask when we expect a decision but the judge has not given a specific timeline or deadline to issue [FERC] order. If we prevail on the motion to dismiss, we would expect the other side to appeal that decision. If the judge denies on motion to dismiss, we will move forward with the cases planned. As I have said previously, we are confident in the strength of our case. In Illinois, two groups of Plaintiffs have challenged the ZEC in Federal Court and the cases are being before one judge. The Plaintiff’s filed for preliminary injunction on March 31st we intervened in that case on April 10 and we filed motions to dismiss. The judge has held a preliminary injunction motion while he receives whole briefing on the motion to dismiss. He will then determine whether there is a legal basis to go forward. That briefing will be completed by May 15 and the judge is scheduled to inform the parties of his intention on May 22. In the interim, we start recognizing ZEC revenues in New York on April 1. In Illinois the utilities have filed tariffs to [complete] getting collecting the ZEC payments on June 1. We don’t expect the actual ZEC procurement process in Illinois to conclude until later in the fall we remain confident that the ZEC programs will be upheld in the courts to the benefit of the state, the communities and these valuable resources. As we have discussed last year in our carbon policy principles, we see state programs as an essential mechanism until we have a more cohesive federal policy that values clean base load generation. Energy’s Secretary, -- recent directed to look at the importance of preserving base load generation is early but encouraging. We appreciate the Secretary’s focus to promote the needed market reforms to compensate these assets. We will support the DOEs effort as they move forward. Turning to the upcoming PJM auction, we understand the investment community is paying close attention particularly after the disappointing MISO capacity auction results. Joe Nigro is available to answer more detailed questions if you have them, but let me share a few thoughts around the auction. To the two positive we are going to a 100% CP for the first time which will put a higher performance burden on the entire fleet. We still think this should lead to a more responsible bidding given the higher risk around non-performance. The CETL numbers or the import capacity into ComEd and EMAAC LDAs have tightened this year versus last year. The tightening can flag more constraint market conditions than last year in these zones which could help in separation. So the negative PGM load, its demand forecast again for this auction in the approved seasonal aggregation that will allow products that otherwise would not clear to participate in a 100% CP world. Finally, we have the risk of more uneconomical generation being built primarily in Pennsylvania in Ohio. These drivers were important but we still expect clearing prices to come down to bidding behavior. You have seen our bid our assets in recent auctions to reflect the underlying economic needs of the individual plants, which in turn had led to some of our plants not clearing. You should expect us to bid our assets in the same responsible fashion in this next upcoming auction. Now let me turn the call over to Jack to walk through the numbers.
Jonathan Thayer: Thank you Chris, and good morning, everyone. My remarks today will cover our first quarter results, an overview of our current rate cases, an update of our gross margin disclosures and a review of some of the events that occurred this quarter. Turning to slide 8, we had a strong quarter financially and operationally across the company. For the first quarter we delivered adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings of $0.65 per share, at the top of our guidance range of $0.55 to $0.65 per share. This compares to $0.68 per share for the first quarter of 2016. Exelon’s utilities delivered a combined $0.47 per share versus our plant and utility results were impacted by unfavorable weather at PECO and PHI which was more than offset by O&M timing across all the utilities. With 70% of our distribution rate base and decoupled jurisdictions including ComEd starting in 2017, we experienced less volatility on our utility earnings from record warm weather in January and February than if we did not have these programs. To help put this winter in context, this was the first time in 146 years when there was no snow on the ground at Chicago for both January and February. Looking across PJM, January and February was the warmest on record since data started being collected in 1950. Generation had a strong quarter relative to plan earning $0.18 per share. We had good performance from our nuclear assets with better capacity factors than budgeted and our constellation team once again delivered strong results despite weak power prices and low volatility. Turning to slide 9. The $0.65 per share in the first quarter of this year was $0.03 per share lower than the first quarter of 2016. To the positive, we had a full quarter of contribution from PHI relative to only 8 days last year, which added $0.09. The other utilities benefitted from rate relief and higher rate base, partly offset at PECO with even milder weather than last year. ExGen was down year-over-year primarily on the loan impacts of lower capacity prices and power price realization as well as more planned refueling outages. Turning to slide 10, we are reaffirming our full year guidance in this range of $2.50 to $2.80 per share. We expect to deliver operating earnings of $0.45 to $0.55 in the second quarter compared with $0.65 last year. Our second quarter results will include contributions from the FitzPatrick plants and the plants of the New York ZEC program that started on April 1. The Illinois ZEC legislation will go into effect on June 1, and plant procurement is expected to occur later this fall. Plants receiving contracts with recognized revenues retroactive the June 1st effective date. Moving to slide 11. Our utilities continue to execute well delivering strong earned returns in the quarter. Looking at the trailing 12-month booked ROEs we saw nice improvements even relative to what we showed last quarter. At PHI we saw all of the utilities registered gains with some that are coming as revenues from the first cycle of rate cases are starting to flow through to results. For the Legacy Exelon utilities we continue to see strong earned ROEs over 10% that led the consolidated Exelon’s utilities platform to nearly 10% including PHI. We have plenty of work to do at Utilities and with our regulators to keep improving the product we are delivering to our customers, but we are happy with where the overall business is performing. We are obviously pleased with where our earned ROEs are trending, but I want to remind you that there will be variability in the earned ROEs that are different utilities as we go forward. The timing of rate case implementation, weather comparability and in-service states were all at back results. We think the ability to earn strong ROEs and the plan that we had in plan at PHI they improved their ROEs will be the recipe for our future success. On slide 12 we have an update on our rate cases. Since our fourth quarter call, we have closed out the Delmarva Maryland case with a revenue increase of $38 million. We’ve also reached unanimous settlement in our Delmarva Delaware Electric and gas cases for $31.5 million and $4.9 million respectively and would expect commission approval during the second quarter. From our first cycle of planned rate cases we are now down just to the Pepco DC case but we expect the commission decision later in July. We are proud of the hard work from our utilities and regulatory teams, these efforts are helping to get PHI’s revenues and earned book ROEs back on course while we simultaneously improve performance for our customers. As we have shared with you many times before, we’ve always viewed the turnaround in PHI earned ROEs as a – rate case cycle process. To that end, we filed our second rate cases in ACE and Pepco Maryland this quarter. Combined with the outstanding cases from the first cycle that I previously mentioned we are currently asking for $252 million in revenues which reflect recovery on multiple years of capital investments that have been made to improve the reliability of the grid across these jurisdictions. We expect the final ruling on Pepco Maryland and ACE likely in Q4, 2017 and first quarter of 2018 respectively. We plan to file a second cycle of cases in most if not all of PHI’s jurisdictions in 2017 with all completed by the end of 2018 putting us in a position to earn between 9% and 10% ROEs in 2019. More details on the rate cases and the schedules to be found on slide 29 through 36 in the appendix. Slide 13, provides our gross margin update for ExGen. In 2017, total gross margin is flat to our last disclosure. During the quarter, we executed on $150 million of Power New Business and $50 million of Non-Power New Business. We are highly hedged for the rest of this year and have fell down -- generation to load matching strategy. Total gross margin decreased in the first quarter by $50 million in both 2018 and 2019 due to the impact of price changes on our order portfolio. We ended the quarter approximately 12% to 15% behind our ratable hedging program in 2018 an 8% to 11% behind ratable in 2019 when considering cross commodity hedges. The majority of our length is concentrated in the Midwest to align to our view of spot market upside at [Nine]. Although we have increased our lengths in other regions as well. We are comfortable to be more open when we look at market fundamentals. For example, oil regional natural gas prices today are over a $1 per MMbtu higher than they realized last year, yet the forwards for power are only about $1 per megawatt higher. We do not believe that is a sustainable situation. To that point I should note that power prices have risen since the start of the second quarter and have reversed about half of the first quarter price declines. On slide 14 we have highlighted some key recent events. On March 31, 2017 we executed on the creation of the Exelon Generation renewable JV, which will provide us with $400 million of pretax cash, including allocated debt that puts total JV Enterprise value at approximately $1.7 billion, the price implies an EV to EBITDA multiple over ten times and $1 per – [KW] value over $1,200. The JV consists of 1,296 megawatts of renewable generation capacity which is about 35% of our renewable output and has an average contract life of 14 years. The JV structure provides the option to drop down contracted renewable assets from our portfolio in the future. The proceeds from this sale will be used to accelerate our deleveraging strategy. Also on March 31, we closed on the acquisition of the FitzPatrick nuclear station from Entergy which adds 838 megawatts of nuclear capacity to our portfolio. The FitzPatrick plant is part of the New York ZEC program and will receive ZEC payments for the next 12 years which started on April 1. The plant is now operated by Exelon and I am happy to report we had a clean cut over of FitzPatrick onto the Exelon platform. We are excited to have the FitzPatrick employees as part of the Exelon family. Our Exelon generation Texas partnership, commonly referred to as EGTP is a portfolio of 3,476 megawatts of gas generation in Texas. In 2014, we raised $675 million of non-recourse project finance for the assets which currently has a balance of approximately $650 million. With a downturn in ERCOT power markets these assets have been under pressure with a debt rating at a discount of base value for some time and the plant is struggling to generate adequate cash flows. Due to the combination of challenge cash flows and our decision not to inject additional equity we have come to terms with the lenders to pursue an orderly sale of the assets on their... The modest current earnings and all of the debt are still included in our financial outlook. However, we see the ultimate exit from these assets being accretive to our UPS] and debt to EBITDA multiples starting in 2018. In light of the process we are not in a position to expand further out in this transaction. Finally during the quarter, we decided to discontinue the sales process of Mystic 8&9 assets. We were exploring a sale of these assets as a direct result of interest received from potential buyers. During the sales process we ran into some issues with the fuel supply agreement that needs to be addressed. And as we said we would only transact if we were to realize a price greater than our – value. Our continuing to own these assets does not impact our commitments on our debt-to-EBTIDA target and debt reduction plans that we’ve already shared with you. Turning to slide 15, we remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet in our investment grade credit rating. We are forecasting to be a 3.2 times net-to-EBITDA at ExGen by the end of 2017 and have a clear path to our long term target of three times debt-to-EBITDA. On a recourse debt basis, we are already well ahead of our target and taking into account the sale of EGTP we would be on target overall. As we said before we will look to [Indiscernible] whole project once we have reached three times target at ExGen. I’ll now turn the call back to Chris for his closing remarks.
Christopher Crane: Thanks, Jack. This brings us to back to our value proposition shown on slide 16 which ain’t familiar. It is unchanged from our last earnings report and we remain committed to these points. We continue to grow their utility rate base at 6.5% annually through 2020 and regulated EPS by 6% to 8% annually through 2020. We continue to use free cash flow generated at ExGen to fund the incremental equity needs of the utilities of $2.5 billion and pay down approximately $3 billion of debt over the next four years at ExGen and the Holding Company. We are focused on optimizing value for ExGen business by seeking fair compensation for our carbon free generation fleet closing uneconomic plans, opportunistically selling assets where it makes sense to accelerate our debt reduction plan and maximizing value through our gentle load matching strategy. We continue to focus on sustaining strong investment grade credit metrics and grow our dividend in a consistent visible manner. Thank you for your interest and we are now ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Greg Gordon with Evercore.
Greg Gordon: Hello good morning.
Christopher Crane: Good morning, Greg.
Greg Gordon: I notice that when you gave the update on your cash flow projections for the balance of the year that it’s several hundred million dollars higher. I don’t remember exactly the slide number. It’s slide 18. It looks like the utilities are the major contributors to that with a modest decline and expected ExGen cash flow, can you give us a little more color on that?
Christopher Crane: Sure Greg. It is the utilities and some of its energy efficiency timing and some of its just working capital, so we are about I think $200 million roughly higher than our expectation.
Greg Gordon: Okay. Is that sort of a – is that a sort of a permanent affect in terms of as I think about rolling the balance sheet forward or is that more of a timing issue on when you are going to collect cash flows or spend capital?
Christopher Crane: The working capital is more of a timing issue, some of the energy efficiency is permanent.
Greg Gordon: Okay, can you give us the sense of what the split is there?
Christopher Crane: $100 million energy efficiency, sorry.
Greg Gordon: Okay. Thank you very much. Second question and maybe it’s not something you are able to really engage with me on the call on, but one of the reasons why I think the stock has underperformed is because people are looking obviously you’ve had a little bit of softness in the 18,19 curves. You already told us that’s bounced a little bit but if people are looking forward to the sort of 2020 role coming this fall and looking at the open theoretically open position and worried about the capacity market print and thinking while 2020 is going to be another down year. So I don’t know if you can comment on how that looks today and also how that dovetails with what you continue to do with vis-à-vis debt reduction at the – at ExGen because while the balance sheet looks like it’s in absolutely great shape today if EBITDA keeps going south, there is sort of a bar keeps going up every year in terms of what you have to do with your cash flow to keep it at that level of leverage.
Christopher Crane: A couple of thoughts Greg. One, I think it’s probably given the liquidity in the market premature to forecast our 2020 ExGen earnings. But one thing to keep in context, on a recourse basis by 2020 we’ll have $4 billion of debt. That is the most pristine balance sheet I think in this sector. So, from a strength perspective with the balance sheet and the ability to deal with the cyclicality of markets I think we are well positioned. Our fundamental perspective would be that as liquidity returns to the market prices are going up across and our hedging approach and the length that we are carrying relative to ratable is the master of that. So I think it’s meaningfully premature to be trading on 20/20 in 2017.
Greg Gordon: Fair enough. Thank you guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.
Jonathan Arnold: Good morning guys.
Christopher Crane: Good morning.
Jonathan Arnold: Question on, you mentioned I think that you would be bidding the units in the PJM auction and the same I think you said responsible fashion. Can you give us any insight into what you see as different in the PJM auction set up with respect to say the and the QUAD which has the ZEC and Clinton which obviously cleared at a low price in MISO is there anything we should be thinking as we compare those two situations?
Joseph Nigro: Good morning. It’s Joe Nigro. I’ll take that question and answer it and if I’ll start by saying we have a long standing practice of really not discussing our bidding strategy around the capacity auctions where we think it will clear. I think there is one thing that we have to take into account; it’s the timing that you auctioned. The MISO auction was for June of this year through May of next year, and the PJM auction obviously is much further out in the curve. When you think about the operations of the power plant and the fuel loaded in the [Indiscernible] for example, that plant was going to continue to operate during that period. What I’d most say about QUAD cities in the bidding is we are going to continue to remain responsible in the way we bid our capacity reflecting the underlying economics of our plant and that’s consistent with what we’ve done with past options. I think the major question mark with this option continues to be as Chris mentioned bidding behavior from the existing generation as well as the discipline associated with new goals. As it relates to existing facilities we continue to see economically challenged plants that have cleared previous options and in addition to that we see the economics, the new goals being marginal. In your last option we cleared about 27 gig watts of base capacity which was about 16% of the total procurement and it remains to be seen how that 27 gig watts would participate in this auction but the big variables as I mentioned will continue to be the bidding of all the plants and we will remain discipline in that regard with all our facilities.
Jonathan Arnold: Okay. Thanks, Joe. And then, could I also ask on that, I guess, topical issue today, but can you quantify to or describe your exposure to Westinghouse as a supplier presumably in the field business primarily and how we should -- is there any concerns you have with regard to the bankruptcy?
Christopher Crane: It’s something that we follow closely not only as a supplier but for the industry. We have reviewed our positions that we have commercially with them. We’re not concerned at this time, but we’ll continue to watch it closely few fabrication. We continue to see that is an ongoing entity in the services business. We continue to gain support to see that is an ongoing entity. None of us know how it’s going to shake out yet, but we have minimal exposure there.
Jonathan Arnold: So, can you give us sort of percentage of the fleet of that service or supply fuel too perhaps?
Christopher Crane: I can get the number for you. We continue to competitively bid our reactor fuel suppliers between multiple suppliers and we move that around based off of pricing but we are not held hostage to a single entity on fuel fabrication.
Jonathan Arnold: All right. Thanks Chris.
Operator: Your next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.
Steve Fleishman: Yes. Hi, good morning. Just wanted to get your thoughts on this DOE review going on baseload generation and maybe we also just have this FERC Conference and how these might tie into kind of state-by-state ZEC process that has occurred so far, we’re trying to be of help this for generation. What could come out of DOE?
Christopher Crane: Yes. Steve, let me start off and talk a little bit about the Technical Conference over the last couple of days. There were three buckets of issues that I think we got to look at. One is carbon pricing on the market and what FERC could do to facilitate the states who are interested in doing that. The second bucket would be the Mopar issues, that’s PJM Grid 2020 [Indiscernible] ISO put out, and the third bucket are energy reforms. And so I think all three of these things are implied as well in connection with the Secretaries. Now, let me talk about the three. First, we think there was a constructive discussion around having one of the issues that has limited the ability of states to incorporate aggressive pricings between the states and I think there was good discussion around what FERC could do to address that problem. There is I think a plenty of degree to solve Technical Conference, a growing recognition that putting carbon explicitly in the market is something that would address a lot of these issues and there is growing receptivity to that. The issue of the Mopar that's where I think it most directly addresses the state ZEC programs and the REC programs. The New England proposal doesn't deal with existing baseload generation or existing generation of any kind, frankly and that’s consistent with FERC’s President. And so that template wouldn’t have any effect on the state programs. The PJM proposal does however deal with existing resources. And we have not historically supported that proposal. We recognize PJM has made some important changes and those were talked about at the Technical conferences. The issue with the Mopar from our perspective is that it is the distraction from some unfinished work that we believe FERC and PJM want to get to first. Unfortunately it’s become little bit of tempest in a teapot, in a sense that there’s a false narrative out there that the challenges to the IPP sector are driven by ZEC and REC policies, when in fact number of our college in business saw equity value is dropped by 70% and 80% before the ZEC even came in to our dialogue. So we don’t think the Mopar is an approach that it’s going to be workable, applies in a face of what states are looking to do. I don’t think it will that effective. We talked about MISO Zone 4, its notable that. And we did Clinton in a way where we’d not have cleared the matter of auction or had been excluded by Mopar, the price in MISO would have risen from a$1.50 to $5 a megawatt that certainly not going to address the downstate issues that ING and others are facing. At the end, we agree with what Chairman, [Indiscernible] and she basically question the wisdom of approaching this problem set with more Mopars per units that are receiving state environmental attribute payments. And I think that's why New York ISO, MISO and others are not going in that direction. So, that’s we don’t agree with the direction on the Mopar, but let me talk to you about something important that came up during recession and I think we do reporting that. And that is [India] talked about in Monday session and I’m going to loosely quote saying that we politely ignored energy market design problems that are under value in baseload access. And here, we can’t afford to ignore those problems any more. And we completely agree with that. We talk and talk over the last few years of that energy pricing problems in the markets, can’t back sold, negative pricing, to back that certain units and set price certain hours, the over commitment of resources driving uplift and a whole host of issues that we’ve had technical conference is on and white paper on and we just having gotten, started and working on that. And as a consequence, and not addressing those energy market issues, states and our customers are being deprived of assets that add resiliency, they add fuel diversity and they add some environmental benefit. And so, what we expect to do at the end of the technical conference you heard California and others echo this is we want set a deadline for bringing to conclusion again our energy market reforms that we’ve talked about. And we think that talking about Mopars or other things that interfere with states rates before we fixed the energy market problems it’s a little bit like putting your shoes on before you putting your pants up. At the end of the day, it makes you look a little bit sold. And so once we get a reconstituted format at FERC, we’re going to go after these energy price reforms and we think Secretary Perry's memo opens the door to address these issues. So we think for last couple of days at Secretary Perry's memo gives us an opening to look at some unfinished business that we have get at it. So, long answer, big subject, but we see lot of promise than we what we saw in last couple of days and we’d see a lot of promise with the DOE is working on that. We have to get this stuff over the finish line.
Steve Fleishman: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS Securities.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Good morning everyone.
Christopher Crane: Good morning Julien.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: So, perhaps just to take it back couple of questions here, can we talk about the non nuclear generation strategy, specifically I wanted to just follow-up little bit on the renewable sell down. First, what's the remaining EBITDA that could be eligible to be sold down if you want to qualify it that way? And then secondly, can you talk about whether or not you would eventually review the mystic sales. Is this something about restructuring the fuel arrangement and a matter of time or is probably something that it’s going to be on the back burner for a little bit? And actually I’ll throw the third question at the same time. With regards to Texas its not be very clear about this deed. The new Texas combined cycle assets or separate discrete process to the extent which that you ultimately divest and/or lose control of the ExGen taxes asset. It’s correct?
Christopher Crane: That last question is correct. And they’re totally separate and would be operated that way. They are not part of the divestiture process. On the first two questions, Jack.
Jack Thayer: So Julien, with the JV structure we have the opportunity to sell down further assets, the two that come to mind are our AVSR solar facility which in 29th but that would not occur until 2019, but we’ve got to get through the ITC recovery period for that. And the second assets would be our Albany Green Energy facility, it is wood-burning plant that hasn’t contract to off-takers down in Georgia, that’s coming online this year which could facilitate to drop down end of 2017 more likely 2018 and that’s all contemplated as part of the overall structure with the JV. With respect to the EBITDA I’m not going to drill down into that and with respect to the GDP given the sales process that we’re working with the lenders on, I just don’t think it’s pretty impress to disclose the – and then with respect to Mystic, again, I answer that.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes. Would you revisit Mystic, just to follow-up on that one or is that something is off of the table for now?
Christopher Crane: We’re not going to talk a lot of details, but as we see in asset in that portfolio as a potential to create value and recycled capital we’ll look at them. We will look at it on an annual basis. We have some work to do on that one site, but we’ll continue to evaluate it going forward.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. Just to understand the JV structure bit further. On the renewable sale why not sell down the whole entity overtime as part of a wider deleveraging, why opt for this sort of JV structure?
Christopher Crane: We’re still committed to clean portfolio. It’s being in the renewable business is still part of our strategy. At this point maintaining the operational control, that maintenance and other facilities is important for us for our investment. And we’re getting a fair return from those, but at this point we felt that the valuation that we were getting in the market allowed us to recycle the capitals, so we’re not existing the renewable business and we continue to put about 125 million a year into solar at the CNI level or some of our national customers and We’ll continue to look at that portfolio how to best manage those investments going forward.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. Thank you for the patient.
Operator: Your next question comes from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.
Stephen Byrd: Hi. Good morning.
Christopher Crane: Hi, Steve.
Stephen Byrd: I wanted to follow-up up on Steve’s question on the department of energy review. In terms of potential agencies or entities involved in your mind is that most likely to be FERC or Federal Legislation, in other words, I guess I'm struggling to figure out how the Department of Energy itself could provide economic support for baseload whether the nuclear, coal or gas. What sort of entities would most likely be involved and I guess I’m thinking if the states are providing value for environmental benefits from ZECs and the ISOs are providing the reliability benefits through capacity performance. What other elements are not being captured? Or what other tools are potential here?
Christopher Crane: Yes. Let me assume this [Indiscernible] couple of parts to that. First we think the DOE has an important role in setting policy, I think the implementation inform of that policy could in certain instances being new legislation, it could be things that are at the ARC in terms of regulatory burdens on nuclear, but it would involve the commission in that sense, it could involve changes in rules at FERC. But DOE is going to have an important voice in our view and this policy discussion and we’ll set the tone even if you can’t complete all of the objectives. There are certain tools that DOE has Section 202(c) authority under the Federal Power Act as an example allows them to secure resources in the market that are needed. That is a power that has been used sparingly I thing only two times in history, but certainly there is a discussion around the use of it for baseload resources. With regard to attribute payments I think environmental attribute payments I think we’re kind of been to wait and see where the administration goes on carbon, but I think you’re general sentiment is correct that that’s not something we see immediately coming out of the department. But U.S. kind of more fundamental question is, states are covering environmental and PJM is covering the liability. What’s left? Well, I tell you what’s left. What’s left is resiliency which is a little bit of a different concept than reliability. Reliability assumes that pipeline infrastructure and other critical pieces are in place. PJM assumes that and says whether there is some reliability impacts or the reliability expectations could be met. Resiliency looks a little bit deeper at that and understands the impact of pipeline disruptions on natural gas-fired generation and should we start modeling those sorts of things, is there a value there. The other piece is that it’s not currently valued in the market is fuel diversity. As we transition to a market that is made up more and more of just natural gas, we’re exposing our customers to fuel price volatility in the long run. Those things because of the short-term nature of the market are fully considered, but if you look at Secretary Perry’s memo and it gets a second bullet point, second and third bullet points so that memo address those very issues.
Stephen Byrd: That’s very, very helpful to think through. Really appreciate that. And then just I wanted to revisit your nuclear operational capabilities and appetite for growing your ownership of nuclear plants. I mean you acknowledge as a very strong nuclear owner and operator. Under what circumstances would you think about increasing ownership of merchant nuclear generation? What kind of criteria would you think about in terms of your appetite for doing so?
Christopher Crane: Yes. We have interest in increasing merchant exposure across any technology. What we would look at is only contracted secure revenue streams going forward, it’s pretty clear cut.
Stephen Byrd: That makes sense. But that could include state to state sort to determine payments rather than a classic PPAs, is that fair?
Christopher Crane: Yes. That is fair.
Stephen Byrd: Okay. That’s all I had. Thank you.
Christopher Crane: Thanks. It’s time for one more question, operator.
Operator: Okay. Your next question comes from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.
Shahriar Pourreza: Hey, guys. Good morning.
Christopher Crane: Good morning.
Shahriar Pourreza: Just real question on how you sort of thinking about the dividend and you’ve got utility that’d eventually to sell fund, sell fund the dividend and cover the whole co-interest. What data points are you looking at where you could sort of think about revisiting the growth rate. Is sort of clarity around PJM? Is clarity around ZECs? What sort of a data point we should be thinking about?
Christopher Crane: Yes. We updated our dividend policy. The board updated the dividend policy about a year ago and gave you the clarity through 2018 on annual 2.5% increase of the dividend. As we said at the time we want to give you a longer-term view on dividend policy. What we need to do is execute on our rate cases in our efficiency at the utilities and in costs and operations. And so 2017 is going to be a big year to continue to have that focus. And so as we come through 2000 into 2018 we can have a dialogue with the board looking at we’re achieving or close to achieving the goal towards 2018, 2019 on where we were going financially in our focus and strategy. So next year – this year is a big to perform. Next year is a year where we should be working very hard to give you a longer term view.
Shahriar Pourreza: Excellent. And then just lastly on retail, just maybe a little bit of an update. I mean, obviously there are some businesses that have changed hands. There some consolidation. There’s some obviously some trends, segment turnings into bit of oligopoly. So I'm curious on just from a generality standpoint what you're seeing as far as the margin environment and that would be helpful?
Joseph Nigro: Good morning. It’s Joe Nigro. I’ll answer the last question first. Our retail margins for C&I origination still remain between that $2 to $4 we talked about well within that payment. The market hasn’t seen volatility and we continue to monitor that. The consolidation overall helps because there is less participants in the marketplace we’ve acquired companies ourselves, obviously all the big entities that have come to this face that hasn’t been there historically. That’s been a positive. We have seen some aggressive bidding behavior by some smaller entities in certain sectors like government, contracting and other things but overall we continue to monitor this very closely and we are comfortable with the projections we have in our margins remain in net $2 to $4 space.
Shahriar Pourreza: Got it. Terrific. Thanks guys.
Christopher Crane: Thanks, Pou.
Operator: That is all the time we have for questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to Chris Crane for closing remarks.
Christopher Crane: Thank you. We appreciate your time and interest in Exelon. We really are off to a great start in 2017 and look forward to executing on the commitments we’ve made to you. So appreciate your time today and I’ll end the call.
Operator: That does conclude today’s conference call. You may now disconnect your lines.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Stephanie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Exelon Corporation 2016 Q4 earnings call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Dan Eggers. Please go ahead, sir.
Daniel L. Eggers - Exelon Corp.: Thank you, Stephanie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Leading the call today are Chris Crane, Exelon's President and Chief Executive Officer, and Jack Thayer, Exelon's Chief Financial Officer. They're joined by other members of Exelon's senior management team, who will be available to answer your questions after our prepared remarks. We issued our earnings release this morning along with the presentation, both of which can be found on the Investor Relations section of Exelon's website. The earnings release and other matters which we discuss during today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today's material and comments made during the call. Please refer to today's 8-K and Exelon's other SEC filings for discussions of risk factors and factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts, and expectations. Today's presentation also includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for reconciliations between non-GAAP measures to the nearest equivalent GAAP measures. We have scheduled 45 minutes for today's call. I'll turn it now over to Chris Crane, Exelon's CEO.
Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.: Thanks, Dan, and good morning to all. Thank you for joining us. 2016 was a monumental year for Exelon, and I'm very proud of what we have accomplished. We made great progress in the ongoing transformation of our company while delivering on our commitments. We performed well financially. Our 2016 GAAP earnings at $1.22 and our non-GAAP earnings were $2.68, landing near the top of our original guidance range of $2.40 to $2.70. At the utilities, we benefited from a hot summer and low storm costs. At ExGen, the nuclear fleet had its best performance year on record. And at Constellation, the team executed very, very well. In 2016, for the first time, our regulated utility, less the holding company, earnings represented more than half of the total earnings and is consistent with our goal for the utilities to be growing the majority of our EPS. And we've implemented a dividend growth strategy of 2.5% annually through 2018. In March, we closed on the acquisition of PHI, adding $8.3 billion to our utility rate base and creating a significant geographic footprint covering the Mid-Atlantic region. The integration of PHI is going better than planned, help by our experience with BGE. We are working our way through the first of the two cycles of catch-up rate cases at the PHI utilities. We're seeing additional opportunities to help and improve the business processes in the stakeholder outreach process as we go through those rate cases. The other banner highlight for 2016 was the creation of the ZEC programs in both New York and Illinois. For years, we have argued that all clean energy resources be treated the same way for their environmental attributes. We're able to work with a wide range of stakeholders in both states to enact programs that compensate these plans for their environmental attributes. As a result of these programs, we plan to continue to operate five plants and protect high-paying jobs, preserve needed tax basis in rural communities and maintain irreplaceable emission-free base load power production. These programs provide a supplemental cash flow for up to 12 years for some of our most at-risk plants. Illinois legislation also provides significant benefit for our customers in energy efficiency, additional renewable generation and to benefit lower income customers. The program also adds to the earnings visibility at ComEd by implementing a decoupling mechanism, supporting energy efficiency investments where we now will be able to earn a return on those investments, and extending the formula rate to 2022. In 2016, we also found ways to further grow stable revenue streams. We deployed $5.2 billion of CapEx at the utilities, growing the rate base by $2 billion, acquired ConEd Solutions, and will close the FitzPatrick nuclear plant station this spring. We have completed nine transmission and distribution rate cases, providing revenue increases of $397 million. None of these accomplishments would be possible without the remarkable 34,000 employees that work hard every day to keep the power and gas flowing. Our workers donated over 170,000 hours to local non-profits, and Exelon donated $46 million, both of which were the most ever for Exelon. The commitment to our community is clearly part of who we are and shows our engagement beyond the products we deliver every day. We also recognize that the support of our employees is essential to high-performing work cultures, and that is why Exelon took industry lead on two important initiatives in 2016. We expanded our paid leave policies to what are truly the best in class, with 16 weeks of maternity leave, 8 weeks for fathers and adopted parents, and 2 weeks of family leave. We were also the first utility to sign the White House Equal Pay pledge. Being a good citizen also means supporting our local businesses. In 2016, our spend with female and minority-owned businesses reached $1.9 billion, over 200% since 2011, and it represents almost 20% of our sourceable spending. The team has done a great job making sure we work with our suppliers across all our communities. Doing the right thing by our employees and communities is the smart thing for business. And more importantly, it's the right thing to do. We are proud to be leading the industry forward on these fronts. Turning to operations, our utilities had a great year. The legacy Exelon utilities continued to perform at top quartile on key operating and customer satisfaction metrics. These are the foundations of a constructive regulatory relationship. The efforts at PHI before the merger and our intense focus on operations since then has started to show benefits. The color blocks are improving even compared to 2015, although we did get some help from favorable weather in 2016. PHI is still improving. We're encouraged by the gain so far, and we have plan in place to deliver for our customers and stakeholders. The color blocks show great performance, but this actually is underselling how well we did in 2016. We actually had a number of best-evers this year. ComEd, BGE, PECO had had their best customer satisfaction ever. ComEd and PHI outage frequency were the best ever. And BGE had its shortest average outage duration ever. The benefits of our uniform management model across the utilities, our smart grid initiative, and our continued reliability spending are clearly paying dividends for our customers. Turning to our non-regulated business operations, we had a banner year in generation as well. Our nuclear fleet had its highest ever capacity factor at 94.6% versus the industry average of 90.4%, which allowed us to produce an additional 7 terawatt hours more and approximately $275 million of revenue than if we had just been average. We also had the shortest average refueling duration ever, just over 22 days versus the industry average of 37 days. The fact the entire fleet performed so well against the backdrop of potential plant closures and fighting for ZECs is truly a testament to the professionalism of the workforce, which we all are greatly appreciative of. Our gas, hydro, and renewable assets also had a good year, strong energy capture on the renewable and the power dispatch on our conventional plants. At Constellation, the team performed exceptionally well. Our customer renewal rate was 77% for electric and 91% for gas. Equally important, our new business win rate was at 28% last year, and our C&I market share grew to 25%. Now, I'm going to turn the call over to Jack to provide the financial update.
Jonathan W. Thayer - Exelon Corp.: Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. My remarks today will focus on 2016 results, 2017 earnings guidance, and updates to a number of our financial disclosures including gross margin. Going forward, the fourth quarter will be when we update key financial disclosures and roll our hedge disclosures over the year. On slide 8, as Chris stated, we had a very strong year financially and operationally across the company. For the full year, we delivered adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings of $2.68 per share, near the top end of our original guidance range of $2.40 to $2.70 per share. Strong performance at both our utility and generation businesses drove these results. The appendix contains further detail on both our fourth quarter and full-year financial results by operating company on slides 52 and 53. Turning to slide 9, we expect to deliver full-year 2017 adjusted operating earnings of $2.50 to $2.80 per share with the first quarter in the range of $0.55 to $0.65 per share. Our 2017 guidance range includes a full-year contribution from PHI, contributions from the FitzPatrick plants after closing, and the partial year impacts of the New York and Illinois ZEC programs that start on April 1 and June 1 respectively. The growth in utility earnings primarily reflects continued reliability investments at ComEd, plus higher formulaic allowed ROEs, as well as increased rates from the recent distribution rate cases at BGE, ACE, and Pepco Maryland. These are partially offset by higher O&M at PECO and BGE related to a return to normal storing costs after a calmer 2016, as well as higher depreciation and amortization driven by capital expenditures. At Exelon Generation, the year-over-year decrease is primarily driven by the impact of hedging into lower energy prices, partially offset by revenues from the New York and Illinois ZEC programs as well as the new Texas CCGTs coming online this summer. More detail on the year-over-year drivers by operating company can be found on the appendix starting on slide 55. On slide 10, let's turn to our updated multi-year forecast, and we'll cover 2017 to 2020 and provide a refresh of what we shared with you at the Analyst Day. For your convenience, in the appendix, we show these updated numbers side-by-side against the Analyst Day numbers. We'll invest more than $20 billion into our utilities to the benefit of our customers over the next four years, which is a slight increase since Analyst Day. Upside comes from the Future Energy Jobs Bill in Illinois, which will allow ComEd to grow rate base and earn a fair rate of return on energy efficiency investments. We now project rate base growth of 6.5% through 2020. On slide 11, of the $9 billion of rate base growth expected through 2020, approximately 75% is covered under either formula rates or other similar types of mechanisms. These timely recovery mechanisms allow us to make additional investments on the behalf of our customers while supporting our ability to earn our allowed ROE. Where we do not have mechanisms, we will continue to work with stakeholders to enact and implement these types of tools. I should also note that following the passage of the Illinois legislation, more than 70% of our rate base is decoupled. On slide 12, we showed the trailing 12-month blended transmission-distribution earned book ROE at each of the PHI utilities relative to their allowed ROEs. ROEs at PHI have improved modestly, but there's still much work to be done. Legacy Exelon utilities had a strong 2016, earning 10.5% as a group, helped by favorable weather and lower-than-normal storm activity. On a weather-normalized basis, the earned returns or ROEs would be closer to 10.1%. Improving the earned ROEs at PHI and sustaining a strong performance of the legacy Exelon utilities will be important to meeting our overall utility earnings growth targets. Going forward, we will provide a slide on a quarterly basis to keep you updated on the progress we're making from an earned returns perspective. On slide 13, we have an update on our current rate cases that are still in progress. Since our last update, we have completed two of the pending rate cases, the Pepco Maryland case was decided in November and we received a $52.5 million revenue increase. In addition, the ComEd annual formula rate filing was settled in December with an increase of $127 million related to approximately $2.4 billion in capital investments made in 2015. Those investments which includes $663 million for smart grid-related work has helped strengthen and modernize the electric system. We still have four pending rate cases at Pepco and Delmarva, combined we're asking for $216 million in revenues, which reflects recovery on multiple years of smart meter and other capital investments that have been made to improve the reliability of the grid across these jurisdictions. We expect the final ruling on the Delmarva Maryland case in mid-February, with the remaining cases being completed over the summer. More details on the rate cases can be found on slide 61 through 66 in the appendix. Consistent with our previous discussions, we expect to file rate cases in each of the PHI jurisdictions again in 2017, as we continue to close the gap between allowed and earned ROEs. Slide 14 provides an update on our outlook for utility EPS. The bars are largely the same as in Analyst Day, albeit $0.05 higher in 2017 and 2020. The increase in 2017 is due to continued cost management efforts; and the increase in 2020 is due to ComEd ROEs and efficiency-related investments. With a higher 2017 starting point, we now project strong 6% to 8% utility EPS growth through 2020. Turning to slide 15, we've modified our gross margin disclosures for ExGen. We now include a new line that carves out capacity and ZEC revenues. ZEC revenues are the payments Exelon receives in New York and Illinois for the beneficial environmental attributes of our nuclear plants. The purpose of this new line item is to clearly call out the portion of our gross margin that is more contracted in nature. As a result of including ZEC revenues from New York and Illinois, the FitzPatrick acquisition and the reserved – reversal of the shutdown decisions of Quad Cities and Clinton, total gross margin increased by $650 million, $1.05 billion and $1.1 billion in 2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively. Almost all the gross margin changes relate to the fleet updates with changes in power prices, adding $50 million in 2018 and costing us $50 million in 2019. Turning to slide 16, on our last earnings call, we announced we were reducing O&M by $100 million in 2018 and $125 million in 2019 at ExGen, adding to the $400 million of savings we've already taken out of the business. The baseline O&M outlook remains the same from last quarter, although the total O&M cost outlook has increased with the addition of the FitzPatrick, Quad Cities, and Clinton power stations which we break out on the slides for your reference. Our baseline capital spend is decreasing through 2020, driven by the proactive investments we've made in our nuclear fleet over the years. These investments have resulted in best-in-class performance and reduced risks for significant unplanned capital spend in the future. On slide 40, we provide greater detail on these investments and the impact they have had on the nuclear fleet since 2010. We continue to run an efficient organization, and we'll always look for ways to reduce costs and run the fleet more cost effectively while maintaining the highest standards for safety and reliability. Turning to slide 17, ExGen will generate nearly $7 billion of free cash flow through 2020, which is more free cash flow for that time period than what was included in our Analyst Day disclosure. This is primarily driven by the incremental cash associated with the New York and Illinois ZEC programs, partially offset by the impacts of lower power prices in the outer years. As we've said before, we will use ExGen's free cash flow to fund utility investment and pay down over $3 billion of debt through 2020. Turning to slide 18, we remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and our investment-grade credit rating. We are forecasting to be at 3.3 times debt-to-EBITDA at ExGen by the end of 2017 and have a clear path to our long-term target of 3 times debt-to-EBITDA. As we've said before, we will look to retire holding company debt once we've reached the 3 times target at ExGen. From a recourse perspective, we are already below the 3 times debt-to-EBITDA level at 2.7 times, as shown here on the slide. This ratio will continue to decline as well with the paydown of debt to reach our consolidated 3 times target. The health of our ExGen balance sheet is strong and is continuing to improve. Before I turn the call over to Chris, I'd like to spend a few minutes on the potential impacts of tax reform legislation of Exelon, which has been a topic of discussion since the election. Research reports and our peers who have already reported earnings have discussed the impacts to the sector and their businesses. From a policy perspective, we think simplifying the tax code and lowering rates is the right objective. We are actively working with our partners at EEI and NEI and on our own to help inform the ultimate tax design. No legislation has been introduced at this time, so no details on exactly what will be included or how it will be => included is available beyond the short description of the Trump plan or the House blueprint. In fact, just last week, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Hatch said he's not planning on using the House legislation as a starting point. So the Senate will have its own bill, and there's no proposal for that bill at this time. And President Trump's economic team has stated that they will have their own views on tax reform once they're in place. At this time, there's no way to know what a tax reform package will look like or how long it will take to advance, which leads us to the mindset that is premature to quantify how tax reform will impact Exelon's financial outlook. We run a wide range of scenarios to understand the high-level impacts of common themes in the House and Trump plans. The House blueprint, excluding order adjustment provisions, will be neutral for our utilities, neutral to positive at the GenCo, and negative at the holding company due to the elimination of all interest deductibility. Order adjustment will be an additional negative at ExGen due to the importation of nuclear fuel, and at that the utilities would raise the cost of imported T&D capital equipment that goes in the rate base. We've seen significant opposition to both the border adjustment and elimination of interest expense deductibility recently, leaving the fate of these provisions unclear. To the extent the Trump campaign becomes the basis of legislation and the election is made to take interest deductibility rather than immediately expense capital additions, it could be meaningfully positive to Exelon's earnings. We see a long path until tax policy has clarity. We'll continue to advocate for the best interest of our customers and shareholders as legislation is developed. With that, I'll now turn the call back to Chris for his closing remarks.
Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.: Thanks, Jack. This next slide should look familiar to you at this point. This is Exelon's value proposition, and we are not wavering from these commitments. Strong utility growth, we expect to grow the rate base at 2.5% annually through 2020 – at 6.5%. Dan caught that one right away, 6.5% annually through 2020, which converts to EPS growth off our 2017 midpoint of 6% to 8% a year. We will continue to look for opportunities to invest in reliability and customer service. ExGen is expected to generate nearly $7 billion of free cash flow through 2020, which is better than we had budgeted at the Analyst Day. We will use this free cash flow primarily to invest in the utilities, pay down over $3 billion of debt over the next years. And we will continue to optimize the value of ExGen through best-in-class operating like we saw in 2016, capturing the benefits of our gen-to-load matching strategy, and fair compensation for our clean energy assets, similar to what we've accomplished in Illinois and New York. We remain focused on the balance sheet and are comfortably exceeding our credit metrics targets over the planning horizon. And our capital allocation priorities will remain the same, regulated utility growth, dividend growth, and debt reduction. The leadership team firmly believes we can deliver on these commitments to our shareholders. Our executive compensation is directly tied to these goals, with the long-term components driven by hitting the multi-year earnings targets at the utilities which ensures we grow this business as we've committed to you. Meeting our targets improvements in earned ROEs at the utilities, which ensure we turn around the performance of the PHI utilities and maintain a strong investment grade credit metrics, which ensures the financial health of the business, no matter what the commodity price backdrop is. Finally, our long-term compensation will be adjusted point per point with the three-year performance relative to the UTY, meaning that we are directly aligned with the long-term shareholders. I'm proud of everything that this team has accomplished in 2016 and very excited about the plan we have in place for the future. So, with that, Stephanie, we can open it up for questions.
Operator: Our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore.
Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI: Thanks. Just a couple of quick questions as you guys were pretty thorough. So, can you give us an update on where you were on some of the tactical decisions you've made to sell down or exit from certain businesses, both the sell-down of the renewables business and the process on Mystic?
Jonathan W. Thayer - Exelon Corp.: Greg, it's Jack. I'll take that. So, I'll start with the renewables. I think it's been widely reported that that we've been in the markets talking about a joint venture for our renewables business, and that process is going well. We want to maintain a stake in that business as it's important to our overall participation in the energy complex. We do have a significant amount of project-level debt on those projects. So there is a thinner equity layer on top of that. So the proceeds, while meaningful, will be used for debt reduction. We'd expect that to be a very positive event for the company. With respect to the Mystic process, that process continues to be underway. We've had broad interest in those assets as they play a key role in that needful market in Downtown Boston. We continue to work with the various stakeholders to draw it to a conclusion. And we look forward to that having a favorable outcome as well here.
Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI: Jack, can you give us any insight as to why it's taken longer than maybe we had initially expected when we – when you first articulated a desire to potentially sell those assets, it was at the EEI last year. And there was the potential for sort of an event early in the first quarter, and we still haven't seen that. And then, even if you were to get a deal tomorrow, given the lack of a quorum at the FERC, what are we looking at in terms of realistic timing to actually come to a closing of a transaction there?
Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.: So, if we did openly talk about it after it had been leaked and figured we get that out there, but there is no fire sale here. We need to take our time and go through the process and make sure we obtain the right value for us and for all involved in it, so working through it, and we'll keep you informed when we're at a closure.
Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI: Okay. But assuming you got a price that was accretive to what you think the implied value is today for ExGen, that would accelerate the deleveraging that you're talking about here on slide 18 in the handout, right?
Jonathan W. Thayer - Exelon Corp.: That's correct, Greg.
Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI: Okay. Fantastic. And the growth rate target for the utility now, that's just clearly a function of having a higher base in 2017, you're $0.05 higher in 2020. So, the headline number is not a reduction in the expectations, it's just algebra, right?
Jonathan W. Thayer - Exelon Corp.: That's correct. And you'll know with the passage of Illinois legislation and the energy efficiency programs, the solar programs we added to CapEx at ComEd, rather substantively throughout the curve. I think it's also important to note, we have a pretty conservative policy on only putting into our CapEx forecast the utilities, plants that are fully formed for capital investment. So, as time progresses and as we see opportunities to invest in the behalf of our customer, there are the opportunities for that rate base and capital budget to grow in those outer periods.
Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI: Right. I have more questions, but I'll go back in the queue. Thanks.
Jonathan W. Thayer - Exelon Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Good morning, guys.
Jonathan W. Thayer - Exelon Corp.: Good morning.
Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.: Good morning.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Can I ask, Jack, I noticed you mentioned that the – that debt reduction target on slide 17 is now ExGen and HoldCo, and I think before it was just ExGen, so just to confirm that – if that is the case. And secondly, how much of the $3 billion roughly is it going to take to get to the 3x debt-to-EBITDA target? So, how much is therefore left over for HoldCo on the current plan?
Jonathan W. Thayer - Exelon Corp.: So, Jonathan your first comment is correct. We previously were talking about retiring debt at the GenCo, now we see the opportunity once we achieved 3 times debt-to-EBITDA to retire debt at the holding company. With respect to the debt retired – we'll retire at the holding company, we have a $900 million maturity in 2020, where I think you could see us potentially retire debt or some component of debt, and we're looking at opportunities with use of proceeds from a variety of strategic activities that we have ongoing to address the roughly $600 million of ExCorp that's not tied to the mandatory convertibles reissuance of $1.15 billion in 2017.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: What's roughly the timing that you see in this kind of – through 2020 outlook that you'd get to 3x on the GenCo absent an asset sale?
Jonathan W. Thayer - Exelon Corp.: I think it's – I think – I think we can get there through cash generation I think over the next, say, two to three years. And then, we can – as we get out in the 2019, 2020, we can work against the holding company.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you. And then, if I could ask one other thing on – can you give us any sort of thoughts around potential for other states to consider New York and Illinois style nuclear measures?
Joseph Dominguez - Exelon Corp.: Jonathan, this is Joe Dominguez. Right now, active discussions are occurring in Connecticut which is probably the most advanced. We believe those discussions will be started in Ohio, already have been relatively shortly in New Jersey and in Pennsylvania. I think all of the states, as Chris indicated before, states that understand the value of the nuclear plants and want to keep these plants operational, and so the level of discussion is at different stages, some with fully formed legislation that's already moving through committee, that's the case in Connecticut, and stakeholder average (32:16).
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. That's it, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe.
Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC: Hi, good morning. Can you hear me okay?
Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.: Yes, we hear you fine, Steve.
Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC: Great. Just a couple of nuclear questions. First, could you give a sense on the appeal process on the ZECs, I guess, in New York, and when we should know from the court kind of roughly either way on the ruling both, I guess, your motion to dismiss and then an actual ruling?
Joseph Dominguez - Exelon Corp.: So in the Federal Court action in New York, as you noted, a motion to dismiss has been filed. That's been fully briefed. I know a number of you have asked for the briefing packages, and those are available to anybody who would like them. We feel very strongly about our case and we believe it should be dismissed on that motion. But if it proceeds to trial, that trial will occur through to the balance of the second quarter, and we would expect a decision sometime this summer.
Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC: Okay. And then just more broadly on nuclear, there's been talk of the Trump administration wanting to do something for nuclear. Is there any better visibility on what they might be looking at or things that you might be suggesting?
Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.: There hasn't been any concrete conversations, just a preliminary recognition of what's going on in the marketplace and the need to maintain the diverse power sources, looking at the economics, local economics of them and the benefit to the customer. So just starting, a lot more dialogue will happen with NEI and the administration, and we're staying involved with NEI and also with our own folks interfacing with the administration.
Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC: Okay, one separate question on tax reform. I know you don't want to get into specifics, but just if we think about your company and the issues you care most about getting fixed or adjusted, are there any particular ones that you're most focused on addressing of the different factors that you mentioned?
Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.: Yes, we think Jack did a good job framing up why it's really premature for us to get point to point. I spent a lot of time on my own and with the EEI leadership in DC to look at this effect on utilities, utility customers, and what has happened in 1986 tax bill. So there are certain things in the regulated space that create a difference. I'm sure a lot of industries are trying to say they're different. But surely back in 1986, the insurance industry and the utility industry, the regulated utility industry was recognized as an exemption or a different methodology. So that kind of conversation is happening within the process. It's not right to have a debate across the table until we have a bill, but coalescing under Tom Kuhn's leadership and the EEI executive leadership and board, we're working through those issues. Everybody is for a lower corporate tax rate. That's an easy one. Jack talked about the probability of the blueprint staying the way it is now versus after the sausage is made. It's something we'll just have to stay engaged and follow. But you reduce an interest deduction from a utility, and that automatically goes on to the customer, and we've got to make sure it's not an unintended tax increase for the customer and we just have to work through those details.
Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC: Great, thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC: Hey, good morning.
Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.: Good morning.
Jonathan W. Thayer - Exelon Corp.: Good morning.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC: Hey, maybe quickly following up on the last one here with Steve, can you elaborate a little bit on what the read-through would be from the litigation in New York vis-à-vis Illinois? Would there be an immediate impact, or how are you thinking about this perhaps across the various ways it could play out? And I've got a follow-up back.
Joseph Dominguez - Exelon Corp.: Julien, this is Joe. The programs in New York and Illinois are very similar. They're both based on paying for the environmental attribute based on the social cost of carbon. And so the read-through is that when we are successful in New York, we think it will be a very helpful precedent to challenge the Illinois legislation.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC: Got it, excellent. And then just following up here on Greg's earlier question, just to establish a little bit of a baseline, how are you thinking about your portfolio evolution given the need to backstop the broader retail business? Are basically all combined cycles, broadly taking here, something that could be looked at? And then also at the same time, how are you thinking about the expansion of the retail business? Obviously, there have been some headlines out there on that as well.
Joseph Nigro - Exelon Corp.: Julien, good morning. It's Joe Nigro. Broadly, we look at our asset portfolio on an annual basis and we look across our nuclear fleet through to our fossil and renewable fleet. And strategically, you've seen some of the assets that we've divested through time here, and I will tell you it hasn't had a material impact on managing our retail portfolios, given that we carry a lot of what I would call optionality in our portfolio with the generation assets. And then additionally, when we need to, we will go to market to augment with additional products. So we're very comfortable where we are and we continue to strategically look at our portfolio. And if the market is willing to pay for something maybe more than we have value on, then we'll take that into account, make the decisions necessary recognizing that we do need to continue to manage our business. And I'm sorry, the question on...
Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.: Retail growth.
Joseph Nigro - Exelon Corp.: Retail growth, we're now – our C&I business is, as Jack mentioned or Chris mentioned in the script, we're about 25% of the market share in C&I. Our margins remained stable in that $2 to $4 origination range, and we continue to monitor that very closely. You heard what our renewal rates are and our win rates are, and they're in line with what we've laid out in the Analyst Day, and we're very comfortable with the plan that we have in place as we move through 2017. We'll continue to monitor that, but right now, we're very happy with where we are.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC: And you wouldn't necessarily take this out a little further, acquisitive expansions in addition to organic, and maybe that's a good kind of segue into thinking about – what kinds of targets are you thinking about on a volumetric basis for the volumes in aggregate as we move through time?
Joseph Nigro - Exelon Corp.: We've given you the volumes, and I think previously – and we rolled them out again at the EEI, and we're very comfortable with where we are on the volume scale. I would tell you, you continue to see consolidation in the retail market, you see some generation entrance that have bought entities, existing entities, not really creating their own retail platform, so there's really no change there. As you know, we've bought a few in the last few years, and we see the consolidation. We'll continue to hunt for those if the opportunity is right, and we see value and it fits our portfolio in what we're trying to achieve with the customer. And we'll remain disciplined with that. With our acquisition a few years ago of Integrys, and recently, last year with ConEd, we've been very happy with that outcome and the way they've integrated into our portfolio, and we'll continue to look for those type of opportunities.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC: Thank you, gentlemen.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse.
Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. Good morning.
Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.: Good morning, Michael.
Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): I was wondering if you could comment a little bit on the impact or the impacts of lower load growth and capacity performance in the PJM, upcoming PJM capacity auction. And separately, FERC recently rejected the MISO proposal for a competitive retail solution in certain zones. One of the criticisms, I think, FERC had in the rejection was that it was not broad enough throughout MISO. I'm just wondering if there's any potential for some kind of broader forward auction system throughout the entire Midwest ISO.
Joseph Nigro - Exelon Corp.: Yeah. Good morning, Michael. It's Joe Nigro. I'll take the first question on PJM, and then I'll hand it off up to Joe Dominguez, and he can talk a little bit about the MISO question. From a PJM perspective, there is a lot of moving pieces, the load came in, as was previously announced, down about 3.5 gigawatts or 2%. So, that wasn't unexpected. We cleared about 27 gigawatts of non-CP supply last year or 16% of what cleared, and as you mentioned, that will be 100% CP this year. that's obviously a positive change when you think about price. There were some movement in the import capabilities. We saw it shrink some into the ComEd zone. And we saw it increased slightly into eastern Mass., so that has an offsetting effect in those two areas. I guess the big thing is it remains around the two biggest variables which are the bidding behavior, and as you know, year-over-year, the energy rents are down, given how low the prices were on coal last year, and then additionally, what the new build is. And we continue to struggle to see how the economics of that new build works, given how marginal it is at best with where the market is on a forward basis. So, putting that all together, there's a lot of moving pieces where our long-standing policy is really not to try to forecast that, but there's a lot of puts and takes that we're evaluating as we go through this.
Joseph Dominguez - Exelon Corp.: And Michael, this is Joe Dominguez, the short answer to your question is, no, I don't see a likelihood that we will see, as a result of this FERC order, an expansion of the proposals for what was effectively Southern Illinois and Michigan across all – with MISO. I could go into a little bit more detail but the answer is no.
Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Thank you very much, guys.
Operator: At this time, we have reached the allotted time for questions. Our final question will come from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.
Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners: Good morning, guys.
Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.: Good morning, Shahriar.
Jonathan W. Thayer - Exelon Corp.: Good morning, Shahriar.
Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners: Just real quick on the $0.32 that you're now guiding on ZECs and FitzPatrick, can you – are you embedding any sort of synergies of owning Nine Mile and FitzPatrick within the same portfolio, or you're still kind of looking at this opportunity?
Jonathan W. Thayer - Exelon Corp.: We're still looking at the opportunity, we're in the process of integrating that plans and that's going quite well. We've got to close the acquisition in March. Obviously, given its proximity to our Nine Mile units, we anticipate that there may be opportunities as we get in there and optimize the operations.
Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners: Okay. Got it. And then, Joe, can you just real quick handicap Pennsylvania, maybe from a potential timing or when we can see something? Are we looking at an adjustment to the RPS to include the nuclear, or is it more of a function of sort of a similar ZEC-type program?
Joseph Dominguez - Exelon Corp.: I think historically what we've done is we've begun the discussion, and the first stage of the discussion is establishing a recognition that nuclear is the lowest cost and most reliable zero-carbon option for our customers, that's where we are in Pennsylvania. The next stage, I think we'll start getting into different solution sets, and you've identified a few, right. So, you could look at something that's similar to the ZEC programs that have been adopted. You can include nuclear as a qualifying resources and RPSs. And it's way too early for me to handicap where that discussion is going to go. There are a lot of different stakeholders. What's important to us is syncing effectively the first concept, which is that nuclear needs to be treated on a level playing field with other non-emitting resources. That will be the first objective in having that discussion. And then, I think, I can ask, as we move through this and in subsequent calls, we could talk about a bit more about how we handicap the options and outcomes.
Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners: Terrific, that's all I have. Thanks, guys.
Operator: At this time, I would like to turn it back over to Chris Crane for closing remarks.
Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.: Thanks, everybody, again for joining. And hopefully, we got all your questions. If not, then get a hold of Dan and his group, and we'll fill in any blanks. It was, as I said, a phenomenal year in 2016, and we're looking forward to building on that in 2017. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.

===== 2016 Q3  (2016-10-26 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. My name is Brandi, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Exelon Corporation Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] 
 I would now like to turn the conference to Dan Eggers, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
Daniel Eggers: Thank you, Brandi. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter 2016 earnings call. 
 Leading today's call are Chris Crane, Exelon's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Thayer, Exelon's Chief Financial Officer. They're joined by the other members of Exelon's senior management team, who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. 
 We issued our earnings release this morning along with the presentation, both of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of Exelon's website. The earnings release and other matters, which we discuss during today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today's material, comments made during this call and in the Risk Factors section of the earnings release and 10-Q, which we expect to file later today. Please refer to today's 8-K or the 10-Q and Exelon's other filings for a discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts and expectations. 
 Today's presentation also includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for a reconciliation between the non-GAAP measures to the nearest equivalent GAAP measures. 
 We've scheduled 45 minutes for today's call. 
 I'll now turn the call over to Chris Crane, Exelon's CEO. 
Christopher Crane: Thanks, Dan, and good morning to all of you. We appreciate your time and interest in Exelon and joining the call today. 
 We hosted our Analyst Day in August, and you have a lot of information that we passed on to understand the business and our value proposition.  With that fresh in your mind, today's call will focus on the third quarter results, some business updates, including actions we are taking with recent power weaknesses. 
 We had a great third quarter across our utilities Constellation and our generating fleet. Our GAAP basis -- on a GAAP basis, we earned $0.53 versus $0.69 last year quarter-over-quarter. 
 On the operating basis, we earned $0.91 a share, up from last year's $0.83 per share and well above our guidance range of $0.65 to $0.75 per share. Jack is going to cover the details on earnings drivers, but let me make a few observations. 
 At the utilities, the hot summer weather was a big help, with revenues up on higher volumes of electricity sold and lower cost with less storm activity across the system. The excellent reliability we provided to our customers over a hot summer reinforces the benefits of our capital investment programs.  ExGen had a great operational quarter, with the nuclear fleet producing more power ever in a quarter. Finally, Constellation really hit a sweet spot in the third quarter. 
 The sustained hot weather enabled us to sell high volumes of electricity to customers while limited price volatility brought the cost to serve the customers down, allowing us to profit on both volumes and margins. The continued success at Constellation in the third quarter reinforces the value of our gen to load matching strategy. 
 So if you look at Slide 6, as we talk about best-in-class operation, at the Analyst Day, we emphasized best-in-class operation across all our businesses, which we see as the ticket of entry at the utilities and economic imperative at the Generation business. And I'm happy to report that the third quarter was operationally strong. 
 On our color block charts highlighted operating performance and customer satisfaction for the utilities, legacy Exelon utilities remain almost entirely first quartile. I'm proud of our customer satisfaction results, but am disappointed with our OSHA results, and we are taking corrective actions and should get these numbers back to first quartile shortly. 
 At PHI, we are encouraged by the process we're making. Although some of this success has been helped by good weather and limited storm activity, we still have a long way to go to meet the reliability commitments we've made, but we are working hard to provide the service our customers deserve. 
 I mentioned already but the nuclear team had a very good quarter, with a capacity factor of 96.3% and no unplanned outage days even with the summer's sustained heat. For the year-to-date, the nuclear capacity factor is at 94.8%. 
 Constellation also had a great quarter, completing the acquisition of ConEd Solutions and beginning that integration. 
 We continue to see a robust renewable rate, with margins in contract durations holding at levels we discussed at the Analyst Day. So I want to thank all of our employees for excellent operations over the quarter and professionalism in what was a very hot summer with fantastic results. 
 On the regulatory team side, at the utilities are very busy as we work through a full load of rate cases at PHI, in particular. We've completed one rate case at PHI. The New Jersey BPU unanimously approved the ACE rate case settlement in August, yielding a good outcome. It brought needed benefits to the New Jersey customers months earlier than we would have litigated the case. We appreciate the efforts of all the parties in New Jersey in making this happen. 
 We are encouraged by the progress that we are making so far, but we're also aware that improving operations and returns at PHI will take time. These are the first sets of rate cases. We plan to refile at each PHI utility again in 2017. We -- it will take 2 cycles to, what we believe, align our revenues with the significant capital being deployed to benefit our customers, improve reliability and help the environment overall. 
 Talking about our key priorities, for us, is finding economically sustainable paths for our financially challenged nuclear plants. We're currently on very different paths but expect clarity this quarter in New York and also Illinois. 
 In New York, we're making progress on finalizing the contracts with NYSERDA and expect to have them signed for all 3 plants in November. This aligns with the expected approval from New York PSC on the acquisition from the FitzPatrick plant. 
 We expect the CES from GINNA Nine Mile I and II to add approximately $0.08 to $0.10 of EPS and expect FitzPatrick to add another $0.02 to $0.08 per share a year, depending on the refuel outage schedules. 
 As expected, a group of independent power producers filed a challenge in federal court. The lawsuit does not request a stay or an expedited trial, and we continue to believe that the CES design is sound, and that it will withstand any legal challenge. 
 In Illinois, we continue to work with a wide group of parties on a comprehensive energy package that would preserve the Clinton and Quad Cities stations operating rights. It will advance the utility investment aimed at energy efficiency and reliability and will support further growth in renewable energy production in Illinois. The time line is short for the resolution, with 2 windows during a 6-day veto session in November and the beginning of December. 
 We remain hopeful that we can reach a constructive solution that truly is of best interest for our state and our fellow Illinois citizens. 
 But absent of the action during the upcoming veto session, both facilities will close. We are moving forward with the retirement of the plants. We have already notified PJM of our intent to retire Quad Cities and will inform MISO in the beginning of December if the legislation does not pass. 
 A few years ago, we asked you to wait a while we worked through the process in Illinois, and we have appreciated your patience. We are now very close to the ultimate resolution in both Illinois and New York. 
 So with that, I'll turn the call over to Jack, and he will walk you through the numbers. 
Jonathan Thayer: Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. My remarks today will cover our third quarter and year-to-date results, our updated 2016 guidance range, progress on our current rate cases and our gross margin disclosures. 
 Starting on Slide 9. As Chris stated, we had a very strong quarter financially and operationally across the company. For the third quarter, we delivered adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings of $0.91 per share, exceeding our guidance range of $0.65 to $0.75 per share. 
 Exelon utilities delivered a great quarter, with a combined $0.53 per share of operating earnings. This was driven by favorable weather at ComEd and PECO where cooling degree days were 39% and 37% above normal, respectively, as well as lower O&M expense versus planned across all our utilities primarily due to lower-than-normal storm activity. 
 Generation delivered $0.41 per share of operating earnings in the quarter. We have strong performance at our Constellation business, where our Generation to Load matching strategy continued to provide value and we benefited from a lower cost to serve our customers. 
 On Slide 10, the $0.91 per share in the third quarter of this year was $0.08 per share better than the third quarter of 2015. Upside came from favorable weather across our service territories, the inclusion of PHI and higher distribution revenues at both ComEd and PECO due to increased capital investment and increased rates, respectively. This was partially offset by a decrease in earnings at ExGen, driven primarily by increased taxes due to the inability to use the domestic production activities deduction and lower capacity prices. 
 On Slide 11, our year-to-date earnings of $2.24 per share are $0.11 per share higher relative to the same period last year, driven by performance at the utilities. The primary drivers are favorable weather, increased distribution revenues across all of our utilities due to higher rates and increased capital investment and the addition of PHI. ExGen is down $0.16 per share from this time last year due to increased decommissioning costs, increased taxes and share count differential.
 Turning to Slide 12, we are raising our full year guidance range from $2.40 per share to $2.70 per share to $2.55 per share to $2.75 per share, reflecting, in particular, the strong results that we've seen at ComEd and PECO year-to-date. 
 Turning to Slide 13, we've laid out the schedule for the next 6 months of activity in all our current rate case proceedings across Exelon utilities. As you know, we filed distribution cases in all of PHI's jurisdictions and expect decisions spread throughout the third quarter of next year, providing needed revenue relief as we continue to make significant investments on behalf of our customers. 
 Our investments in our utilities are needed to improve the customer experience and create value for customers. As Chris mentioned, in August, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities approved the settlement authorizing Atlantic City Electric to increase its electric distribution rate by $45 million. The new rates went into effect immediately, which was 7 months earlier than expected. This really recognizes Atlantic City Electric's commitment to enhancing its energy infrastructure. Over the past 5 years, Atlantic City Electric has spent approximately $716 million in energy system upgrades to benefit its customers. 
 The settlement is a good start, but there's more work to be done in the other jurisdictions. We still have rate cases outstanding at the other PHI utilities. In these cases, we're asking for $326 million in revenue requirement increases. These increases reflect recovery on multiple years of smart meter and other capital investments meant to improve the reliability of the grid across all the PHI jurisdictions. We're expecting the Pepco Maryland decision in mid-November, followed by Delmarva Maryland in February. 
 In addition, ComEd made its annual formula rate filing with the Illinois Commerce Commission in the second quarter of this year, with the decision expected in December. ComEd requested a revenue requirement increase of $132 million related to approximately $2.4 billion in capital investments made in 2015. These investments, which include $663 million for smart grid-related work, have strengthened and modernized the electric system. More details in the rate cases can be found on Slides 28 through 33 in the appendix. 
 Slide 14 provides our third quarter gross margin update, including our 2019 disclosures. We're including the 2019 numbers a couple of weeks earlier than our normal course of EDI as we wanted to package together some interrelated updates for you today. 
 Our total gross margin uses September 30 curves and does not include the impacts of the CES program in New York or the purchase of FitzPatrick. But we have included these impacts below the lines to provide a full picture for 2017 through 2019, and we anticipate formally including both of them at our fourth quarter call. 
 2016 total gross margin increased $50 million during the third quarter, lifted by strong performance primarily at Constellation. We're highly hedged for the rest of this year and remain well balanced on our Generation to Load matching strategy. 
 Total gross margin decreased from the second quarter to the third quarter by $100 million in 2017 and $250 million in 2018. The decline is driven by lower power prices on the unhedged portion of our output. We have seen power prices at NiHub and West Hub for these years move higher since the end of September, with 2017 increasing approximately $0.50 to $0.75 per megawatt hour, respectively. 2018 prices have increased approximately $0.20 to $0.50 per megawatt hour, respectively, and as a result, total gross margin on our unhedged generation has recovered since 9/30 by $50 million. 
 At the end of the quarter, our hedge position was approximately 7% to 10% behind ratable in 2017 and 4% to 6% behind ratable in 2018 when considering cross-commodity hedges and reflecting our more positive fundamental view on the power markets. The majority of our link remains concentrated in the Midwest to align with our view of power market upside at NiHub. 
 Total gross margins for 2019 is $6.8 billion, which is $450 million less than in 2018. The majority of the decline from 2018 is due to $175 million in lower capacity revenues, which we provided at Analyst Day, $125 million from a full year of retirement for Quad Cities and $200 million from a roll-off of in-the-money hedges versus 2018. 
 We see multiple reasons why we'd expect a better realized power price environment than what's captured in these numbers. First, forwards beyond 2017 and especially beyond 2018 reflect a highly illiquid market with limited real price discovery. Liquidity will improve as we get closer to the delivery year, and that will help prices. 
 In addition, our work on power market shows too many plants continuing to operate even though they're not economically viable. These plants will need to close, and like we've done with certain of our fossil plants and our planned nuclear retirements. 
 Second, our Generation to Load matching strategy and our portfolio management team at Constellation have a proven ability to extract value out of various market conditions. Our Constellation business is set up to profit in periods of extremes. This summer, we captured better margins since our contracts are priced using forward summer market volatility. And when we don't see that volatility, such as this summer, we capture additional value. We saw the same thing during the polar vortex, a period with extremes but in the opposite direction. Our gross margin projections on this page do not anticipate these events repeating and assume normal weather, leaving the -- an opportunity for additional upside. 
 And finally, the CES program in New York and the acquisition of FitzPatrick will add $500 million in gross margin in 2019 and annual EPS contributions of $0.10 to $0.18 per year starting -- annually starting next year. 
 Turning to Slide 15. Even though we don't believe this market will be a reality, we are acting as if it will. We're reducing expected O&M expenditures by $100 million in 2018 and $125 million in 2019 at ExGen relative to what we showed you at Analyst Day, adding to the $400 million of savings we've already taken out of the business. 
 We are finding additional savings as we focus our operations and reduce development efforts at Generation as we close out the growth CapEx program in 2017. 
 We run an efficient organization, but we need to look for ways to reduce cost beyond these reductions. Our focus on -- our focus at ExGen remains on maximizing our cash generation to meet our commitments of funding utility equity needs and debt reduction. These efforts will help keep us on track. 
 Finally, turning to Slide 16, our sources and uses slide. We expect adjusted cash flow from operations of $6.85 billion in 2016. In September, the U.S. Tax Court ruled against us on a like-kind exchange issue related to our sale of fossil generation in 1999. The outcome on numerics was not unexpected. We were fully reserved for the underlying claim. However, we do not agree with the decision and particularly disagree with the decision to issue penalties, which we did not think was likely or warranted. The law is very clear that we were entitled to rely upon the opinion of legal counsel. We believe the court came to an erroneous conclusion, and we expect to appeal the decision early next year. We plan to issue approximately $1 billion of long-term debt to support the payment to the IRS. 
 I'll now turn the call back to Chris for his closing remarks. 
Christopher Crane: Thanks, Jack. We do appreciate the time. And we've had a lot to be proud about at the company, but we're not happy with the outlook that we see at ExGen. 
 As Jack talked, we're taking actions. The limited liquidity in the forwards beyond 2017 and the true lack of discipline by uneconomic generators are distorting the market. 
 That said, we're not just going to sit around and wait on the power markets to recover. As we said, we're taking further actions to control our future at ExGen, aggressively managing our cost across -- or even against these forwards, cutting $100 million in cost from 2018 and $125 million from 2019 on top of the $400 million we've already cut across the business. And we're pursuing the compensation for the 0-carbon attributes of our plants, as we've done in New York. 
 We are optimizing the fleet. All of this brings us back to the value proposition. We're targeting the best-in-class utility EPS growth of 7% to 9% through 2020. The strong free cash flow at ExGen will provide the incremental equity needs at the utilities as we focus on debt reduction at the ExGen. We're focused on optimizing the value of our ExGen business by seeking the fair compensation for the carbon pre-generation fleet and closing uneconomic plants. We will be opportunistically -- that's a good word, to selling assets where it makes sense to accelerate our debt reduction plans and maximize value through the gen-to-load matching strategy, which had another big quarter. We'll continue to focus on sustaining strong investment-grade credit metrics, growing our dividend in a consistent visible manner. 
 And I want to thank you for your interest, and now we're ready to take questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. 
Greg Gordon: So looking at the disclosures on the utilities, you raised your guidance range by $0.05 at each of the 2 utilities, but ExGen also had a -- is $50 million better on a gross-margin basis. I know you usually think about this in sort of rounding terms, and that's less than $0.05, but as you think about Q4, where are you -- where do you think you are inside the ExGen guidance range, assuming normal operations for the rest of the year? 
Jonathan Thayer: Greg, I'd say we're feeling very good on the back of a very strong performance within the Constellation business year-to-date. There are some timing elements that keep us in that same guidance range. Obviously, the fourth quarter is an important one for that business, and we'll be tracking it closely. But I'd say we feel good about how we're trending, and that's reflected in our comfort in taking the guidance up across the company. 
Greg Gordon: When I look at the delta from '18 to '19 in terms of the headwind from capacity -- and a lot of this, you talked about at Analyst Day. Capacity, mark-to-market on power curves, but then the offsetting benefits of lower O&M, lower depreciation, lower taxes, it looks to me, based on the fully diluted share count, like that's about a $0.15 delta today based on current forward curves. Am I missing something or is that in the right ballpark? 
Jonathan Thayer: I mean, relatively speaking, I think that's -- you're in the right direction. I don't want to give 2019 guidance at this point, but that feels right. 
Greg Gordon: Okay. And then can you give us some sense of timing on the process for the Mystic plants and when we might get some visibility on price and timing to close? 
Christopher Crane: I don't think that there's been any statement on that. 
Jonathan Thayer: We acknowledged we're selling the plants. Beyond that, Greg, I don't think it's probably right for us to comment on the process. 
Operator: Our next question is from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. 
Jonathan Arnold: Can I just ask about the -- you made comments about feeling good around how you're executing in Constellation. Any comments on trends in margins and renewals? And one thing we noticed was that the new business to go for 2019, $950 million, is down a little from what you had for 2018 this time last year, yet you've got ConEd Solutions in there, I would guess. So is that some pressure in what you've seen around margins or more conservatism? Or how should we think about those numbers? 
Joseph Nigro: Jonathan, it's Joe. We feel pretty -- we feel very strong we're going to be able to deliver on 2019. Part of the reason that number is down is because we've already executed more in that year than we would have at this point last year for 2018. So that's why you see a lower number. Our new business to go -- our new business in total -- or the business we're going to create in total between 2018 and 2019 is roughly the same amount, and we're comfortable that we're going to be able to meet these targets as we've done in the last 4 years. At your comment about margins and the renewal rates in retail, as I mentioned at Analyst Day, that market has remained stable. Our margins are right in line with what I talked about at Analyst Day. Our renewal rates remain strong. The acquisition of ComEd, although we've only had them for a brief period, is going well. We're very impressed with the way they run their operation, and we're integrating that into the Constellation business. So the retail business remains very stable, and we're happy where things are at this point and continue to monitor it. 
Jonathan Arnold: Okay. And then can I ask around the ExGen O&M guidance? Could you give us a little more insight into what's driving the incremental savings? And then, perhaps -- I mean, is this -- obviously, one of your nuclear competitors is seeing some cost pressures in that business. Can you talk about how -- what your sort of underlying expense profile might be, and how much you're having to cut in order to get to these net lower numbers? 
Christopher Crane: I'll let Jack fill in the details. On our nuclear fleet, overall, in the past 7 to 10 years, we have made significant capital investment to prepare the plants for their extended life. You can see our reliability numbers reflect the investment that's been made, so we do not see any significant increase in capital. Actually, we're seeing the decrease in capital, in maintenance capital, because of the massive improvements that we've made. On the O&M side, there's been significant focus, not only at Exelon but across the industry, with industry initiatives to try to find ways to take what were old processes that were put in place that may be much more efficiently executed with the same results on a much lower cost basis, and that's the initiative that the Nuclear Energy Institute is performing. I can't speak to other fleets, but I can tell you that we have a very strong focus on capital, a very strong focus on efficiency. And the last thing we would do is cut into safety or reliability, and that's been a clear focus of mine throughout my whole career, and it will continue to be. Run the plant safely, reliably and very efficiently. 
Jonathan Thayer: So Jonathan, just building on what Chris said, starting with that focus on safety and reliability. As you might imagine, when you contemplate a program that, say, is $400 million across the company and you're turning over many stones, you identify additional opportunities. And so among -- we've got almost more than 100 initiatives that we've been looking at, and each will contribute approximately from $1 million to several million dollars. But whether it's corporate efficiencies in organizational design, nuclear fuel savings, contractor costs, in-sourcing rates, nuclear site security, automation, NRC fees reductions, property taxes, organizational design and centralization such as within our engineering group, outage costs, automation, I mean it's just a long list of activities. And we do have good line of sight on these opportunities. And I think building on the processes that we've put in place to target cost and seek efficiencies, I think our hope is that we may, in fact, even find more than what we're sharing with you today. 
Operator: Our next question is from Steven Fleishman with Wolfe. 
Steven Fleishman: Yes, a couple of things. First, just on the new -- the New York ZECs. Could you just clarify kind of the thoughts on ZECs versus RECs? Because the IPPs that filed the appeal seem to kind of say there is a difference. So could you kind of clarify maybe where they're getting that wrong? 
Christopher Crane: Joe. 
Joseph Dominguez: Yes, it's Joe Dominguez, Steve. We don't think there is really a difference. The program was fashioned after the REC programs. The distinction is that plaintiffs who are trying to create New York are not real. But they face the political problem, of course, that if they describe the lawsuit as also challenging the renewable programs, they're going to have a good deal more opposition. But the programs function essentially identically. The ZEC program is based on the cost of keeping resources in the market just as the renewables credits are the cost of keeping resources in the market, paying for the environmental attributes, recognizing that these assets get both wholesale and market revenues as well as attribute payments. But from our perspective, they function pretty much the same way. 
Steven Fleishman: Okay. And then moving to Illinois, could -- just any more color. Are you feeling more optimistic about being able to get a legislative bill this veto session than, let's say, a month or 2 ago? 
Christopher Crane: I'll let Anne. 
Anne Pramaggiore: Okay. This is Anne Pramaggiore. We are -- I think what we're seeing right now is that there's a bit of an opening of a door. The legislature has a temporary budget in place, and Chicago public school funding is behind them. And so I think we see an opportunity in the veto session. We also think there's a lot of work to be done to get there. We've got to pull together a coalition to come in with an agree [ph] bill as much as possible, and we're in the process of putting that together now. But we do think that there's the potential that this would be entertained in the veto session. 
Steven Fleishman: Okay. And then, just lastly, in the context of what you said about the kind of power views and long-term liquidity. To the degree that, let's say, Illinois bill passes and it includes benefits for all types of generation, just -- doesn't that kind of continue on the kind of -- the potential inefficiencies of the markets and kind of keep some of the issues that are causing prices to be lower? So I guess, just how are you thinking about hedging and managing your portfolio against the fact that if -- the more of these you get done, the more Generation stays around? 
Joseph Dominguez: Steve, this is Joe Dominguez, and I'll turn it back it over to Joe Nigro in terms of managing the portfolio. Look. We've -- the market is what it is. Today, we have over 30 states with renewable portfolio standards that recognize the environmental contributions of virtually every resource in the market that does what our nuclear plants do. So we're seeking to get fair treatment. At the same time, from a policy perspective, we've been clear for many years now that we think the right move is to put a cost occlusion in the market. That is, in the case of climate, establish a price on requirement. And we're going to continue to pursue those things. But obviously, there have been a number of headwinds that have prevented those policies from being fully realized and fully recognizing the impact that carbon has on climate, as measured by the federal government. So we haven't seen programs that trade [ph] carbon up to the social cost of carbon. We're going to continue to work on those things. But the plans we have in New York and Illinois, we think of as preserving those units for the day where we have that best design in place. And we think that day is going to come eventually, but we need a bridge solution to keep the units that are important to our customers in place so that they're available once we do have a carbon signal in the market. And that's how we reconcile it. But we have to take this world as it comes to us, and the world currently isn't our most favorite design of putting a price on carbon in the market. We have these separate state programs, and it's important for our customers that these nuclear plants be preserved, and that's what's driving our initiatives. Joe? 
Joseph Nigro: Yes. And I would add, just from a market perspective, portfolio perspective, a couple of things. One is, on the market side, I think the illiquidity of the market is somewhat independent of what Joe is saying. I think it gets into the nature of market participants. As you're well aware, when you think about the financial institutions to start with that added liquidity in this marketplace in years past, we don't see nearly the depth of that. But what's interesting is the power markets have been illiquid for quite some time. But when you look at open interest just on the gas market, for example, we've seen a change there where it's very front-end loaded versus kind of the outer years. And I think what's important with that is -- and let me give you an example. When you look at the price change in the quarter in PJM, in particular, versus -- the end of June versus the end of September, you saw that the prices -- the price of gas in each of those years, when you include the basis prices weren't great, fell equally. Yet we dropped power prices more materially on the back end of the forward curve than we did in the nearby 2017, and that gets into some of the illiquidity in the market. As it relates to our portfolio, we take all these factors into account, both the things that we're doing internally with our other assets, we have an estimate of what other folks are going to do with their own assets. We've been very clear that we've been aggressively managing our portfolio as it relates to our ratable plan, and we'll continue down that path. The last thing I would add is that we talk a lot about the benefits of our Generation to Load Strategy, and we do it with both [ph] in the dollars. It also has a huge benefit from a market perspective because it doesn't force us to go to that illiquid over-the-counter market. We have a strong customer base and a very, very strong load serving business now that matches output of generation to quantity of load very well. And we're going to continue to grow that, and we've done it both organically very well and through acquisition with like Integrys and ComEd, and that's been a big benefit also. 
Operator: Your next question is from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. 
Stephen Byrd: Congratulations on a great quarter and on further cost reductions. I wanted to hit on what you mentioned in terms of some of your peers who would appear to need to shut down further plants. And we do see some of those same dynamics, but I was curious, from your point of view, what kind of catalysts or drivers should we be thinking about in terms of seeing more sort of rational decisions and further shutdowns? What do you see as some of the key catalysts? 
Joseph Nigro: So Stephen, I think the example I would give you is like when you look at coal-fired generations. When you look in the Eastern Interconnect between, call it, 2016 and over the next few years, we see almost 30 gigawatts of coal expected to retire, with almost 2/3 of that being done by the end of next year. The obvious examples are some of the plants that have been announced in Illinois and also in Ohio and the rationalization of that. Obviously, we've taken our own actions with our own power plants. We've seen others do the same thing beyond coal, and we expect more of that will continue if these low prices continue. Because when we look at it fundamentally, there are plants that are challenged economically that are still running that, really, the economic rationale isn't there for those to continue to operate. 
Jonathan Thayer: And Stephen, just to build on that. I think you've heard us make strong comments about a focus on reducing leverage at the Genco to 3x debt-to-EBITDA. I think the reality is, in this current pricing environment, you're going to start to see others look at their outlooks and look at their leverage statistics and focus their efforts on generating cash. In order to do that, they're going to need to retire money-losing assets. So I think it'll force greater discipline on their part. We're already seeing some of that. I think there's a potential for consolidation and asset optimization around that and portfolio optimization. So I think we see a pathway for others to be disciplined as we have. But obviously, we need to see execution on that -- in that regard. 
Stephen Byrd: Those are all great points. I wanted to shift over to the New York ZEC legal challenge, and I think you've laid out your points of view in terms of the legal position. In the event that, in court, the ZECs were either sort of overturned or remanded for substantial modification, can you speak to the impacts to the acquisition with Entergy in terms of the transaction impacts? 
Joseph Dominguez: Sure. Stephen, this is Joe Dominguez again. So the way you ought to look at that transaction is the legal risk will shift to us, really, around the time we do the outage in January. So post January, you ought to think about us as effectively being the economic owner of that legal risk, subject, of course, to the approvals. But we're not going to be able to walk away from the transaction if something occurs post January that changes the ZEC program. And the logic there is, after the outage, we effectively have our fueling machine, and we've paid for the outage cost, so we're going to be the economic owner at that point, again, subject to regulatory approvals of the transaction. 
Stephen Byrd: Understood. And I guess, the worst case always is that you do still have plant closure as an option, so that your worst case is captain, and you still do have the potential for, obviously, a good outcome? 
Joseph Dominguez: That's right. And we feel very strongly in the merits of the case. Otherwise, we would not have done this. 
Operator: Our next question is from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. 
Shahriar Pourreza: Chris and Jack, the $0.02 to $0.08 of synergies from FitzPatrick, can you just remind us if that includes any additional synergies of owning FitzPatrick next to Nine Mile? 
Christopher Crane: It doesn't, and we'll evaluate that as we get into the integration. There's conversations now in the nuclear integration team on what is the best way to optimize. The security fences are next to each other. It's a very big site. So amalgamation of the complete site might be more expensive than it's worth, but there are other elements in and on the site that we can look for synergies around the support services and the executive management. 
Shahriar Pourreza: Okay, got it. And I don't know if you could mention the actual -- is it enough to be a couple of pennies or anything directionally? Or not yet, too early? 
Christopher Crane: Too early. We've got to get in and see and make sure that we maintain our design basis but look at everything possible we can to be more efficient. 
Shahriar Pourreza: Okay, got it. And then just lastly, with the strong results year-to-date, is this sort of any opportunities to pull forward some O&M? And maybe how we should think about it for the fourth quarter? 
Jonathan Thayer: I'd say, with respect to O&M, we're going to manage our plan tightly. And generally, there's not that much opportunity to move things quarter-to-quarter. The planning required for the bulk of our O&M takes months, if not years, and so I think you'll see us try and land pretty darn close to what we've shown you in the slides today. 
Operator: And we have time for one last question. That is from the line of Chris Turnure with JPMorgan. 
Christopher Turnure: I had some questions on Pepco, and I wanted to just get an update on your latest dialogue with interveners in Maryland and D.C. and just kind of how things are progressing there on their understanding of you guys underearning by so much and having stayed out of cases for so long there predeal. 
Denis O'Brien: This is Denis. Great question. We -- as we're going through the integration, I think things are going very, very well. As we mentioned before, it's going to be a long haul in terms of rate cases being filed every 12 to 15 months for the next 5 years. We've had some good progress in New Jersey. We're in the throes of the case in Maryland at this point, and I guess, we'll know about November 15 the outcome of that. So a little hard to predict. Maryland's somewhat challenging. We are continuing to work on improving reliability, improving all of our performance levels as well as working to improve our image reputation and brand in Maryland. But I think this is going be one of those things where it's going to take us a few cases to get through to a better level of performance. So we're seeing November 14 or 15 where we are, and we're going to make this happen. It just may take us a few cases into it. 
Christopher Crane: And in D.C., we're early in the process. We've made our filing. We're in data request now. Over 400, I believe, data requests are coming in. So there's going to be a lot of dialogue there, a lot of questions that we'll need to provide the sound answers for the basis of our request. 
Christopher Turnure: Okay. And then, excluding weather, were there other drivers behind the outperformance -- or pardon me, the guidance increase for the Pepco utilities for 2016? 
Jonathan Thayer: Primarily weather-related. So hotter-than-normal temperatures as well as storms, relative to what we budgeted, came in lighter. So beyond that, I think those were the major drivers. 
Operator: And that does conclude the question-and-answer portion. At this time, I would like to turn the conference back to Mr. Eggers for closing remarks. 
Daniel Eggers: Thank you all for joining us and your time today. I know it's a busy earnings day. We appreciate your interest in Exelon, and we look forward to seeing a number of you at EEI the week after next. Have a great day. 
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect your lines.

Operator: Good morning and welcome to the Exelon Corporation's Q1 2016 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Prasanthi and I'll be facilitating the audio portion of today's – and active broadcast. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. For those of you on this stream, please take note of the options available in your event console. At this time, I would like to turn the show over to Dan Eggers, Senior Vice President of Investors Relations.
Dan L. Eggers - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations: Thank you, Prasanthi. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Leading the call today are Chris Crane, Exelon's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Thayer, Exelon's Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by other members of Exelon's senior management team who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. We issued our earnings release this morning along with the presentation, both of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of the Exelon's website. The earnings release and other matters which we discuss during today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today's material, comments made during this call, and our Risk Factors section in the earnings release, and the 10-Q, which we expect to file on May 10. Please refer to today's 8-K, the 10-Q, and Exelon's other filings for a discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts and expectations. Today's presentation also includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for a reconciliation between the non-GAAP measures to the nearest equivalent GAAP measures. We've scheduled 45 minutes for today's call. I'll now turn the call over to Chris Crane, Exelon's CEO.
Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Thanks for joining us this morning. Once again we had a great quarter financially, where we closed near the upper end of the range even with the milder weather. And operationally, our utilities and plants continue to operate at high levels. The big news for the quarter is we closed the Pepco Holdings transaction in March. We are excited to have Pepco utilities as part of the Exelon family. We know this has been a long journey and it took much longer than any of us anticipated, but we appreciate the patience of our investors as we pursued the merger. Our employees who worked tirelessly from the inception to the completion of the deal and the many stakeholders who've supported was critical to getting the deal done. PHI is an important piece of our strategy to become a more regulated company with more stable earnings streams. While we are still in the early stages of integrating PHI, PHI's earnings outlook is consistent, if not better, than what we showed you at EEI. It brings meaningful benefits to our customers, communities in Delaware, District of Columbia, Maryland, New Jersey, including bill credits and reliability investments. More than $500 million in total commitments have been made and will be achieved due to this merger. We're now focused on integrating Pepco into Exelon. We will bring our management model and our best practices to improve the experience of our customers. The transaction confirms Exelon's role as a leader in the industry. We serve 10 million customers, more than any other utility company. We will spend nearly $23 billion in capital across our utilities and generating business over the next three years, which is the second-highest among our peers. We are the largest pure T&D by rate base and within the top five when including rate base generation. We are the second-largest generator of electricity in the country, the largest competitor by a factor of nearly two, while producing power at the lowest carbon intensity of any large generator. We are the leader in the retail electric provider in the country serving 139 terawatts. The culture of the industry leadership is found throughout our organization, positioning us very well for the future. Switching to operational performance. Our first quarter operating performance was strong and we're on track for a strong year. At our legacy utilities, our SAIFI and CAIDI are on track to meet reliability targets; we are in top quartile in both. At the GenCo, our nuclear plants ran at a capacity factor of 95.8%, our solar and wind assets outperformed their energy capture targets. Switching to Illinois in the nuclear plants. While there is much to celebrate this quarter, we also need to make tough decisions on the future of Clinton and Quad Cities nuclear stations in Illinois. The board has given me authority to go forward with early retirements for Clinton and Quad Cities plants, if for Clinton adequate legislation is not passed during the spring legislative session that is scheduled to end May 31, and if for Quad Cities adequate legislation is not passed and the plant does not clear the upcoming PJM auction. Otherwise, we plan to retire Clinton on June 1, 2017, and Quad Cities on June 1, 2018. This is consistent with planned refueling outage and capacity market obligations. We committed to our employees, our shareholders and the communities to try to find a path to profitability for our distressed assets. This is because these plants are vital to the communities that they are located in and provide economic and environmental value to the state. The state's own analysis showed that closing Clinton and Quad Cities would result in $1.2 billion in lost economic activity and 4,200 jobs lost, and a significant reduction of supply of reliable electricity for Illinois residents and businesses. We worked hard over the last few years to find a path to sustainable profitability. To bring $120 million in strategic capital to these plants, we've pursued legislation and regulatory market changes. We've been successful in some areas: the PJM market reforms that were put into place last year, the cost reductions that we've achieved, and the large number of stakeholders who have worked so hard to help in this fight. We have strong allies in our cause, our employees, our plant communities, the bill sponsors and co-sponsors, our partners in labor, and our vendors among others. I want to thank them all very much for their support and regret the impact on this decision that we have on them. But for reasons outside of our control, we have not seen progress in Illinois policy reforms, also the Supreme Court stay creates uncertainty regarding the EPA's Clean Power Plan. Power prices have fallen to a 15-year low in PJM, causing the economics of Clinton and Quad Cities to further deteriorate. These plants have lost $800 million in cash flow from 2009 to 2015. Just to be clear, we are not covering our operating costs or our risks, let alone receiving a return on our invested capital. We've done all we can up to this point and we continue to work through the spring legislative session to enact the much needed reforms. However, without adequate legislation we no longer see a path to profitability and no longer can sustain the ongoing losses. On a more positive note, we continue to see a pathway to reform in New York where Governor Cuomo, the legislature, the Public Service Commission have recognized a need to preserve the state's nuclear plants. New York is quickly moving forward to implement a clean energy standard that will allow us to continue to operate our challenged Ginna and Nine Mile plants. I'll turn the call over to Jack to discuss the first quarter results further.
Jonathan W. Thayer - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP: Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. My remarks today will cover our first quarter results, 2016 guidance, update our gross margin disclosures and provide an update on developments since Q4. I'll start on slide eight. As Chris stated, we had a strong quarter financially and operationally across the company. For the first quarter we delivered adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings of $0.68 per share, near the top of our guidance range of $0.60 per share to $0.70 per share. This compares to $0.71 per share for the first quarter of 2015. Exelon's utilities delivered a combined $0.37 per share. During the quarter, we saw unfavorable mild weather at PECO and ComEd versus planned, which was partially offset by lower bad debt expense at BGE. There are only eight days of PHI included in our results, which had a minimal impact on the quarter. Generation had a great quarter, earning $0.34 per share. We had strong performance from our nuclear assets with better capacity factors than budgeted. And while weak power prices and lower volatility were a drag, our Constellation team delivered strong results. Our generation to load matching strategy continues to provide value and we benefited from a lower cost to serve our customers. For the second quarter, we are providing guidance of $0.50 to $0.60 per share. This compares to our realized earnings of $0.59 per share for the second quarter of 2015. The appendix contains details on our first quarter financial results compared to the first quarter of 2015 results by operating company on slide 16 and 17. Turning to slide nine, we are affirming our full-year guidance range of $2.40 to $2.70 per share which now includes the contribution from PHI and assumes an average of 926 million shares outstanding for 2016. This should help calibrate your segment models. On slide 10, we are still working through a comprehensive financial plan now that we have closed the PHI deal, but want to address the pieces that we can today. We are reaffirming our earnings growth at our legacy utilities of 7% to 9% per year from 2015 to 2018. On PHI, we are still working through the plan, but see the contribution equal to or better than what we showed you at EEI and consistent with sustaining our 7% to 9% utility growth target. On slide 11, to meet these growth targets we are going to be busy on the regulatory front. The PHI utilities have been out of rate cases for at least two years. We are continuing to invest $800 million per year to improve reliability and customer service leading to the low-earned ROEs that we show on slide 30 in the appendix. However, by the third quarter, we plan to file distribution cases in all of PHI's jurisdictions and expect decisions in all cases by the middle of next year providing needed revenue release. Atlantic City Electric and Pepco Maryland have already filed their cases. ACE filed an electric distribution base rate case on March 22 with the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities requesting an $84 million revenue increase and a 10.6% return on equity. It also included PowerAhead, a five-year $176 million grid resiliency plan. On April 19, Pepco requested a rate increase of $127 million with the Maryland's Public Service Commission. The rate cases include smart meter recovery and a two-year $32 million grid resiliency plan. In addition to reducing the number and length of outages, Pepco's five-year smart grid program is generating nearly $4 in customer benefits for every $1 invested. In addition, ComEd made its annual formula rate filing with the Illinois Commerce Commission. ComEd requested a revenue requirement increase of $138 million reflecting approximately $2.4 billion in capital investments made in 2015. Those investments, which included $663 million for smart grid-related work has helped strengthen and modernize the electric system, resulting in record power reliability and customer satisfaction, operational savings, and new ways to save on electric bills for ComEd customers. More details on the rate cases can be found on slide 33 – slides 34 through 37 in the appendix. Slide 12 provides our first quarter gross margin update. In 2016 total gross margin is flat to our last disclosure. During the quarter we executed on $200 million of power new business and $100 million of non-power new business. We are highly hedged for the rest of this year and well-balanced on our generation to load matching strategy. Total gross margin decreased in the first quarter by $150 million in 2017 and $200 million in 2018, as PJM power prices moved approximately $1.60 to $2.10 lower since the beginning of the year. We ended the quarter approximately 5% to 8% behind ratable in both of these years when considering cross-commodity hedges with a majority of modeling concentrated in the Midwest to align to our fundamental view of spot market upside at NiHub. Power prices have risen since the start of the second quarter and we are timing our hedging activity to lock in the value of the recent price increases while remaining well positioned to capture our fundamental view. On slide 13, I wanted to give you a quick update on some tax implications that are associated with the completion of the PHI merger. With the inclusion of PHI, we expect to realize $700 million to $850 million of additional cash from 2017 to 2019 related to legacy NOLs and the impacts of bonus depreciation. However, now, as a very modest cash tax payer for 2018, we have less ability to take the domestic production activities deduction, or DPAD, in 2018 which effectively increases our overall consolidated tax rate by as much as 200 basis points or the equivalent of $0.06 to $0.08 per share in 2018. Although this is a one-time negative impact to 2018 ExGen earnings, it comes with significant positive cash flow and we expect to return to normalized tax rates in 2019. With the variability of interest rates, I'd like to remind you that ComEd's allowed ROE is based on a 30-year treasury rate plus 580 basis points, and thus sensitive to moves in this rate. Every 25 basis point move in treasury rates results in a $0.01 move in EPS. Before turning the call over to Chris, I wanted to raise a few scheduling points. We'll be hosting an Analyst Day on August 10 in Philadelphia and we'll get details around shortly. Therefore, we will not be having a second quarter earnings call and will release earnings before Analyst Day. I will now turn the call back to Chris for his closing remarks.
Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Jack. Just closing out on slide 14, the capital allocation philosophy. I want to cover that before we turn it over to Q&A, and take a moment to reiterate our capital allocation philosophy. Balance sheet strength remains a top financial priority. We have a strong strategy to deliver stable growth, sustainable earnings, and an attractive dividend to our shareholders. We will be growing that dividend at 2.5% each year for the next three years, starting with the dividend payable in June. From a capital deployment perspective, we will continue to harvest free cash flow from the generation business to invest primarily in our utilities to benefit our customers, invest in long-term contracted assets which meet our return requirements, and return capital to our shareholders. This is the right strategy for our markets and our assets. Thanks and we'll open the line up now for your questions.
Operator: And we do have audio question from Stephen Byrd (17:13).
Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Steve (17:15).
Unknown Speaker: Start on the Illinois legislation. And wonder if you could speak to the breadth of support that you have for the proposal. And then also if you could just go through the mechanics of if it was implemented, how it'd work? So we can start to think about modeling the impacts.
Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Joe, you want to cover that?
Joseph Nigro - Executive Vice President, Exelon; Chief Executive Officer, Constellation, Exelon Corp.: Sure. Steve (17:36), the support is the same support we had for the original bill, labor, the host communities. And in addition, we now have the support of some groups that represent climate scientists and others that are concerned with greenhouse gas emissions. In terms of how the program would work, let me just start with a policy analogy that I think all of you are familiar with. Existing state RPS programs for renewables provide compensation of qualified resources through renewable energy credits, RECs. The REC value is the difference between available wholesale revenues and the costs needed to keep the existing renewables in operation and get new renewables built. All this is done in order to get the benefit of greenhouse gas reductions while protecting customers. If wholesale revenues go up, the needed REC payment goes down. We see that happening every day in REC spot markets. The ZEC program is designed the same way. It's a payment for the state value of zero emission credits from nuclear plants which represents the difference between the needed revenues and the costs of operating the plants. In the case of the New York and Illinois programs, the way it would work is that experts at the Commissions will determine on a prospective basis the cost of operating the plants plus risks, less available market revenues. And where there is a delta between that, in other words where the costs and risks are not covered by available market revenues, the ZEC program will kick in and provide compensation for greenhouse gas avoidance. The program is not a PPA or a contractor difference. If revenues or costs are different, there is no true-up. And – so, Steve (19:26), I think if you have additional questions, perhaps after the call we could work with Dan and Emily to set up a meeting, go through more programmatic details.
Unknown Speaker: That's great. That's a great start. Thank you. And then just shifting over to renewables more broadly, could you just speak to your degree of appetite for more acquisitions? It sounds like you'll be a full taxpayer, I believe, in 2019, if I have that correct. But just broadly, what degree of opportunities do you see out there in renewables? Is this an area that you would expect that you'll see further growth in?
Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It is definitely throttled based off of our tax capacity and we are looking at that now. You do get a certain amount of dilution with delaying the benefits of the tax attributes of the project, so we have some projects in the pipeline now and are re-evaluating others to see if they're – they would be viable to go forward in the near-term.
Unknown Speaker: Understood. Thank you very much.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman.
Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Steve.
Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC: Hi. Good morning. A couple of – first, a logistical question. The Ginna $101 million that you mentioned that you're getting, is that – is kind of a trued-up amount including past years, is that in your guidance for this year? Or is that kind of like a one-time item or how are you treating that?
Jonathan W. Thayer - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP: Steve, that's in our guidance.
Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC: Okay. Including any back from prior periods?
Jonathan W. Thayer - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP: That's correct.
Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC: Okay. And then a question just – is there any way you can give us some sense on the cash flow or losses from Clinton and Quad Cities, let's say, in your guidance for last year or something of that sort?
Jonathan W. Thayer - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP: So we've stated that it's greater than $800 million since 2009. There are some variables in there on cash savings going forward or cash losses going forward, power prices coming down, cost cutting initiatives; and we do have an element of overheads that would not be as controllable. So you would see the run rate to be similar to what has happened in the past.
Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC: Okay.
Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Steve, you know, on this point – so for 2017, the cost exceeded available market revenues or at current marks (22:12) by $140 million. But I think importantly and Joe raised this point, it's not the whole picture. The closure also avoids millions of dollars in basis and unit-contingent risks that we face by operating the plants. And stated differently, in order to reverse course we need Illinois as well as New York to provide a structure that allows us to cover our cash costs plus normal operating risks in order to reverse this course.
Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC: Okay. And $140 million that's kind of cash flow? Does that include like CapEx, or is that just kind of cash flow without CapEx?
Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: That's cash flow.
Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC: Okay. One last question just on the – in the event legislation doesn't happen and you need to shut the plants, what – is there any cost related to that?
Jonathan W. Thayer - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP: As you saw in the K, and we reiterate in the Q, there is some unfunded liabilities on the decommissioning trust. Those numbers are in there at full 100% ownership of the plants. And so the way that we would have to handle that is – you know, you can start out with parent guarantees, but you have to have it funded over a 10-year period, I think 60% by the end of the fifth year, and then the rest by the end of the 10 years.
Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC: Okay. Those numbers in the K are still good then, so that we just can use those?
Jonathan W. Thayer - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP: They're updated in the Q.
Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: That'll be coming Tuesday.
Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, good morning, guys.
Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good Morning.
Jonathan W. Thayer - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP: Good Morning.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Just to clarify one thing on the current proposal that I think was emerged last night around the legislation. So originally this applies to all nuclear plants in the state, but is it correct that this would just be Clinton and Quad? And can you just explain how that works in terms of the discussion of the ZEC structure?
Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Joe?
Joseph Nigro - Executive Vice President, Exelon; Chief Executive Officer, Constellation, Exelon Corp.: Sure. Jonathan, all plants could apply, but quite obviously the only plants that would receive revenue under this program would be those where the costs exceed the revenues. And so there is – it's a 20 terawatt-hour cap which has enough room in it to accommodate Clinton and Quad Cities. And our expectation is that Exelon would seek to have those two plants participate. The other plants would not participate.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And that's sort of nuanced in how the legislation's worded effectively?
Joseph Nigro - Executive Vice President, Exelon; Chief Executive Officer, Constellation, Exelon Corp.: That's correct.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay.
Joseph Nigro - Executive Vice President, Exelon; Chief Executive Officer, Constellation, Exelon Corp.: It's the same offer to you, Jonathan; if you'd like, after the call, we could sit down and work through some of the details.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. That'll be great. And is there any...
Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And, Jonathan, just to interject just to make the clear point, they would provide the opportunity to be compensated for cost plus risk.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. That was one thing. The second thing, in your fourth quarter deck, you have this forecast around leverage ratios and the like going out through 2018, which, I believe, was assuming that Pepco would not happen. This was of the ExGen. Can you give us a sense of how that progression would look if you kind of market to the – with Pepco scenario?
Jonathan W. Thayer - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP: Sure. So, Jonathan, we still anticipate reducing leverage of ExGen by $3 billion over the five-year planning period, albeit this is not to the extend that we would have under the standalone scenario, because ExGen's free cash flow is now being deployed to help fund PHI's capital spending program. And we'll provide more detail on the puts and takes of that at the Analyst Day in August.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So $3 billion is kind of the new ExGen delevering number?
Jonathan W. Thayer - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP: That's right. That's over the next five years, we have a large maturity. And I believe it's 2019, that we would look to retire at maturity.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. So that's over five years?
Jonathan W. Thayer - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP: That's correct.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And then the 2.3 ExGen debt-to-EBITDA that you were looking at for 2018, roughly what does that look like now?
Jonathan W. Thayer - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP: It, over the five-year period, would go to right around three times.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So that's again over five years, rather than three years?
Jonathan W. Thayer - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP: That's correct.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you. And then I guess you mentioned in the prepared remarks the prices have rebounded...
Jonathan W. Thayer - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP: So, Jonathan – sorry, just let me correct, 2.7 times at the end of the five-year period.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So whereas you have 2.3 times in 2018, it's now 2.7 times after five years?
Jonathan W. Thayer - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP: Yes.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you. And then you mentioned that prices have rebounded. So can you give us a rough sense of how the kind of gross margin mark would look if you use more like today's prices?
Joseph Nigro - Executive Vice President, Exelon; Chief Executive Officer, Constellation, Exelon Corp.: Yeah. Jonathan, good morning. It's Joe Nigro. I think if you look at our hedge disclosure at the end of the quarter and then factor in the changes since the end of March, you would see all of that drop in 2017 and 2018 being recovered. We've seen an appreciable move, as you know, in prices since the end of March. We're actually higher in NiHub than we were at the end of the year. We're higher at West Hub than we were at the end of the year, so we would have recovered all that drop and probably adding to it. We calculated that a couple of days ago, but the market has continued to move higher, so we probably have seen it actually go over where it ended the quarter.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Okay. That's it. Thank you very much, guys.
Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC: Yeah. Hi. Good morning.
Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC: So perhaps to follow up on the same theme, can you elaborate a little bit on the balance of the nuclear portfolio that is ex-Clinton, ex-Quad? How you think about their cash flow profile? And if you don't get this legislation, what the prospects are for further rationalization? I don't mean to jump the gun too much here, but just talking about the future a little bit more?
Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So there's varying cash flows by assets depending on their location. They are positive at this point. If you look at the other units that are more challenged, you're looking at Ginna and Nine Mile. One – we know about Oyster Creek and it's coming up in 2019, the other one that has a real focus on it right now is Three Mile Island.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC: Got it. And specific to Illinois, is there any commentary around – so let's say we don't get it in 2016 or 2017, does that trigger another set of reviews? Again, not to push it too much.
Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: At this point we'll have to watch the capacity auction clearing in the out years. It's tight on energy at some of the assets, but they are positive.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC: Got it. Okay, great. And then turning back to the utilities real quickly, can you comment, or I'm curious, if you will, what the earned ROEs embedded at Pepco for 2016 – just what's the baseline on the Pepco side as far as you see it post the close?
Jonathan W. Thayer - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP: Julien, in terms of – I think we included it on slide, I believe it's 30, the earned for 2015. Obviously, while we're in the pendency period during the rate cases that – obviously, there's regulatory lag, so we're going to see that decline, but we'll have a much deeper dive in the PHI as part of the August 10 meeting. You can see on slide 29 the rate base statistics and I think can work through some assumptions on regulatory lag using that information.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC: Got it. And perhaps not to jump the gun too much on the Analyst Day, but what is the thought process on the baseline for a future regulated CAGR?
Jonathan W. Thayer - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP: I think the thought is the 7% to 9% that we confirmed on the call and PHI is absolutely consistent with that expectation. We, as we mentioned, are seeing improvement relative to what we forecasted or projected at EEI using PHI's internal forecast. And Dennis and team continue to work to identify further opportunities around efficiency as well as regulatory policy to work to get those earned and allowed ROEs in line with the success we've experienced within Maryland, Pennsylvania and Illinois.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC: Got it. You wouldn't roll it forward though?
Jonathan W. Thayer - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP: I'm not certain I understand what do you mean roll it forward?
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC: The 7% to 9%, just roll it forward to CAGR off a 2016 base?
Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We'll address that at the Analyst Day.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC: All right. No worries. Thank you.
Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I mean, embedded in there is 7% to 9% through 2018, so just thinking it through, it's in there.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Brian Chen (32:25).
Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Brian (32:30).
Unknown Speaker: Going over to slide 13, the EPS impact that you've laid out in that top table, I just want to verify that that is not including the use of capital from that positive cash flow impact that you've got on the second row right?
Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: That's right, Brian (32:46).
Unknown Speaker: Okay. Great. And then I just want to verify that Quad Cities didn't clear in the 2018 and 2019 auction, correct? So the closure of Quad Cities shouldn't have any sort of residual obligation that you have for the 2018, 2019 capacity through (33:03)?
Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: That's correct.
Unknown Speaker: Great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: And your next audio question comes from Praful Mehta.
Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi, guys.
Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning.
Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Good morning. So just on the leverage a little bit, just to ensure we understand both at the holding company level and at ExGen. You've kind of talked about the ExGen debt and what you see over the 20 – the five year period. How are you looking at holding company debt given the leverage you've assumed post Pepco transactions? Is there any objective to delever a little bit at the holding company as well?
Jonathan W. Thayer - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP: So Praful, as you've heard us comment in the past, we do target at 20% FFO to debt on a consolidated basis and that was one of the benefits of adding PHI to the Exelon family. And so we will certainly be looking at our leverage ratios at the GenCo. I think you'll also see us consider to the extend we have available cash at the holding company as well, we just need to see as we get further out what the realized power prices are and what the free cash flow coming off of the GenCo is in those five years.
Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got you. And just so if you think about from the sources/uses perspective, the source is primarily out of ExGen coming to fund CapEx at the utilities and then deleveraging both at ExGen and the parent. Is that a fair way to think of it or is there some cash generation coming out of the utilities as well over the next two year, three year period?
Jonathan W. Thayer - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP: I would say, on a net basis, utilities are consumers of cash. So you're correct. That ExGen cash flow as well as debt raise at the utilities is the primary source for funding the significant CapEx that we see, $25 billion over the next five years at the utilities.
Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got you. Thank you. And then just finally, we saw that the power new business and the to-go business, the EBITDA, or the growth margin of that is going from $250 million in 2016 up to about a $1 billion by 2018. Could you just give us a little bit of context of what's driving that significant ramp-up in that side of the business?
Joseph Nigro - Executive Vice President, Exelon; Chief Executive Officer, Constellation, Exelon Corp.: Yeah. Hi. It's Joe Nigro. That's pretty standard shape that we have. If you go back and look at disclosures over the years, you would expect to see much less new business in the prompt years – in the prompt year, in this case 2016, than you would in the out years, for example, in 2017 and 2018. Embedded in that power new business is things like the execution of our retail business and the margins associated with that. So as we get closer to the swap period more and more of those contracts get layered in, we begin to reduce that bucket of power new business. I mean, there's other elements of our business that follow that same timing shape, so this isn't unique in the sense of seeing a ramp up between the prompt year to two years forward and we're very comfortable with the numbers that we've put out there.
Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got you. Thank you so much guys.
Operator: And this does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.
Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you.

Operator: Good morning. My name is LaShanta and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I'd like to welcome everyone to the Exelon Corporation Q4 2016 earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Francis Idehen. Please go ahead, sir.
Francis Idehen: Thank you, LaShanta. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Leading the call today are Chris Crane, Exelon's President and Chief Executive Officer, and Jack Thayer, Exelon's Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by other members of Exelon's senior management team who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. We issued our earnings release this morning along with the presentation, each of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of Exelon's website. The earnings release and other matters, which we discuss during today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in the earnings release, today's material, comments made during this call and in the risk factors section of the 2014 10-K and the third-quarter 10-Q. Please refer to today's 8-K and the 10-K and the 10-Q and Exelon's other filings for a discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecast and expectations. Today's presentation also includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for a reconciliation between the non-GAAP measures to the nearest equivalent GAAP measures. We've scheduled 45 minutes for today's call. I will now turn the call over to Chris Crane, Exelon's CEO.
Chris Crane: Thanks, Francis, and good morning to everybody. Thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter call. Before I go into the results I want to take a moment to thank our crews who worked hard to restore power for our customers in Baltimore and Philadelphia affected by the January storms. BGE and PECO were able to restore approximately 22,000 customers throughout the weather event, keeping the average restoration times to less than three hour, which is a remarkable accomplishment given the challenges associated with traveling and the working conditions as the storm intensified. I'll start off by reiterating our strategy and our capital allocation philosophy. The balance sheet strength is a priority that guides every strategic decision. It allows us to deliver stable growth, sustainable earnings and an attractive dividend for our shareholders. Our strategy for delivering these objectives is to harvest free cash flow from the Genco, to invest primarily in the utilities for the benefit of our customers, invest in long-term contracted assets, which meet our return requirements and return capital to the shareholders. Consistent with this capital allocation policy, we're announcing today an evolution in our dividend policy. Our board has approved a policy to raise our dividend by 2.5% each year for the next three years beginning with the June 2016 dividend. The dividend increase shows our commitment to provide an attractive total return proposition for our shareholders and reflects the shift in focus towards our regulated utility and long-term contract businesses. Our balance sheet and our cash flow profile support the shift in the dividend policy and maintain a high credit quality and investment grade rating remains a top priority. We continue to de-risk the Company by growing our regulated business. This has allowed us to generate earnings with a lower risk profile. We remain as focused as ever on careful disciplined use of capital. Let's turn now to 2015 results in each of our businesses and our goals for 2016. Despite a difficult year in the markets we delivered earnings of $2.49 a share in 2015 demonstrating once again our ability to run businesses well and manage through even the most challenging environments. At our utilities, 2015 was a record year for us in many respects and growing regulated business continues to thrive. We achieved a major earnings milestone: our utilities earned over $1 billion in net income, delivering the highest utility earnings on record. We invested nearly $3.7 billion in needed improvements for our customers across the utilities including the AMI and the grid modernization investments, significant gas and electric infrastructure and innovative technology and customer-oriented systems. Our track record for reliability and customer service has allowed us to earn solid returns. Our utility earnings on aggregate across Exelon is at 9.5% in 2015. Our returns reflect the constructive regulatory relationship in our territories. PECO received a unanimous approval for both its $127 million rate case settlement and a $275 million long-term infrastructure improvement plan. BGE received approval for recovery of more than $200 million of energy efficiency and gas infrastructure replacement investments. And at ComEd, we achieved our fourth consecutive year of constructive outcomes in our formula rate filing. This year we filed a rate reduction at ComEd, showing our ability to contain cost and limit the impact of capital investments on our customers' bill even during the current Smart Grid investment cycle. The utilities continue to drive high operational performance and that performance is getting better each year. Of the 26 metrics we track, 21 of them were best or second-best ever in 2015 including reliability and customer satisfaction. As for our goals in the utility business in 2016, our first primary goal is closing the PHI transaction at which point we will begin the important job of integrating PHI into the Exelon family of utilities. We will bring our management model to PHI Utilities in order to improve the experience of the customers in the region. We will work diligently to develop and implement an effective regulatory strategy for PHI. We will invest approximately $4 billion in our existing utilities to refurbish and modernize the grid to improve service for our customers. That is part of the $18 billion we will invest in our existing utilities over the next five years. We will work to maintain first quartile operational and customer satisfaction numbers while continuing to focus on productivity and cost management. Finally, we expect a decision in our November 2015 BGE rate case in June and we'll file our annual formula rate update at ComEd in April. By executing on these goals, we will deliver one of the most compelling utility earnings growth stories. Our generation business had a solid year. Operationally in 2015, Constellation performed well even in the face of weak markets. Nuclear capacity factor was 93.7%. Refueling outage performance was very strong. Average refueling outage duration was 22 days. That's the lowest average since 2002. Our gas and hydro plants outperformed the dispatch match targets. Our solar and wind assets did the same for the energy capture targets. Our power business went 15 months without an employee OSHA recordable incident. It's the best safety performance ever.  At Constellation, our generation to load matching strategy contributed meaningfully to the earnings. Our load serving business experienced growth in both power and gas. In 2015, we served 195 terawatt hours of wholesale and retail load, materially growing that platform from 155 terawatt hours the prior year. We continue to have high customer win and renewal rates. We are now a top 10 marketer of natural gas and it has significantly increased our delivery of retail gas to 720 Bcf last year. In 2016, at Exelon Generation, we will continue to operate world-class fleet of assets at the highest level of performance while continuing to execute our strategy of growing the contracted generation business with 350 megawatts of wind projects in development. At Constellation, we will achieve our targets of serving 210 terawatt hours of load across our wholesale and retail base, using our commercial platform as both a risk management vehicle and an earnings driver. Each of our businesses is well-positioned to continue strong performance in 2016 operationally and financially. We have some important priorities we are targeting in 2016. We will continue our broad advocacy efforts to ensure that our unique class of nuclear assets are properly valued for their clean, safe and reliable attributes. Developments in New York for a clean energy standard are constructive. The leadership of the governor in New York has been very positive, but more work needs to be done and we will engage with key stakeholders in the state. We continue with our specific efforts with legislators and stakeholders in Illinois on the low-carbon portfolio standard.  We provided ample time to reach the resolution on the nuclear assets, suffering significant losses in the process. If we don't see significant results, we will make the economically rational decision. We continue to engage with MISO on a constructive reform to address the issues in Zone 4. We will work in the states in which we operate to develop compliance plans for the clean power pool. This has been a challenging period for our sector. We are tackling those challenges aggressively. We are reducing our costs by $350 million. We will continue to shift our business mix to more regulated exposure both organically with our $18 billion capital into our existing utilities over the next five years and through our strategic acquisition of Pepco which will raise that number of capital investment to $25 billion over the next five years. The Company remains on a solid footing and our balance sheet remains strong. And we continue to run the businesses at the highest operational levels. With that, I will turn the call over to Jack for the financial details.
Jack Thayer: Thank you, Chris, and good morning everyone. As Chris stated, we had a strong year financially and operationally across the Company. For the full year, we delivered earnings of $2.49 per share and $0.38 per share for the fourth quarter. If bonus had not been extended, we would have delivered earnings of $2.58 per share, meaningfully exceeding the midpoint of our guidance range.  The appendix contains details on our fourth-quarter financial results by operating Company on slides 21 and 22. My remarks today will focus on 2016 earnings and O&M guidance, our credit profile, the cost management initiative and an update of our gross margin disclosures. Turning to slide 6, we expect to deliver 2016 full-year adjusted operating earnings of $2.40 to $2.70 and $0.60 to $0.70 per share for the first quarter. While we anticipate closing the Pepco holdings deal in the first quarter, our guidance is a standalone figure that assumes the equity and debt issued for the PHI deal is unwound during the year. The impact of the extension of bonus depreciation is included in the guidance. Our growing utilities earnings primarily reflect increased capital investment in distribution and transmission to improve reliability and customer service at ComEd as well as increased rates from PECO's recent distribution rate case, partially offset by higher O&M at PECO and BGE related to storm and bad debt costs.  Our strong operating performance at our utilities is fostering a positive regulatory environment in all our jurisdictions and is evident in the transformation and allowed and earned returns that we've achieved at BGE since the Constellation merger. BGE has improved reliability and customer satisfaction in every year as compared to 2012, the year of the merger, which in turn has led to improved regulatory outcomes and earned ROEs over that same period. Last November, BGE filed an electric and gas distribution rate case with the Maryland Public Service Commission requesting revenue requirement increases of $121 million and $80 million through its electric and gas distribution rates respectively.  The requested rates of return on equity in the application are 10.6% for electric distribution and 10.5% for gas distribution. We expect the Maryland PSC to rule on the rate case in the June timeframe with the new rates going into effect shortly after the final order. The revenue requirement increases reflect the continued investment including Smart Grid being made at BGE to improve reliability and customer service. Constellation had a record year in 2015 driven by higher realized margins that benefited from a lower cost to serve our load and strong performance in our portfolio management group. In 2016, we expect a more normalized cost to serve load and portfolio management performance, which we expect will have a negative impact on our earnings relative to an extraordinary 2015.  Overall, at Exelon Generation the earnings impact from normalized margins and higher decommissioning costs, partially offset by fewer nuclear outages and cost management efforts, results in a forecast decrease in ExGen's earnings range versus last year. Our cost management initiative savings in 2016 should largely offset the impact of inflation at ExGen where labor and wage inflation are significant components of O&M. For reference, more detail on the year-over-year drivers by operating Company can be found in the appendix on slides 23 through 26.  Moving to slide 7, as we've said in the past bonus depreciation has a negative impact on earnings, but a positive impact on cash. In 2016 it creates a rounded $0.09 earnings drag at the consolidated level with a $0.06 impact at Exelon Generation and a $0.03 impact at ComEd. On the cash front it increases cash flow by $625 million in 2016. Despite the negative earnings impact of bonus depreciation in 2016 through 2018 we are affirming the CAGR of 3% to 5% for the enterprise and 7% to 9% for the utilities through 2018 that we disclosed at EEI. In addition the extension of bonus depreciation will likely have a further effect on Exelon as a whole after the closing of the Pepco holdings deal. Once the merger is completed and we begin the integration of PHI's operating, planning and regulatory functions we will provide an update on PHI's forecast and the resulting accretion impact on Exelon's forecasts. On slide 8, our top financial priority remains maintaining our investment grade credit rating and ensuring the strength of our balance sheet. The five-year extension of bonus depreciation improves the free cash flow position at ExGen, which has a positive impact on our FFO to debt metrics. ExGen free cash flow over the 2016 to 2018 period is now projected to be $5.35 billion or $3.2 billion after taking into account committed growth capital. Since our EEI disclosure Exelon Generation has commenced developing a further 350 megawatts of long-term contracted wind projects in Michigan and Oklahoma. As you'll note on the slide, given our strong cash flow outlook ExGen has a declining debt to EBITDA ratio starting at 3.2 in 2016 and decreasing to 2.3 times debt to EBITDA by 2018. Bottom line, we're growing durable earnings and shrinking debt.  Turning to slide 9, I will provide an update on the cost management initiative that we announced towards the end of last year. We recently finalized the savings initiatives in January and have incorporated them in our current long-range plan. As we mentioned at EEI, the total identified savings are in the $350 million range with savings split equally between Exelon Generation and our corporate shared services organization. $100 million of the savings of the shared services organization will be achieved within our information technology function with the remainder coming from various corporate function such as finance, legal, human resources, and supply. The corporate savings will be allocated roughly equally between Exelon Generation and the utilities. Overall, this means that roughly three-quarters of the total cost savings for the Company will hit the bottom line in Exelon Generation, while the remaining quarter of the savings will be realized at the utilities and ultimately passed on to our customers. As a result, we expect a run rate earnings benefit from our cost management initiative of $0.13 to $0.18 per share beginning in 2018 with approximately 35% of the run rate savings achieved by the end of this year. Our proven track record of cutting cost and running our business efficiently gives us confidence we will be able to achieve or exceed these savings. Slide 10 shows our 2016 O&M forecast relative to 2015. We project O&M for 2016 to be flat to 2015 and we expect a slightly negative O&M CAGR across the enterprise over the 2015 to 2018 period and a negative 1% CAGR at Exelon Generation. ExGen's year-over-year decrease is driven by a combination of factors: fewer planned nuclear outages compared to 2015, lower pension cost and the impacts of the cost management initiative. The year-over-year increase at PECO and BGE is due to inflation and budgeting for normal storm and bad debt costs, which results in incremental year-over-year O&M growth. Slide 11 provides our fourth-quarter gross margin update. This quarter's gross margin update now includes the impact of the Ginna RSSA to 2016 and 2017 total gross margin. As we saw both power prices and heat rates for 2017 increased by the end of the quarter, we reduced our deviation to ratable. For 2017, we ended the quarter with a power position of 5% to 8% behind ratable on a total portfolio basis when considering our cross-commodity hedges. We are even further behind ratable in the Midwest approximately 13% to 16% when considering cross-commodity hedges. We continue to align our hedging strategy with our views on the market. In 2016 total gross margin is flat to our last disclosure. As you know, we're highly hedged in 2016, which combine with the inclusion of the Ginna RSSA allowed us to offset the impacts of lower prices in 2016. During the quarter, we also executed on $50 million of both power new business and non-power new business. Total gross margin increased by $50 million in both 2017 and 2018. The increase in 2017 is partially driven by the Ginna RSSA, which mitigates losses, while the increase in 2018 is driven by higher power prices across most of the regions, most notably in NiHub with around-the-clock prices increasing by $0.64 per megawatt hour. During the quarter, we also executed on $50 million of non-power new business for both 2017 and 2018. As a reminder, the appendix includes several schedules that will help you in your modeling efforts. That concludes our prepared remarks. And we will now open up the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. 
Greg Gordon: Thanks, good morning guys. Great presentation. Thank you. A couple of questions. Can you talk in a little bit more detail about what your plan is and what the milestones are for making a decision in Illinois on the uneconomic units? And can you refresh our memory on where we stand in terms of profit and loss on the three units that you had initially a year and a half or two years ago identified as impaired?
Chris Crane: Sure. As you know we were successful and PJM was successful on the capacity market redesigns that gave some upside to the fleet in NiHub. Greatly helped Byron and added help to Quad cities, but since then as you've seen the downturn in the forwards Quad cities continues to be challenged and more neutral on cash flows and earnings, while maintaining the risk of operation. We continue to work on Clinton. Clinton is negative. We have two initiatives underway, one working with MISO on Zone 4 reforms and we'd like the design to be more like the new PJM capacity market design. But that in itself will not save Clinton. As you know there's a lot of work going on in Springfield with the administration and the legislature. And we have had a very strong support from the leadership of the legislature and the administration on coming to a resolution on the energy outlook for Illinois. It's not only the Clean Energy Standard, but there is an environmental jobs, agreeing jobs bill and there's a utility of the future bill that have to be negotiated together. There's been progress made in that dialogue, but it is critical that we have, that we're able to present to the legislature this spring a combined package that ensures the financial viability of our assets as they contribute highly in reliability, in environmental or we will have to make the rational economic decision. It's our job to get the stakeholders together. We're working hard on that and to bring the leadership what is a consensus package that’s good for all of Illinois and its customers. So we're in this spring time in Illinois and we're hopeful that we can have reasonable heads prevail and negotiate a balanced outcome and as I said present that to the leadership so they can provide the continued support.
Greg Gordon: Okay, so Quad because of the further decline in gas prices and power prices since the CPE results has gone back out of the money. So is that a fair summary?
Chris Crane: It is. It is. With these forwards it is. 
Greg Gordon: Okay. And the second question is, so you guys are going to, based on your cash flow slide on page 37 you're going to end the year with a pretty substantial cash balance. And if I look at the cash flow profile you project through 2018 that should continue to grow all things equal. Your debt to EBITDA is going to be sub-3, by my measure you're trading at under 4.5 times EVD to EBITDA on the implied valuation of the nuclear business. That basically implies that the nuclear is a wasting asset write, that with $8.5 billion of debt on the balance sheet that you should be amortizing debt because these plants are going away in 10 years. I mean what can you do to convince investors that this low gas price environment doesn't ultimately drive these assets out of business? Because if they are 20- or 30-year assets and not 10-year assets the stock is undervalued. 
Chris Crane: Yes, first of all there's more than 10 years on these assets. We had license renewal at Braidwood. It goes into the late 2040s. The money producing plants are the larger dual unit sites that will run into the 2040s. That's Byron Braidwood, LaSalle, Limerick, Peach Bottom and they are positioned well in the markets. Peach Bottom is in the 30s I think, but the others are in the 40s. So we've got a long run left on these profitable plants. If the smaller units or the single site units cannot be profitable and we can't get a market design they will be retired and there is an upside based off of that retirement on free cash flow and earnings. We will remove the drag. As Jack described, we're very focused on the debt to EBITDA ratios at the GenCo, and over this period of time we will be reducing over $3 billion of debt at the GenCo and continuing to manage that, matching our assets with our debt. We feel very comfortable where we're at. But it is a misnomer that is out there that these are 10-year assets with a large debt profile on them. Jack, you want to -.
Jack Thayer: No, I think you covered it Chris. I mean the goal is to create that fortress balance sheet to do the right things around our assets and sustain the profitability of the long lived plants. 
Greg Gordon: All right, thanks guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse.
Dan Eggers: Hey, good morning guys. If we go look at the dividend increase in the 2.5% a year for the next three years, can you maybe, Chris, share how the Board thought about using capital to raise the dividend considering you already have a pretty healthy yield? And then what was the thought process behind 2.5% a year for those three years? 
Chris Crane: Sure. We had, as we talked back three years ago now when we had to restructure the dividend, we had grown the dividend at Exelon based off of the earnings and cash flow on a very volatile business, the GenCo. We had to make the shift and take the pain at the time to refocus the payout and where that reliable cash flow would come from. We set out at that time after the merger with Constellation, improving the performance for the customers and the reliability of BGE and along with that improving the profitability. ComEd has done a phenomenal job improving reliability, making prudent investments and as our shareholders have seen, as you have seen, the strategic plan we laid out a few years ago is paying off. And it can be seen, it's transparent that by 2018 theoretically the utilities would be covering the dividend. In discussion with shareholders and feedback at the end of the year the certainty and our confidence in the business needed to be fully displayed. In dialogue with the Board, we thought that we can make these increases. We've talked about the free cash flow, we talked about the balance sheet and we're committed to that through 2018. I think it's a positive sign in the right direction that we feel confident in our strategy going forward.
Dan Eggers: Okay, got it. And then on the Pepco deal, I guess you have kind of down to one month of room for the commission to make a decision. I guess A, have you heard anything or is there anything indicative of where the commission could make a decision? And B, if the deal does not get approved how do we think about the full return of the previously raised equity and the debt retirement? 
Chris Crane: So the commission did state that they would take this matter up before our March 4 date. And that's our only commitment is to try this till March 4 and if we can't get it by March 4 then we have to fold up and then start to execute on the debt reduction and the buyback of the equity issued. And that would start immediately. The plans, the contingency plans are in place by Jack and Stacy and the team. And that execution would then start at that point. 
Jack Thayer: And Dan, just for modeling convention, what we've assumed is it takes us roughly five months to buy back the equity and that has a $0.06 drag associated with it during 2016 on our standalone plan. And we would assume we'd retire the majority of the debt associated with Pepco in March, which has a $0.01 drag. So all-in on a standalone basis there's about $0.07 of drag in our EPS associated with PHI closing that out if we end up on a standalone basis.
Dan Eggers: And I think that the disclosure in the back of the $1.6 billion or whatever buyback that you have in the appendix, that's based on just buying back the same number of shares you originally issued, although the notional amount is obviously less than you raised. And is there a possibility you guys could buy back the amount you raised rather than the number of shares?
Jack Thayer: To your point what we've modeled is buying back the 57.5 million shares that we issued for the transaction. I think our balance sheet strength and where we see that orienting from a debt-to-EBITDA basis provides a lot of flexibility. And we'll review what's the best means of creating value for shareholders. 
Dan Eggers: Got it. Thank you, guys.
Chris Crane:
Operator: Your next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.
Steve Fleishman: Yeah, hi, good morning. Just on the dividend strategy change I just wanted to confirm that that's the plan kind of with or without Pepco?
Chris Crane: It is.
Steve Fleishman: Okay. And secondly, what are your thoughts on the use of the bonus depreciation cash? And it sounds like you haven't included that in the impact of bonus or you're just taking the hit but not including reinvestment. What might you reinvest in?
Chris Crane: We have significant investment in the utilities. We are putting debt on the holding company. We would anticipate less debt issuance to infuse the equity into the utilities as part of that. And there we would look at other opportunities to for further regulated or contracted investment if they met our hurdle rates. 
Steve Fleishman: Okay. And then the $1.350 billion that you're putting into contracted generation at ExGen, is that all renewables projects?
Jack Thayer: There's a contracted peaker up in New England that's a modest part of that. But the bulk of that is contracted wind or contracted distributed generation.
Steve Fleishman: Okay, and argue assuming – are you including any debt financing on those assets or are you assuming for purposes here you're just funding all of it? And could you add debt to those projects?
Jack Thayer: Steve, we're assuming that because of their contracted nature that we'll be able to secure project financing, which would get some measure of off credit treatment to minimize the impact on the overall balance sheet.
Steve Fleishman: Okay. And so the $1.350 billion is just your equity investment in these? 
Jack Thayer: The $1.350 billion is just cash.
Steve Fleishman: Cash. Okay.
Jack Thayer: So that can be either project financed or equity financed, some combination of both.
Steve Fleishman: Okay, great. Thank you very much. 
Chris Crane: Sure.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.
Jonathan Arnold: Hi, good morning guys.
Chris Crane: Good morning.
Jack Thayer: Good morning. Just a quick one on a similar topic. Does the projection you show for ExGen net debt to EBITDA stepping down to 2.3 by 2018, how much of your free cash flow are you assuming you are going to reinvest? Or is all of it just rolling into the net debt calculation in that upper slide? 
Chris Crane: Jonathan, the major drivers of that are we have a $700 million maturity in 2017 that we pay down. We pay down about $1.2 billion of CP and then a growing cash position, which ultimately takes you from that 3.2 down to 2.3 times.
Jonathan Arnold: So is it fair to say the 3.2 of free cash flow is kind of all rolled into the debt projection or not entirely?
Chris Crane: It's rolled into the debt projection. It's financing or funding the dividend increase. It's basically insulating the balance sheet to a very strong position.
Jonathan Arnold: Great. That was my other things got asked, so thank you very much.
Chris Crane: Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from Praful Mehta with Citigroup.
Praful Mehta: Hi guys.
Chris Crane: Good morning.
Praful Mehta: Actually going back to this debt question at ExGen, I just want to understand given the goal is to harvest cash from ExGen as you've pointed out and to reinvest that cash, and we've talked about the lifetime of assets for the nuclear as well, is there a level of just debt, as in currently the debt balances let's say $9 billion, is there a level of debt that you see if the right debt grows that number that you see at ExGen, is it between the 2018, 2019 time frame? Are you targeting a certain number? 
Jack Thayer: We're retiring about $3.6 billion over the next five years at ExGen. And I think that provides us, rather than targeting a specific number I think more importantly it provides us with a considerable amount of flexibility and insulation and allows us to position from a point of strength our merchant fleet to compete on a long-term basis. It's clearly differentiated from the balance sheets of some of our competition. And we think that that will be a competitive advantage as we proceed through the coming years. 
Praful Mehta: Got you. Thank you. And then secondly in terms of the dividend, if the Pepco transaction weren't to close as you grow your dividend by the 2.5% as you've talked about, how are you looking at the payout ratio relative to just the utility earnings by 2018 and is there a target level that you're comfortable with in terms of payout relative to just utility earnings?
Jack Thayer: So from a dividend standpoint, in effect what we do is we set a minimum from a payout ratio at the utilities, but we've got a lot of flexibility in how we can fund that growth. So rather than targeting a specific payout ratio in aggregate what we're really looking at is a minimum payout ratio at the utilities of 65% to 70%. And then we look at where best to fund the dividend as well as fund the investment in the utilities to grow the regulated earnings stream of the company at 7% to 9%.
Praful Mehta: Got you. So there is an area where the payout from just the utility business or I guess the total payout relative to the utility earnings could go higher than the 70% if in case the Pepco transaction doesn't close?
Chris Crane: That's a possibility. But if you look at, go back to what Jack said, a payout ratio of 65% to 70% by 2018 theoretically with our earnings profile, the utilities would cover that dividend. And that's a theoretic position we wanted to be in because we need to make decisions on further capital infusions for necessary projects to drive customer satisfaction and reliability.
Praful Mehta: Got you. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Barbara Chapman with BNP.
Barbara Chapman: Hi.
Jack Thayer: Hey, Barbara.
Barbara Chapman: How are you guys doing?
Jack Thayer: Good.
Barbara Chapman: Good. If somebody could speak to your sources and uses slide on 27 please and help answer a couple of questions. One, the issuance needed at Baltimore Gas & Electric just seems larger than what we've dealt with. So I'm just kind of curious what's going on there as far as an investment standpoint. But also on the corporate issuance, it doesn't appear there is a placeholder for the reissuance of the debt that was not exchanged and therefore called last year. So if you could explain if the Potomac merger goes through are we done now with the permanent debt financing for that?
Jack Thayer: So Barbara, let me start with your second question first. This is on a standalone basis, so you'll note under the debt retirements that we have a further $1.875 billion of retirements here. If PHI goes through then clearly we would look to fill the gap of what we called during the fourth quarter of 2015 through a further financing at the holding company and on a pro forma basis, this sources and uses table would show the impact of that. With respect to BGE, we’re retiring $300 million there. We’re issuing $750 million, so the net $450 million you’ll recall we have a significant gas program there where we are hardening and replacing infrastructure within our gas utility as well as we have significant investments in reliability on the distribution and transmission side. 
Barbara Chapman: Okay. So we are back – we’re still on the original thought that closing Potomac you will be out with to refinance what had to be called then?
Jack Thayer: Absolutely.
Barbara Chapman: Okay, because it’s confusing the way this is written on that issue. Okay.
Jack Thayer: And then Barbara, just the difference this time obviously is we would issue on the other side of the transaction completing. So we have sources of funding that we can use to bridge. And then we would do a large holdco issuance to replace that short-term financing.
Barbara Chapman:
A - Jack Thayer:
Q - Barbara Chapman: And your final question comes from the line of Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.
A - Chris Crane: And your final question comes from the line of Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.
A - Darryl Bradford: And your final question comes from the line of Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.
Q - Barbara Chapman: And your final question comes from the line of Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.
A - Darryl Bradford: And your final question comes from the line of Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.
Q - Barbara Chapman: And your final question comes from the line of Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.
Operator: And your final question comes from the line of Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.
Shahriar Pourreza: Good morning, everyone.
A - Darryl Bradford:
Shahriar Pourreza: So just looking at slide 8, is there a scenario that could essentially see some of your ratios including your debt to EBITDA essentially south of 2.3 especially if we continue in a sort of a prolonged low gas price environment?
Jack Thayer:
Q - Shahriar Pourreza: Okay, that's helpful. And then just on the dividend policy, when you think about your second leg of growth, should we assume like step functions to get you closer to what your consolidated growth is or should we assume maybe another large increase post-2018?
Chris Crane: So, we would analyze the best shareholder capital return policy. We'd be looking at are there further investments that can be made that create stronger and continuing growth in our investment in the regulated utilities. But it will be analyzed and as I said we theoretically hit a target of a payout in 2018. We will take into consideration the best uses of capital allocation at that point and we would anticipate some growth continuing after 2018. There's a lot of infrastructure and technology advancements that are coming along that will benefit the customers and benefit reliability and drive much more productivity within our workforce. So it's something that we'll look at and we're heading in the right direction. 
Shahriar Pourreza: Excellent, excellent. And just one last question. Just around maybe you could touch on the New York Clean Energy Fund that's being proposed, sort of the outlook for Ginna post the RSSA and then is there any impact to the put option with EDF?
Chris Crane: I will let Joe Dominguez cover this.
Joe Dominguez: Sure. Good morning. As Chris said at the top of the call, it's not the Clean Energy Fund but it's a zero-emission credit program that benefits nuclear. As Chris said at the top of the call, it's been a constructive development for us in New York. We still have quite a ways to go. But as a threshold political matter, having a governor with the prominence of Governor Cuomo step forward and propose to compensate nuclear fairly to keep it in business is important. If we get the details right I would go so far as to say it's kind of a watershed event for the industry. But we don't have the compensation details sorted out yet. The RSSA at Clinton will expire in March 2017, so practically speaking we need to see the details for the New York program this year. Once we see those details obviously it could provide incremental revenue that would factor into the put if that put in fact occurs. But we don't have important details right now on the level of compensation or how the procurement mechanism would work. So it's all speculative until we do the work over the next three or four months and nail this down.
Chris Crane: In my conversations with the leadership at EDF, they are very comfortable with our operations on the nuclear side and in this market environment they are not looking at exercising the put at this time. So we will continue to work on the regulatory side and drive strong operational performance. And we have a little time on Ginna to the end of the RSSA into 2017, and like Joe said we've got a very supportive administration that recognizes the clean benefits of nuclear and that's really appreciated.
Shahriar Pourreza: Congrats on the results.
Chris Crane: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Dushyanta and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Q3 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you, I will now turn the conference over to Francis Idehen. Please go ahead.
Francis Idehen: Thank you Dushyanta. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining our third quarter 2015 earnings call. Leading the call today are Chris Crane, Exelon's President and Chief Executive Officer; Joe Nigro, CEO of Constellation; and Jack Thayer, Chief Financial Officer. We are joined by other members of Exelon's senior management team, who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. We issued our earnings release this morning along with the presentation, each of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of Exelon's website. The earnings release and other matters which we discuss during today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today's material, comments made during this call, and in the risk factors section on the 10-K which we filed in February, as well as in the earnings release and the 10-Q, which we expect to file later today. Please refer to the 10-K, today's 8-K and 10-Q, and Exelon's other filings for a discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts and expectations. Today's presentation also includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for a reconciliation between the non-GAAP measures to the nearest equivalent GAAP measures. We've scheduled one hour for today's call. I'll now turn the call over to Chris Crane, Exelon's CEO.
Christopher Crane: Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us this morning. We're pleased to deliver another very strong and what's been a very good year for us thus far. First, I'll highlight our financial and operational performance and then I'll switch over to our key strategic objectives. On the financial front we're reporting operating earnings of $0.83 per share over 6% EPS growth versus the same period last year and above our guidance range. Despite the delays in closing PHI which I'll address further, we're still on track to deliver our best year of earnings since 2012. We are raising our guidance range to 240 to 260 and Jack will provide more details on the financial performance during his remarks. It's been a phenomenal year across our companies. At the utilities we're set to invest $3.7 billion this year and needed infrastructure and enhancements and grid reliability and resiliency modifications. Part of more than the $16 billion investment that's planned over the next five years. This includes our smart meter installation program which we now have completed nearly 5.5 million gas and electric installations across our operating companies. Our utilities will exceed $1 billion in net income in 2015, driven by industry leading operational performance with each utility achieving first quartile safety, first and second quartile safety results and ranking in first quartile in customer satisfaction. We reached the settlement at PECO in its recent rate case filing which follows the BGE recent unanimous rate case settlement in Maryland. This highlights how strong operational performance supports recovery and constructive regulatory environments. On the generation side of the business we had another solid quarter of operations performance. Nuclear capacity factor was 95.5, power dispatch match was 99%, renewable energy captures was 94.8%. We also had great execution in Constellation this quarter showing the value of our generation to lower matching strategy. And our ability to optimize our portfolio even during adverse market conditions in a way that contributes meaningfully to our earnings. The breadth of the consolation platform gives us multiple scales to market. We are the number one retail electric provider and well ahead of our nearest competitor. We serve nearly 200 kilowatt hours of wholesale and retail load and we are also a top 10 marketer of gas in the U.S. delivering 46 Bcf of gas daily. On both side of the company we continue to run the business at high levels of performance and the results are evident in this year’s earnings. Now I want to discuss three key initiatives we have been working on this year, capacity performance, the low carbon portfolio standard in the Pepco Holdings merger. Starting with capacity performance, PJM capacity performance design went at implementation this year’s auctions with constructive results. We are pleased with the outcome of the capacity auctions. The new penalty structural hold generators accountable reliability to the benefit of customers. For the 1819 auction we cleared a significant number of megawatts at higher price zones that in these prices exceeded at our own internal expectations. The transition auctions better reflect the value of the reliability of our nuclear units that they provide to the grid. Our next major initiative was getting a low power portfolio standard past. We came into the year advocating for a better market design in Illinois one that would level the playing field for nuclear energy as a key resource in the state. We worked hard to introduce the carbon standard earlier this year however the political situation in the state has made the budget the soul focus leaving little opportunity for progress on energy legislation. We are disappointed that we have not made a progress on this front however the overall outlook for the nuclear fleet has improved as a result of policy and market factors namely the constructive results of the capacity auction, the positive results from Illinois power agencies capacity procurement for 2016, the long term impact on the environmental protection agency’s new carbon reduction rules. As a result we have decided as announced to defer another year’s decision about the future quad [ph] having said that, the low carbon portfolio standard remains a good policy for Illinois and a priority for Illinois. On our last key initiative was the Pepco acquisition. Let me take time to share our perspective on where we're at with the deal. We are very excited we reached the settlement with the Government of the District of Colombia, the Office of People’s Council, the Office of the Attorney General and others in D.C. The settlement includes commitments to provide a substantially enhanced benefits to the consumer and businesses in the district, it includes bill credits, low income assistance and fewer and shorter outages, a clear greener D.C. and investment in local jobs in the local economy. The settlement package was specifically shaped to address the concerns articulated by the D.C. Public Service Commission in its August quarter. As you’ve seen we have improved the reliability and the customer satisfaction at BGE and see the benefits of those performance improvements reflected in regulatory outcomes. We look forward to the opportunity to do the same with the Pepco family of utilities. The deal remains an important strategic element to the future of excellent allowing us to shift our business mix to a more regulated and durable earning stream. We realize the deal has taken longer than expected and we know that is required patience for many parties especially our investors as we work to complete it. We received an order from the D.C. Public Service Commission two days ago that moves us in the right direction. The Commission granted our request to reopen the record and consider the settlement in the existing doc, a schedule that was set that is in line with our proposed timeline. And the commission is committed to consider the settlement in a fashion that is open, transparent and fair. We appreciate the commission’s commitment to ruling on the merger in a timely manner and we ask for your support as we get this across the finish line. It has been a busy year and we've accomplished a lot and there is a lot left to be done. In particular we're embarking on a large scale cost management initiative. We'll provide more details at the EEI financial conference. We are pleased with the performance we've delivered for the shareholders this year despite the significant market and regulatory headwinds as we always were working hard to serve our customers and the communities that where we serve better. I'll now turn the call over to Joe, who will discuss the markets.
Joseph Nigro: Thank you, Chris and good morning everyone. The Constellation business had another strong quarter outperforming our targets. Our portfolio management team performed very well and as Chris mentioned our retail and wholesale business is having a very strong year. In addition, our core strategy of matching our generation fleet with our load business continues to provide significant value for our shareholders. It has been paying off across the volatility and price spectrum. We have captured higher prices for our generation during periods of extreme weather while managing our load obligations and we've captured higher margins during low volatility period like this summer as we've realized lower cost to serve our customers. It also provides us with an important channel to market for our hedging activities which is important in times of low liquidity and in places where there is not an active market. Our past results and our current hedge disclosure show that our business can drive in either market environment and provide a great deal of value to the enterprise. My comments today will focus on power and gas markets during the quarter and our fundamental view. The recent PJM capacity performance auction and our hedge disclosures in hedging activity. Turning to the power markets on slide four. NiHub remains undervalued even independent of gas prices. PJM West price is more fairly valued when accounting for the new generation underdevelopment and expected in the East. Our fundamental view of power prices remained unchanged in addition we especially see upside in the non-winter months and during off peak hours. The difference between our fundamental view and the near term forward market prices of NiHub is primarily driven by changes in dispatch stat [ph]. Additionally fuel and coal markets are in contango while power is backwardated which is unusual. We think this is also contributing to lower prices in our views with support. During this summer, the impacts of a change in the stack were massed across the power pool because we did not see the peak loads that were expected and delivered natural gas prices were extremely low. While we saw price rebates [ph] continue to deliver high, the absolute price was driven lower by steel price [ph]. If we extended this picture on this slide further out in the curve you would see an even greater disconnect between the forward curve and our fundamental view driven mostly by a lack of liquidity. This lack of liquidity at NiHub is in most years and we are seeing it in West Southern 2019 and beyond in particular. Because it is lack of liquidity our hedging activity is mostly continued to be down for our load business and not over the calendar markets. We continue to align our hedging strategy with our views of the market and in 2017 remain behind ratable with 6% to 9% of power exposure. We are even further behind ratable in the Midwest with power exposure 17% to 20%. This strategy exposes us to the significant upside we still see in that market. While partially protecting us for many further degradation of natural gas prices through our cross commodity hedging. Before turning to the hedge disclosure itself, I'd like to touch on the recent PJM capacity auctions. Chris covered the results of the auction a few minutes ago. So I'll focus on the key takeaways from the auction. The biggest impact was getting behavior. In the 1819 base residual auction and the transition auction we saw market participants bidding in a more disciplined manner and recognizing the risks with penalties for non-performance. In addition about half the new builds cleared versus what we saw in the 1718 auction. And finally, the vast majority of demand response clearly the base product which may have read through value as PJM transitions to 100% capacity for performance product in two years. As I mentioned earlier our load business remain solid. Our originations have been strong and our generation to load matching strategy has worked well throughout the year. You can see the impact of this strategy throughout the gross margin disclosures. In 2015 we have a net $200 million increase in total gross margins since the end of the second quarter. We started the third quarter with a $100 million power new business target remaining for the year. We had strong performance during the quarter executing 200 million in power new business with the majority realized in the quarter. As a result of this performance we raised our power new business target by a $150 million resulting in only $50 million of power new business to go from the fourth quarter. Our performance was driven by our generation to load matching strategy including a load across to serve our load across the portfolio and our position management activity showed by through the backstop of our generation. As an example [indiscernible] experience quite a bit heat in early August and we saw the reserve margins in ERCOT come in as much as 10% lower than projected on those days. Spot prices increased and we benefited in capturing value from this move. As a result, we are also seeing upward movement in ERCOT pricing in the forward curve. In 2016, the impact of capacity performance auction increased total gross margin by $150 million this was partially offset by market price decline net of hedges of 50 million. During the quarter we executed on a $150 million of new business and are raising our 2016 power new business target by $200 million to $500 million total remaining. This compares to a $400 million new business target to go for 2015 at the same point last year. We are confident we can make this new target next year given our performance this year and the addition of the Integrys acquisition. Our total gross margin increased by 200 million to $7.8 billion. Capacity performance results added 300 million to total gross margin which was partially offset by a $100 million decrease due to the impact of lower prices on our open generation net of hedging. During the quarter we executed $100 million in power new business. We are confident that we have the right hedging strategies to capture the upside we see coming in the market and we have proven that our generation to load matching strategy brings value in both low the high volatility environments. I'll now turn it over to Jack to discuss the financial results for the quarter.
Jonathan Thayer: Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. As Chris and Joe stated we had another strong quarter financially and operationally. My remarks will focus on our financial results for the quarter, our full year guidance range, and provide an update on our cash outlook for 2015. Starting with our third quarter results on slide six, Exelon delivered earnings of $0.83 per share exceeding our guidance range by $0.08. This compares to $0.78 per share for the third quarter of 2014. Exelon's Utilities delivered combined earnings of $0.33 per share outperforming the third quarter of last year by $0.04. During the quarter, we saw favorable weather at both PECO and ComEd. Cooling degree days were up 30% from the prior year and 28% above normal in Southeastern Pennsylvania and up 18% from the prior year and 3% above normal in Northern Illinois. Distribution revenues at both ComEd and BGE were higher quarter-over-quarter reflecting the impacts of increased capital investment and higher rates respectively. On September 10th, PECO reached a settlement on its rate case filing. They agreed upon revenue requirement increase of $127 million represent 67% of the original proposal. The Pennsylvania PUCs decision is expected in December of this year with rates going into effect on January 1, 2016. The Pennsylvania PUC recently approved the new system 2020 plan which will lead to an additional $275 million being invested during the next five years to install advanced equipment and reinforce the local electric system making it more weather resistant and less vulnerable to storm damage. An order on commence annual formula rate filing is expected to issue by the ICC in early to mid-December. As a reminder ComEd requested a revenue decrease of $55 million in its current filing. This reduction reflects the continued focus on cost management and operational efficiencies that are being realized from a stronger more reliable grade with fewer outages. More detail on each of these rate cases can be found in the appendix on slides 19 through 21. Turning to slide [ph] generation, it had another strong quarter delivering earnings of $0.55 per share, $0.05 higher than the same period last year. As Joe mentioned, our generation to load matching strategy continues to provide value for our business and our shareholders. We benefited from a lower comp to serve both our retail and wholesale customers and had another strong quarter of performance from our portfolio management team. In addition, compared to the third quarter of 2014, we had a positive contribution from the Integrys acquisition. These positive factors were partially offset by realized Nuclear Decommissioning Trust fund losses in 2015 as compared to gains in 2014 and the impacts of the divestitures of certain generating assets in 2014. Last week, we filed a settlement agreement with New York PSC and FERC in regards to our Guinea [ph] facility. The new agreement shortens the RSSA period by 18 months includes more market based revenue and requires that any expansion must be justified by a study. The settlement is still subject to approval by both the FERC and the New York PSC. While we are pleased with the negotiated RSSA will allow Guinea [ph] continue to powering the grid in the local economy until 2017 it's only a temporary solution to a long-term problem. Single unit nuclear facilities like Guinea [ph] faced significant economic challenges brought on by four market conditions and a lack of energy policies that properly value the clean and reliable energy that nuclear provides. More detail on the quarter-over-quarter drivers for each operating company to be found on slide 17 and 18 in the appendix. As Chris mentioned, we are raising our full year guidance range for earnings to $2.40 to $2.60 per share. At the beginning of the year, we provided a standalone guidance range of $2.25 to $2.55 per share. We narrow the range on our second quarter earnings call to $2.35 to $2.55. This guidance range included the impacts of the debt and share dilution from the PHI merger and assume that the merger would close during the third quarter. Since the merger did not close, we have $0.13 of earnings drag from the interest expense and share dilution. Without this drag, we would have expected full year earnings to exceed the top end of our new guidance range of $2.40 to $2.60 per share due to strong performance of both the Utilities and Constellation this year. Consistent with our past practice, our guidance range does not include the impact of an extension of bonus depreciation which we would expect to be around $0.08 decrease per share. Nonetheless, we are comfortable that we will still be in the guidance range even if bonus depreciation were to be extended. Turning back to Pepco for a minute. We will need our original deal case accretion of $0.15 to $0.20. However, it will be push back until 2019. In addition, we expect the impacts in the merger to be neutral in 2017 and $0.07 to $0.12 accretive in 2018. These changes are primarily due to the delay in closing the merger, the consequent updates to PHI’s business plan as a result of this delay and due to the meaningful improvement in Exelon's business plan. The deal remains critically important to our long-term strategy. Slide seven provides an update on our cash flow expectations for this year. We project cash from operations of $6.8 billion across our businesses and free cash flow of $925 million at generation in 2015. As you can see our projected earnings cash balance is roughly $9.6 billion for the year, most of this is related to the fact that we’ve raised the funds necessary to close the Pepco merger which as you know has been delayed. $2.5 billion of the debt was subject to redemption if the merger does not close by December 31st. Yesterday we announced the debt exchange offering to amend the mandatory redemption date in those notes. This action will minimize our refinancing risk and allow our bondholders to stay invested in the bonds and year end approaches. In closing, I want to reiterate that our company can perform well in a rising interest rate environment which is typically a headwind for our industry. This is because our earnings are positively correlated to interest rates due to both comments ROE being directly tied to the 30 year treasury rate as well as the discounting of our pension liabilities. As a general rule, every 25 basis point increase in interest rates equates to roughly $0.02 of consolidated earnings uplift related to ComEd in the pension. Thank you and we will now open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse.
Dan Eggers: Just Jack taking a before you left off on the Pepco accretion numbers. You guys are going to have $0.13 of drag because of the equity and the debt associated with the acquisition. If we look at '16, how much of that $0.13 gets offset I guess on a year-over-year base if we're to step forward one year.
Jonathan Thayer: Dan we would anticipate that the transaction would close towards the end of the first quarter and the transaction will be modestly diluted to --.
Dan Eggers: Including $0.13 or net of the $0.13?
Jonathan Thayer: Including the impact of the shares and debt issue, so it inclusive of that $0.13 expense associated with interest and increase shares.
Dan Eggers: Okay. If I go I guess next question. On the Constellation side with the retail margins coming through. Can you guys give us some context is that how much contribution is coming from that business or where you guys sit in that historic margin range of $2 to $4 megawatt hour. Just so we can see a little better from the outside what's going on there.
Joseph Nigro: Yeah hi Dan, this is Joe. Good morning. In the let's start with the second question first. We are still well within that $2 to $4 range. It's above the $2 value and it's below the $4. Our commercial industrial originations remained solid and we're happy with that. As for the margin, I think about it more on a total portfolio basis, because there is retail margins of one component of it. The second thing is we serve a lot of wholesale polar load as well which have a different margin structure associated with them. But the money that we made in the third quarter which really driven by three key things. The first thing is that if you go back and look at our hedge disclosure again for the second quarter, we were effectively 100% hedged across our book for the year. And so we set up with the short buys recognized we had the backstop of our own generation to serve loaded market guide volatile. The second thing is we cost it our loads when we sold them the risk premiums were much higher than what is realized in the spot market primarily driven by the low, low gas prices during the third quarter. And then the last thing is we took an opportunity when the prices dropped to hair cut during the summer to materially get our position in longer as we walked into August and then we saw some volatility. So we capitalized them that as well. So it's really been three components that drove the value.
Dan Eggers: Okay, got it. And I guess last question you maybe Chris or Jack is just on the decision to differ the nuclear plant closures. How much earnings drag should we assume is coming off those three plants in 2016? And given the delays in making decision what would actually get you guys the point to decide which higher in any of these assets that are making money.
Christopher Crane: So let's first talk about PJM and Quad and Byron. The CP auctions substantially changed the profile of cash flow and earnings. We have still need on the low power portfolio standard to cement the long-term viability of these assets. But Quad is just marginal flat on free cash flow. It just slightly dilutive on earnings. And if we can move the CP along, it will greatly improve that. Byron is in a little bit better shape based off of CP and we'll continue to watch that closely. On Clinton we were prepared with no action taken on the capacity market to go forward with the retirement. We have seen a commitment and action at MISO to evaluate zone 4 as its only competitive, real competitive market to evaluate the redesign of the capacity construct that would adequately compensate the generators for the investors they are making. We've also seen positive signals from the state of Illinois by evaluating and starting workshops to evaluate the problem statement and workshops to look at potential fixes on Zone 4 in Southern Illinois. So now that we've seen some potential for improvement, we're willing to go another year. At unit Clinton is one of our newest units in the fleet is got over 30 years of potential run left, with support coming from MISO and understanding the problem statement at - and the state now considering what should be done in the southern part to ensure reliability. We saw that as an enough promise to extent it one more year to see what we can do in 2016.
Dan Eggers: So that is your view that you'll have some sort of market reform in '16 I guess in the first half of '16 in MISO for those plants look viable or is it just the action that will get you comfortable even if it's not resolve.
Jonathan Thayer: We want to resolve in 2016. I don't know if it's going to be in the first half but it has got to get resolved in 2016 between the lower power portfolio standard and the capacity construct in MISO it is going to be imperative for us to go forward. Quad in the subsequent auction is cleared 16-17, 17-18. So we've got a blanket on that for couple of years but it did not cleared 18-19.
Dan Eggers: Okay, got it. Thank you guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.
Steven Fleishman: Yeah, hi. Good morning. Couple of questions just on the [indiscernible] recent update that you gave, is the kind of push out of the accretion or just due to delays and closing and just more time to get the cost cuts and through and I guess maybe any rate relief through like the rate free is that you have. Is that the main difference?
Jonathan Thayer: That's part of it and the other part is our approved from the time we announced the merger and from when we talked about the LRP last year - last quarter excuse me, our position is improved. So there is a little bit of we're better than we were. And the delays is the other part of it.
Steven Fleishman: Okay. And then I guess just on the nuclear decision. And I would just wondered there is a little bit of kind of risk okay, you were crying wolf on this, because you talked about this for a while then you're not shutting this year. Just how is the risk of the shutting like real in '16 or what is different in terms of making this decision now. I mean gas prices are also a lot lower too.
Christopher Crane: Yes. So we opened the books to key stakeholders in the stake. They could see the red [ph] that was being produced by these assets. We were able to work with PJM and the other stakeholders on CP that gave us the improvement that we're not seeing the level of red [ph] or in some cases neutral on the assets. These are long lived assets and their big decisions to make we're not crying wolf we've actually got results. And if we can continue to get results these units will become profitable and be able to stay within the fleet. And the contributions they make to the communities that they serve. So this is not as backing down on a decision this is as making progress on a path that we define clearly at the beginning of this. If we cannot see progress we would shut the units down. We have seen progress and we continue to believe there is potential for more progress. If we do not see that progress, we will shut the plants down.
Steven Fleishman: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI.
Greg Gordon: Thanks. A few questions, first back on [indiscernible] I have the good fortune of having follow them before you. You announced the acquisition and I have been keeping my model up to date. And it actually looks to me like their financial situation is materially degraded over the year or so year and half or so and through the time that’s been caused by this delay they haven’t gotten rate increases, they've got massive operating cost increase they’ve added several hundred basis points of leverage to their balance sheet I mean they don’t look like they are a viable entity in their current form if this deal doesn’t close. So, it’s part of this problem with the delay and the accretion that you’re coming from a deeper hole?
Christopher Crane: If the delay in filing the rate cases has contributed to PHI’s position that they’re in now. They publicly spoke about what their future would be on a stand. We believe that once we are able to fold them into the fleet and drive the synergies and help support them with the operational performance that will give the environment for a fair regulatory recovery going forward. As we’ve seen with BGE.
Greg Gordon: Yeah. I mean certainly as I have observed on a standalone basis they’ve just seen a massive escalation in cost which I am sure you’d be able to control much more readily given Exelon’s playbook that should lead to a necessity from lower ask in terms of rate increases to get back to a decent return more to think correct?
Christopher Crane: Yeah. I mean that’s part of the thesis in our filings and what we’re able to do with the settlements we can drive the synergies with our platform that will reduce the request for needed scope of rate increases.
Greg Gordon: Okay. Thanks. Going back to the $0.08 to impact to earnings from bonus depreciation Jack that’s on this year’s earnings and is that sort of lower rate base net of capital allocation and can you just walk us through how you do that calculation?
Jonathan Thayer: Sure. That would be Greg on 2015. The $0.08 would hit $0.07 at ExGen, it would hit a penny at ComEd importantly it would also improve our cash flow by $650 million and at ComEd we would see the impact of bonus depreciation would cause a $215 million reduction in ComEd's rate base.
Greg Gordon: So, what do you assume, you do with the 650 million in cash just becomes goes at the corporate general bucket or do you assume a specific offset in the denominator through much that reduction if you just less that, is that the answer?
Jonathan Thayer: Effectively, we would reinvest that back into the utilities part of our business to fund our capital plan.
Greg Gordon: Okay. And why is there such a big impact on ExGen?
Jonathan Thayer: It’s the domestic production credits, there is a limit or they goes into place and as those bonus depreciation hits that limitations goes into effect and meaningfully hits our ExGen part of our business with somewhat unique with our exposure to this within the industry.
Greg Gordon: That hits your ability to consume production tax credits?
Jonathan Thayer: It’s more, Tom do you want to - had a tax.
Unidentified Corporate Participant: As a generator, we’re entitled to claim so called domestic production activities in - which has completed as a percentage of generation income so as bonus appreciation reduces that income or therefore reduces the related...
Greg Gordon: Okay, got it. Thank you guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.
Jonathan Arnold: Good morning guys.
Jonathan Thayer: Good morning John.
Jonathan Arnold: Quick question. I noticed that in your recast of the ‘15 guidance those now you obviously have the holdco drag which I apologize I missed this guessing in part of the financing on Pepco. But what would be we - that ride of - what’s the reasonable run rate of holdco expense as we look for beyond this year?
Jonathan Thayer: So, Jonathan, we commented in our earning script that the equity and debt financing associated with PHI because we didn’t close as anticipated in Q3 and would be a $0.13 drag on the year. So, our guidance contemplates that drag and incorporates that obviously. Prospectively, we would anticipate closing the transaction towards the end of the first quarter of 2016, we would get the benefit of Pepco’s earnings and the pro forma would be modestly diluted for ‘16 until we as Chris mentioned execute the rate cases and grow the revenues and earnings at PHI over the course of the next several years.
Jonathan Arnold: And I had the comment about the $0.13 diluted that was a ‘15 comment or was it ‘16?
Jonathan Thayer: No that’s a ‘15 comment Jonathan. 15, sorry 2015 drag in 2016 we have the benefits of PHI for three quarters.
Jonathan Arnold: Okay, got it. So once you close will you start on that the holdco financing for that deal kind of into the segment or do you think you’ll still have a discrete pair of drag that might be larger going forward?
Jonathan Thayer: We will incorporate the shares issued or we have the shares issued the 893 million shares in the share counts that will give us advisory for all of our business units and then we have the corporate moving company or holding company that will get allocated.
Jonathan Arnold: Okay so I should once we get into ‘17 let’s say this parent segment the best guess is kind of flat?
Jonathan Thayer: Starting in ‘17 we’ll start to see increase in going into ‘18 and very strong at the end of the LRP period.
Jonathan Arnold: Okay, thank you guys. And then could I ask one other thing we saw this Maryland A.G. filing in the second quarter any thoughts around timing how concerned are you it might be Maryland that ends up throwing the rents in the work?
Jonathan Thayer: Darryl you want to cover that?
Darryl Bradford: Yeah Jonathan, this is Darryl Bradford. We have - the attorney general asked for leads to file [indiscernible] brief we’re going to following on opposition today along with the Maryland Public Service Commission, why there'd be attorney general allow to file in that we feel that the Maryland decision is a very strong one the parties that are appealing and have a very heavy burden, go for its permit there will be a hearing in the Circuit Court on December 8 on this and we believe that decision was very solid and we believe that it will be of help.
Jonathan Arnold: Okay great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Hue Wynn [ph] with Bernstein.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you. I was wondering if you could provide any high level perspectives on the cost cutting initiative that you had mentioned in the scripted remarks.
Christopher Crane: Yeah we’re going to be putting out the details at EEI but we’ve looked at our corporate center BSC business service cost, we’re looking at a IT cost in some of the work that we can do there and also at the generating company so we should be able to provide more detail on that or we will be providing more detail in the year.
Unidentified Analyst: All right. Thanks so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Good morning.
Christopher Crane: Morning.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: So first question going back to Pepco if you will, the 2019’s figure what’s embedded in there is that simply just closing on the transaction, executing status quo or are there rate case assumptions etcetera I was just trying to get a little bit more sense that far out in terms of what’s baked in?
Jonathan Thayer: So there are rate case assumptions that we’re taking straight out of PHI’s RP. Once we close we’ll be able to get deeper into those numbers in the drivers but it is based up of their assumptions on what they’ll recover in rate cases and their assumption on cost in cost controls going forward. So we will be able to do more on that and provide updates when we get into the detail at the close.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. To a clarification it might be a little tricky first earned ROE’s approximately I mean is it fair to say what I’ll let you comment on that on the Pepco side and then separately as you think about this transaction you’ve got I suppose the cost update coming at EEI, is there some fungibility between those two as well?
Jonathan Thayer: I'm sure there is because you are going to have the Massachusetts model will dictate the over hedge down to the specific company. So there should be with this improvement minor adjustments. But it would too early to speculate now on where there goes. On the ROE's the calculation would be straight out of the LRP that PHI is operating under now their LRP that will have to be updated post close with our assumptions of not only the cost reductions but the operational improvements.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Great. Last little question here. What is the creaks you guys filed an interesting 8-K recently regarding must offer requirements in 2019. Is there and ability to clip participate for a partial year and toward the subsequent capacity auction at all?
Jonathan Thayer: [Indiscernible] will take that.
Unidentified Corporate Participant: Hey, Julien, it's Joe [ph]. Julien we've looked at that that would be very difficult especially with the new CP environment. So you've seen our most [indiscernible] we don't intend to participate with that.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Just wanted to clarify. Thank you.
Operator: Your final question comes from Ali Agha with SunTrust.
Ali Agha: Thank you. Good morning.
Christopher Crane: Good morning.
Ali Agha: First question, just wanted to clarify the $0.08 beep [ph] that you had in the third quarter above the high end of your guidance, was that all coming from the stronger performance at Constellation or what was the main driver there?
Jonathan Thayer: Ali it was both across the utility business as well as that constellation and nextgen part of our businesses. So we had strong weather and operating results at both PECO and ComEd and then we had good operating results at PJE and as Joe articulated in his discussion we had strong performance from the generating part of our company.
Ali Agha: Okay. Second question, this disconnect in pricing between your fundamental view of NiHub and the forwards we've been hearing that for the last several quarters now and this [Inaudible] happen during that - what is your opinion is going to trigger that to coincide? Is there just a search in demand, extreme weather, I mean like I said we've been seeing this for a while, what do you think will change that?
Joseph Nigro: Good morning. I think - it’s Joe. I think there is a couple of things. But I think the biggest thing is there is a complete lack of liquidity in NiHub and especially when you get beyond like 2015-17 period. We think that when - with normal weather in 2016 we think NiHub is somewhat fairly value. But as you move out on the curve it gets materially undervalued and that's driven mostly by the lack of liquidity. If you look at you have gas prices that are in a contango market and M3 is relevant because it's across the [indiscernible] a lot of hours setting price using M3 gas. So if you look at like 2016 to 2018 you've got $0.25 of value on the curve just associated - $0.40 of value associated with Henry hub prices and another $0.20 to $0.25 with M3. There are $0.65 a value in the gas curve and yet the power prices at NiHub today are $0.25 back warding. In addition closely contango as well so that part of it, the coal [ph] retirements part of it. We have seen heat rate expansion even at these low gas prices, we think some of that has been massed quite frankly by the fuel being so low. But when you put all that together in the complete lack of liquidity that's where we coming up with the driver of higher prices in the future.
Ali Agha: Understood. And the last question assuming these forward curve stay as they are and I know that at EEI you'll update your curves 18 to the mix as well. But when you look at - I mean you are showing us fairly flat margins 16 17, the cost saving that you are planning are they going to be strong enough so that just directionally GenCorp can a show a positive net income stream because depreciation another expansion are going up as well or are we still looking at flat to perhaps declining GenCorp profile given what the forward curves are telling us right now.
Jonathan Thayer: Ali, its Jack. I know that there is a lot of interest in us engaging on the cost reduction topic before EEI. But I think it's probably better to align our disclosure around that cost reduction effort with our outlook for 16 17 and 18 hedge disclosures. You'll obviously see the significant benefit of CP in that period aligned with the benefits of cost reduction. So the story is positive, we'd ask for your patience in terms of transparency around that until EEI.
Christopher Crane: The bottom line is we are seeing improvement over the LRP period.
Ali Agha: Okay. So from an Exelon perspective just directionally you would as we stand here today 18 19 earnings with that going there should be higher than where we are in '15. Is that a fair statement?
Jonathan Thayer: Yes.
Ali Agha: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning. Thank you for standing by. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Exelon Corporation Quarter Two 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Your lines have been muted to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I'd now like to turn today's conference over to Francis Idehen. Thank you, you may begin.
Francis Idehen - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thank you, Ali. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining for our second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Leading the call today are Chris Crane, Exelon's President and Chief Executive Officer; Joe Nigro, CEO of Constellation; and Jack Thayer, Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by other members of Exelon's senior management team, who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. We issued our earnings release this morning along with the presentation, each of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of Exelon's website. The earnings release and other matters which we discuss during today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today's material, comments made during this call, and in the risk factors section on the 10-K which we filed in February, as well as in the earnings release and the 10-Q, which we expect to file later today. Please refer to the 10-K, today's 8-K and 10-Q, and Exelon's other filings for a discussion of factors that may cause the results to differ from management's projections, forecasts and expectations. Today's presentation also includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for a reconciliation between the non-GAAP measures to the nearest equivalent GAAP measures. We've scheduled 45 minutes for today's call. I'll now turn the call over to Chris Crane, Exelon's CEO.
Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Francis, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining. We're pleased to report another strong quarter with our earnings coming in at $0.59 per share, surpassing our guidance of $0.45 to $0.55 per share. You'll hear more from Jack in a minute on the specifics, and Joe Nigro will also provide some color around the performance. We've seen a number of positive developments that affect various business this quarter. The two primary catalysts for us this year are the PHI acquisition and the capacity market auctions. We received approval from the merger since our last call in Maryland in May, and leaving D.C., Washington, D.C. as our only outstanding jurisdiction to close the merger, which we expect to hear from soon and we're looking forward to a positive outcome there. Upon closing the merger, our focus will shift to the integration of PHI Utilities into the Exelon Utilities to align our operations to better serve the PHI customers base. Another major catalyst is the capacity performance revisions that have been made. While we continue to believe that FERC came to the right conclusion, putting reliability at the center of its planning process to ensure that customers in the region are well served, we always were aware that DR and Energy Efficiency were in the 2018-2019 auction. The most recent change that allows DR and Energy Efficiency to provide – to participate in the transition auctions, we believe to be non-material to the outcome. We are disappointed in the delay, but we think that we'll be on the right track into recognize the value of our highly reliable fleet going forward. And we remain confident that the capacity construct is the best way to protect the grid as we await further clarification on the timing of these transition auctions. I think we're getting that in the last days. So, by the September timeframe, we should have clarity on the value proposition, along with the reliability measures being enacted. In Illinois, the legislative session ended without a resolution on the market redesign for the Low Carbon standard, the Low Carbon Portfolio standard. We were disappointed that we were not able to get this outcome before the session ended, but understand where the state is focused right now on its budget priorities. The nuclear plants provide significant value to the state and its economy, and it's mostly important to its consumers. Looking ahead, we have certain regulatory and operational triggers in September that require us to make some tough choices on the specific assets this fall, particularly in light of the continued pressure on the power markets. So we are continuing on with our disciplined plan on evaluating the assets and their likelihood to stay within the stack, and we'll bring that to closure with our decision in September. Despite these market challenges, we continue to find ways to create value in our Constellation business, which Joe is going to talk about shortly. Part of our resilience to the power market weakness is driven by our ability to capitalize on our generation to load strategy. And this quarter, we showed the benefit from the lower cost to serve load. And the – increasing our utility business has been able to reduce the overall volatility at the enterprise level and deliver growth. You can expect that even more to be true over time. Not only is it shifting our business mix with the acquisition of PHI, but it also, with our infrastructure improvement investments, we're investing $16 billion in our existing utilities over the next five years, which provides respectable growth rates, and roughly another $7 billion with the addition of PHI. I want to remind everybody that we can perform well even with a rising interest rate environment, which is typically a headwind in our industry. This is because our EPS is positively correlated to interest rates, due to both ComEd's formula rate and ROE being tied to the 30-year Treasury rate, as well as the discount of our pension – discounting the rates of our pension liability. Overall, we are positive the company is able to provide more stable and durable earnings streams for our shareholders with our operational expertise in driving performance across the enterprise. With that, I'll turn it over to Joe, who will discuss the markets. He's followed by Jack on the financial performance.
Joseph Nigro - Executive Vice President, Exelon; Chief Executive Officer, Constellation, Exelon Corp.: Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone. The Constellation business has continued to perform well in 2015 as a result of our generation to load matching strategy. My comments today will address market events during the second quarter, and what they mean for our commercial business going forward, including our hedging strategy in our updated disclosures. Starting with slide four, the spot power markets in the second quarter have been defined by mild weather and lower natural gas prices, which drove the price in power considerably lower than in 2014 across all of PJM. The impact of low spot market conditions has carried through to the forward markets, with prices down approximately $0.45 per megawatt hour in 2016 and $1 per megawatt hour in 2017, at both PJM West Hub and NiHub since the end of the first quarter. The lack of liquidity in the forward markets has exacerbated the drops in power prices and heat rates, with the forward markets exhibiting volatile price moves on very little trading volumes for calendar 2017 and beyond, especially at NiHub. During the quarter, our hedging activities for 2016 to 2018 were executed through our retail and wholesale load businesses rather than on the over-the-counter market. Our fundamental view of power prices has not changed, but given the drop in market prices, there is a greater gap between the market and our fundamental view due to current natural gas prices, expected retirements, new generation resources, and load assumptions. Moving to slide five, I will discuss the forward market and its impacts on our hedging profile. During the second quarter we maintained our behind ratable strategy and increased our cross-commodity hedge position to increase exposure to power price upside. We have successfully used this behind ratable hedging strategy in the past when our view showed upside in the market. We are 4% to 5% behind ratable in 2016 and 2017, and 7% to 8% behind ratable if you will remove our cross-commodity hedges at NiHub. We are confident in our ability to adjust our hedging strategies to capitalize on our fundamental view. Turning to slide six, I will review our updated hedge disclosure and some key changes since the end of the first quarter. In 2015 we have a net $50 million increase to total gross margin since the end of the first quarter, driven primarily by strong performance and execution. We executed on $200 million of power new business and $50 million of non-power new business during the quarter. Based on 2015 performance to date and expectations for the full year, we have increased our power new business target by $50 million. Our generation to load strategy was successful last year during the extreme polar vortex conditions, and it's serving us well this year under weaker load and price conditions. It is further augmented by strong performance from our portfolio optimization activities and our Integrys acquisition. For 2016, we saw prices decrease across most regions, decreasing around $0.45 per megawatt-hour in both the Mid-Atlantic and the Midwest. This resulted in a decrease in our open gross margin of approximately $200 million, which was offset by our hedging activities. During the quarter we executed $100 million of power new business and $50 million of non-power new business, and are raising our power new business targets by $50 million additional due to commercial opportunities, for a gross margin increase of $50 million in 2016. For 2017, prices decreased by approximately $1 per megawatt hour in both the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest. This resulted in a decrease of $300 million in our open gross margins. Despite the drop in prices, our total gross margin is only down $50 million due to our hedged position and an increase in our power new business target of $100 million in case we have line of sight into additional commercial opportunities. Since the beginning of the year, prices have fallen due to mild weather, lower gas prices, lower load demand in the Midwest, and a lack of liquidity in the markets. Prices have fallen more in 2017 and beyond than in 2016. Although this weakness in the spot market has impacted forward markets, we are confident in our fundamental view of the gas and power markets and are positioning our portfolio to take advantage of this. Now I'll turn it over to Jack to review the full financial information for the quarter.
Jonathan W. Thayer - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP: Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. We had another strong quarter. My remarks will cover our financial results for the quarter, third quarter guidance range, and our cash outlook. Starting with our second quarter results on slide seven, Exelon exceeded our guidance range and delivered earnings of $0.59 per share. This compares to $0.51 per share for the second quarter of 2014. Exelon's Utilities delivered combined earnings of $0.25 per share and were flat to the second quarter of last year. During the quarter, we saw favorable weather at PECO and unfavorable weather at ComEd. Cooling degree days were up nearly 37% from the prior year and 47.4% above normal in Southeastern Pennsylvania, and down 34% from the prior year and 21.6% below normal in Northern Illinois. Distribution revenues at ComEd and BGE were higher quarter-over-quarter. In addition, BGE had a decrease in uncollectible accounts expense compared to the second quarter of 2014. Exelon Generation had another strong quarter, delivering earnings of $0.36 per share, $0.09 higher than the same period last year. As Joe mentioned, our generation to load matching strategy continues to prove effective. We benefited from a lower cost to serve both our retail and wholesale customers, and had strong performance from our portfolio management team. In addition, compared to the second quarter of 2014 we had fewer outage days at our nuclear plants, which had a positive contribution from the Integrys acquisition, higher realized nuclear decommissioning trust fund gains, and received additional benefits quarter-over-quarter from the cancellation of the DOE spent nuclear fee. These positive factors were partially offset by higher tax and interest expense. More detail on the quarter-over-quarter drivers for each operating company can be found on slides 18 and 19 in the appendix. For the third quarter, we are providing guidance of $0.65 to $0.75 per share. Accounting for the impact of the increased share count and the debt associated with the Pepco Holdings transaction, and assuming the transaction closes in the third quarter, we are narrowing our full-year guidance from $2.25 to $2.55 per share, to $2.35 to $2.55 per share. Our guidance does not assume that bonus depreciation is extended. Slide eight provides an update on our cash flow expectations for this year. We've simplified the format of our slide to provide a clearer view of our cash flow at each operating company, including explicitly showing free cash flow. We project cash from operations of $6.6 billion. We project free cash flow of $900 million at Generation in 2015. 80% of our total growth capital expenditures are being invested in our utilities over the next three years, which will provide stable earnings growth. In June we completed the debt portion of our financing for the Pepco transaction by issuing $4.2 billion in senior notes, with the majority of these proceeds being used to fund the transaction. Strong market demand allowed us to upsize the offering, enabling us to pull forward some future-planned corporate debt issuances. We issued across the tenor spectrum with an average maturity of approximately 14 years and an average weighted average coupon of 3.79%. Earlier this month we completed the settlement of the equity forward transaction. The combination of these financings allows us to close the merger quickly upon receiving approval from the D.C. Public Service Commission. Our balance sheet remains strong and gives us the ability to invest and grow our business. As a reminder, the appendix includes several schedules that will help you in your modeling efforts. Thank you, and we'll now open the line for questions.
Operator: And our first question will come from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI.
Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI: Good morning.
Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Greg.
Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI: Couple of questions. First, when you talk about commercial opportunities, in the context of your comfort level raising your guidance for power new business/to go, are we talking about sort of the inherent counter-cyclicality of the margins in that business in the low wholesale environment, i.e., are we moving closer off the $2 floor in margins and closer to the $4 sort of peak of the cycle margins that you see in that business historically, or is it simply new customers, more volumes than you had projected in either the gas or the electric business?
Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Joe?
Joseph Nigro - Executive Vice President, Exelon; Chief Executive Officer, Constellation, Exelon Corp.: Yeah, Greg. In this specific instance, specifically for 2016 where we're raising our power new business/to go by $50 million and 2017 by $100 million, it's really – it's not related to those load margins. It's more specifically related to some proprietary structured commercial opportunities that we have really solid line of sight into on the wholesale side of the business, quite frankly. To your point though, I think it's important to note we have raised our targets each – $50 million each quarter for 2015, for a total of $100 million so far year-to-date. And a lot of that has been driven by really three things. One is the monetization of loads that we sold at higher prices last year. So, we have seen increased value from that load-serving business, some of our optimization activities. And then we went in, as you saw from our disclosures last quarter, we went in with a short bias with a backstop of our own generation, and given the results of market prices in 2015 to date, that's performed well. We would only look to raise those targets, the power/to go targets or non-power/to go targets, if we have good line of sight into specific opportunities. And in this case, we do.
Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI: Okay. Follow-up to that. If these are fairly chunky opportunities and you win them, will we get a sort of a discrete disclosure or would that just – would we get – would you just update it on a quarterly basis as per your usual, moving from to go to, into the hedges?
Joseph Nigro - Executive Vice President, Exelon; Chief Executive Officer, Constellation, Exelon Corp.: Yeah. Yeah. We'll disclose that when the negotiations are complete.
Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And Greg, it will be in the MD&A disclosure in our interview (19:24), when it occurs.
Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI: Okay, great. Second question. In light of economic conditions in Texas, most of your investors would probably rather see you pull the plug on this gas-fired project that you're pursuing. What gives you the confidence that the through-the-cycle economics of that investment are still worth going forward in this environment?
Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So as we said, we've got a very good deal on acquiring these assets on our brownfield site. Minimal infrastructure investment. They still have a double digit IRR with these market forwards. If you just projected we stay here for 10 years, and then plug the fundamentals in after, we're still at a double-digit IRR. This is a solid investment. These are going to be dispatched first. They're the highly efficient, air-cooled, and at the right price.
Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI: Concise answer. Thank you. Take care.
Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: All right.
Operator: And your next question will come from the line of Steve Fleishman, Wolfe Research.
Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC: Yeah. Hi, good morning.
Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning.
Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC: First to Jack, clarification. So in the updated 2015 guidance, are you including some amount of POM, both the business and the financing costs? And if so, is it positive or negative within the year?
Jonathan W. Thayer - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP: So Steve, we are including – we are including the equity and the debt associated with the PHI acquisition. So for share count purposes, that incorporates a weighted average share base of 892 million shares. It does assume the third quarter close of PHI. But there is a measure of dilution this year that's related to the increased share count, the debt, and as we pursue rate cases on PHI, improve their revenues and earnings, we'll see the accretion that we anticipate with that transaction in future periods.
Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC: Okay. So just to clarify, when you net for this short period into year-end, when you net POM revenue and the financing cost, it's actually – your numbers would have been higher in this guidance if you hadn't included that.
Jonathan W. Thayer - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP: Modestly, Steve.
Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC: Okay. But then we'll get the...
Jonathan W. Thayer - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP: It (22:02), but not materially so.
Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC: But the future accretion guidance that you gave, I think, at the last quarter, or recent commentary, that's still good for future years?
Jonathan W. Thayer - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP: The impact on rate cases and the deferral of those rate cases modestly impacts the accretion, but we're still at the – as we disclosed at the last quarter, we're still at the sort of bottom end of the range in 2017 that we gave.
Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And so, it's 2018 to get to that – more to that midpoint of the run rate that we talked about.
Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC: Right. But you said that – you clarified that, I think, the last call or so. That's not new. Okay.
Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. So, $0.15 in 2017, and you'll see us head to the upper end in 2018.
Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC: Okay. Second question is just with respect to the power views. I kind of feel like just, the last few calls you've been a little bit more mixed on your power views. You're a lot more bullish right now, at least, I guess, with respect to NiHub. Is that mainly just a fact that you had to pull back as of Q2 end, and so you're just more bullish because the starting price is lower, or are you more bullish even if the prices had stayed flat?
Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It's, the prices have gone lower. We're more bullish, they're non-sustainable at this level.
Joseph Nigro - Executive Vice President, Exelon; Chief Executive Officer, Constellation, Exelon Corp.: Yeah. And, Steve, what I would say is, our view of the absolute value of power price hasn't changed quarter-over-quarter, and what's changed is we saw a material drop in the back end of the power curve and I'm talking to NiHub, but it's attributable to West Hub as well, but our upside is really baked at NiHub where we see material upside as you move out into that 2018, 2019 timeframe. We see upside as well in that 2016, 2017 period, and what's changed is the market has fallen so much, quarter-over-quarter; our absolute view of power price hasn't changed. So that spread has gone wider. And when we look at our fundamental models at NiHub, in particular, we see a lot of value that's still to be derived, and that's due to the changing dispatch stack and some of the other things that we've talked about previously.
Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Talk about the lack of liquidity.
Joseph Nigro - Executive Vice President, Exelon; Chief Executive Officer, Constellation, Exelon Corp.: Yeah, the liquidity piece of it is a big part of it, Steve. We had a $0.40 – approximately $0.40 a megawatt-hour drop in PJM, in West Hub and NiHub in calendar 2016. That's the most liquid period on the forward curve. When we've pulled data and we have access to and look at what's going on in the out-years, 2018, 2019, 2020 where we saw a material drop in prices, there is absolutely nothing trading at NiHub. There had been some few sporadic trades at West Hub, and you see the market set prices off of those trades. And our view is through time, that spread relationship between the West Hub and NiHub is going to collapse because of the retirements on the western side, the new builds on the eastern side, and that's why we think there is material upside. But our fundamental absolute view on power price hasn't changed. It's just the way the market reacted quarter-over-quarter.
Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: And your next question will come from the line of Daniel Eggery (sic) [Daniel Eggers] (25:35) with Credit Suisse.
Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hey, good morning, guys. On Pepco, could we just talk about the process? So assuming that the D.C. decision comes soon, what is the process for closing from this point, and what bearing does the Maryland appeal have on your ability to close right now?
Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'm going to get Darryl Bradford to cover that.
Darryl M. Bradford - Executive Vice President & General Counsel: Hey, Steve.
Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It's Dan.
Darryl M. Bradford - Executive Vice President & General Counsel: I'm sorry. Dan, we expect to – assuming a acceptable order from the D.C. Commission, we expect to close promptly after that order. Our contract would indicate that that will take place within 48 hours of approval by the D.C. commission. And we don't think that the Maryland motion should be any bar to us closing. We don't believe that that motion has any merit whatsoever. As you know, the alleged conflict of interest of one of the commissioners having a preliminary interviewing discussion, which she stopped, with a non-party, isn't a basis under Maryland law to question the independence of that decision, let alone to stay the proceedings. No court in Maryland and no commission in Maryland has ever suggested there's a conflict with the commissioner of any agency having a conversation with a non-party. Particularly where, as here, Exelon is one of some 45 board members, 140 members in an agency that includes public interest groups like Public Citizen, which was a party below and was the first one to raise this conflict issue. So we don't think that that motion has any merit. We filed a response yesterday with the court, and we plan to go ahead and close promptly after the D.C. commission issues an order, assuming that that order has acceptable conditions. And we have faith that the D.C. commission will do the right thing. We think we've put in a strong case with a lot of benefits for customers and protections for customers. And we look forward to a prompt closing.
Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Got it. And then I guess just on the nuclear plants in Illinois with PJM, I guess, probably moving the closure date to October. That's still probably before Illinois can act legislatively. With the drop in the forward curves, is there a practical way where you can look at those plants and think that they stay economic without some sort of legislation in Illinois? And does that force your hand come October?
Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: The capacity market fixes, focused on reliability, will not be enough to keep all the units economically viable. It does give us some support for the investments that we continue to make on the assets to maintain the reliability but it's not totally there. We need a market fix in Illinois to stop the non-competitive nature of the market. And short of the legislation to fix that, we will have to make decisions on retiring assets that are not economically viable. As we talked about previously, we have requirements around notification to PJM of our intent to retire units. It's an 18-month notification. We also have commitments around when we have to notify of our availability for the 2018-2019 auction in participation on that. And very importantly, we have to order and design cores that – fuel cores that take a while for us to – or 2019-2020 auction instead of 2018-2019, 2019-2020 auction, our participation there. And we have to order the cores, and there's a long lead time there. Are we going to run for an additional year or are we going to run for a longer period of time? And that's a very expensive decision to make. So, at least on the PJM (30:34) we'll make the decision, the final decision, if we're going to do that, in the September timeframe. We've been in consultation with the Board and we'll continue to consult with the Board, and where management's made their decision we'll pass that to the Board for the final approval in that timeframe, and continue with the outreach to our stakeholders.
Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Chris, just given the fact that you're not going to have legislation realistically done before September, and you kind of laid out the other challenges, doesn't it – what would cause you to not close the plants come September, based on the fact pattern you just laid out for us?
Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: If the units clear the 2018-2019 auction, that would show that they're financially viable. That is a long shot in our opinion, just because of the cost structure and how the forwards have continued to collapse at the bus at a couple of these units. We've got the transmission constraints, we've got the overproduction and importation of wind that not only drops the spot but continues to collapse the forward curve. The disconnect between NiHub and the bus at some of these units is $6, $7. And we have worked very closely with all the stakeholders involved for over a year and a half on trying to come to resolution, and it is the time that we'll have to make the decision after we see what happens with the capacity auctions. We don't take the decision lightly. We understand the effect that we have on the communities and potential effect on employees, but this has been a long-term issue that we've been evaluating and trying to come to resolution, and we're staying within the timeline. Actually, we extended our timeline last year to give more time to come up with the proper market fixes, and to be compensated adequately for operating these units versus subsidizing a low-cost market.
Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): And I don't mean to beat this to death (32:49) for this, but would closing a Quad or a Clinton show up noticeably as accretive to you guys on 2017 numbers?
Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We don't – we have not looked at that, and don't look at it. We analyze the plants as a standalone in their own economics, so it's about a plant losing money. We have not evaluated; others have and others have talked about the impact to consumers on those units closing. The state itself did that assessment, and there is some material impact on the consumer, but we have not evaluated anything specific to Exelon.
Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay, very good. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning, guys.
Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey.
Jonathan W. Thayer - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP: Good morning.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: One – just – given your comments about liquidity in the forward curve, is it fair to assume that you've probably not done much in the way of 2018 hedging yet? Because ordinarily you would have been a couple of quarters into it. Just curious if you could give us any insight?
Joseph Nigro - Executive Vice President, Exelon; Chief Executive Officer, Constellation, Exelon Corp.: Yeah, Jonathan. We are behind our ratable sales plan in 2018. As you know, we have a very big load-serving book of business, so we've captured opportunities, both in our retail and wholesale load-serving businesses to the extent possible, in 2018. And in addition, at times, as we've spoken about in other years, we used the gas market as well. But to sell straight OTC power in 2018, we've not done much, if any, of that at all.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then just to revisit the commercial opportunities comment. Can you give us any insight as to what kind of opportunities you're talking about? And is it, are they the result of others pulling back from the market, or just successful discussions with potential clients I guess?
Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It's early on that one, Jonathan. We'll do the full disclosure when we complete the negotiations.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Sorry to re-ask that. And then, Chris, at the outset, you made the comment that you saw the inclusion of DR in the transition auctions as being, I think you said, nonmaterial to the outcome?
Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Could you share a bit more of your kind of logic and thought process behind that statement?
Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Joe?
Joseph Nigro - Executive Vice President, Exelon; Chief Executive Officer, Constellation, Exelon Corp.: Jonathan, it's Joe. First of all, we lost over $1 billion of market cap post the announcement of that, of the inclusion of DR in 2016-2017 and 2017-2018. And we really thought it was a little bit of an overreaction. As Chris mentioned, we're disappointed in the delay, but we don't believe there's going to be a material impact to either of those transition auctions. As you're aware, DR was already included in 2018-2019 and beyond. The reason why we don't think it's a material impact in the transition auctions is really related to how the auctions themselves cleared on the base residual, and the separation in price in 2016-2017 on one side, and then the amount of DR that clears in the 2017-2018 auction, and when we put that all into our models, it's very similar to what we've read, quite frankly, from a lot of what's been written by the equity community, that it's going to be a limited impact.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you for that.
Operator: And your next question will come from the line of Julien Smith with UBS.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC: Hi. Good morning.
Jonathan W. Thayer - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP: Hey, Julien.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC: Hey. So, first quick question and it does kind of rehash a little bit here, but on the fundamental upside you're talking about, just to be clear, what does that assume in terms of retirements, just to be clear? Your own retirements, particularly as you're thinking about the life of your portfolio here in the back half of the year?
Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. We have not evaluated the potential retirement of any our assets on market-forward prices. And, so this is just based off of fundamentals of what has been announced, and what we see for retirements, what we see for the economic viability of the existing fleet in what they would have to clear to stay viable going forward. So it's not a sustainable market forward with the asset mix that's currently in. It has nothing to do with any forward decision we would make.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC: Right. So just to be clear, nuclear retirements would be incremental to your fundamental upside?
Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We don't know that. We have not analyzed it and I wouldn't want to project one way or the other. It's, there are two different things. The nuclear asset retirement is based off of the economic viability of the asset on the stand-alone. And we have had losses and free cash flow losses in the trailing five years of some significance. And we project going forward with these market forwards, them to be even worse than they were a year ago, which is driving us to make that decision. It is not based off of any potential impact on the market forwards or the rest of the fleet's viability.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC: Got it. And then two subsequent questions here. First, in terms of the FCF losses, what would you estimate those as being, both for the eastern portfolio and for the ComEd portfolio as it stands today? And then secondly, tied into that, as you evaluate the remaining life of some of these assets, would you imagine layering one announcement after another? So I suppose specifically, there's a timing issue related to ordering new cores. I imagine certain units have to get those orders in before others. Could we see one nuclear retirement and then subsequently, depending on what happens in the legislative arena, et cetera, see further announcements later this year, in trying to reconcile the bigger issues around FCF deficit?
Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. We've discussed fairly openly the units, the affected units. PJM's rules require us an earlier notification than MISO's rules. And so, we would be moving forward, if we have to, on PJM units before MISO units. We don't project a MISO decision until beginning of next year, looking at the opportunities we have with that unit either through legislation or other mechanisms, to secure the required revenues that we need there. We've talked about New York units. We're still working with our partners in our stakeholders in New York to look at, is there a viable way beyond – a reliability must-run situation to maintain economic viability there? And the final asset that's been in discussion is Oyster Creek, which we've already had an agreed-upon early retirement date at the end of 2019. So, short of the – short of a, some type of failure that was a costly failure on the unit, we would run into that period to allow adequate transition, utilization of the fuel, and adequate transition of our employee base to other facilities.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC: Got it. But just to be clear about the MISO unit there, depending on the success this year in the legislative arena, would that drive that decision?
Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It would have a – it would heavily weight our decision.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And we have time for one final question. Your final question will come from the line of Chris Turnure with JPMorgan.
Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Good morning, guys. I wanted to get a little bit more color on the Pepco approval process here, and the court challenge, than what you've already talked about. Do you have any sense of the precedent, or a precedent, for actually staying a commission order? Obviously you disagree with the merit of this case. But you do you have any precedent there, and what would be the path forward if it was not stayed, and you got the decision out of D.C.?
Darryl M. Bradford - Executive Vice President & General Counsel: Thanks. It's Darryl again. Yeah, the precedent on a stay is very clear in Maryland. It's an extraordinary remedy. It is rarely granted. You have to show a likelihood of success on the merits. And the motion does not, on the merits of the underlying merger, raise any issues whatsoever. The only issue that raises is this specious purported conflict claim, which we think is very, very weak. So, we don't think they've attempted to meet that. They would also have to show irreparable harm, which – they spend a paragraph trying to satisfy that. It's really not very persuasive, in our view. They would have to show that a stay is in the public interest. And, of course, not only has the Maryland Commission, but the New Jersey Commission, the FERC, the Delaware Commission have all found that this merger is in the public interest. And they'd also have to show that the hardships favor them, and in our pleading we lay out why disrupting – the hardship of potentially disrupting a $7 billion merger outweighs any hardships that would occur from the grant of the stay. So we think it's an extraordinary remedy. We don't think that they've come close to meeting those standards in any respect. And the law is also very clear that in Maryland, it's not a balancing. They have to satisfy each and every one of those elements, and in this case, in our view, they haven't satisfied any of them. So, that leaves us in a position where, upon D.C. approval, and assuming that the court agrees with the pleading we filed yesterday and doesn't grant a stay, that promptly upon the D.C. Commission joining the other commissions in finding that this is in the public interest, and assuming that any conditions it imposes are not unduly burdensome, that we would close promptly.
Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Great. That's very helpful. And then, is there – or my understanding is that D.C. has to rule by the end of August. Is there any flexibility around that timing? Can they extend that again?
Darryl M. Bradford - Executive Vice President & General Counsel: Yeah. There is no clock in D.C., so they are not under any time constraint. Generally, the D.C. Commission has ruled within 90 days of something being fully briefed and submitted to them. This was fully briefed at the end of May. So that 90 days would end at the end of August. I think that's where that date comes from. Obviously, we're hopeful that sooner is better than later, but that will be up to the D.C. Commission, and they'll rule when they have finished their work. They are, I think, acutely aware that a lot of people are looking for a decision from them, and they understand that. But they will take the time that they deem necessary in order to do their job right.
Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And then if I could, real quick, Joe, I just wanted to follow up, you've mentioned lack of liquidity in the forward markets a couple of times on the call here. Is this a lack of liquidity that exceeds just the general nature of these markets and what you've seen historically? Has that increased, and if that is the case, do you have an opinion as to why there might be so few trades going on out there?
Joseph Nigro - Executive Vice President, Exelon; Chief Executive Officer, Constellation, Exelon Corp.: Yeah, I think it's probably worse than it has been historically. And I think some of it is, there is just no natural buyers out on, that far out on the forward curve, as I said. The back end of the forward curve was dropped much more than in like 2016, where there were more natural buyers, whether we talk about retail or speculators or other participants. So I think with some of the folks that used to participate in the markets not doing that, some on the banking side and others, I think it's had a material impact.
Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. And that will conclude today's conference call. We appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Britney and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Quarter One 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Francis Idehen, you may begin your conference.
Francis Idehen: Thank you, Britney. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining for our first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Leading the call today are Chris Crane, Exelon’s President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Thayer, Exelon’s Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by other members of Exelon’s senior management team who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. We issued our earning release this morning along with a presentation, each of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of Exelon’s website. The earnings release and other matters which we discuss during today’s call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today’s material, comments made during this call and in the Risk Factors section of the 10-K, which we filed in February as well as in the earnings release and the 10-Q which we expect to file later today. Please refer to the 10-K, today’s 8-K and 10-Q and Exelon’s other fillings for a discussion of factors that may cause the results to differ from management’s projections, forecasts, and expectations. Today’s presentation also includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for a reconciliation between non-GAAP measures to the nearest equivalent GAAP measures. We have scheduled 45 minutes for today’s call. I will now turn the call over to Chris Crane, Exelon’s CEO.
Christopher Crane: Thank you, Francis. And good morning everyone, thanks for joining the call. Before I go into the prepared remarks, I want to first start by addressing the situation in Baltimore. As a company with a significant presence in Baltimore monitoring the unrest with great concern, as you know, Maryland’s Governor Larry Hogan has declared a state of an emergency and Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake has declared a city-wide curfew until next week. We join the rest of the business community in recognizing the issues that Baltimore is dealing with and needs to address so the city can – this great city can heal itself to get back on to economic growth for all. Moving on to the quarter, I am very pleased with our financial performance. We delivered earnings of $0.71 per share, surpassing our guidance range of $0.60 to $0.70. And Jack is going to describe our performance in greater detail. I would like to focus my remarks on our priorities in how we are strategically pursuing value for customers and shareholders. We continue to operate in a challenging market environment, particularly on the generation side of our business, but our gen to load match strategy continues to create value as seen in the first quarter hedge disclosure. Our advocacy efforts are focused on creating our channels to capture value for our communities and customers we serve and for our shareholders. I’ll touch on those directly. In our regulated business, we’re redefining the role of the utility of the future, in part by making needed infrastructure investments to modernize the grid. Over the next five years, our LRP has $16 billion of capital that will create approximately 6% CAGR with another potential $7 billion at PHI. Installing smart meter technology to enable customers to make informed choices about their energy consumption and promoting energy efficiency investments in innovation and resilient technologies at our utilities is a way that is progressive and equitable across all customer types. You can see this reflected in the energy plan for Illinois future build that we recently proposed through ComEd and Illinois. With these efforts we’re bringing improvements to the lives of the customers in a way that creates value for the company. Our merchant business faced challenges primarily due to policies and market design shortcomings that have failed to fairly value the benefits of nuclear. As a result, we focused our advocacy efforts on ensuring reliable, environmental and economical benefits of nuclear power are not taken for granted and that these plants are operated on a level playing field. In Illinois, we are working with state legislators on the low carbon portfolio standard that values each of these benefits. The bill unanimously was approved by the Center Energy Panel and the Public Utilities Committee and will now go to the Senate forward. We hope the same will happen in the House and that the bill will be approved within this legislative session. From a reliability perspective, we are pleased that FERC has granted the waiver to allow PJM to delay the capacity auction in order to further review PJM’s CP proposal. It is clear from this action that FERC appreciates that the old rules are not sufficient to ensure reliability and the changes must be made. We look forward to a positive outcome. We continue to work through the process of finalizing a contract with RG&E for our Ginna facility. As these events play out, we’ve continued our best operating the plants and the utilities at high levels of efficiency, engineering our generation output through strong portfolio management while we expand our footprint and our profits in retail power and gas operations. As you can see, we are doing things on both sides of our business, we’re tapping into multiple channels to create upside and drive value for our customers and for our investors. This leads me to our proposed merger with PHI. As you know, we’ve obtained regulatory approval from FERC Virginia and New Jersey, we’ve reached a global settlement in Delaware that is pending Commission approval. That leaves Maryland and the District of Columbia. In Maryland, we’ve reached a partial settlement with several critical parties that has been presented to – we presented that settlement to the Maryland Public Service Commission and expect a decision from them on May 15. In the District, we’ve completed our evidentiary hearings and we’re now filing briefs and the Commission will comments its deliberations. We have said from the beginning that this merger and the commitments we have made clearly demonstrate this merger is in the public interest and should be approved by the regulatory commissions. While there is no guarantee that the Public Service Commission will approve the proposal and that there is no guarantee they will not impose conditions that would frustrate the transaction, we believe that the settlement and commitments that we are made in the proceeding are more than meet the statutory requirements for the merger approval and we will look forward to orders approving the merger. We expect the merger to close late in the second quarter or in the third. In summary, we’re creating value today while actively pursuing public policy changes that recognize the benefits provided by our clean reliable assets and we’re working on all those fronts. I’ll now turn it over to Jack who will cover the financial performance for the quarter.
Jack Thayer: Thank you, Chris, and good morning everyone. We had a strong first quarter to start the year. My remarks will cover our financial results for the quarter, second quarter guidance range and update our hedge disclosures and cash outlook. I’ll start off with slide 4. Starting with our first quarter results on slide 4, Exelon exceeded our guidance range and delivered earnings of $0.71 per share. At Exelon Generation, once again we realized the benefits of our generation to load matching strategy. Quarter after quarter this strategy has paid dividends in a broad array of market conditions. During the first quarter, despite experiencing lower power prices than during the same period in 2014, we benefited from a lower cost to serve customers. We are realizing strong margins in our load business from contracts we executed last year after the Polar Vortex. In addition, our gas business performed above our expectations during the quarter due to favorable weather. While our nuclear plants performed better than they did at this time last year, we did have some nuclear outages that negatively impacted our quarterly earnings by approximately $0.04 relative to plan. That being said, we continue to push our plants to perform at our standard highest levels of performance. Our portfolio management team performed strongly and was able to more than offset these losses. On balance, Generation earned $0.35 per share during the quarter. Exelon’s utilities delivered combined earnings of $ 0.39 per share, an $ 0.08 increase over the first quarter of last year. Although we did not see a repeat of the Polar Vortex of 2014, with sustained extreme cold and wind, we faced a very cold winter with heating degree days 14% to 19% above normal in ComEd’s and PECO’s service territories. In fact, it was colder in Philadelphia this winter than the previous winter. Cold weather, a lack of severe storms and increased distribution rates of BGE drove utility results this quarter. More detail on quarter over quarter driver of utilities can be found in the appendix on slide 16. For the second quarter, we are providing guidance of $ 0.45 per share to $ 0.55 per share. This compares with our realized earnings of $0.51 per share in the second quarter of 2014. We are reaffirming our full-year guidance of $ 2.25 to $ 2.55 per share. Since our last call both PECO and ComEd have filed rate cases this year. On March 27, PECO filed an electric distribution rate case with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission requesting a $190 million revenue increase and a 10.95% return on equity. This is PECO’s first rate case filing since 2010 and the first time filing based on a fully projected future test year. In addition, if the PAPUC approves the new System 2020 plan, an additional $275 million will be spent during the next five years to install advanced equipment and reinforce the local electric system, making it more weather resistant and less vulnerable to storm damage. We expect the PAPUC to rule by the end of the year on the rate case and System 2020 plan with new rates going into effect in January 2016. On April 15, ComEd filed its annual formula rate filing with the Illinois Commerce Commission. ComEd requested a revenue decrease of $50 million. This reduction is a result of a continued focus on cost management and operational efficiencies that are being realized from a stronger more reliable grid with fewer outages. EIMA and the smart grid investments are working. Since 2012, there have been more than 3.3 million avoided customer interruptions including 1.2 million in 2014, due largely to increased investments in distribution automation or digital smart switches that automatically route power around problem areas. Outage will save customers an estimated $175 million. More detail on each of these rate cases can be found in the appendix on slides 20 through 22. I’ll now turn to our first quarter gross margin update on slide 5. During the quarter, we saw a drop in natural gas prices, while power prices were steady and heat rates expanded further. The market is finally incorporating the change in the generation stack due to coal retirements as evidenced by the heat rate seen today. Approximately 10 gigawatts of coal plants that PJM have or will retire this year with the majority of retirements occurring in April and May. We hedged closed to a ratable amount during the quarter in both in Mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions. At the end of the quarter, for 2016 and 2017, we remain considerably behind ratable in the Midwest where we continue to see upside. Total gross margin is unchanged, relatively unchanged across 2015 through 2017 from our fourth quarter disclosures. As I mentioned, Constellation had a good quarter and executed $200 million in power new business and $100 million in non-power new business. In addition, we’ve raised our power new business target by $100 million because we have line of sight for continued success in the balance of the year. This increase was offset by our nuclear outages resulting in a net $50 million improvement in 2015 total gross margin. Slide 6 provides an update on our cash flow expectations for this year, projected cash from operations of $6.7 billion. I’d like to point out that we have increased our CapEx projections at ComEd by $200 million. In finalizing the investment plan for 2015, ComEd identified incremental opportunity to invest in infrastructure, including grid resiliency and security, storm hardening and smart grid. These investments will continue to improve the reliability of ComEd's system. As a reminder, the appendix includes several schedules that will help you in your modeling efforts. Thank you. And we will now open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Daniel Eggers with Credit Suisse.
Daniel Eggers: I have been hearing a lot of concerns about the Pepco acquisition and probably some of the Maryland comments, both out of the MEA and the Governor's office. Can you just kind of share your thoughts on how you guys addressed maybe the market power considerations or issues that are raised and how you guys moved past that to get this deal done?
Christopher Crane: There are some that have mentioned a loss of competition and as all know, Pepco, Maryland and BG&E do not compete. Each of these will be standalone in the future as they are now. Rate cases will be decided by the Public Utility Commission in Maryland. We work at the will of the Commission. The benefits that we show by bringing PHI into the Exelon Utilities with best practice sharing being able to leverage procurement and the commitments that we made we think meet the test of best – to the benefit of the consumer. And so the Governor has not taken that position. The Governor has stayed neutral since as he said he has come into this late in the process. So there was rumors that he was against it, that was clarified with the letter that he sent to the Commission saying he has faith in the Commission that they will do the right thing and he is neither for or against, he is neutral on it. And that’s the support that we have gotten from Montgomery County and Prince George's County is significant. Those were the major customer bases, the majority of the Maryland customers are and we have a strong support from both counties.
Daniel Eggers: I guess just to play devil's advocate, but if Pepco were not to fill, you guys have funded the equity component of that transaction well in advance. How would you guys use that capital if you ended up having it back to deploy in a different direction?
Jack Thayer: Obviously, we don't anticipate that to happen. We anticipate getting a successful outcome here. To the extent that the terms of approval were onerous or we were rejected outright, we would look to cash settle the equity, the forwards that we had issued and we would look to utilize the capital raised from the convertibles to either fund growth at the business or return value to shareholders through other means.
Daniel Eggers: I guess just one last question on the prioritization of capital. Obviously the ERCOT CCGTs are out there, but there has been more conversation about prospect of the LNG project that you guys are an early investor in as well as these stories about the UK office. Can you just clarify how you guys are prioritizing those capitals and maybe address any of the issues that might be around what we have been hearing in the media?
Christopher Crane: You can see based off of our capital spend, our highest priority is in the regulated investments. We’re making, as I said, $16 billion of investment over the next five years with another potential $7 billion with Pepco being PHI coming in. So that is, we see is a good solid investment needed for the infrastructure for the customers and benefit the shareholders. The CCGTs in Texas are still a very good investment, very positive NPV. It continues to match our generation to load strategy as we continue to grow that load book in Texas in ERCOT. We said at the beginning we are getting these at very good terms, they are under $700 a KW on our brownfield site where we will have expense advantages combining them with our existing facilities. And the nature of those plants, the efficiency and the flexibility of them, they will dispatch well in that ERCOT market. So that’s still a positive investment. [ANOVA] is a good, strong option. We’re the fifth largest in handling merchant gas. We have core competencies around our gas portfolio and continuing to grow out the gas business is a logical move, we believe. But the nature of that project is it would be a contracted long-term type arrangement that de-risks it significantly. If we are successful in obtaining contracts and permits, then we would make the investment to continue to develop out our gas business. So that’s the strategy around utilities. The strategy around competitive electric and gas continue to be the primary. The story in the UK is not an equity story at all. Exelon Nuclear Partners has been invited into the bidding process to be the operator on a couple of projects potentially in the UK. We have a very small office that we rent month to month that those folks are working out of. Part of the process of doing that is understanding more the UK market, so there has been some due diligence around that, but we have no plans right now on becoming an equity owner in the UK at this point. Those were clarification needed to be made.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.
Jonathan Arnold: Just a quick one on Illinois. Chris, you were saying you still think you are hopeful that you will get things across the finish line in the spring session. There has been talk that there might be slippage into the veto session and obviously with the PJM auction delayed maybe the state would want to wait, see the outcome. What’s behind your conviction that we’re still on for the spring?
Christopher Crane: There is a hearing today that we’ll be continuing to address the issue. So it is being discussed, it’s being worked even with all of the other business that has been going on in Springfield around budgets. So as I said, we got strong support, unanimous support out of the Senate Energy and Public Utilities Committee in March, unanimous, and there is hearings on both the House and Senate this week to continue to discuss it. So we remain positive, cautious but positive that we will be able to get something through in this session. If we don't and the likelihood is that we’re not going to get a bill and we have to address the long-term profitability of the units and we’ll decide that as we see the legislative session end.
Jonathan Arnold: One other issue, Dan asked about the UK and you responded about the nuclear operator bidding process. There was also a story that you’d been linked to looking at an investment in a CCGT which appear to be similar next-generation technology like you are working on in Texas, any comments on that?
Christopher Crane: Yes, I learned about that when you did in the clippings. So there is market intelligence that’s going on at a lower level in the organization, but there is no plans to enter into equity positions at this point in the UK.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI.
Greg Gordon: Your expected generation guidance for 2015 to 2017 in New England is 2x, 2x plus today versus what it was in the fourth quarter release. You haven't acquired any assets, so can you explain how you’ve been able to double your expected generation in that market and the flow through impact it is having on your expected gross margin which looks like it’s up marginally over the next two years, but then down marginally in 2017?
Joseph Nigro: I will speak to that and you are right you noticed that our expected generation in New England in all years has increased appreciably and as such, the generation percentage hedge has declined with that increased output of generation. Very simply, we had disclosed in Q4 2013 that we had worked with a field supplier to restructure a contract that we have. And if you remember back then, our generation had dropped by about 50% in that quarter-over-quarter at that time. That contract restructuring has been terminated and it will be effective at the end of June this year and the contract itself will revert back to its original terms and conditions. It has two impacts. One, you’re seeing the generation impact and the hedge percentage impact and the notification of that termination was at the end of the first quarter this year. So really you’re seeing it flow through on an immediate basis. The gross margin impact was very minimal across the horizon. And as such, just mechanically when you look at the hedge disclosure, the dollars of the termination of the contract restructuring as well as the increased value of the generation output and the margin associated with that is all flowing through the open gross margin line and it’s very minimal. So really it is a volume change that you see with a little dollar impact.
Greg Gordon: So then what’s the economic rationale for termination if it’s more or less NPV neutral? Are these fuel contracts for gas plants that have optionality associated with price volatility, are they baseload? Why would you terminate that contract if it wasn't increasing NPV appreciably?
Joseph Nigro: I can't say too much due to the confidentiality of the nature of the agreement, but what I will say is the contract termination was the right of the supplier held that right. And from our perspective, as I said, the impact economically was very muted. I can't speak to the supplier's perspective on why they terminated it, but it’s related to a long-term supply arrangement that we have.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: I wanted to focus on the CP product if you could. First, with regards to your expectations on the future retirements, I’m curious, do you see these CP product as proposed, driving retirements as you go to 100% CP market? Is that conceivable and what kind of units? And then subsequently obviously with Supreme Court here waiting on the DR decision, how do you see that ultimately impacting the base of CP products of any eventual auction here? Does it appreciably impact CP or is it more of an impact from the base auction?
Joseph Nigro: I think to your first question around retirements, we don't see a material impact. I think the rationale is first and foremost obviously to improve the reliability on the system and to do that you need a couple of, you can go about that a couple of ways. One is the hardening of the units themselves which have a cost associated with it. The second thing is to make sure you have firm fuel on-site for these units and there is a cost to do that. When you look at the economics of all of that, we don't believe there is going to be a material impact to retirement. I will sit here and say though given this structure that’s been laid out if it is implemented, I would expect that you would see an increased risk premium effectively in the marketplace given the fact that the penalty structure is changing rightfully so to ensure reliability. But I don't think outright there will be material impact on the retirement side.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: And on demand response?
Joseph Nigro: I guess from a DR perspective, there is a lot of flux around the rules, but sitting here looking at this auction, we would expect to see the demand response activity will continue in the way it has. And then as rule changes through time, if the change, whether it becomes a retail product as opposed to a wholesale product, we will have to see how that plays out.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: And then just turning to the renewables business, obviously the yieldco phenomenon continues to evolve. Have you given more thought about the degree to which this business is core as we’ve seen the market evolve?
Christopher Crane: Julien, with respect to the renewables part of our business?
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Exactly, just not with creating a structure yourself, but ultimately whether you could garner better value in the public markets of late?
Christopher Crane: As you know, we have an extensive business both on the solar as well as wind renewables part of our business. And how we have improved the returns on that business over the last number of years has been through the extensive use of project financing as a means of returning capital to the corporate coffers to reinvest either in the growth of the utilities or fund some of our other expansionary efforts around. As an example, the peaker that we are building in New England or the combined cycles we are building in Texas. Certainly, we do watch and we do evaluate and consider the potential impact of value that a yieldco could have on our assets from the perspective of yieldcos as potential buyers of those assets or through the potential to create our own yieldco. And we continue to evaluate that within our project financing efforts. We have retained that option to be able to do that. I think one of the key elements though to a successful strategy around yieldcos is having a significant and visible pipeline of assets that you could drop down. And we have I think a good amount of assets. We have elements like our ANOVA LNG facility that if we decide to pursue that and we had a long-term off take agreement that would provide attractive revenues that could fit in that type of structure. But at this point we don't have any plans to pursue such a structure and continue to have a candidly wait and see approach.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: So more of a retain the business, build it out and then see down the line rather than monetize it?
Christopher Crane: Absolutely. So you see us continuing to deploy wind investments. We have a project that we’re developing down in Texas, Laredo. You continue to see us work down a path on the ANOVA LNG project to secure a long-term off take and you see us continue – through our Constellation business continue to pursue opportunities to grow the solar side of our business.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Neel Mitra with Tudor, Pickering.
Neel Mitra: I was wondering on the holdco side, how much more debt are you able to support after the Pepco acquisition closes now that you are more regulated?
Christopher Crane: Neel, as you know, we have significant debt issuance forthcoming that will be used to finance at the holding company, the PHI transaction that we would look to bring to market once we have visibility around a successful path in Maryland. We continue to evaluate the balance sheet capacity and the space that we have at that holding company. As you know, we’ve said we will utilize that holding company as a potential vehicle to finance regulated growth. I think an important element to this is the interplay between the growing earnings mix of our utilities business relative to our merchant exposure on how the rating agencies perceive us. And so to the extent that the rating agencies continue to evolve in their thinking around the risks embedded in our business and see us as a less risky credit, I would say that is the biggest mover of balance sheet capacity. Obviously, some elements around whether it’s capacity performance, the Illinois Clean Energy Legislation that would be additive to the company's cash flow and earnings would also be helpful to our ability to add further leverage to the holding company.
Neel Mitra: And then assuming Pepco closes, what’s the latest update as to when the dividend is fully funded by the regulated side?
Christopher Crane: So we project that towards the latter part of the decade into 2020 timeframe, but we will continue to evaluate that based off of rate case outcomes.
Jack Thayer: That’s specific to – from a free cash flow standpoint, the utilities being able to not just from a payout ratio standpoint, but from a free cash flow funding standpoint, Chris’ point on the latter part of the decade is when that cash would be available to potentially consider growing the dividend.
Neel Mitra: And then last on the Illinois legislation, if something isn't reached by the end of May, what are the options to maybe keep the process going through 2015 or is it kind of done through the rest of the year if you don't have an outcome by May?
William Von Hoene: We expect the session, this is Bill Von Hoene, to conclude at the end of May. It conceivably could be extended if the budget impasse continues. It’s unlikely that the energy legislation would be considered during that period of time. There is a six-day session, veto session in November and into early December which requires a super majority on any votes that pass during that period of time. So that would be the next time the legislature would convene after the conclusion of this regular session.
Neel Mitra: And a super majority would require a 60% vote, is that correct?
William Von Hoene: That’s correct.
Christopher Crane: The point on that though in May of 2014, we committed not to make any decisions based off of economics for a year. We’re coming to the end of that year and we need to make decisions that start the planning process if we do not see a success path.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski with Macquarie.
Angie Storozynski: So wanted to focus again on Illinois, so it seems like you guys are bullish energy prices in Illinois and that’s why you are not hedging much of your portfolio. You are also bullish on capacity prices. At the recent PJM, you just had this spike in MISO capacity prices. So how does it all add up because on the one hand if capacity prices rise then you have less of a volatility on peak [indiscernible] potentially lower heat rates. So how does it reconcile with your outlook on heat rates?
Joseph Nigro: I think what I would say is if we talk just about energy prices in Northern Illinois for a minute, using prices as of the end of the quarter, we do still see heat rate expansion. We don't think the market has priced in all the upside really driven by the back of the change in dispatch stack. And if you think about two different timeframes like 2016, 2017, we probably see less upside than we do when you get out to the 2018, 2019 time period and it’s probably to the tune of $1 to $2 accordingly. Just as importantly, we also have a view that we think natural gas is underpriced at this point which in addition to that would drive prices higher net-net because you would see a slight heat rate decline with the rise in natural gas. But net-net, it would be a positive outcome. And your point is right that from a hedging perspective, we continue to remain behind our ratable hedging plan in the Midwest to the tune of about 10% in 2016 and 2017 approximately just given those views.
Angie Storozynski: And you also think that the carbon legislation in Illinois is not going to have any negative impact on forward energy prices in Illinois?
Joseph Nigro: No, we don't.
Angie Storozynski: Secondly, in ERCOT, you keep saying that you have a cost advantage for the new build and you clearly do. But forward curves are showing on peak spark spreads of $15, $16, so the conclusion or your dedication to the project is driven by your outlook on where these spark spreads are going to go as opposed to what we’re seeing? And so can you give us at least a sense what kind of spark spreads you are assuming in your calculations when you think that the IRR of the projects is still interesting?
Kenneth Cornew: We continue to be comfortable with our investment in these plants because as Chris said, the cost advantage, the technology advantage meaning the heat rate efficiencies and the responsiveness of the plants. We’ve seen spark spreads bounce around a lot in ERCOT. The lack of volatility recently has driven them down. Our long-term fundamental views are what I would say conservative and we’re still confident in the investments, very confident actually.
Operator: And your final question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.
Shar Pourreza: Just sticking with the RSSA with Ginna, is there an update on the filing? And then just counter with the EDF put option, how should we think about under an assumption that you may own the remaining portion of this plan, is there an option that you can get an expanded RSSA contract if the timing works?
William Von Hoene: The RSSA contract was approved by FERC effective April 1, but with two adjustments being required in the contract which have been sent back and a compliance filing will be made by Ginna to reflect that. Then there will be a process by which the contract itself will be evaluated and potentially settled through a FERC procedure. So that is going to go forward for probably the balance of the year based upon precedent in other circumstances, although the ability to collect on a cost based rate is effective now. The put is exercisable by EDF January 1, 2016. We do not know and don't speculate as to what would happen in connection with that. With regard to the potential extension of the RSSA agreement, it’s predicated on the period of time that’s necessary for the New York system to find alternative ways to deliver the same reliability that Ginna currently is required to deliver. So we would not anticipate in the absence of the failure of the New York system to do so that there would be any basis for extension of the agreement.
Shar Pourreza: And then just one lastly, sticking with the Illinois carbon portfolio, have you quantified what could potentially be available under the cap using let's say the 2014 rates? And then additionally, am I correct to assume that there is an opportunity to breach that cap if somehow credits are being constrained?
William Von Hoene: No, the cap is the same essentially 2% cap that goes on energy efficiency in RPS, and I think that’s been calculated by a number of folks. There is no provision by which the cap could be breached under the legislation as it’s currently proposed.
Shar Pourreza: And then you haven't quantified what could be available under the program using pre-existing rates, right?
William Von Hoene: No, we have not.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.
Paul Ridzon: A quick question on Illinois, with the Attorney General's office kind of weighing in on the MISO auction, is that entering the discussion in the Legislature?
Christopher Crane: There has been attention not surprisingly to the MISO auction in connection with the Legislative deliberations and I think it’s relevant in the minds of a number of legislators. From our standpoint, however, it has virtually no impact on the health of our plants. The Clinton plant which was a price taker in the auction and which had sold in advance a significant portion of the power that benefited the auction results is only about $13 million. So that’s far short of what would be necessary and doesn't obviate the need for the low carbon portfolio standard for that plant or elsewhere.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust.
Ali Agha: I wanted to clarify, I may have missed this, I think you were mentioning that. On the forward prices versus fundamental view, if I heard you right, you said you thought Midwest was probably about $2 lower than what the fundamental view would be? I wanted to confirm that and what’s thinking on mid-Atlantic for PJM right now, forward versus fundamental?
Joseph Nigro: What I said was there’s two components to our view. The first is just fundamentally we still expect to see heat rate expansion in Northern Illinois across the time horizon. So if you look at calendar 2016, 2017 and beyond, we would expect to see heat rate expansion and that’s probably in that $1 to $2 range. But additionally, we see gas price upside which would also increase the power price beyond that upside. So that would effectively raise the heat rates as well and/or effectively raise the power price as well. So there are two components to our view and as such, we’re behind our ratable plan in 2016 and 2017 from a hedging perspective to the tune of approximately 10%. And it’s important to note that there is some seasonality associated with that in our hedging profile within a given year reflects that, meaning we see time buckets that are more valuable relative to the market than others. On the West upside, we see that heat rates and power prices are generally in line with our fundamental forecast and we don't see quite as much opportunity, but again there is seasonality associated with that and our hedging profile takes that into account.
Ali Agha: Joe, one other thing, on the retail side, a quick update on the competitive environment and the $2 to $4 margin that we’ve historically been benchmarking just to give us a sense of where we are as new contracts are rolling in?
Joseph Nigro: I think in general, our load business has done very well whether we’re talking about our retail book of business on the commercial and industrial side or our polar procurement business on the wholesale side. After the Polar Vortex last year, we saw, I would say folks may be pricing the risk more prudently from our perspective as it relates to managing a retail contract. That’s one element of it. And then from the margin perspective using that $2 to $4 benchmark that you laid out there, we’re well in line in the range of that $2 to $4 whereas we were sitting here a year and a half ago we’re struggling to be even at the low end of that range. So we’ve seen improvement across the board both from a risk pricing perspective and a margin improvement perspective in our load business from both wholesale and retail.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Travis Miller with Morningstar.
Travis Miller: This is a bit of a follow-up to that last question, but how long do you expect this magnitude of the load matching benefit that you got in this quarter to extend? Can we think about this extending through the full-year and beyond or was there something in the quarter that gave you even more benefit on the load matching side relative to what we could see later in the year?
Joseph Nigro: I think there's a couple of answers to that question and I think the most important one is we’re seeing the changeover in the generation stack that we expected to see with retirements and low gas prices and you’ve seen the heat rate expansion that we have been talking about for some time. I think in addition to that, I think what you’re going to see going forward is increased volatility and both upside volatility and downside volatility. And I think that has an impact on load following contracts because you need to make sure that they are priced accordingly. So we have got the benefit of, I would call it, lower load serving cost in the first quarter and they’ve come down on a mark to market basis for the balance of the year. But our expectation is given that market volatility we would expect to see that that would pass through to continuing to see appropriate risk premiums in our load serving business and appropriate margins.
Operator: And your final question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.
Michael Lapides: Just want to circle back a little bit on PJM. We keep seeing a lot of announcements or people attempting to get new combined cycles built. We’ve obviously had a lot to clear over the last few years, gas base is still pretty low meaning it is still pretty wide in parts of PJM relative to where Henry Hub is or even where TETCO is. Just curious your kind of multi-year thoughts about whether lots of plants actually do get built, meaning or do a lot just kind of disappear by the wayside? And what this means not only for – your view of are we kind of at new build economics in PJM? Does the concept of building merchant combined cycle in PGM makes sense to you here? Just kind of broader thinking about gas plant economics in that market.
Joseph Nigro: There is a couple of questions there. Let me try to pick them off one by one. I think the first one is as it relates to the turnover of the [indiscernible] stack, I think it’s clear that we’re going to see retirements of generation assets. In our fundamental modeling, we have an add back of an appreciable number of gas-fired generators in PJM with most of them on the eastern side of PJM because that is where the economics are more favorable than toward a territory like NiHub for example. You are talking about a long-term investment asset with a build of a combined cycle plant and you are looking at a market with spark spreads that’s a much shorter dated time horizon. In PJM, unlike some of the other markets, the capacity price comes into play and is part of the equation. Clearly, we don't see new build economics work on the Western side of PJM. On the Eastern side of PJM, it’s a much more marginal exercise. I think where spark spreads are and where capacity prices if you use last year as a benchmark for example, I think you could say that's a marginal calculation. There was some talk if you go back a year ago that people were going to be able to lock in gas contracts for 20 years at well under Henry Hub at M3 gas or mid-Atlantic type gas. I would tell you I haven't seen that and I don't think that is going to be the case, so there is an element of making sure that you understand what the dynamics of the cost of production are as well. But I think net-net fundamentally, what we see is a turnover of stack. Our fundamental forecast reflects that so we have an appreciable add back of combined cycle plants and when we take that all into account, as I said previously, we still see upside to the heat rate in NiHub and we are generally in line with where the market heat rate is at West hub.
Michael Lapides: One real quick follow-up if you don't mind. You all talked a little bit about what the resolution on nuclear fuel means. Can you talk about what that means for fuel costs on a per megawatt hour basis for a typical nuclear plant? Like how material is the change on a dollar per megawatt hour? Are we talking $0.05 or $0.50, just trying to get my arms around it.
Christopher Crane: You’re talking about the DOE fee?
Michael Lapides: Yes, please.
Christopher Crane: It's a little less than $1 a megawatt.
Michael Lapides: Got it, $1 a megawatt hour, so something that may have been 750-ish is now well below 7?
Christopher Crane: Yes.
Operator: I would now like to turn the call back over to Francis for closing remarks.
Francis Idehen: Thank you, Britney. This concludes our first quarter call. Thank you everyone for joining us this morning.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining for our Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Leading the call today are Chris Crane, Exelon’s President and Chief Executive Officer; Jack Thayer, Exelon’s Chief Financial Officer; Joe Nigro, CEO of Constellation; and Bill Von Hoene, Exelon’s Chief Strategy Officer. They are joined by other members of Exelon’s senior management team who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. We issued our earning release this morning along with a presentation, each of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of Exelon’s website. The earnings release and other matters that we discuss during today’s call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could defer from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today’s material and comments made during this call and in the Risk Factors section of the earnings release and the 10-K, which we expect to file later today. Please refer to today’s 8-K and the 10-K and Exelon’s other fillings for a discussion of factors that may cause the results to differ from management’s projections, forecasts, and expectations. Today’s presentation also includes references to adjusted opening earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for a reconciliation between the non-GAAP measures to the nearest equivalent GAAP measures. We have scheduled 60 minutes for today’s call. I will now turn the call over to Chris Crane, Exelon’s CEO.
Chris Crane: Good morning and thanks for everybody joining. We had another strong year of operations in 2014, which we are very pleased with given the challenging weather conditions at the start of the year. At the utilities, each OpCo achieved top decile performance for safety and top quartile performance for outage frequency and duration. The nuclear fleet ended the year at 94.2% capacity factor, which this marks our 15th year in a row being over 92%. Gas and hydro power dispatch match was at 97% and our renewable energy capture was at 95%. On the financial side, we delivered $2.39 a share in line with our recent year full year guidance. Exelon Generation delivered a strong year for performance in what was a volatile year and our generation to load matching strategy drove strong results during an unexpected mild summer. The utilities performed well in light of severe storms and continuing challenging interest rate environment. 2014 was an active year for us. In addition to selling several assets, we continue the process of recycling capital and strengthening our balance sheet. I will highlight some of our major investments for the year. We grew across the enterprise. From the utility growth perspective, we announced the PHI merger and continued on with our infrastructure upgrade plant spending $3.1 billion of utility investment. On the merchant side, we announced the state-of-the-art CCGT newbuild in ERCOT and we added 215 megawatts in nuclear, wind and solar capacity during the year. At Constellation on the retail side, we completed the acquisition of Integrys retail and ProLiance. We also made investments in adjacent markets in emerging technology to continue to prepare for an evolving marketplace. Bloom Energy and our micro grid investments are good examples of that. We also have a number of major regulatory developments in 2014 that affect both the utilities and the generating business. On the generating side, we have seen progress in Illinois nuclear discussions, with four reports released last month, which highlights the reliability, the economic and the environmental benefits of the nuclear plants to the state. PJM capacity performance proposal has been submitted to FERC. We strongly support the steps being taken to ensure reliability in the region. We expect a continuing discussion on the EPA’s Clean Power Plan over the next several months. On the utility front, we had two positive outcomes for ComEd and BGE rate cases. ComEd received 95% or more from our ask on the last three consecutive rate cases. And BGE achieved its first settlement since 1999. And these outcomes highlight our continued commitment to the customers we serve. Bill is going to go into greater detail on the efficacy issues towards the end of the call. These policy initiatives on the horizon present a potential material upside to earnings as value of our fleet is more appropriately recognized by the market. However, I do want to underscore that the management team is focused on EPS growth and our capital deployment efforts. We invest in prudent growth of the utilities where we can add value for our customers. And within our merchant business we look for opportunities to earn robust financial returns. Our recent announcement announced a Peaker in New England is a great example of that. Our continued investments in both utilities and the generation businesses, demonstrates our commitment to long-term growth initiatives across the enterprise that will bring value to our customers and drive future earnings. Now let me turn it over to Jack to discuss our financial expectations for 2015.
Jack Thayer: Thank you, Chris and good morning everyone. We provided information on our fourth quarter financial results in the appendix of today’s materials on Slides 17 and 18. I will spend my time this morning on 2015 earnings guidance and our O&M forecast. Turning to Slide 3, we expect to deliver adjusted operating earnings in the $2.25 to $2.55 range, which is the same as our 2014 guidance and earnings of $0.60 to $0.70 per share for the first quarter. Our guidance does not include the earnings from the Pepco Holdings acquisition, but does reflect all asset divestitures to-date. As you know we sold several assets last year, the proceeds of which are being used to partially finance the PHI acquisition and to recycle capital on the merchant side of our business. The lost contributions from these divestitures results in an earnings impact of $0.12 per share relative to last year. In future years there is minimal earnings impact, in particular as capacity revenue from Keystone and Conemaugh runs off. The modest lost earnings from the divested plants will be meaningfully offset by the accretion from our Pepco merger and earnings from other growth projects. For 2015, the earnings impact from these divestitures of $0.12, combined with an additional refueling outage at nuclear of $0.02 and the increased pension and OPEB cost at ExGen of $0.02 are modestly offset by higher capacity prices of $0.07. The full year benefit of the elimination of the DOE fee at Exelon Nuclear of $0.04 and by higher earnings at ComEd of $0.03. As you know at EEI we gave earnings projections for Exelon for three utilities through 2017. Since that time, we have adjusted the midpoints of that guidance down by a total of $0.05 per share due to the impacts of treasury yields at ComEd and bonus depreciations impact on EPS. We still expect a healthy 5% to 6% CAGR on utility earnings from 2014 to 2017 and the cash benefits from bonus depreciation will help to accelerate and fund utility investments. For reference and deeper analysis more detail on the year-over-year drivers by operating company can be found in the appendix on Slides 19 through 22. As Chris mentioned our capital investment plan is significant and positions us to grow earnings over time. Over the next 5 years we are investing $16 billion in capital at our existing utilities and plan for more than $6 billion of investments at the Pepco utilities. We believe these investments are prudent and will improve reliability and our customers’ experience. As you know the Pepco transaction is expected to add $0.15 to $0.20 per share of earnings on a steady state basis in 2017 and beyond. In addition to growing earnings the Pepco acquisition shifts our earnings mix to a substantially more regulated weighting with 61% to 67% of earnings coming from the regulated side in the 2016 through 2017 period. On the ExGen front our focus is deploying capital for growth that achieves attractive financial returns and generates both earnings and cash flow. These investments span the energy value chain and include conventional generation like our Texas CCGTs and a new build peaker in New England that cleared the most recent capacity auction and investments in our distributed energy platform. Above and beyond our existing plan, we see additional opportunities and the have free cash flow to deploy capital to earn attractive incremental returns on both the regulated and merchant sides of our business. Starting in 2016, we expect to have up to $1 billion in incremental annual capacity we can deploy to invest in our utilities, emerging growth and other opportunities. At the utilities, we are evaluating the potential to increase our investments in utility infrastructure, including grid resiliency and security, storm hardening, and new smart grid enabled technologies. Of course, our capital investment in the utilities has to be prudent and help meet the evolving expectations of our customers. These investments will benefit customers by improving reliability and system performance and allow them to better understand and manage their energy usage and costs. At ExGen, capital deployment across the business will be driven by the ability to earn robust financial returns. Slide 4 shows our 2015 O&M forecast relative to 2014. We project O&M for 2015 to be $7.225 billion, an increase of $275 million over 2014. The increase at ComEd and BGE is due to inflation and increased budgeting for storm costs, which results in incremental year-over-year O&M growth. ExGen’s increase is related to a combination of factors, the inclusion the three months of CENG O&M relative to 2014, an additional planned nuclear outage compared to 2014, increased pension costs and projects at Constellation and Generation, including Integrys and growth in our distributed energy business. Overall, we expect a basically flat O&M CAGR over the 2015 to 2017 period. We remain disciplined on cost even as we seek to grow our business. Since our presentation at EEI, we have increased our CapEx projections for 2015 across the company by approximately $325 million. The increase is primarily at ExGen and reflects investments to build contracted generation, including an 80-megawatt wind facility in Texas and an up to 50-megawatt biomass plant in Georgia, which we announced yesterday. Additionally, we have increased the 2015 budgeted CapEx for our Texas CCGTs, advancing the timing of the capital spend. The total cost of the project has not changed. Now, I will turn the call over to Joe Nigro for a discussion of markets and our hedge disclosures.
Joe Nigro: Thanks, Jack and good morning. The Constellation business continues to perform at high levels. We finished 2014 strong and are seeing solid results so far in 2015 as a result of our generation of load matching strategy and our ability [Technical Difficulty] to market. My comments today will address market events during the fourth quarter and what they mean for our commercial business going forward, including our hedging strategy, the New England ISO capacity market results and our updated hedge disclosures. During the fourth quarter, we experienced a decline in prices across the energy complex as oil and natural gas both realized steep losses in the spot market. Power prices followed gas lower in the second half of the quarter as expectations of extreme weather subsided. The primary driver weighing on prices was the contraction of winter premiums as the markets focus moved away from last year’s Polar Vortex and on to higher natural gas production storage estimates. NI Hub and West Hub around-the-clock prices were down $1.50 to $3 for calendar years 2016 and ‘17 from the end of the third quarter to the end of the fourth quarter. In response, we have positioned the portfolio to better align with our fundamental view that we expect to see seasonal power price subside, primarily at NI Hub and began to build a long position into the forward years. This is similar to how we positioned the portfolio the last few years when our fundamental view showed power market upside. When the market is volatile, our generation of load strategy allows us to optimize the portfolio to lock-in additional value. During the year, we aggressively pursued load-following sales when we observed appropriate risk premiums and increasing margins. We are very highly hedged in 2015 and not impacted from the large downturn in near-term power prices. In fact, we were very aggressive in hedging our PJM East and New England portfolios early in the fourth quarter when higher risk premiums were priced into the market. The remaining length in 2015 is mostly in our Midwest position and focused in the months and time buckets where we believe the forward market is undervalued. As I mentioned we began to build a long tradition in the forward years because we see upside in our view versus market. During the fourth quarter, we dropped further behind our ratable plan and added approximately 5% to our hedge percentages for 2016 and 2017 versus a normal quarter of 8% sales. The majority of our behind ratable position remains in the Midwest where we continue to see upside in power prices driven by coal retirements. Not only did we adjust our deviation to ratable during the quarter, but we also adjusted our seasonal hedging strategies holding length in undervalued month. We will continue to hold a long position based on our market views. Last year at this time we talked about hedging with natural gas to take advantage of our bullish view on heat rates. Those views have materialized over the past 12 months. And we have shifted our hedging strategy out of these cross commodity hedges in order to lock in the higher market implied heat rates. In January of last year, natural gas sales represented over 10% of our hedges. Currently they are less than 2% in any given year. Going forward our hedging strategies and positions will continue to reflect where we see upside versus current market prices both from our view of heat rate expansion and natural gas price increases. We have got a lot of questions recently on oil markets and I would like to spend a minute on what the sharp decline in pricing means for our business. We are not materially impacted by oil pricing mostly due to the fact that our gross margin is primarily driven by a large base load position. However, we do experienced some minor impacts including the potential for lower peak power pricing during heavy load conditions, the potential for lower load growth in ERCOT and lower pricing in our upstream business. The current pressure on the oil prices is more pronounced in the near-term delivery periods as longer-term prices in the $65 to $70 per barrel range still reflects global demand growth. Before I turn to our gross margin update, I want to provide you an update on the recent capacity auction in New England. On February 4, ISO New England released the results of its ninth forward capacity option for the planning year 2018-2019. The clearing price indicate that the new pay for performance capacity construct works. And will attract development of new resources needed in the region. This concludes our recently announced 195 megawatts dual fuel peaking facility at our existing West Medway site, which we expect to have online by December of 2018. Turning to Slide 6, I will review our updated hedge disclosure and the changes since the end of the third quarter. In 2015, total gross margin is unchanged. The impact of the divestiture of Keystone and Conemaugh was offset by the acquisition of Integrys and the expectation of favorable portfolio performance. We executed on a 100 million of power new business and 50 million of non-powered new business during the quarter. Based on 2015 performance to-date and the expectations for the full year, we have increased our power new business target by an additional $50 million. For 2016-2017, total gross margin decreased by $200 million and $250 million respectively largely driven by the impact of lower market prices on our open position. The divesture of Keystone and Conemaugh was offset by the addition of Integrys in these years. We also executed on 50 million of both power and non-power new business in 2016. Overall, the commercial business is performing extremely well across all of our business lines. We will continue to implement hedging strategies that reflect our fundamental view of increases in both power and natural gas markets and optimize our portfolio. Now I will turn it over to Bill.
Bill Von Hoene: Thanks very much Joe and good morning everyone. As Chris referenced in his opening statements, there are a number of developments playing out on the policy front that affect our customers are our businesses. These issues are not necessarily earnings impactful in 2015, but they may have a material impact on the company beyond this year. And so we are going to spend a few minutes this morning sharing with you our perspectives on the issues. I will start with three issues affecting the generation business in policy space. First on the capacity market reform front that Kris referenced, we have been involved in PJM’s stakeholder process to develop a proposal that will harden the power supply system to help it withstand extreme weather events and ensure reliability for customers. We believe the proposal that now sits before FERC is constructive and if approved will address the gaps in system reliability. The proposal has many similarities to the – for performance market design, which FERC approved in New England a couple of years ago. It’s a no-excuses approach that provides fair compensation to reliable assets that do perform and penalizes suppliers that do not. We think this is a win-win for our customers and for our generation business. We have invested billions of dollars in our fleet over the years to make it the most reliable set of generating assets in the country and we think that the fleet will fare well in a pay for performance system. All told, we view developments on the capacity reform front as decidedly positive and we are expecting a ruling from FERC by April 1. Second, let me talk briefly about the discussions that are ongoing in Illinois. As Chris referenced and as you all have seen by now, the state of Illinois report on potential nuclear power plant closings was issued earlier this year in response to House resolution 1146. As stated in that report, the right energy policy for Illinois should guarantee reliability and improve the environment, while creating and retaining jobs, growing the local economy and minimizing cost. It is difficult to envision such a policy, without nuclear as a critical part of the energy mix. The report offers an independent assessment of the substantial economic, environmental, and reliability benefits that Illinois’ six nuclear plants bring to the state and lays out five options to address the current situation. Establishment of the cap and trade program, imposition of a carbon tax, adoption of a low carbon portfolio standard, adoption of a sustainable power planning standard or reliance on market and external initiatives to make the corrections. We are supportive of any of the options that reward all carbon-free resources equally, but doing nothing simply is not a viable economic option if we are to maintain the operations of those plants that are at risk. As we stated repeatedly, we do not think a bailout. This is about addressing market floss to properly value resources that are of great importance to the State of Illinois. The state has an opportunity to implement, need a change and we will work with policymakers and stakeholders during the coming months to come to an appropriate conclusion soon. Third, on the generation front, a brief discussion of the environmental policy, as you know the EPA’s clean power draft was issued last year. While it is well-intentioned, it fell short in our view of addressing the importance of nuclear to achieving our national environmental goals. We continue to work on improving the plan. Notwithstanding the shortcomings of the initial proposal, however, we view the environmental discussion as progressing in the right direction. Furthermore, the EPA debate and the states roadmaps to implementing the plan are inextricably linked to the discussion around nuclear energy in Illinois that I just referenced as any solution must contemplate the state’s ability to comply and to do so cost effectively without the clean attributes of nuclear that will be impossible. The final ruling on the EPA’s plan has been pushed back to later this summer. Like many, we want clarity on the issue. However, we would rather the time be taken for the agency to get this right and design a rational emissions reduction policy for the country than to rush it through. We are confident that the EPA will issue a final rule that appropriately values our assets. The question that arises from all of these pieces is how do they fit together and will the resolution of these three policy issues translate to market-based compensation sufficient to maintain the economic viability of our challenged assets. That is what will play out over the next few months or longer. In the aggregate and individually, we view these potential policy changes as a positive driver for the Exelon fleet. If the PJM reforms are adopted, this should benefit all of our PJM nuclear assets. However, we have been clear that there is no silver bullet. Each plant has to stand on its own economic merits and it is unlikely that the PJM reforms in isolation will ensure the survival of each plant. One clear example of this is Clinton club, which is not in PJM and therefore will not be properly valued as a result of the PJM capacity market reforms. These plants need to be fairly recognized for both their unparalleled reliability and for their zero carbon attributes. Anything short of that recognition is insufficient and that is why we have been working diligently and simultaneously on all the fronts I have referenced. The fact is there is no other technology that produces reliable, zero carbon electricity. All of the alternatives are intermittent and far more expensive than keeping these plants in operation. Our customers will pay more if these assets are retired prematurely and need to be placed. We think policymakers get this and also understand what it means to lose these plants in terms of jobs and costs. We are optimistic that they will take the steps needed to ensure fair treatment of the units, because it is clearly in the customer’s and the state’s interest to keep these plants open. Finally, on the regulatory front, let me turn to a non-generation matter, which is of course the PEPCO transaction, which we announced last year. Getting the merger with PEPCO across the finish line is of course a very high priority for the company and things are progressing according to plan. We continue to anticipate a closing sometime in the second or third quarter of this year. We are pleased to have received approval from New Jersey earlier this week. And as you know, we have already received approvals from FERC and the state of Virginia. In Delaware, as noted in the letter to the commission that you have seen, we are close to a settlement. And if the settlement is reached, there may be an adjustment in the schedule. We are continuing the process of review in the remaining jurisdictions of Maryland and Washington DC. We believe the merger is in the public interest and we expect that the combined company to bring significant value to customers given our top-tier operational performance and the merger commitments we have made. We look forward to completing the regulatory process and closing the transaction on schedule. Thank you. And now, we will open up the floor for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Greg Gordon of Evercore-ISI.
Greg Gordon: Thanks. Good morning guys.
Jack Thayer: Hey, Greg.
Greg Gordon: Jack, can you comment again on the – to revisit the comments you made on the earnings guidance for the utilities, because as I look at the $0.20 to $0.30 from BGE, $0.35 to $0.45 from PECO and $0.45 to $0.55 from ComEd, if I just take the exact midpoint there, that’s $1.15 versus $1.25 at the midpoint of the eyes that’s a $0.10 delta, not a $0.05 delta? Is there a reason why I am miscalculating that?
Jack Thayer: No, Greg. The $0.05 delta was with respect to 2017. The 2015 guidance to your point is down $0.10. Some of that is just a mere factor of rounding. We speak in terms of $0.05 increments. And would say 2015 guidance is down on a relative basis, $0.05 year-over-year, although the rounding would indicate that is down $0.10, it’s just a matter of how we round it up or round it down our expectations.
Greg Gordon: Okay. So the earnings power out in ‘17 of you three utility businesses is a nickel lower than your prior expectation, not a dime?
Jack Thayer: That’s correct. And I think importantly there, you see the sensitivity we have to interest rates, primarily ComEd, you see the impact of the bonus depreciation, which has the CPS impact of lowering rate based and lowering expected earnings but also is the cash flow and savings related to that is a contributor to the $1 billion of incremental capital we see in ‘16 and beyond that we can deploy to grow both our utilities business as well as our merchant business.
Greg Gordon: Okay. Another question, because I think there is a bit of an apples and oranges going on in terms of the discussion, now that you have given us an earnings guidance for this year, that includes the $0.12 dilution from the generation, from the asset sales that you are using to fund the Potomac transaction. As we roll into – if we assume that deal closed precisely on 12/31, is it accretive by $0.15 to $0.20? Is it accretive by $0.15 to $0.20 all things equal off this base or is it more accretive because you are also offsetting the dilution from the asset sales you used to fund the deal?
Jack Thayer: The $0.15 to $0.20 number, Greg, that we referenced incorporates the net dilution associated with the asset sales. That said as I mentioned in the script, the earnings contribution from those assets, while admittedly $0.12 this year, because of the failure of Keystone and Conemaugh to clear capacity markets, the contribution from those assets diminished meaningfully off the curve. The $0.15 to $0.20 that I referenced we would anticipate in 2017, so that’s while you mentioned a close in 12/31 obviously per Bill’s comments we are anticipating a Q2 and Q3 close. We wouldn’t expect to see that all of that $0.15 to $0.20 until 2017, we will be certainly achieving part of that during the 2016 period.
Greg Gordon: Got it. So, I get it, so the math on the earnings contribution from the assets sold, they would have been significantly less than the $0.12 contributor out in time?
Jack Thayer: Correct.
Greg Gordon: Okay. One more question, just in a little bit of the weeds on the forecast for O&M, you did call out increased O&M predominantly at BGE, ComEd, and ExGen and then you say that through ‘17, you expect 0.2% growth. Specifically at ExGen, as we get out into ‘17 is that growth rate sort of pro rata across all the businesses? Is ExGen’s O&M roughly static, because I know you are adding assets to the mix in ‘17? And I am wondering whether there is a significant increase in O&M associated with that or whether the totality of the O&M is still only growing nominally inclusive of those new asset additions?
Jack Thayer: It’s pretty static, Greg. Certainly, we are adding those assets, the operating cost of which will increase. We added Integrys. We added ProLiance. We have announced in recent months both a waste-digesting plant out in LA, a pulp and biomass facility down in Georgia partnered with P&G. We are looking for incremental opportunities in that space. We are offsetting that in part with activities that we are pursuing broadly across the company to drive lower operating costs both within the embedded businesses – so Constellation, the power generation business, the nuclear business, as well as our business services corporation. So, on a kind of blended basis, we see relatively flat O&M further out the curve. Obviously, wage inflation is a component of that. Interest rates have been a meaningful factor of that in driving pension costs and the growth in the liabilities side of that higher. So, as CPI oscillates as interest rates move that will continue to be candidly something a little bit outside our control, but obviously something we are trying to focus on other things to offset.
Greg Gordon: Great, thank you guys.
Jack Thayer: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Dan Eggers from Credit Suisse.
Dan Eggers: Hey, good morning, guys.
Jack Thayer: Good morning, Dan.
Dan Eggers: Just following up on Greg’s question on the utility outlook, if you go back to a year ago when you guys gave guidance I think that kind of all these expectations are down about $0.15 today from where they were a year ago. Can you just bridge for me what has changed a year-to-year basis? And then if you thought about interest rates normalizing or pension normalizing, how much of the $0.15 erosion could you reasonably get back?
Jack Thayer: I don’t know that Dan I can track you back to year end of 2013, but clearly you have seen a material degradation in the interest rate environment. As an example in 2014, the average 30-year was 3.34%. The interest rate for 30 years today is 2.63%. So, just with even – even within on an average basis of full year, the continued decline of interest rates and/or sensitivity to that through the formula rates at ComEd has been significant. For sensitivity, say 25 basis points up or down, and the interest rate is $9 million improvement or detriments to our expected revenues at ComEd. Obviously, the same element is impacting us from a pension liability side marry that with a change in the mortality tables and longer expected lives of our pension and OPEB participants. And that is a headwind – and that’s a headwind that we pass through, through the formula rate within ComEd. But we have to go through rate cases at PECO, and we have to go through a rate cases at BGE to recapture that. So, and then I guess the final element that’s changed, I think is given our load sensitivity of PECO and given some of our longer term load sensitivity of BGE and ComEd as we have continued to experience zero, and in some instances negative load growth that’s been a headwind as well. That said, we continue to see meaningful opportunities to deploy capital in that space. We see an opportunity to drive our customers’ reliability and experience. And importantly we see opportunities to earn a fair rate of return in those businesses. And as we are delivering and evolving a ray of services of our customer, even perhaps improve upon what we allowed to earn.
Dan Eggers: Okay, got it. And I guess, just kind of on the deployment of capital conversation, what are you guys seeing in the ERCOT markets at this point in time underlying the new build decision, it seems like sparks have eroded since those plans were announced and obviously with maybe an economic slowdown, because of oil and gas drilling, there is a little bit of concern in the market, I suppose over demand growth?
Ken Cornew: Yes, Dan, it’s Ken. We are very comfortable with our decision to invest in our combined cycle plants in Texas, and there are several reasons for it. First, the technology we have chosen, we think puts us in a significant competitive advantage. Again, as you know with the position in the stack, we would have as well the ramping capability in the units also cost advantage, given we own these sites. We have advantaged cost position that we don’t think it would be matched in the market. Importantly, we made this investment on our long-term fundamental views. And without talking about a re-assumption in our fundamental views, they are not – they are not drastically different than the environment we are seeing right now. We didn’t – we didn’t make a bet on massive load growth in Texas. We are very conservative in our assumptions. And the last thing I will say Dan is we have a significant load business in Texas as well. And having these plans and this capability and matching that capability with our load business is something, I think you are seeing it right now. We have proven that that is the value proposition that Exelon brings to table. And we expect that the investment in these plants will really enhance that value proposition in Texas.
Dan Eggers: Okay. Thanks, Ken. And I guess Bill can you just walk us through what kind of a timeline we need to see in Illinois as far as draft legislation on carbon action and kind of progression to get something done before the recess in the summer.
Bill Von Hoene: Yes, Dan. As you know the recess is scheduled or at least currently scheduled for the end of the May. And what we anticipate is that legislation consistent with the policy solutions outlined in the 1146 report will be introduced in the general assembly sometime within the next month. We are actively working with legislators, regulators and stakeholders with that in mind. So I would expect to see something surface within the next month and that will give ample time for the legislator to consider it. There will be hearings related to 1146 or possibly to the legislation specifically that will accompany that. But if this gets introduced as we anticipate within that next 30 days or so, it will give an opportunity to go through the full discourse in the legislature before the recess in May.
Dan Eggers: Okay. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jonathan Arnold from Deutsche Bank.
Jonathan Arnold: Yes, good morning, guys.
Chris Crane: Good morning.
Jonathan Arnold: Quick one first, just on Illinois and following up on Dan’s question, is there a sponsor that has emerged or sponsor of this or are you still kind of working that out?
Bill Von Hoene: There is – Jonathan, there has been nothing publicly announced. There will be a significant number of sponsors and it will be bipartisan, but that won’t be revealed until the legislation itself is actually announced.
Jonathan Arnold: Well, as you have said, you are expecting it to be broadly supported?
Bill Von Hoene: Correct. We anticipate Republican and Democratic sponsors in significant numbers.
Jonathan Arnold: In both houses or is it going to sort of emerge in one house and then go to the other?
Bill Von Hoene: The mechanics, it is not yet been determined what the mechanics will be, but there will be adequate support and sponsorship in both houses to run it through the legislature.
Jonathan Arnold: Great. And then if I could also just revisit the question on the regulated guidance, I am sorry to do this, but Jack when I look at the $1.11 starting point for 2014, which was pretty consistent with the EEI slide and your statement that 2017 is only down by a nickel in the midpoint, which would imply $1.35 versus $1.40. I think where I am having confusion is that you had said – you called that an 8% CAGR at EEI, but now you are saying 5% to 6%, but seems to me that the $1.11 to the $1.35 would be more like 6% to 7%. And 5% to 6% implies a bigger reduction. Can you speak to that at all?
Jack Thayer: I think Jonathan we are talking about 100 basis points. And to be candid, the rounding issue comes into play. So, I think I would focus more on the $0.05 of degradation from EEI’s 2017 expectation to where we sit today. And some of that is an issue of the timing of capital deployment and other elements and I think we feel good about 5% to 6% growth. Ideally, we will endeavor to deliver higher growth that $1 billion of incremental spend in ‘16 and beyond is potentially a driver of that incremental growth.
Jonathan Arnold: But the $0.05 is what we should really focus on?
Jack Thayer: Yes.
Jonathan Arnold: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Steven Fleishman from Wolfe Research.
Steven Fleishman: Yes, hi, thank you. So not to beat a dead horse with that, does your viewpoint on the utility include any of the $1 billion being reinvested in it or is that, that would now be in additive?
Jack Thayer: No, its additive.
Steven Fleishman: Great.
Jack Thayer: Incremental.
Steven Fleishman: Thanks. And then just with respect to the Illinois legislation, I know there is other aspects of this, not just on nuclear plants. So, maybe you could give us a little bit of better sense of what else might be addressed in this legislation. I am assuming it’s also kind of renewables, but is there other aspects that would likely be in this?
Bill Von Hoene: Steve, this is Bill. The legislation that we are referencing in the nuclear is standalone for the time being. There are going to be undoubtedly additional energy-related initiatives. There was a group that convened last week called the Clean Jobs Coalition, which was an environmentally directed group of a number of agencies and entities, which indicated that they will introduce legislation that will relate to energy efficiency to renewable standards and also to a cap and invest system that would be implemented in connection with 111(d). So, we anticipate that, that will be legislatively active and there undoubtedly will be a variety of other things that will be considered as well.
Steven Fleishman: Okay. And just lastly and maybe to Joe on your kind of point of view in your hedging, it sounds just to kind of clarify, it sounds like you are particularly focused on future NI Hub prices being too low. Is that fair?
Joe Nigro: Yes, Steve. I think there is two elements. I think you are correct when you think about the expansion opportunities, heat rates I think that’s primarily in NI Hub. I think from our perspective as well, we actually see upside to the natural gas markets, especially this maybe to a lesser extent in ‘16 and more so as you move out into ‘17 and ‘18 on the back of demand pickup and where prices are today and that would be true, for example, both at West Hub and NI Hub. You can see in the quarter that we sold less than our ratable plan, approximately 5% of our portfolio – total portfolio, whereas an average quarter, we would sell about 8% and we rotated out of a lot of the gas shorts that we had because of the big heat rate move we had. So, as we move forward as we build a position that falls behind ratable, it’s going to be done more on a, I’ll call it a flat-priced basis, where we are just going to take the power that we would have normally sold and just hold it in our portfolio and we will tailor that to locations and time buckets. NI Hub will be a big piece of that, but we will be looking at other areas as well depending on what we see in the gas market.
Steven Fleishman: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from UBS.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hi, good morning.
Jack Thayer: Good morning.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: So, I wanted to ask a little bit of a bigger picture question here around the direction of the company vis-à-vis utility versus merchant. And as you think about that decision point, you have obviously made a couple of decisions over the past years, PEPCO namely, how were you thinking about positioning the company towards the merchant side of the business, specifically as you think about, a) potentially expanding nuclear and then b) specifically expanding into Texas, are either of those avenues palatable or desirable under a merchant expansion? And then more broadly, is a merchant expansion desirable at this point in time?
Jack Thayer: So, we continue to look at both sides. The utility business as we talked about we can operate the utilities well. We can drive efficiencies in. We can improve the customer experience while we are getting returns. We are in a unique situation with ComEd on the formula rate at some historically low interest rates. We are not running from the investment – the utility business. We think interest rates will normalize and will be at the right place for the return. So, we will continue to make prudent investments and operate the utilities well there. On the merchant side, it’s all about the value proposition in looking at the specific investments. If a nuclear plant came available and we could fold it into the portfolio and see our adequate returns, we would certainly have the scale and the scope to put one in. We don’t see any out there right now, but newbuild is not an option. So, that’s the only way we get as acquisition. As we have said before, we do think Texas is one of the more interesting markets to invest in right now, and that’s why we are proceeding with organic growth down there. We do look at assets that come up from time-to-time in the ERCOT market. Most have been overvalued from our perspective on the long-term fundamentals. That’s why building these new technology units makes more sense to us. So, we will continue to look for opportunities on both sides of the business and use the balance sheet prudently to make the investments, but one thing that we – in the last couple of years as we do our asset valuations on an annual basis, recycling capital has become a focus and we will continue to watch that. If we see assets and others have more value and we can deploy that capital into other arenas, we will not be – we will not be shy of any divestiture. And that’s what we did this year with divesting assets and having the opportunity to use that capital into what we think is something that would be strategically valuable for us with PEPCO and also having the – creating the new balance sheet space to make the investments in new unit. So, we were still very confident in the model and confident in the investment thesis. And if low interest rates are hard on pensions and they are hard on the formula rates, but in the long run we see those coming back and we still think it’s a good investment in CC.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Alright, great. And then secondly, if you can comment more specifically around Ginna in New York, obviously there has been some development there, what’s your latest expectations if you can elaborate?
Bill Von Hoene: Chris you want me to take that?
Chris Crane: Joe is going to grab it.
Bill Von Hoene: Thanks.
Joe Dominguez: Julien, this is Joe Dominguez. We continue negotiating the RSSA with our counterparties up there in New York. I think you will see developments become public on that within the next few days to a week.
Julien Dumoulin-Smit: Got it, fair enough. Thank you. Good luck.
Joe Dominguez: Thanks.
Chris Crane: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Stephen Byrd from Morgan Stanley.
Stephen Byrd: Good morning.
Chris Crane: Good morning.
Stephen Byrd: I wanted to – I think I had heard that on the call that Keystone and Conemaugh had not cleared in the PJM auction, and if that’s correct, I wondered if you can just elaborate on the rational, I thought of those as large well-operating co-plants, I am just curious what was the driver behind that?
Joe Nigro: And Stephen, this is Joe. Good morning. There are a couple of reasons for that. First of all, as you know into the mechanisms afforded in the PJM model, you can calculate an avoided cost rate on each of your units. And we take the opportunity with our fossil units in particular and all of our fossil units to do that. And that’s just what I’d call our cost base line. And recognizing what we need from a cost perspective on those units we take that into account in our bidding strategy. And we have a host of other assets that we have to look at in particular to make sure that we are looking this in a proper sense from a total portfolio basis. And in the way that math worked for Keystone and Conemaugh in particular, it just didn’t clear given where the clearing prices were today for that particular option.
Ken Cornew: So, Steven just a little to add to that, this is Ken, there are substantial costs at the plant associated with the environmental upgrades. That associated with the avoid the energy benefits that were very low from that 2009 to 2013 period drove the avoided cost rates up at those plants. And as we said before we – the market works when participants bid their costs, and that’s what we do.
Stephen Byrd: Okay, great. Thank you. And just shifting to the utility, in terms of achieving the growth rates that you have laid out, what kind of low growth assumptions sort of your latest thinking that’s driving that growth?
Chris Crane: Denis, do you get that?
Denis OBrien:
Stephen Byrd: Okay, great. And the change in terms of the outlook from flat to – negative to flat to positive, what’s your – just at a high level view of what would drive that improvement in load growth?
Denis OBrien:
Stephen Byrd: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: And our final question comes from Hugh Wynne from Sanford Bernstein.
Hugh Wynne: Thanks. The $435 million asset impairment charge in this quarter, how do you breakdown between Keystone, Conemaugh and upstream assets and others?
Jack Thayer: Hugh, the total of overall long-live assets impairments that we had during the year, we had a wind impairment that was $0.06. We had a lease impairment that was $0.02. We had Quail Run assets held for sale impairment of $0.04. Keystone and Conemaugh was $0.29 of that. Upstream was $0.09 for a total of $0.50. On the flip side of that, we had $0.28 of gains related to the sale of Safe Harbor, sale of Fore River, again on the sale of West Valley. So, overall on a net basis, it’s about $0.22 negative impact on the year.
Hugh Wynne: Okay. And then my question is for Bill. Bill, though you’re lawyer and you are talking about the potential implications of the Clean Power Plan EPS and Clean Power Plan, I just want to get your views as to the likelihood that the plan survives at all. I understand there has been challenges as to whether EPA has a authority to regulate CO2 under 111(d) at the – in the first place. And then secondly if it does, whether that authority extends to energy efficiency and renewables is this Clean Power Plan going to be with us in the long run or do you think it’s going to be whittled down or overturned altogether?
Bill Von Hoene: Well, one thing that we can be abundantly certain of is that there will be litigation respecting whatever the final rule will be. But the basic tenants, Hugh, of the underpinnings of the rule are legally sound. The ability to regulate carbon emission has been already ruled upon by the United States Supreme Court and our expectation is that there will be litigation and there maybe modifications that result from that, but the basic underpinning of the rule will survive and will have the impact that will be significant in that scope.
Hugh Wynne: Right, thank you very much.
Operator: I would now like to turn the call back over to our presenters.
Jack Thayer: So, thank you very much everybody for joining. As we laid out from an operation standpoint, very strong year, we continue to run well, continue to watch costs and contain where we can. The Constellation, the Generation business has done a very good job in this marketplace and we continue to see – feel very strong that, that will be continue to be supported. The utility side, the utilities are operating well as I said. We see the investment thesis as right. We know the sensitivity to the interest rates, but don’t think that’s a long-term sustainable issue and we will continue to keep investing. Thanks.
Operator: This will be the end of today’s call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Reshira and I’ll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q3 2014 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Mr. Idehen, you may begin your conference.
Francis Idehen: Thank you, Reshira. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining our third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Leading the call today are Chris Crane, Exelon’s President and Chief Executive Officer; Jack Thayer, Exelon’s Chief Financial Officer, and Ken Cornew, President and CEO of Exelon Generation. They are joined by other members of Exelon’s senior management team who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. We issued our earning release this morning along with a presentation, each of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of Exelon’s Web site. The earnings release and other matters that we discuss during today’s call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could defer from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today's material, comments made during this call and in the risk factors section of the earnings release. Please refer to today's 8-K and Exelon’s other fillings for a discussion of factors that may cause the results to differ from management's projections, forecasts, and expectations. Today’s presentation also includes references to adjusted opening earnings which is a non-GAAP measure. Please refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for a reconciliation between the non-GAAP measures to the GAAP earnings. We have scheduled 60 minutes for today's call. I’ll now turn the call over to Chris Crane, Exelon's CEO.
Chris Crane: Good morning, everybody and thanks for joining the call. We had another strong quarter from an operational perspective as well as a financial perspective. As we announced this morning, our operating earnings of $0.78 per share beat expectations and we remain on track to deliver on our financial goals for the year. Jack's going to discuss the financial performance in more detail in a minute. I am going to just focus on the broader strategy and operational issues. Our strategy continues to leverage the integrated business model that creates value using our strong balance sheet to invest in both regulated and competitive businesses to drive growth. Our investment in Pepco Holdings, Integrys and most recently the two Texas gas plants confirm our commitment to grow on both our regulated and our unregulated side of the business. Through this model our utilities contribute to earnings stability and provide dividend support while our competitive business provides exposure to market power upside. We are not just resting on the market power to turn around, we are continuing to invest in our core markets and competencies while pursuing opportunities to innovate in adjacent areas. And Ken will elaborate on that when I finish, in how we think about these markets. We own our assets that are more valuable to others -- when we own assets that are more valuable to others, then we will take a look at selling them as we continue to focus on our recycling of capital into stronger investments. You have seen evidence of that with our announcements on our asset sales this year and we will continue to optimize our portfolio going forward. What drives our success is our focus on operational excellence. Our nuclear fleet continues to run at high capacity factors, 96.5 for the quarter. Our power fleet had a 98.8 dispatch match in our renewable energy capture rate was 94.9. We also achieved very strong operational metrics in our utilities. Many of our growth areas we are pursuing, such as Pepco Holdings and the Texas gas projects, are directly tied to our ability to operate across our business at consistently high levels. Switching gears, I want to quickly discuss the capacity market design proposals. There has been a lot of progress at PJM in developing a new capacity performance product and making other designs changes. We are encouraged by PJM's acknowledgment of the value and reliability that comes from firm fuel, particularly given our nuclear units performance and their minimal additional cost of compliance for us for this proposed product. We are keeping a close watch on how the proposal evolves over the next several months and we will continue to remain engaged. On the Pepco Holding front, we continue to work through various regulatory approval processes. We received approval from Virginia earlier this month and we are working collaboratively with the other jurisdictions. We remain on track to close the transaction in the second or third quarter of 2015. On the nuclear front in Illinois particularly, we continue to engage with the stakeholders as the process goes forward on recognizing the value and the environmental benefit and the economic benefit of these plants to the state. That process as we have said before will continue to work through 2015. In closing, we are pleased with the results of the quarter. Exelon is operationally strong and positioned to deliver earnings expectations for the full year. We remain committed to deliver sustainable income and provide access to growth opportunities across the energy value chain. With that, I will turn it over to Ken to discuss in more detail what we're doing with our competitive generation business.
Ken Cornew: Thanks, Chris, and good morning everyone. We had a very productive quarter at Exelon Generation announcing several development projects and an acquisition. Each of these initiatives leverages our operating and commercial expertise. We are investing in our core business and markets as well as adjacent markets to increase value. We are positioning Exelon to be at the forefront of and capitalize on the evolving energy landscape. We are pursuing investments that meet customer demands across both the electricity and gas value chains. Along those lines, last month we announced plans to build two CCGTs in Texas using a new GE technology that will make them among the cleanest, most efficient CCGTs in the state and in the nation. The units will be located on existing Exelon sites and will have a combined capacity of over 2000 megawatts, allowing us to build them for more attractive price relative to other new builds in the region. These first of a kind GE gas turbines will provide the highest efficiency and best operational flexibility in the market. The units are designed to ramp faster than any other see CCGT turbines allowing us to better capture market volatility and price movements. Importantly, being mindful of increased water efficiency in drought prone Texas, these units will be cooled with air instead of water. We expect construction to begin next year and commercial operation in 2017. Earlier this month we also announced an investment in NET Power. A first of a kind demonstration power plant in Texas that uses carbon dioxide as part of the combustion cycle and produces zero atmospheric emissions. The technology will ultimately produce pipeline quality CO2 that can be sequestered or used in various industrial processes including enhanced oil recovery. This technology is a potential game changer in reducing carbon emissions from power generation and is another step towards Exelon's vision of a clean innovative energy future. Finally, as you know, we announced the acquisition of Integrys Energy Services at the beginning of the quarter and expect to close that transaction in November. The combination creates a stronger, more diverse business that is well positioned to compete for customers in retail electricity and gas markets across the country. It vastly expands our gas portfolio increasing our load by 150 BCF annually. And it enhances our generational load strategy because many of the power customers currently served by Integrys are in regions where Exelon owns significant generation. Sifting to the power markets and hedging on slide three. Mild summer weather defined the markets during the third quarter. In July, spot markets cleared at relatively low prices on the back of low demand and strong natural gas supply. Forward market prices followed and bottomed out in the end of July. Since then, forward prices have recovered and are still well above where they were at the beginning of the year. Prices are up approximately $5 a megawatt hour in West Hub and $2.50 a megawatt hour in NI Hub for calendar year '15 and the move in 2016 heat rates and prices are similar. We believe the price increases are due to the impact of coal retirements as a result of mass implementation next year and we expect this trend to continue. NI Hub should be particularly sensitive to the coal retirements and our hedging strategy reflects that view. During the third quarter or portfolio management team performed very well. They executed on $150 million of power new business which allowed us to raise our full-year gross margin outlook by $50 million. In addition, we achieved $50 million of non-power new business. For 2015 and 2016 total gross margin is down $200 million and $250 million respectively. Divestitures during the quarter account for $150 million of the decrease in each year and in 2016 lower market prices accounted for the remaining $100 million. You all know that Exelon Generation stands to benefit significantly from changes in power prices, whether in energy or capacity markets, and we will continue to see improvements in both. In the meantime, we will continue to make investments in market-leading technology and expand our footprint in attractive markets through acquisition. I will now turn it over to Jack to review the full financial information for the quarter.
Jack Thayer: Thank you, Ken, and good morning everyone. I will cover Exelon's financial results for the quarter, our full-year guidance range and update our cash outlook for 2014. Starting with our financial results on Slide 4. We had a strong third quarter and Exelon delivered earnings of $0.78 per share exceeding our guidance and in line with our results for the third quarter of 2013. At Constellation, both wholesale and retail performed well this quarter driving the overall performance at Exelon Generation. During the year we have seen dramatically different market conditions play out and our balanced generation to load strategy has benefited us in each circumstance. During the first quarter, our reliable, firmly fueled nuclear base load generation supplemented by our dispatchable fleet allowed us to take advantage of the volatility created by the polar vortex, while successfully managing our load obligations. Our portfolio benefits from our load serving business in periods of low volatility like we saw this summer. We experienced lower cost associated with ancillary services, load following costs, specifically hourly LMP shaping and variable load risks and power basis. Post polar vortex and with the expectation of greater volatility in the future due to coal plant retirements and market rule changes, we are charging appropriate load following costs. We have seen the success of this strategy throughout the market cycle. For the full year we are narrowing our guidance range to $2.30 to $2.50 per share from our previous guidance of $2.25 to $2.55 per share. We expect to deliver 2014 results comfortably within the revised full-year guidance range. One of our key assumptions is that bonus depreciation expires as scheduled. If extended by Congress, we will benefit economically with a positive cash flow impact of approximately $80 million in 2014 and in the ballpark of $1 billion in 2015. However, we would expect to see a $0.05 per share drag on our full-year earnings which is not factored into our current guidance for 2014 or 2015. Turning to utilities on Slide 5. They delivered combined earnings of $0.29 for the quarter. For the third quarter, ComEd earned $0.15 per share. We are on track to have a decision in our most recent formula rate case in December. On October 22, the Illinois Commerce Commission approved the Grand Prairie Gateway, 345 KV transmission line project. The nearly $260 million project will connect ComEd's Byron and Wayne substations, alleviating identified congestion and providing net savings to northern Illinois customers of more than $250 million within the first 15 years of operation. Construction of the transmission line is scheduled to begin in the second quarter of 2015 and the line is expected to be in service by the second quarter of 2017. Including this project, ComEd is on track to invest more than $1.7 billion in 2014, which is approximately $300 million more than last year. This includes over $400 million related to EIMA and is consistent with our investment strategy to continue improving reliability and system performance in the ComEd's service territory. PECO's earnings were $0.09 per share for the third quarter. Through the end of September PECO has substantially completed the installation of advanced meters and grid for electric customers. Nearly 1.5 million meters with an overall investment of approximately $700 million with $200 million of that funded by the DOE. We are well into the deployment of upgraded natural gas meter modules, installing more than 120,000 modules. We expect the installation will be complete in the second quarter of 2015. This technology brings significant benefits to PECO and its customers. In addition to helping the company further improve storm restoration and improve operational efficiencies, the technology also helps customers better understand and manage their energy use and cost. BGE delivered $0.05 per share this quarter. On October 17, BGE reached the unanimous settlement agreement on its rate case which was filed with the Maryland Public Service Commission. The settlement includes a total revenue requirement increase of $60 million between electric and gas. In addition, the settlement allows for a $20 million reduction in depreciation and amortization expense. This is the first BGE rate case settlement since 1999 and is the result of an improving regulatory environment in Maryland. It still must be approved by the Maryland PSC before it becomes effective. The earliest new rates would go into effect would be mid-December. Slide 6 provides an update of our cash flow expectations for this year. We project cash from operations of nearly $7.5 billion. This compares to $6.975 billion last quarter. The variance is primarily driven by additional proceeds from asset divestitures. Turning to our asset sale program. We announced agreement to sell our Fore River, Quail Run and West Valley units during the third quarter. Our total gross proceeds from these plants and Safe Harbor will be $1.3 billion. On an after-tax basis, net proceeds from these sales will be more than $975 million. Further, on October 24 we entered into a definitive agreement for the sale of our interest in Keystone and Conemaugh to an affiliate of ArcLight Capital Partners for $470 million of gross proceeds, inclusive of approximately $60 million of working capital or $418 million on an after-tax basis. We expect to close this transaction late this year or early next year. Please note that the sale of Keystone/Conemaugh is not included in our cash forecast or reflected in our commercial disclosures. We will update these disclosures on the fourth quarter call. However, we expect to take an impairment loss of $350 million-$450 million which will be reflected in the fourth quarter. This is non-operating and will not impact full-year EPS guidance. We anticipate closing the Integrys transaction in the fourth quarter. The purchase price and working capital of approximately $325 million is reflected in the cash from operations. On the financing side, we completed the $695 million financing of ExGen Texas Power, a diverse portfolio of CCGTs and peakers in ERCOT North and Houston zones. Since the third quarter of last year we have project financed approximately $1.75 billion, providing capital to allow us to explore growth opportunities for Exelon Generation. As a reminder, the appendix includes several schedules that will help you in your modeling efforts. Now I will turn the call over to Chris for his concluding remarks before we open the line for Q&A.
Chris Crane: Before I turn it over Q&A, I want to close with some more remarks on Illinois. There has been a fair amount of speculation and some misreporting on what we're looking for in Illinois so I want to be clear. We are not looking for a bailout. We have a strong record of opposing non-market-based solutions not only in Illinois but in other states as well. What we are seeking to keep the plants operating is a solution that recognizes the clean attributes of nuclear as done with other sources that we compete against within this market. Examples of such a solution would be a clean energy standard or carbon regime like a RGGI, Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. So there has been recent publications of reports that clearly articulate the significant contribution to the state and local economy as well as the environmental benefits from our nuclear plants, and we agree with those totally. Various state agencies including the state EPA and the ICC continue to work on the issue in a coordinated fashion and we hope that a positive conclusion will be reached by the end of the legislative session next May. So thank you and we look forward to seeing all of you at EEI and with that we will open it up for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Greg Gordon with ISI Group. I am sorry, your first question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.
Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research: Sorry, Greg. So just a couple of quick questions. First, on the 2014 guidance update, the overall number is the same midpoint but it seems like there is $0.10 to $0.15 more at ExGen and $0.10 to $0.15 less at the utilities. Could you just kind of give a quick snippet of explanation for the changes in each?
Jack Thayer: Sure, Steve. This is Jack. So I will start with the utilities where I think it's simplest. We have had significant storm expense this year, particularly at PECO and BGE. And then as you think about the formula rate at ComEd, interest rates, it's based of the 30-year treasury. As that's declined our allowed return has declined with that. So that's been a headwind for the year. And when you aggregate those, that's on the utilities side really kind of bringing down the expected contribution relative to plan from the utilities. That said, both the formula rate and increased rates of BGE have been an offset to that and been a positive for the year. On the Exelon Generation side, clearly you are seeing the benefit of a number of positive outcomes. Strong performance from Constellation. You are seeing the elimination benefit of the DOE fee. But we have had some increase outages this year. We have had higher costs associated with purchasing power during the polar vortex. So, again, speaking to the benefit of the balance load gen strategy, the opportunity to participate in the polar vortex and that volatility was a benefit at Constellation during the winter. The opportunity to have lower cost to serve during the summer was also a benefit at Constellation which I think you are seeing in the very strong improvement in the hedge disclosures as those positives have benefited our overall outlook.
Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research: Okay. Great. And I guess one other question is, just in thinking about all the asset sales and your forecast. I guess when you give like 17 at EEI, will this money have been reinvested in something or is it all going into Pepco which you we are not, you won't have the numbers for Pepco in your guidance yet? So where is all that, yes?
Jack Thayer: No, I understand the question. You will recall when we announced the Pepco transaction, we had highlighted that we would use $1 billion of those proceeds from asset sales to fund that investment. And at that time, we disclosed that we expected the impact of the asset sales, the lost contribution from those assets, the addition of Pepco, to be $0.15 to $0.20 accretive in 2017. The proceeds to date, as you know are in excess of that billion. We will have, including Key/Con, roughly $1.4 billon of after-tax proceeds. And we will incorporate that into our disclosures as we move forward. I would say that we believe that the very attractive prices that we have received are helping us to fund the growth, whether it's at the two combined-cycle plants in Texas, whether it's at the acquisition of Integrys, cash is somewhat fungible. But we are doing a lot that we think is very positive on the Exelon Generation side of our business to invest and grow.
Operator: Your next question comes from Greg Gordon with ISI Group.
Greg Gordon - ISI Group: So Steve, thankfully, did not ask my question. When we are looking at the gross margin update, just want to be clear on what is baked in and what isn't baked in. So you've just announced the sale of Key/Con, so the lower volumes and the lower gross margin associated with the sale of Key/Con are not yet factored in. Is that correct?
Jack Thayer: That’s correct.
Joseph Nigro: Steve, it's Joe Nigro. They are not factored into the disclosure.
Greg Gordon - ISI Group: And is the Integrys acquisition factored in yet?
Joseph Nigro: No.
Jack Thayer: It is not.
Joseph Nigro: It is not.
Greg Gordon - ISI Group: Okay. So neither is factored in?
Joseph Nigro: That’s correct.
Greg Gordon - ISI Group: And when you give us the 2017, when you roll it, are you going to include an assumption for the contribution from the new Texas power plants or will they be up and running beginning of '17, middle of '17, end of 2017?
Joseph Nigro: Yes. When we roll out '17 and EEI you will see the assumptions of the new Texas power plants in the open gross margin calculation.
Chris Crane: And, Greg, we plan on having those units up and running prior to the summer of 2017.
Greg Gordon - ISI Group: Great. Can you maybe spend a little bit more time explaining how you were able to reduce the cost of serving your load so much that you were able to put up a really strong quarter despite the fact that, I presume, you actually delivered variable load risk. Probably came in on the downside of your expectation of what you would serve in the quarter in terms of the load in the retail business. So can you explain a little bit more how you were able to more than offset that on the cost side?
Joseph Nigro: Yes, Greg, there were really four elements to the success in the quarter and three of them are directly related to load. I think Jack said this and I will reiterate it. I think if you look at the first quarter, we got a huge benefit on the generation side because us like everybody else incurred substantial charges on our load book in Q1 but we got the benefit of the generation in the first quarter. In the third quarter, it was directly related to the fact that we had estimates of what cost to serve would be in three big buckets. One you just mentioned, the variable load shape. The second is there is ancillary service cost estimates and then the third piece is, and I am talking, let's stay in PJM for a second because we have quite a bit of load in PJM. We have estimates as to what specific location of cost or basis cost would be. In all three of those buckets, the cost came in substantially lower than what we were expecting them to be. And so we got the benefit of that by serving load at contracted prices. The fourth element which really isn't tied to load directly but it's more of a general portfolio management comment, is we benefited from our spot optimization as well. Shaping of our generation to match our load and running short schedules. Price protection to the downside that we have purchased prior to the quarter and got the benefit of. As well as when we did see some volatility we had some opportunity with our excess generation to capitalize on that as well. So really, it's truly a story of generation and load.
Operator: Your next question comes from Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse.
Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse: Just kind of following up on these asset sales. Can you help put in context the idea of selling down some PJM capacity ahead of RPM rule changes. The idea of investing in ERCOT before there is any demonstrative move and maybe some policy changes there? Just kind of how you guys are seeing these kind of two major power markets evolve that's maybe leading to some capital allocation decisions?
Chris Crane: Dan, what don’t I speak to the assets sales side and then Ken can speak to the investment side within ERCOT. There's no question that the discussion and commentary around the proposed capacity performance market factored into the pricing. We started our process in advanced of that but the commentary was well understood by the buyers. It was factored into the pricing. And while we didn’t have absolute clarity on how that market will develop, certainly it played in the element in the investment decision for the buyer. Clearly we have an internal view on how that market will evolve and what it's near term and more importantly longer term impacts will be on asset values. And we have factored that into our decision to sell Key/Con as well. As you will know, we were close to $1 billion of net proceeds. We didn’t need to sell this asset. We viewed it as a very attractive price and one that viewed as an opportunity to recycle that capital and invest in Texas opportunity and others. Ken?
Ken Cornew: Yes, Dan. I am sure you realize at this point we have been working on this Texas opportunity for a while now. We had sites that were set up very well to construct. Bringing GE and Exelon together was very leveraging in terms of putting the best technology forward that we could and doing at a very very low cost. And we are excited about the ERCOT market and its fundamentals going forward. We think that these plants will show up right about at the right time when ERCOT needs power and we think we have a technology and location advantage that obviously we have been working on and we are implementing that strategy as such. So for us this is a deployment to better technology. It's a deployment to lower cost and a deployment to more upside for ExGen.
Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse: Ken, when you think about the ERCOT market, you highlight the air cooled nature of these plants and with the CSAPR rules kind of evolving or coming back again. Are those having bearing or is there a way to think about the economic value of both CSAPR coming back and maybe water use issues in Texas as to help put this in a better cost position?
Ken Cornew: Clearly our strategy to go air cooled is a good one for Texas given the water constraints that are there. And our strategy to put efficient, clean, lowest in the stack combined-cycle is going to be constructive in environmental regulation space. That’s all upside for us. We looked at the economics of these plants, where they sit on the stack and how they can respond to price movements and they will stand on their own because of that. And I think what you mentioned is potentially even more upside.
Chris Crane: Let me just elaborate on the water side. When you go to build a new asset and you try to secure water in the ERCOT market, you are building a 20 to 30 year asset with a contract that can only extend for three years. The air cooled nature of these assets guarantee their availability and their capability of returning value for many years to come while they, as Ken pointed out, they have the best mechanical heat rate and the best ramping speed to capture and to operate in a market that’s heavily saturated with renewables.
Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse: Okay, got it. I guess one last question just on the CO2 front. There is kind of two big gubernatorial elections in Illinois and Pennsylvania this year. In Illinois, what has been the comments I guess between the two candidates, or is there any difference in willingness to consider supporting if somebody puts the value on the nuclear assets? And then in Pennsylvania, I believe candidate Wolf has come out in favor of some carbon policy. Where do you guys see that potentially playing through?
Joseph Dominguez: This is Joe Dominguez. I think you have captured it well in Illinois, I think the -- excuse me, in Pennsylvania. I think candidate Wolf has talked about joining RGGI if he becomes the governor. And I think that would be their compliance mechanism, at least based on what he said. Obviously, if Corbett remains in offices, he has been opposed to carbon trading regimes historically. So that’s a big toggle there. In terms of Illinois, there hasn’t been a lot of focus on who the different candidates would deal with carbon going forward. Not an opposition certainly to carbon trading from either candidate at this point. We think both will recognize the inherent value of nuclear, both from a reliability and claims standpoint. So we don’t think the game changes materially depending on the gubernatorial election and what's going on.
Operator: Your next question comes from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.
Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley: I wanted to talk about the forward power market versus fundamental view that you have. Since March we have seen the PJM East on peak heat rates for 2016, rise about 3500 from about 12,000 to 15,500. When you look at your fundamental view of heat rates and then also sort of new build economics when you combine capacity prices plus spark spreads which were 16 or up about 40% at PJM East. Can you give us your view on your fundamental power view relative to the forwards?
Joseph Nigro: Yes. Stephen, it's Joe Nigro. If I start in PJM East, I would say that in the '15-'16 timeframe we think that the PJM West hub prices are generally fairly priced. There is a small big of upside in '16. When you go out to '17--'18, we do see increasing upside. I think on the NI Hub side, it's safe to say that there is quite a bit of upside both in the '15-'16 timeframe and more so in '17-'18. And some of that is related to the facts that you just have better liquidity in the front end of the curve, 2015 in particular. And we have seen quite a bit of heat rate expansion as you mentioned in the last few months in '15 related to the back end. That all takes into account normal weather and normal operations. Some of the changes that PJM is talking about related to things like dynamic reserves that they are looking at implementing in the course of the year, would be incremental upside to what I'm talking about and it's not factored into our fundamental focused. From a fundamental forecasting perspective, we spend a lot of time scrubbing the stack as to what we expect to be added into the stack and what changes we would expect. I think it's safe to say, when you look at the new build economics for CCGTs in the Midwest, they are pretty challenged given the fact where energy prices are and the associated capacity prices. You are much closer to breakeven economics in the mid-Atlantic. And that gets into where the market spark spreads are and where the capacity prices are but they are generally close to breakeven economics.
Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley: Okay. Thank you. The first part of what you said, Joe, you were talking about PJM West. Was that also designed to cover PJM East or what's (indiscernible) that I understood the first part ?
Joseph Nigro: They are generally pretty close. There's probably slightly more upside at, let's call PJM West hub then there is at East hub. And there would be increasing upside as you move further west in PJM to NI Hub for example.
Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley: Okay. Understood. So PJM East in your view is more closer to fair value...
Joseph Nigro: Yes.
Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley: But not overstated. Okay. And then shifting over to the utility. We just talked a little bit about PECO and low growth expectations. Longer term beyond, it just looks like for this quarter and next quarter, the low growth numbers are a bit lower than before. Can you talk a little bit more fundamentally about the PECO territory and your thoughts on load growth longer term?
Chris Crane: Denis, you want to cover that?
Denis O’Brien: The longer-term load growth in all three areas is really pretty flat. I mean I think we may see load growth anywhere between a zero and 1% over the next few years but we are not seeing anything now really significant.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.
Jonathan Arnold – Deutsche Bank: Could I ask a question about how you see demand response playing out, particularly in PJM? I mean you are obviously a large owner of utilities and PJM seems to have the strategy that DR is going to reorganize itself under the umbrella of states and utilities. So sitting on both sides of that equation, do you have a view on how this can work and what the impact on sort of the amount of that product in the market might be under different scenarios? Anything you could say there?
Joseph Dominguez: Sure. Jonathan. This is Joe Dominguez again. Obviously a very dynamic situation. We have a court order delaying the mandate at FERC. We will see if FERC is able to move forward with an appeal to the Supreme Court. So the decision isn't final until at least that determination is made. We think demand and the response is a very important tool in the market. It's an important tool for customers. It helps to keep prices low. And as long as it does exactly the same thing as generation, we think it needs to be a component of the market. We have looked at the white paper that PJM circulated. I think it begins a good discussion. Obviously, if the LSEs are going to be in the contracting role for DR, there has got to be a lot of work done between FERC, the states and the industry ultimately to make sure the product is defined appropriately in a uniform manner and then is included in the load forecast. We think that makes a lot of sense. As you know, FirstEnergy has filed a complaint and they had some requested relief to strip out DR out of the markets and rerun the last option. We don't support that. What we do support, prompt action by FERC to define the new DR market to work with the states to implement it. But to close, we see it as a continuing and important tool and there is a good deal of work in our view to be done in how it gets defined and implemented.
Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank: Do you think that implementation can practically be achieved by next May's auction in the same type of scale that it's at today?
Chris Crane: No, I don't think so. I think the timing is going to be very difficult. Particularly if FERC appears the matter to the Supreme Court, we are not going to have a decision by the Supreme Court in all likelihood until March which is going to be a challenge for all the stakeholders to develop programs and have it implemented, assuming the appeal isn't granted. If it is granted, I think things will obviously stay and we will all wait the decision from the Supreme Court. But even if the Supreme Court doesn't hear the matter, it's going to be hard to imagine that we will have all the predicate work done to fully involve DR to the full extent that it's already participating, which was your question. That's different than saying that there can be no DR participation. I think we will get some DR participation on the load side even if the timing is constrained. Just probably not as much as we have seen.
Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank: Okay. Great. Thank you for that. Can I ask just on another topic. On the Illinois process, Chris, I think at the outset you said you think that it will continue through 2015 but then you also said you are hoping that there will be some sort of determination by the time the legislature wraps up. Could you just maybe elaborate a bit more on what you see the steps in this process to be and timing of them?
Chris Crane: Yes. At the end of the last session there was mandates given by the legislature to different state agencies to review the environmental and economic support of these units that are in Illinois. That is ongoing. And as I mentioned, it's a coordinated, collaborative process and dialogue that's underway right now. I wouldn't speculate what the final outcome look. We are suggesting, is their potential for a clean energy standard as we have discussed before. That has to be vetted through to see if that's the right avenue going forward. We are just holding that it needs to be a market-based reform in support of the assets as the state currently supports renewables, clean coal and other sources. So the sources we compete against are already recognized for the value that the provide and that's what we are looking for. So we had made the agreement with the states since they were open to having discussions about compensating for the value that they provide, that we would slow any decision on what the long-term aspects or the long-term viability of some of the plants would be. And so we hope that we see a path clear by the end of this session coming up in May. And if not, we will have discussions on the other side, looking at the economics of the plants.
Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank: My memory says that the state agencies were supposed to come out in November. Is that correct and do you still -- are you expecting that to happen on time?
Chris Crane: Yes. Actually they have a window between November 15 and January 15 to issue those reports. So the earliest we will see in is November 15. Hard to say whether they are going to hit the earlier part of the target but I am very confident that they will get their work done within the 60 day period.
Operator: Your next question comes from Hugh Wynne with Sanford Bernstein.
Hugh Wynne – Sanford Bernstein: You are obviously intermittently involved in discussions around the reforms to the PJM capacity market architecture and I am sure you have modeled the potential impact of the various different changes that have been proposed. I was wondering if, similar to the detailed discussion that you provided of your expectations for energy prices, you might provide more color on what you expect the impact of the proposed reforms to be over what period of time. And perhaps also give us your assessment of the likelihood of these reforms being accepted by FERC in time for the next auction?
Chris Crane: So we don't want to speculate. The process is very fluid right now on the design and how it would go forward. So we don't want to speculate or start to put a stick in what we think the value is to us. We first want to get the design right so we understand that the capacity will be there and the system will be secure. As the process moves forward we may be able to do that but it's some time off. We believe that the commitment that PJM has made and their board has made to addressing this process or to addressing these revisions to the process, will be done in a timely enough manner to allow FERC to review and make judgment before the next auction. So we feel good about that part of it but it's too early to speculate on value proposition here.
Hugh Wynne - Sanford Bernstein: Just a follow-up on that. You've in the past, obviously have been quite bullish in your forecast about energy prices in PJM and to a certain degree that's played out. Yet the decision to invest when it was taken was taken in Texas. Could you comment on the relative economics of the two markets. Why you favor Texas over PJM and whether the prospective changes in the capacity market in PJM might allow you to make a similar new build decision in the future closer to your core markets?
Chris Crane: Sure. There is a couple of ways to look at that. One is, we have is still a significant upside to the energy and capacity market in PJM. The divestiture of our partial ownership in those assets will not be material, depending on which way the market goes. We have talked in the past about continued geographic diversification of our generating portfolio. ERCOT is a core market. It's not an adjacent market. It's one that we work in now with our wholesale and retail portfolio, our generating assets. We have continued to maintain a very positive stance on ERCOT and stated previously that we will continue to look for opportunities to invest in it. And that's what these units are. The technology, the Brownfield location, the nature of their cooling will allow them to to take a spot in the dispatch stack that will allow us to recover the value that we need for making such an investment. We continue to monitor the PJM market. The needs for generating assets. In some areas we are somewhat constrained based off of the market power, a view of where we would want to build plants or could build plants. But there may be potential opportunities coming forward as plants retire and the market tightens and the capacity market revisions come in that we might be able to deploy the technology that would give us the return on value that we are seeing in ERCOT market.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ali Agha with SunTrust.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: In the opening remarks you all had stated that in the gross margin numbers, taking out Safe Harbor and the three gas-fired plants, I think took out about $150 million annually from the gross margins. Just to complete that picture on a pro forma basis. If you take out Keystone/Conemaugh, how much further reductions should we assume just from a pro forma basis?
Jack Thayer: It would be roughly $150 million in 2015 in gross margin and about $100 million in 2016.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Just from those two divestitures?
Jack Thayer: Correct.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Got it. And then second question. Jack, you alluded to Pepco and the net impact in '17 from that acquisition. Can you remind me, the equity units, $1.15 billion, if I recall correctly, they have to be converted into equity in mid-'17...
Jack Thayer: That's right.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: At the then prevailing equity price. Is that correct?
Jack Thayer: That's correct.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Okay. And so in your [revision] (ph) obviously you...
Jack Thayer: Ali, obviously a floor of $35. We participate in the upside if the shares are higher at that point all the way up to a 25% premium.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Got it. Okay. And so in your math obviously you have made that conversion when you were running that math?
Jack Thayer: Absolutely.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Okay. And my last question for you guys. Chris, obviously you've been fairly active on the divestiture front with your capacity. You are building Greenfield plants in Texas. As you look at the landscape right now, are you seeing more opportunities to buy or sell given the kind of prices that may be out there for existing assets?
Chris Crane: Yes. Just to clarify, the assets in Texas are on Brownfield sites and that helps their cost basis significantly with the infrastructure to support the plants already being there. Right now the market has priced assets higher than we, in some cases higher than we can see that value ourselves. And we have participated, will continue to participate in the sales process looking at the potential purchase of assets as they come to the market. But they have been trading at, as we see, a premium. And that was what led us to the divestiture of some of the assets that we have. They didn't have the earnings capability with their dispatchability and their capacity factors or the nature of the agreement of ownership that we value them as well as others in the market are willing to pay. So we don't see much more in the way of asset optimization beyond what we have discussed previously. We will continue to participate. But we do see other markets as a potential investment on a new build. If it's peakers in some areas or highly efficient units in others. But don't expect to see a lot of transactions either way just because of the market values on them right now.
Operator: Your next question comes from Paul Fremont with Jefferies.
Paul Fremont - Jefferies: I guess my first question is that PJM is talking about incremental auctions as part of their capacity performance transition plan. Can you speak to the effect of re-running past auctions on retail contracts that you currently have outstanding and whether those contracts would somehow have the ability to reprice?
Jack Thayer: First of all, we think the impact would begin in '16,'17, so not in the '15, '16 timeframe. And as you know, most of our contracts are called within that 30 month tenure. Contracts that would be affected we believe on the fixed price side contracts that the change in law clause would be relevant in this instance, and we would invoke that given the changes that we are talking about.
Paul Fremont - Jefferies: So you would have some ability to pass through the cost?
Chris Crane: Correct. To our retail -- in most instances. There are instances on our retail customers where you can't but in most instances you can.
Ken Cornew: And, Paul, this is Ken. I would just add that we have been aware of this situation or what I would call exposure risk and are treating it appropriately in our pricing of customers as we continue to compete for them.
Jack Thayer: And the retail component of it is only one side of it. As you transition into these things there is going to be a generation benefit on the other side. So you would have to look at the net effect of all that.
Paul Fremont - Jefferies: And then when we think of the capacity performance market and what you are asking for potentially either in New England or New York with your nuclear plants, what would the implementation of this type of a scheme by PJM do with respect to your desire to have some form of fixed price protection for the nuclear plants?
Jack Thayer: I think what Chris has been saying is, we are not looking for fixed price protection in the way of a PPA or a guarantee of a price. What we see the reform is doing is, in the first instance, curing a real reliability problem that we have in PJM. The problem that we see growing worse over the next few years. And that's the first and most important focus of our work. What it will do is it will provide potential additional compensation for firm fuel resources. Resources that are reliable, like nuclear units. And it will punish resources that don't perform well. And what we saw out of this past winter is a lot of units did not perform well and that's created a real problem that needs to be addressed. But it really, it doesn't relate, I don't think to anything that would provide a guarantee of a payment for the nuclear assets. It's not nuclear specific. Any unit that performs well and secures its fuel will have the opportunity to earn a little bit more. Those units that don't perform well and don't have firm fuel will be exposed to severe penalties for non-performance which is the way it should be.
Paul Fremont - Jefferies: I guess I'm still not understanding. So what additional support would the states potentially be providing under in terms of compensation for those units?
Jack Thayer: I think we are mixing two things. We are mixing a reliability need that's going to be addressed by the PJM reforms. The reforms in terms of 111(d) and zero emission energy is the focus of our work at this day. And as Chris said, over the last six years Illinois has passed laws that essentially provide market-based credit opportunities for all types of zero emission energy with the exception of nuclear. And the focus of our activities in Illinois will be to include nuclear and give it an opportunity to compete on a best price basis for those clean air attributes.
Chris Crane: We have made it clear over the last three years in a very pointed way the unintended consequences of subsidizing one clean source against another. And the unintended consequences come to roost. And so what we are trying to is fix what has happened between the subsidized PTCs and other forms of enablement for those more expensive sources to come to market. So we are looking at the market fix in what would be a fair treatment of all the renewable or clean generating assets within the market.
Paul Fremont - Jefferies: And then my last question is, in Texas, what would you estimate is sort of the lower cost to build at your existing site per KW?
Chris Crane: Yes. We have said we are spending about $1.4 billion on these plants and they are going to be in excess of 1000 megawatt each. So you can do the math. It's going to be our around 700 a KW.
Operator: And your last question comes from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.
Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets: You touched on this a little bit, but could you just go back to kind of the upside that you saw in the third quarter. Was it all ExGen or was it at the utilities as well?
Ken Cornew: The benefit in the third quarter was exclusively ExGen.
Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Did it make up for some shortfalls at the utilities?
Ken Cornew: You had some storm expense at the utilities. Then you also had elements of the decline in interest rates around treasuries factoring into our earned return at ComEd.
Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets: So relative to your guidance, the utilities underperformed and that was more than offset by ExGen?
Ken Cornew: I would say they modestly underperformed and it was meaningfully offset by ExGen.
Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Great. Thank you, very much.
Francis Idehen: Okay. Thank you, very much. That will conclude the third quarter call.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2014 Q2  (2014-07-31 10:00:00) =====
Executives:  Ravi Ganti – Vice President-Investor Relations Christopher M. Crane - President and CEO Jonathan W. Thayer – EVP and CFO Joseph Nigro – EVP-Exelon; CEO-Constellation Joseph Dominguez – SVP-Federal Regulatory Affairs & Public Policy 
Analysts:  Dan Eggers – Credit Suisse Steve Fleishman – Wolfe Research Greg Gordon – ISI Jonathan Arnold – Deutsche Bank Hugh Wynne – Sanford Bernstein Angie Storozynski – Macquarie Capital  
Operator: Good morning, my name is Amy, and I’ll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the second quarter 2014 earnings call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Mr. Ravi Ganti, you may begin your conference.
Ravi Ganti:  Thank you, Amy. Good morning everyone, and thanks for joining our second quarter 2014 earning conference call. Leading the call today are Chris Crane, Exelon’s President and CEO; Jack Thayer, Exelon’s Executive Vice President and CFO, and Joe Nigro, CEO Constellation. They are joined by other members of Exelon’s senior management team, who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. We issued our earning release this morning along with a presentation, each of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of Exelon’s website. The press release and other matters that we discuss during today’s call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. The actual results could defer from our forward-looking statements, based on factors and assumptions discussed in today's earning release, comments we do in this call, and in the risk factors section of the earnings release. Please reported today's 8-K and Exelon’s other fillings for a discussion of factors that may cause the results to differ from managements projections, forecasts, and expectations. Today’s presentation also includes references to adjusted opening earnings which is a non-GAAP measure. Please report to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and the earnings release for reconciliation between the non-GAAP measures to the GAAP earnings. We have scheduled 60 minutes for this call. I’ll now turn the call over to Chris Crane, Exelon, CEO.
Christopher M. Crane: Thanks, Ravi. Good morning to everybody and thank you for joining. We had a good quarter overall, but before I get into those details I wanted to start today’s call by re-emphasizing Exelon’s long-term strategy. Our strategy is to continue to leverage our integrated business model to create value, invest for growth, and explore ways to diversify our business into other areas of the energy value chain. The utilities provide stable earnings in dividend support and allow us to reinvest in projects to strengthen the infrastructure. Our competitive business provides commodity upside, and the platform to diversify into adjacent markets. On the regulated side, the Pepco Holdings transaction provides an opportunity to accelerate our regulated growth, and provides stable cash flows, earnings accretion and dividend stability. The geographic fit in the operational synergies provide us the opportunity to deliver better customer service. On the Genco side, we continue to look for ways to grow in the existing markets we serve, and diversify into other related areas. Our partnership with Bloom Energy Fuel Cells is aligned with our goals of keeping up with our customer needs and the growth demand for distributed generation. Our acquisition of the Integrys Energy Services business allows us to expand our retail footprint further in an industry that continues to mature, consolidate, and provide hedging diversification benefits for our existing portfolio. Similarly, our interest in the Annova LNG is another example. We are significant participants in natural gas market, managing approximately 1.4 trillion cubic feet of gas on an annual basis. This project fits nicely in this business and aims to develop mid-scale, LNG facility near Port of Brownsville, Texas. It’s in its early stage of screening for development with very little financial commitment for us at this moment, but has significant potential upside. So you can expect that we will continue to look for, and find diversification opportunities that leverage our expertise and strengths. Moving on to the quarterly results, we posted a solid quarter with operating earnings of $0.51 per share, which is just over the upper end of our guidance range. For the full-year, we are reaffirming our guidance range of $2.25 to $2.55 a share, which we provided to you at the beginning of the year. Jack is going to go into more details about the earning in our financial performance in his remarks. On the operational front, we had a solid operational performance at our nuclear fleet this quarter. We achieved 91.8% capacity factor while completing five refueling outages during the second quarter. After completing our spring refueling outages, we ran at 98.8% for the month of June. These capacity factors include our ownership share of the CENG plants, which became integrated into the Exelon operations platform on April 1. Our gas renewable fleets had a strong quarter as well with fossil hydro dispatch match at 99.2% and our solar and wind energy capture at 94.7%. ComEd and PECO had significant storms around the end of the quarter and on the last day of the quarter we had severe weather including multiple tornados in Illinois that caused service interruptions to over 420,000 customers in the ComEd service territory. PECO faced two storms on July 3 and July 8 that left more than 400,000 customers without power. In the matter of three days, or a little less, the power was restored to over 99.9% of those affected, demonstrating a storm response capability of our organization. I'd like to thank those personnel that were involved for the quick and rapid response. On the regulatory side, ComEd filed its most recent annual distribution and transmission formula rate update in April. BGE filed its electric and gas distribution rate in early July. In early June, the EPA came out with its much anticipated draft rule for greenhouse gas regulations for existing power plants that set limits on emission by 2013. We see this as a potential positive for Exelon, and we are pleased that the rule recognizes the critical importance of the Nation’s nuclear generation as vital to achieving the proposed standard. While it's too early to draw sweeping conclusions about state-by-state impact given the complexity of the rule in the time afforded to the states to respond, we think that our clean base-load nuclear fleet is well-positioned to take advantage of the potential changes in the stack composition and the generation mix that this will achieve. Let me give you a quick update on the Pepco Holdings transaction. So far we have submitted filings with Burke, Virginia, DC, New Jersey, and Delaware. We continue to expect this transaction will close in the second to third quarter of 2015. We've made progress on funding the acquisition as well. We had a successful equity issuance in June and asset sales are proceeding, including our sale of our ownership in Safe Harbor that is expected to close in the third quarter. Jack is going to go into more of the specifics around this area. Touching upon the state of the power markets. Despite the recent pull-back due to mild weather across the U.S. and higher gas production and injection rates, the forward power prices are still higher year-to-date. 14 gigawatts of coal assets that are set to retire in the PJM footprint by next year are still operating. Current weather and expected gas storage levels are going to dictate the forward power prices in the near-term. We saw high, spot wild volatility in the markets during the first six months of the year, and have seen higher risk premiums and margins for wholesale and retail load products. We aggressively hedged during the quarter, and moved closer to our ratable hedging strategy capturing the upside prices we saw during the quarter. Joe Nigro is going to go into more details in his comments. On the PJM auction results, as you know, the auction cleared at $120 a megawatt day, it was higher than most anticipated due to primarily, the rule changes around lower imports, lower demand response, and participants bidding behavior. We think the results are encouraging for our plants that cleared, but there is an opportunity for further improvements in the market rules in the future, such as, firm fuel commitments, anti-speculation rules, and with the recent ruling, court ruling looking for clarity on the role of demand response, energy efficiency in the capacity markets. Our nuclear units: Oyster Creek, Quad Cities, and Byron, five in total did not clear the auction. For Quad Cities and Byron, these units are important for grid reliability, environmental and from an economic standpoint, are especially critical in helping Illinois meet its environmental goals in light of the recent EPA rules. To that extent, Illinois House passed a House Resolution 1146 in May recognizing the value of nuclear energy for its reliability and its carbon-free benefits and urged the expiration of our opportunities to avoid closing nuclear plants. We have agreed not to make any decisions about retiring these units until June of next year to allow for the Illinois legislature time to enact market-based reforms at the state level that this could be items such as joining Reggie or a clean energy standard. However, as we’ve said in the past, if we are unsuccessful and we do not see a path to sustain profitability for these units in question, we will be forced to retire them to avoid long-term losses. I do want to be clear, again, about one thing, we are not looking and do not want contracts for subsidies from Illinois, only contracts that recognize the environmental benefit in the reliability of the assets. To wrap up, we’re confident our fleet operations in our portfolio management to deliver our earnings expectations for the full year. A key area of focus for us during the second half of this year is to continue working through regulatory approvals to close the Pepco transaction. We will continue to look for opportunities to invest in assets that add value to Exelon and to its shareholders and ways to diversify our portfolio. With that, now I’ll turn over to Joe Nigro to share his views on the commodity markets.
Joseph Nigro: Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone. We wanted to take some time to talk about power markets developments this quarter, as well as year-to-date. I will also touch on our generation hedging strategies, discuss the results of the 2017-2018 PJM capacity auction, provide an update on those margins. And finally, tell you how this translates to our gross margin forecast. Moving to Slide 3, the spot power markets in the first half of the year have been defined by volatility. We have had six months of very constructive spot market signals, followed by July weakness due to weather conditions. In the first quarter of this year, the polar vortex led to higher spot prices in PJM, as we observed the growing reliance on resources such as natural gas units, demand response and oil peakers. Throughout the second quarter, we saw spot power prices were higher than what we saw during the same period in 2012 and 2013. Expanding heat rates have been observed under most load conditions. These higher delivered heat rates can be attributed to the change in generation stack. During July, we’ve experienced, unusually mild weather leading from lower spot power and deliver natural gas prices across the board. Cooling degree dates are trending approximately 10% below normal at a national level, and 35% below normal in the NI Hub area. Due to the lack of weather related demand in July, spot prices in PJM have been clearing lower than the previous two years. Moving to slide 4, I’ll discuss the forward market and its impact on our hedging profile. It has been a volatile year for forward power prices. The second quarter of 2014 was a continuation of the trend we saw in the first quarter, in terms of an increase in both power prices and heat rates at the NI Hub and West Hub markets. During the second quarter, forward NI Hub, around-the-clock prices for 2015 and 2016 increased approximately $2 to $3 per megawatt hour, while West Hub prices increased by close to $2. A lot of the increase with in line with our long-held that power prices should increase, giving the ongoing changes to the generation stack associated with coal plant retirements, and an increased reliance on natural gas supply and other high priced, non-based load resources. During the second quarter, we were able to take advantage of the rising power prices and move our behind ratable strategy, as well as our cross-commodity hedge position closer towards ratable. And we have been operating behind our ratable hedging strategy for some time as we felt the upside in the market of both NI hub and West Hub warranted a more open position. During the quarter, we captured the running forward prices increasing our hedge generation by approximately, 11% in 2015 and 9% in 2016. We also took advantage of market conditions by reducing the amount of our portfolio that was hedged with natural gas from near 10% to below 5% in both 2015 and 2016. In total, we reduced our power price exposure in 2015 and 2016 by 17% and 12% respectively. Our generation fleet is now hedged between 92% and 95% in 2014, 75% and 78% in 2015, and 46% and 49% in 2016. Since the end of the second quarter, we have seen forward markets soften due to the weather-related weakness in spot market. Forward prices for natural gas – natural gas basis, and power are down during the month of July. The move down is largely driven by decline in the prices for the winter delivery months. Specifically, PECO M3 natural gas basis is declined heavily in the winter months, which is led to a corresponding decrease in both West Hub and NI Hub power prices. Spot natural gas basis prices were strong in Q1, driven by weather conditions, but were lower in Q2 as weather driven demand backed off. The forwards responded accordingly with 2015 gas basis increasing through the first part of the year, only to decline during May and June. Our gas basis dues split into a short-term and long-term view. Over the next two years, we expect volatility to continue; while longer-term, we expect the stability in the Mid-Atlantic base is driven by the development of the infrastructure to transport gas away from the Marcellus shale area, expanding LNG exports, exports to Mexico, industrial expansion and gas demand for power generation. With respect to the forward power market, we still see upside price opportunity in certain non-winter months and seasons where we believe the markets are undervalued. While we have moved our hedging strategy closer to ratable, and more neutral across the calendar years in 2015 and 2016, we think there is an opportunity to benefit from power price upside in those delivery periods. We will continue to set our hedging strategy according to this view. Fundamentally, our view of power price upside has not changed. We understand that there are very short-term factors that can impact spot and forward prices, as we saw in the winter and then again, in July this year, weather by itself can have a significant short-term impact on the market. However, our view is grounded in the fundamental changes that are taking place in the market. Specifically, we expect about 30 gigawatt of coal generation to require – to retire across the Eastern Interconnect, by next year, with which approximately 14 gigawatts will be in PJM. Changes in this supply stock and more disciplined load pricing are just a few of the fundamental market changes we have witnessed this year. Before moving onto our gross margin update, I want to touch on the PJM capacity auction and then an update on our retail margins. The PJM auction cleared at $120 per megawatt day in both the RTO and NERC regions. The RTO clearing price doubled from the previous year’s auction, indicative of tighter supply demand fundamentals following coal retiring announcements. The clearing prices were primarily driven by 3,000 megawatts at lower imports, 1,400 megawatt of lower demand response, and participants bidding behavior. These drivers were partially offset by nearly 6,000 megawatts of new generation that cleared. There are further potential market design changes that we will continue to monitor, which will impact future capacity prices as well. Some examples of this include uncertainly regarding the impact on capacity and energy markets of the DC Circuit Court vacating FERC Order 745, as well as FERC in PJM working to curve speculation, potential changes to the shape of the demand curve and potential changes due to cold weather reforms. This was the first option that we did in some of our nuclear units at the rate CRs. And as a result, Quad Cities units one and two fired in units, one and two and Oyster Creek did not clear. As Chris mentioned, the failure of these units to clear will be a key factor in our decision and whether or not to shut down the plants. Our nuclear plants rely on the capacity market for revenues, and without those revenues, their economics will be stressed even more. We have committed that no decision will be made on any of our Illinois units before June 2015. Moving onto our load margins. So far this year, we began to see increases in both our wholesale and retial load margins, as providers become more disciplined in their pricing assumptions. We have and will remain disciplined in our list-premiums and will not chase volumes for the sake of volume. We continue to see an improving retail market developing to longer-term contracts and competitor consolidation. As many of you may have heard, yesterday, we announced the agreement to acquire Integrys Energy Services, a leading retail power and natural gas provider serving 1.2 million customers across 23 states and the District of Columbia. The Integrys portfolio adds further scale to our retail power and natural gas business and provides generation and load-matching benefits to our portfolio. We expect the transaction to close in the fourth quarter of this year or the first quarter of 2015. Turning to slide 5, I will review our updated hedge disclosure, and some of the significant changes given the events for the second quarter. Focusing on 2014, we have a net $50 million increase to gross margin, since the end of the first quarter, driven primarily by the elimination of deal in nuclear waste in, partially offset by an extended outage at Salem. As I mentioned before, our portfolio management teams performed very well in managing our portfolio generation and load given the volatile market. This contributed to us executing on $100 million of our power new business targets and $50 million of our non-power new business targets during the second quarter. For 2015, we saw pricing increase across most regions. The increase is around $2 per megawatt hour in the Mid-Atlantic and the Midwest. This along with the DOE fees resulted in an increase in our open gross margin of $450 million. Given our hedge position and our execution of $100 million of power new business, our total change in gross margin with an increase of $300 million. For 2016, prices increased by $2 to $3 per megawatt hour. This resulted in an increase of $600 million in our open gross margin, with a hedge position of between 40% to 50% for the quarter, and an execution of $100 million in power new business, our total change in gross margin with an increase of $450 million. Overall, the first half of 2014 has resulted in higher prices from where we began the year. While mild weather increased gas production and falling natural gas bases prices have challenged power prices during July. Although volatility in the market is likely to persist, we are also confident that gas and power markets are fundamentally stronger and were just a year ago at this time. Now, I will turn it over to Jack to review the full financial information for the quarter.
Jonathan W. Thayer:  Thank you, Joe and good morning everyone. I will cover Exelon’s financial results for the quarter. Our third quarter guidance range and update our cash outlook for 2014 including a discussion at the financing for the Pepco Holdings acquisition. I will start on slide six. As Chris mentioned earlier, Exelon delivered second quarter earnings of $0.51 per share, exceeding our guidance range of $0.40 to $0.50 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.53 per share in the second quarter of 2013. The key drivers of the reduction in earnings quarter-over-quarter were lower realized energy prices at Exelon Generation, offset by increased distribution revenue at the utilities. The cost of the extended outage at Salem, during the second quarter is offset by the elimination of DOE Nuclear Waste fee. I will go into greater detail on the quarter drivers at each of the utilities in a few moments. For the third quarter we are providing guidance of $0.60 to $0.70 per share. In April, Exelon received the operating licenses for the CEMG nuclear fleet and began operating those plants. Prior to closing, Exelon and Generation each accounted for its investment in CEMG under the equity method of accounting. After the close, we moved to a consolidated method of accounting and recorded all assets, liabilities, and EDF’s non-controlling interest in CEMG at fair value on Exelon and Generations balance sheet as of April 1. Ongoing operations will be included in the consolidated Exelon and Generation financial statements. However, these accounting changes do not materially change the earnings and cash flow for Generation and Exelon. For the full-year, we are reaffirming our guidance range of $2.25 to $2.55 per share. This guidance includes the impact of the elimination of DOE Nuclear Waste fee and is partially offset by increased outages primarily in the nuclear fleet at Calvert Cliffs and Salem. These outages and their impacts are expected to be a $0.12 per share drag for the year. As we stated before the full-year benefit of the fee expiration is around $150 million per year or approximately $0.11 per share. We do not expect Congress to act to re-instate this fee in the immediate future and therefore have removed it from all years of our gross margin disclosures. Turning to the utilities on slide seven, they delivered combined earnings of $0.25 for the quarter. Before explaining the drivers of each utility, let me provide a brief update on our latest load forecast. In general, we are seeing load growth year-over-year at ComEd and PECO. While BGE growth is flat for 2013. ComEd is seeing positive load growth of 0.8% across all three customer classes, led by 1.2% in the residential sector. PECO's overall load growth of 0.7% is led by 1.2% growth in the large commercial and industrial sector and offset by a decline in load in the small commercial and industrial sector. You can find our latest full-year load estimates in the appendix on slide 18. For the second quarter ComEd earned $0.13 per share compared to a $0.11 per share in the same quarter last year. The increase is primarily related to higher distribution revenues due to rate base growth from higher capital investment. PECO’s earnings were $0.10 per share for the quarter; this is up $0.01 per share from the second quarter of 2013, due to decrease income tax expense primarily due to additional tax repair benefits from February and July’s storms and redemption of preferred securities which resulted in a reduction of preferred dividends. As Chris mentioned earlier, PECO had two significant storm events in early July. Combined, these storms had a total incremental O&M cost of $10 million to $20 million and incremental capital cost of $10 million to $20 million. Despite these storms, and the ice storm in February, we are comfortable that PECO can still meet its full-year guidance range. BGE delivered earnings of $0.02 per share in the first quarter, a decrease of $0.01 from the same period in 2013, due to the increased O&M cost primarily due to bad debt expense, and labor, contracting, and materials partially offset by the increased distribution revenue. Earlier this month, BGE filed a rate case with Maryland PSC asking for increases of $117.6 million for electric and $67.5 million for gas. We expect the final order in late January 2015 with new rates going into effect shortly thereafter. As you know ComEd filed its annual formula rate case in April and we expect a decision from the ICC by December 12. And the new rates will go into effect in January of 2015. More information about the filings can found in the appendix, on slides 19 and 20 for ComEd and BGE respectively. Slide 8 provides an update of our cash flow expectations for this year, we project cash from operations of $6.975 billion, this compares to $6.2 billion last quarter. The variance is primarily driven by proceeds from divestitures and a decrease in OPEC contributions. As you know, we had a busy quarter, working on financings for the Pepco Holdings acquisitions. on May 30 2014, we announced that we had entered into a $7.221 billion bridge loan facility to support the transaction and provide flexibility for timing of permanent financing. We executed the first portion of the permanent financing with a successful equity issuance via forward sale, which priced on June 2011. we issued $1.2 billion in mandatory convertible units, and $2 billion in equity forward contracts, each of these transactions including green shoes, the proceeds of which may be utilized for accretive growth opportunities. As a result of the equity issuances, we reduced the bridge loan facility to $4.2 billion. We are well down the road with our asset sale program. in May we sold our Safe Harbor hydro facility to Brookfield capital for $613 million, or $375 million after-tax with an expected close in the third quarter. We’re also proceeding with efforts to divest Fore River, Quail Run, Hillabee and Keystone Conemaugh. We anticipated raising greater than $1 billion in after-tax proceeds from the divestitures, with the excess proceeds funding future invested growth. As a reminder, I’d like to point out a few changes made to the presentation of the projected sources and uses of cash from the first quarter due to the consolidation of CENG of Exelon. For the fourth quarter of 2013, we showed 100% of CENG cash flows, net of distributions reflected in the cash from operations line and the CENG distribution to EDF in the other line. Starting the first quarter, we have kept the CENG distribution to EDF in the other line. However we now include 50% of CENG’s CapEx in investing, while leaving all other CENG cash flows, net of distributions and cash from operations. As a reminder, the appendix includes several schedules that will help you in your modeling efforts. Now before I open the call for questions and answer, Q&A, I want to acknowledge that this is Ravi Ganti’s last call as VP of IR. Ravi is moving back East to become the Senior Vice President and Chief Commercial Risk Officer. I thank you for representing Exelon for the past two years. I also want to welcome Francis Idehen as the new VP of IR. Many of you on the phone have met Francis, and we at Exelon are excited to have him in this new role. That concludes my remarks. Operator, we’d like to turn it over to Q&A.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse.
Christopher M. Crane: Hey, Dan.
Dan Eggers – Credit Suisse: Can we talk a little bit more about kind of what’s going in the retail markets, (a) as far as what kind of margins and profitability you guys saw in the quarter. And then with the Integrys acquisition, how you think about the scale of selling power through retail channels relative to other ways of hedging your exposure?
Christopher M. Crane: Yes. Joe will take that.
Joseph Nigro: Good morning, Dan. The retail market remains very competitive. As you know, there’s a number of participants in all the areas that we’re in. I would say however since January, we have seen improvement in all of the retail markets. And it’s really happened on two fronts from our perspective. The first is just the premium – the rich premiums charge to serve load. And I’m talking both in the retail markets as well as on the polar side, have gone up with the increased volatility we’ve seen in the market. And then in addition to that, we have seen our margins on the C&I origination on the power side expand as well. And I think both of those things are positive. We have been saying for some time that we expected to see this happen, because we couldn’t get our hands around where the market was trading at effectively. I think from the Integrys perspective, it’s a really good [depth] [ph] for our portfolio from the standpoint of – the core products are power and gas, which dovetail nicely into our existing retail business. The 22 states that they’re in, also fit nicely with the geographies that we are in, and it is just a natural opportunity for us to grow the business that you see some of the competitors scale back.
Christopher M. Crane: The only thing I’d add to that, the nature of the business is still very competitive, as Joe said, there’s dozens and dozens of participants that are still in markets like northern Illinois. We expect upon closures that our combined footprint would be about 29%. I think it’s been over reported in a few outlets. And so 28% to 29%, but there again, as the contracts come up, it will be – that will be processed in a very competitive way. So we feel strong about the acquisition and we still think it supports a very competitive market.
Dan Eggers – Credit Suisse:  You guys have historically talked about kind of $2 to $4 margins for the retail business, where are you seeing new business fall within that continuum?
Joseph Nigro: Dan, we’re seeing – we’ve mentioned previously in the last six months that at one point, we were slightly below that $2 to $4 threshold for C&I originations. We’re now back over that $2 threshold that [core load] [ph] mid $2 and we’ve seen improvement. and as I mentioned in addition to that, on top of that, we’ve seen the actual risk premiums increase. So the increases did really on two fronts, but our margins alone are above that $2 threshold.
Dan Eggers – Credit Suisse: And I guess one other question kind of after the Pepco deal there was talked about, looking to buy more generation assets prospectively as well and maybe the asset sales freeing up even more balance sheet room. Can you just walk through the criteria, you guys expect as you look at buying assets in this market, and then with the volatility and power markets, we’ve seen in the last few months. How is that maybe affecting decisions or where you might want geographic exposure?
Christopher M. Crane: We continue to look at growing both sides of the business either through on the generation side, either through acquisitions or potential development projects. but they have to pass the test of accretion and over the period and a value proposition, a positive NPV, a contribution to earnings and free cash flow or EPS. We participate as assets come more recently. Assets have been going at higher valuations than we would put them in the portfolio for, but it will continue to watch as things come to market and run them through our models. They need to be generally in the markets that we’re serving and trying to grow into some of the asset optimization there we’re going through now. It is fairly back on a few of the assets that don’t have the good well run assets, good employee base highly reliable, but they don’t have the value creation in our portfolio, so continuing to optimize the assets as we go forward. As we’ve said previously, really interested in the Texas market, we see the economy there strengthening, we see the demand although not as fast as previously reported presenting opportunities for further growth in the wholesale, and retail opportunities, which would – with our business model, we’ve tried to match as much as we can the generation to the load and the portfolio.
Dan Eggers – Credit Suisse: Okay. Thank you, guys.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.
Steve Fleishman – Wolfe Research: Yes. Hi, good morning.
Christopher M. Crane: Hi, Steve.
Steve Fleishman – Wolfe Research: Hi. just first on the guidance for this year, have you incorporated any of this bad July weather, or August forecast in the range or not?
Christopher M. Crane: Yes.
Steve Fleishman – Wolfe Research: Okay, good. Is that that’s in your Q3 forecast as well?
Christopher M. Crane: Yes. But one of us said, yes. (Indiscernible)
Steve Fleishman – Wolfe Research: Okay. Good, and then just going back to the TEG transaction, retail. can you give us maybe any sense of the metric of what kind of valuation you might have paid for that business?
Joseph Nigro: Well, as we mentioned in the press release, Steve, we paid $60 million for Integrys, and assumed the working capital of approximately $180 million or so. I would say on an EBITDA multiple basis it’s close to or less than 2 times on an EBITDA multiple basis.
Steve Fleishman – Wolfe Research: Okay. And then this might be a bit of a farfetched question. But just curious, because you’ve been growing your renewable business at a decent amount and contracted generation. What’s your kind of take on this yield curve trend and is this something you’d want to kind of sell your assets to, given that you are probably selling for a lot now or you want to keep trying to grow the business, just how are you thinking it about it?
Christopher M. Crane: We like the business on the projects that you can get for the right value. It is on the renewables a free cash flow play and with the current tax rules that are there it’s a tax play. We have leaned more towards project financing. And we think that fits our needs better than a yieldco and in the long-term with what we see for the tax environment for these assets going forward. So we’re not heading towards yieldco or pushing assets into the yieldcos, we’re more continuing development in project financing assets.
Steve Fleishman – Wolfe Research: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with ISI Group.
Greg Gordon – ISI Group: Thanks. A couple of questions, first, I know you had a good update on cash flow in part from tax. Though, were those tax inflows contemplated as possible to the beginning of the year and you just excluded them from your guidance, because of you are uncertain on timing, or were they something new that developed over the quarter, and then should we assume a normal effective tax rate in the subsequent quarters in the next couple of years?
Christopher M. Crane: Greg, I’d say some elements were, I would say on the opportunity side. So we had some visibility. We had about $100 million improvements based on tax reimbursement for decommissioning trust funds. The Safe Harbor sale allowed us to accelerate some tax credits, so that pulled forward about $175 million. So we have had some elements that we had some visibility might come to fruition and with some successful settlements with the IRS, as well as very successful sale of Safe Harbor have created incremental opportunity there. On the effective tax rate side, we would anticipate about 31% to 32% consolidated effective tax rate on operating earnings for the year. And on the GAAP side mark-to-market earnings kind of caused that to have some variability around it. About the modeling purposes, I think you can safely assume the 31% to 32%.
Greg Gordon – International Strategy & Investment Group LLC: And in subsequent years, is that a reasonable bogey, or is it – should we assume something higher in lieu of any one-time tax monetization?
Christopher M. Crane: I think that’s a fairly reasonable level.
Greg Gordon – ISI Group: Okay. So consistent at that level.
Christopher M. Crane: Yes.
Greg Gordon – ISI Group: Okay. And then can we talk a little bit about gas and gas basis, working here with John we watched not just strip, but the monthly is in you have still got a pretty positive winter basis and a pretty negative summer basis that take along the three. But then at the Chicago City Gate basis hasn’t been nearly as volatile. What’s your – what is going on in the real-time market and what is your point of view on how – Exelon’s point of view on how we ought to think about gas basis?
Joseph Nigro: Yes. Good morning, Greg. It’s Joe. I think from the gas basis perspective, your point is right on. We’ve seen the Nov-March strip for next year, the M3 basis dropped since the end of June about $0.50, and inversely as we tied in early May, it’s dropped almost $1. and to your point, really the summer periods since the end of June for that M3 basis hasn’t fallen at all, we’ve dropped some, since the high at the end of May; Chicago has been much more stable. From our perspective, there’s a couple of things obviously, the strong Q1 spot prices had a big impact on driving the forward prices higher, both in the winter and summer period. Most we’re seeing an impact that drag through to the forward curve on what’s going on in the spot market. I mentioned in my prepared remarks how we’re 35% down on cooling degree days in Chicago and 10% national. That’s having an impact in the gas market, both the NI Hub and drag through the basis. I think specifically, the M3 basis, where it’s going to continue to see some of this volatility in the next two years or so. As we continue to produce more gaps with the Marcellus shale, we’re producing about 15 Bcf a day. In Marcellus, we just don’t have the takeaway capacity and move that gas efficiently. As we get out towards 2017, we really expect that gas demand and supply demand balance that Marcellus could come into much better equilibrium, when you think about some of the pipeline reversals in TransCo and Texas Eastern and Rockies Express, which will provide an uptick and more stability to that gas basis.
Greg Gordon – ISI Group: So, when will you guys roll out how you’ve positioned yourselves for 2017 vis-à-vis hedging, and would we expect that perspective to be reflected in your positioning when you do so?
Christopher M. Crane: Yes. I think the way I would answer that is, first is, we’ll roll out 17 like we do every year with EER. And we do have a ratable program for 2017 began this year. We are impacted by gas basis just like everyone else by our open position. But I would also say as we convert to power sales obviously, we don’t have as big an impact on the gas basis doesn’t have as big an impact on us, once we sell the power, because we have so much long base load nuclear generation that it’s not impacted once the power sold.
Joseph Nigro:  But 17 will come out in EER.
Greg Gordon – ISI Group:  Thank you, gentlemen. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.
Jonathan Arnold – Deutsche Bank:  Good morning, guys.
Christopher M. Crane:  Good morning.
Jonathan Arnold – Deutsche Bank:  Could I just ask you to give us an update on how you see the whole kind of discussion in Illinois around these market base solutions playing out? I guess you said you weren’t taking any action on plans till middle of 2015. The legislature is going to come in for a veto session in November, and then be back in the early part of next year. What’s going on currently, if anything, and how is this actually going to move forward?
Christopher M. Crane:  I’ll get Joe Dominguez just to cover his action.
Joseph Dominguez:  Sure. What’s going on currently is that the Illinois stakeholders are taking a look at the 11B proposed rule, which obviously, provide the strong signal to the states to preserve nuclear as part of their compliance plan. The other thing that is happening is part of the resolution that Chris mentioned at the asset, state agencies are drafting a number of reports that will look at the economic value of the units to the local communities, jobs, the value of the energy produced, the value of the low resources.  And so we expect those reports to be completed sometimes around November or December positioning us for a discussion of solutions in the spring session. So I think the first time we'll see the actual legislation and different proposals will be in the spring. As Chris mentioned, we're looking for a market solution to the extent that low carbon resources, enhanced reliability, or attributes. We'll expect the compensative for those attributes and we’ll expect that competition really at all of the plants and not just the plants that are in jeopardy. So that’s our go-forward plan. I think that’s the timing.
Jonathan Arnold – Deutsche Bank: So the next thing we’ll probably see will be this reports coming out towards the end of the year.
Jonathan W. Thayer: That’s right.
Jonathan Arnold – Deutsche Bank: And then, would you say that the stakeholders’ interest in that is entirely dependent on 1011D, well does that kind of run. Is there a chance we move on this regardless of what happens with EPA and carbon?
Christopher M. Crane: The state has long positioned itself as focused on environmental issues. And they have individually, as the state take actions and advance of 1011D and looking at different programs that they maybe able to participate in, and we see this is helping them with the road map on going forward. So there is an interest within the state for that. There is also an interest within the stake holder body to secure the long-term viability of these assets, they’re greatly highly critical to the economy, local economy in which they are located in serving as tax basis, job basis, economic support for the community. So it’s a multifaceted view, but the environmental support has been a long-term focus for the state.
Jonathan Arnold – Deutsche Bank: Okay. Thanks, Chris. Can I just ask similar idea on a different topic on the various set of avenues you are pushing forward in terms of PJM market structure reform, could you give us an update on which of those is getting the most attraction and what your expectations are around timing and process there as well?
Christopher M. Crane: Joe you want to…
Joseph Nigro: So there is some unfinished business around the speculation reforms that have been proposed in advance of the last auction and set up some sessions to deal with that. We think that ultimately revise some of those speculation reforms for approval and advance the next auction. The other issue that is gaining a lot of attention, it’s an examination of the winter on a reliability situations I think has revealed some gaps in the capacity product that we have purchased thus for (indiscernible) consumers. So I think PJM is going to be looking at something that procures some additional commitments around high availability resources. I think that’s going to look a lot like resources that have firm fuel, like our nuclear plants. And I think it’s going to be characteristic approach where there will be additional compensation those units or enhanced reliability. And there is also going to be some enhanced penalties. And I think as an early model one might look to in that regard is what New England has done. I think PJM is going to look very carefully at that. So there will be some more money in the session, but also some more penalties for people who don’t perform. I think generally speaking PJM wants to be added a business of managing fuel supply for gas generators that has become a big issue and will become a bigger issue as the staff changes. And the other thing we saw is obviously generator non-performance in the winter, which really threatened the reliability of systems. So I figure we will see a proposal sometime in the next month from PJM with action bringing something to firm potentially by the end of the year depending on what the analytics look like.
Jonathan Arnold – Deutsche Bank: Would that run on typical PJM PRA schedule with an auction I guess second quarter or you see that happening on a different time frame?
Joseph Nigro:  Well. I think in the long run it’ll do just that, it’ll be part of the PRA and planning perimeters, we see going into the PRAs. But there is a question about these next few winters before we can catch up with the PRA schedule. So I think there's going to need to be something that will be supplemental for the coming winters. But, again, we need to see what PJM proposes. But I don't think it just truly to PRA plan. I think it’s going to be back in the next few winters as well.
Jonathan Arnold – Deutsche Bank: Okay. So the next month, you think that proposal is in that…
Joseph Nigro: Yes.
Jonathan Arnold – Deutsche Bank: Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Hugh Wynne with Sanford Bernstein.
Hugh Wynne – Sanford Bernstein:  Good morning.
Christopher M. Crane: Good morning.
Jonathan W. Thayer: Good morning.
Hugh Wynne – Sanford Bernstein: I wanted to follow-up on some of the discussion regarding Illinois response to 1011D. I think you had mentioned that rule provides an incentive to preserve the capacity of the nuclear fleet, and one point I also heard mention the possibility that Illinois might join RGGI. Could you comment more directly on what you've heard regarding the strategies of Illinois and Pennsylvania with a respect to their possible response to 1011D, their state implementation project?
Christopher M. Crane: I would say just first of all it's very preliminary. So I think there’s a couple of things that folks are looking for. It’s pretty clear that if you lose nuclear plants your ability to comply with any carbon regime going forward is going to be jeopardized. So plants produced tremendous amount of zero carbon energy, and so if you lose those you are going to see a big uptick taking in carbon efficiency and we see that states – were plants have actually retired. I think that's been fully recognized. What the vehicle for compliance will be is going to be the subject of discussions. I would guess at least a year and possibly longer. So I just think it’s too early to speculate on where they are going to go. I think some stake holders and see what’s been done in the RGGI states and find that appealing. But, we are there's a lot of grain before we get the solution on that.
Jonathan W. Thayer: I think the other thing to add is in conversation, this is a very complex rule and it takes time to digest as I think the state ones to ensure they understand the allotment are reduction goals they have given that they ensure that as they are given a fair shake in that, but it will be as Joe said it take a while.
Joseph Nigro:  If I could just add you asked about Pennsylvania as well. There I think the administration has not been predisposed to joining RGGI that the other candidate for Governor as indicated as part this platform that he would win RGGI if he is elected, so mostly what the elections results look like in November, and that will probably charge path there.
Hugh Wynne – Sanford Bernstein: Can I just ask a question on that front? The portion of your fleet that's in New York and in Maryland, of course, is already governed by RGGI. Is it important to you, and are you making initiatives to see that the rest of your fleet is also governed by similar rules? Or do you feel that PJM can operate flexibly with different state implementation plans in different states?
Christopher M. Crane:  I think we believe later. I think RGGI is a good choice. RGGI is just one of choices, as clean energy standard can work, a dispatch model where we pricing carbon and then dispatch resource through the RTOs, it works. There are a lot of solutions out there. We have supported the RGGI platform and the model of improvements and we’ll continue to support those states that are interested in that model. But it’s not the only solution. 
Hugh Wynne – Sanford Bernstein:  Great. Thank you very much. 
Operator:  Your next comes from the line of Angie Storozynski with Macquarie Capital.
Angie Storozynski – Macquarie Capital:  Thank you. Good morning. So, I wanted to go back to the questions about Integrys. I know a lot of questions have been asked. Have you incorporated the projected uptick in volumes and margins to your retail business in your gross margin projections?
Christopher M. Crane:  No. Angie, we have not.
Angie Storozynski – Macquarie Capital: Okay. So, the follow-up question is: How should we think about it? How big of a swing could it be? Also, is this for short power?
Christopher M. Crane: First of all, I think the first question is the uptick in volume would probably be approximately 15% to our retail power volumes. And our existing constellation retail power volumes, on the gap side the uptick in volume would be approximately 30% to the existing constellation volumes.
Angie Storozynski – Macquarie Capital: Okay. And I’m just trying to figure out if this very low multiple – does this very low multiple have to do with the fact that the portfolio was short – the 2 times EV to EBITDA?
Jonathan W. Thayer:  Yes, Angie, this is Jack. Clearly, Integrys didn't own generation to support that portfolio they had acquired has been hedged via the open market. It fits nicely with our generation footprint in the state that are active. And this will be an incremental avenue for us…
Christopher M. Crane:  Yes. And I would add to that Angie, the purchase with the mark-to-market exercise, so regardless if they were long or short, it would be an exercise in just mark-to-market, whatever positions they had on. It’s hard to speculate and then provide a more information to that.
Angie Storozynski – Macquarie Capital: Okay. That's fine. Now, should we expect that you will give us an updated projections for volumes and then margins for the retail business during the EEI?
Christopher M. Crane: Yes. That is correct. We will update it for EEI.
Angie Storozynski – Macquarie Capital: Okay. Then, given the correction in forward power curves since June 30, could you give us a sense roughly how big of a swing we are seeing currently in your total gross margin for 2015 and 2016 versus what you're showing from the slides?
Christopher M. Crane: Yes. If you are look at our sensitivity tables that we provide in our hedge disclosures. We show you a $5 change in power crises for 2014, 2015, 2016 respectively for PJM west and for NI-Hub, and we were roughly down about $3 in 2015 and 2016 respectively, so just backing into the math it’s approximately $150 million in 2015 and approximately $250 in 2016 and you could see that in the sensitivity tables we provide.
Angie Storozynski – Macquarie Capital: Okay. And then again going back to the retail business, I mean just to reconcile your views, so you are expecting, as we do, a growing volatility in power prices, and yet you are bulking up your retail business, which tends not to do well in a volatile power place environment. So are you comfortable with this strategy because you're still long power, or is it that you think that you're the last man standing in the retail business, and thus you will be paid for this additional risk that you're assuming?
Christopher M. Crane:  It’s definitely not the last man standing. It’s a (indiscernible) market with many participants in it. So I think, Joe could continue to cover this strategy, you touch that.
Joseph Nigro: Yes. I think Angie there is a couple of things. I think the first is intrinsically we believe in the logic of matching generation and load. And there is a number of reasons to do that it’s beneficial for us, because we don’t have to take our power output, over the counter market. The optionality of our units is efficiently matched with these load contracts. The locations in which we’re selling the load contracts matches nicely to our generation output generally. I think the second; the other side of it is the volatility piece. These contracts are renewing in a relative frequent period, that touch the phase and the volatility is reflected in those contracts. So it’s not like for being exposed that. If you go back six months ago, we were saying we didn’t think the market was accurately pricing the volatility in the right way. And when I was impacting the way we were executing our own quantity to retail. We have seen that improved and we thought it would improve and we are comfortable with it because it an efficient hedge for our total portfolio. And the margins had continued to expand.
Angie Storozynski – Macquarie Capital: Okay. My last question, not related to the generation business for once, we're still missing a filing in Maryland for your Pepco acquisition. Is there any reason why you're waiting to file in Maryland?
Christopher M. Crane: Yes. As we previously said we have multiple filings in at Maryland. And we had to time ourselves in our own workload. So we prepare the other one, first Maryland’s on a clock its 225 days, so we’ll be filing that one very shortly. But it is just the execution of the work we already have, in front of the commission in Maryland the work that we needed to do in front of the other commissions.
Angie Storozynski – Macquarie Capital: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Ravi Ganti.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Brandy and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Exelon Acquisition of Pepco Holdings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks there will be a question-and-answer session (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Mr. Ravi Ganti, Vice President of Investor Relations, sir you may begin your conference.
Ravi Ganti: Thank you, operator. Good morning everyone, thank you for joining us. Earlier this morning we made two announcements. Exelon plans to acquire Pepco Holdings in an all cash transaction and our first quarter 2014 earnings results. Materials and presentations related to the earning and acquisition are available on the investor relations section of our website. Our discussion in today’s call contains forward looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. You should refer to the first two slides of today’s presentation as well as information in Exelon’s SEC filings for a discussion of factors that may cause the results to differ from management’s projections, forecasts and expectations. Leading the call today are Chris Crane, Exelon’s President and CEO; Joe Rigby, Chairman, President and CEO of Pepco Holdings and Jack Thayer, Executive Vice President and CFO, Exelon. We have scheduled 60 minutes for today’s call. After the prepared remarks, we will open the call for Q&A session. With that, I turn the call over to Chris, CEO, Exelon.
Chris Crane: Thanks everybody for joining us this morning. Before we get to the topic that will focus on today’s call, our acquisition of Pepco Holdings, I want to spend a minute on our earnings for the quarter. We delivered on our financial expectations with earnings of $0.62 a share which was within the range of our – for our quarter. Our earnings for the quarter would have been $0.12 higher without the large outage in January – the outage at [indiscernible] nuclear facility and the impact of the severe ice storm in the PECO service territory. We are providing guidance of $0.40 to $0.50 per share for the second quarter operating earnings. We are on track to deliver on our financial goals for the full-year. We provided prepared remarks on the market portfolio strategy and advantage results along with our earnings release this morning, you can contact IR for any follow-up questions. We do have Ken Cornew and Joe Nigro in the room if there is specific that you want to touch on. Now move on to the topic that is the focus today. We’re extremely pleased to announce that we’ve reached an agreement to acquire Pepco Holdings. We’re doing is call from Washington DC and I'm very pleased to be here today with Pepco’s CEO Joe Rigby joining the call to share his views on the transaction, what it means or Pepco, the 2 million customers in the DC, Delaware, Maryland and New Jersey area. We think this deal is the right deal at the right time for Exelon. This is a strategic acquisition that results in a leading Mid-Atlantic electric and gas utility platform with the contiguous footprint that will serve almost 10 million customers in six states. This acquisition will add further sources of stable regulated cash to our portfolio and leverages our position as a leader in operating large urban utilities. Exelon will pay a cash consideration of $27.25. That translates to a 27.7 upfront premium based on last Friday's closing. We have committed financing via our bridge line in place to fund the acquisition and our strong balance sheet will enable us to source permanent financing for the purchase price using balanced mix of debt and equity along with cash on our balance sheet. Jack will talk through more of the financial details later but let me give you a few initial thoughts. This transaction is highly accretive beginning in our first year of full operations as a combined company. It’s accretive to the tune of $0.15 to $0.20 per share on a steady-state basis. It maintains Exelon balance sheet flexibility to continue to pursue further growth investment across all of our businesses. And it preserves the upside in Exelon value that we still see fundamentally expected to gain from the continued recovery in the power markets which have been strong since the first of the year. For Pepco Holdings customers, this transaction results in direct consumer benefits and enables further sharing of operational best practices across a larger suite of utilities. Let me turn your attention now to Slide 5 to talk more about the strategic benefits of this combination. The geographic fit of Pepco utilities within the Exelon utilities is a second to none. There's a natural overlap of our operations in the Mid-Atlantic. It will enable us to realize cost savings and improved reliability for all of our customers. And when it comes down to storm restoration, as we've had recent examples on how PECO, BGE and ComEd worked together to ensure that we got the lights back for our customers in the face of some of the worst storms we’ve ever seen in the last few years. This sizable utility platform also provides an opportunity for us to streamline processes, drive savings and improve efficiency in our day-to-day operations. We can drive performance through matrix based operating model. The acquisition also supports our belief in the value of an integrated utility model with a balanced mix of regulated and non-regulated cash flows and continues the upside for the shareholders, allows us to continue to have the upside for the shareholders from a power price recovery. We started to see recovery in the power markets as I mentioned come to fruition and the utilization of our balance sheet to particularly fund this acquisition maintains a leverage to a significant upside of the power prices. On Slide 6, we show the map of what our service territory will look like post merger. We’ve worked in close proximity to Pepco, Atlantic City Electric, and Delmarva Power for many years and we’re pleased with the prospects of making them part of the Exelon utilities. Slide 7 provides some facts related to the transaction. As I mentioned before, we're paying 27.25 per share for Pepco Holdings in an all cash transaction. There are no significant changes to our operation or governance from the company and I look forward to working very closely with Joe and Pepco management team as we work with the regulatory approval process and the integration plan. Our plan is to obtain all required shareholder and regulatory approvals to close the transaction in the second through third quarter of 2015. Slide 8 provides some additional context around the timeline for the regulatory process. A joint team for regulatory folks from both Exelon and Pepco are prepared to continue working together and in conjunction with stakeholders in various jurisdictions to secure all the necessary approvals. We expect all the regulatory filings to be made in approximately the next 45 days. Only Maryland has the stated clock on the regulatory process, we believe our experience learned from the Exelon Constellation merger will position us to secure the needed approvals by – as I said the second to third quarter of next year. I would like to now invite Joe Rigby to give his thoughts about the transaction, how it brings value to PHI shareholders and customers.
Joe Rigby: Thanks, Chris and I want to thank you and your great team for helping make this transaction happen. This is a great day for the Pepco Holdings family, our shareholders, employees, customers and our communities. We’re excited to join the Exelon team and to become part of a larger well-capitalized company that has better scale to invest in infrastructure, people and the local community. Our shareholders will receive an attractive premium of 24.7% for the purchase of their shares by Exelon. Chris Crane and Exelon are committed to building upon our significant improvements in system reliability, customer service and outage restoration. Exelon has experience in large urban cities like ours and is a value corporate citizen. We share a culture of continuous improvement, accountability, safety and commitment to our community. Our customers will directly benefit as a result of this transaction, including $100 million of customer benefits across Pepco Holdings service territories, the rate credit, low-income assistance and energy efficiency programs, a commitment to further improve system reliability and enhance storm restoration capability. This is a tremendous opportunity and Exelon is the right partner for taking Pepco Holdings to the next level. I’d now like to turn the call over to Jack Thayer, CFO of Exelon to discuss the financial of the transaction.
Jack Thayer: Thank you, Joe and good morning everyone. This is an exciting day for Exelon and our shareholders. The financial overview of the transaction begins on Slide 11. The acquisition of Pepco Holdings adds significant value for our shareholders. As Chris mentioned, it’s significantly earnings accretive in the first full-year after closing. The deal will increase earnings by $0.15 to $0.20 per share in 2017. The rapid growth of rate based, retained synergies and earnings of Pepco’s three utilities, combined with our financing plans for the transaction drive sustainable earnings accretion. As you know, Exelon has committed $15 billion in capital to ComEd, PECO and BGE to grow their rate bases over the next five years. The addition of the Pepco utilities to the Exelon family will add an incremental $8.3 million in regulated rate base. This in turn will increase our regulated earnings, add stable cash flows and add to our financial strength. Additionally the utility earnings from the pro forma company can fully support the Exelon dividend by 2015. The integration of the two companies will result in more than $250 million of net synergies over the first five years of which we can expect roughly one-third will be retained. Our past experience gives us confidence that we can deliver on these synergy targets. The Constellation integration resulted in significant savings and we believe we can achieve meaningful savings for customers and shareholders in this case as well. This deal brings substantial benefits to our shareholders and the contemplated financing approach preserves the upside to be gained from power market recovery. On Slide 13, you can see the earnings accretion, the rate base growth and continued strong credit metrics as well as a more balanced business mix on a pro forma basis with operating earnings, pro forma for the transaction. On slide 13 provides an overview of our financing plans. Our strong balance sheets coupled with the regulated nature of the transaction and the visibility into recurring utility cash flows affords us the opportunities to manage roughly 50% of the acquisition price with debt at Exelon corporate, taking advantage of an historically low interest rate environment. The remaining portion of the transaction will be funded with a mix of common stock, mandatory convertible securities and up to $1 billion of cash from the sale of non-core assets at Exelon generation. Our investment grade credit ratings at all Exelon and Pepco registrants are expected to be maintained. We have a bridge financing in place for the full amount of the acquisition which provides significant flexibility for the timing of permanent financing. That is particularly important given the long lead nature of the regulatory approval process. Going forward the combined company will continue to have a strong liquidity profile supported by $9.5 billion in revolving credit facilities. Importantly, this transaction delivers growth for the company and our financing strategy maintains balance sheet capacity for continued growth investment on both regulated and merchant side of our business. Now I will turn the call over to Chris for concluding remarks before Q&A.
Chris Crane: Thanks, Joe and Jack. We talked with all of you over the last few years and we’ve been relentless in our commitment to deliver value to our shareholders in all aspects of the business. We've taken actions to create flexibility to invest in growth while maintaining a strong investment grade balance sheet. You all know our fundamental view in the upside of power prices which we're starting to enjoy seeing come to fruition, that has not changed. We position ourselves to further benefit from the market recovery. We also believe in the need for strong infrastructure investment in our utility platforms. As Jack mentioned we are investing 15 billion in rate base over the next five years at ComEd, PECO and BGE. We now have a unique strategic opportunity to add Pepco Holdings to our company and continue to grow and diversify our regulated footprint. This truly is an exciting time for Exelon and we’re pleased to have had the time – to discuss this with you this morning and again I want to thank Joe Rigby personally and his team for allowing this transaction to go forward, with the culture of the companies are very similar and we look forward to learning from the Pepco organization and sharing some of the things we've learned over the past few years as we’ve improved the performance of our operation as they have also. With that, I will open it up for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) And your first question is from Dan Eggers [Credit Suisse].
Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse : Hey, good morning, guys. Chris, you've been talking for a while about ways or opportunities to deploy capital and all the alternatives that were out there with the goal of visible earnings and consistency and repeatability. Can you just walk through how you came to a regulated utility acquisition like this versus maybe renewable investments, and some of the things you have talked about and maybe how the returns compared to this versus what else you would have seen in the market?
Chris Crane: Sure, we’re in the market on all sides, the renewable opportunities that are coming to the market, the conventional generation opportunities, we continue to hunt for value in that area. And we've seen some of the conventional stuff go at higher premium that we’re not willing to commit to but we will stay in that market. As Jack said, we have considerable flexibility that’s been created on the balance sheet by this acquisition and it will not deter us from looking at opportunities when there is a willing partner on the other side to sell their assets. It is in a large part opportunistic, we were able to find a partner that saw the strategic sense in creating scale and so it’s more about timing and opportunity but we are still looking on a regular basis at anything that comes to the market or in conversations with folks that we think should come to the market. But we will continue to work on that, this will not deter or distract us from any of the power side, we will have an integration organization that will be led under Bill Von Hoene but it will lean heavily on the Exelon utilities to come up with the integration plan. In the meantime under Ken Cornew and Joe Nigro’s leadership we will continue with the Genco strategy independently as we operate these businesses independently and we think there will be future opportunities that will come our way and we will be able to integrate them into our platform equally as efficiently as we will do this transaction.
Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse : I guess maybe Jack, you can walk through how the balance sheet works that you were able to add that level of debt and still keep a lot of flexibility apparently for other investments and what kind of assurance you have gotten from the agency so far?
Jack Thayer: Sure, Dan, as you are aware, historically the rating agencies have looked at Exelon corporate and Exelon generation on that combined basis and our target FFO to debt metrics, if I was to pick one agency S&P as an example have largely viewed the corporate entity and the merchant part of our business as one and the same. With the acquisition of Pepco Holdings and the rebalancing of the earnings mix and re-rating of the risk perception related to Exelon corporate, what it affords is the opportunity to add significant incremental leverage at the holding company that absent this transaction we would not have otherwise been able to do. So as we think about adding $3.5 billion of corporate debt at the holding company in an historic interest rate environment where we can login long-term rates at very effective levels we see that marry up with the opportunity to invest in growing rate base at Pepco Holdings and the opportunity to marry that up with a strong operating overlap, we see this as a uniquely opportune time about – tap the debt markets but also add highly accretive investments to our overall mix.
Chris Crane: Let me add one thing to that, Dan, just to go back to some of the things we talked about, when we started to communicate last fall, our investment in the utility business, the 15 billion part of the strategy here is to have the utilities be able to cover our commitment to the shareholders on the dividend and within the next couple of years. So we've right-sized the dividend appropriately for the business, the utilities will be able to service the debt and dividend as needed at the holding company. And we can have more flexibility on free cash flow off of the generation business to continue to grow that side of the business. So from a strategic approach, this advances where we were hearing and strengthens our view on the strategy and structure of the entity while being able to use that quantity based cyclical – somewhat more cyclical to capture the upside, where we see fit.
Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse : I guess just to go back to my first question and then I will stop it. When you look at the value return of this to shareholders relative to the other options that have been out in the market, can you just maybe give a context or how the comparability of accretion or net value return worked for this deal relative to the other places where you could have deployed capital that you have seen or that you see in the market today?
Chris Crane: I will take a couple of the typical CCGTs that you were to have $752 million to $1 billion that have gone across the market, you can see accretion of a couple pennies at best on those type of assets. For something like this we’re using some equity and using more debt, you can see the accretion of $0.15 to $0.20, it is powerful. And so I think you could probably get fairly strong accretion if we were dealing with a fleet of assets to come in. On the renewable side, the investment thesis is not as much about EPS as it is about free cash flow, that helps enable us to do other things. So Jack, if you want to provide any clarification any more, go ahead.
Jack Thayer: Sure, Dan, I think as Chris mentioned, here we have a growing or an opportunity in invest in growing rate base and the opportunity for sustained investments and continued investment to further rate base opportunities versus, as Chris mentioned, once you get through the tax attributes of renewable investment, really does a very modest in some cases negative EPS contribution further out the curve and there it’s about velocity of return of capital and seeking out further opportunities to invest relative to, here we have a sustained opportunity to invest in infrastructure in a way that earns us a very attractive returns, that on a standalone basis that the incremental leverage at the holding company makes that much more beneficial when it comes to dropping EPS down the bottom line for our shareholders.
Chris Crane: But just to be clear, this does not preclude us from other growth opportunities on the other side of the business, it's a good opportunity at the time that we’re able take advantage of and it further moves our strategic focus down the road that as we discussed previously.
Operator: Your next question is coming from Greg Gordon [ISI Group].
Greg Gordon - ISI Group: I've got one question on the merger and one question on the quarter. So on the transaction, obviously Mr. Rigby and his team despite doing a pretty good job running their business had a hard time getting the type of rate relief they have needed to move their earned returns on equity up towards their authorized returns. When you think about the base case forecast that you are using to give us the accretion numbers, what do you assume your ROE trends are? And how much different are they under the Exelon merger case than they are under the standalone Potomac case?
Jack Thayer: In terms of what we assumed in our operating model when calculating the synergy it’s very much into Pepco Holdings projections that they used and recently rolled out in their communications at their analyst day, that’s very consistent with the Ivys [ph] projection for the company on a going forward basis. So to the extent that we are able to through synergies to speed, the opportunity to earn allowed ROEs that we’re able to through – continued performance improvements and improved storm response and other elements to earn higher allowed ROEs from our jurisdictions in New Jersey, Delaware, Washington DC and Maryland that would all be upside to the transaction. Obviously that’s something that that's we will be targeting as we’re integrating the companies and integrating Pepco’s utilities into our operating model. But right now in our transaction economics we just assume that Pepco continues on the path that it was –
Joe Rigby: No, I think as we went through the due diligence process as Jack mentioned, that obviously we provided all the information and I think what I am hearing Jack said is that there was no kind of remarkable upside that was assumed and the opportunity I think to realize the synergies and to be able to work that into the forecast I think it’s going to have a positive impact on the actual earned ROEs.
Greg Gordon - ISI Group: Segueing to the quarter. Looking at Slide 9, which is the 2013 versus 2014 comparison of ExGen -- the negative deltas into $0.09 from lower realized energy prices, higher procurement costs, $0.05 from nuclear and fossil output. So can you explain to us how we should think about this because clearly the retail business probably was on the wrong side of power price volatility in the quarter in terms of having a lot of demand and having to manage variable load risk? And at the same time your lowest cost resources were not available, so you can you kind of breakdown what happened that was sort of uniquely in the retail book in that $0.09? I think it's probably simpler when we think about the $0.05 just in terms of outage days but can you explain to us exactly what happened?
Joe Rigby: Greg, there is a number of things that are moving around when you think about – I assume your question is Q1 ’13 versus Q1 ’14, when you think about it, the thing is we had – when you hedge our portfolio, we had substantially lower energy benefitting PJM in the Midwest, in the Mid-Atlantic quarter over quarter when you think about ’14 versus ’13. The big driver in the Midwest was the roll off of the Comed swap, in ’14, still in the first quarter in ’13. In the Mid-Atlantic, it was just driven by energy prices. [Indiscernible] that was a positive hiccup but we review that all from lower energy. In addition to that, as you see on the Slide, we had some decrease in nuclear output and fossil output in ’14 and – we had a roll-off with long term contract in the Midwest, that’s why you add in to that as well and then when you get into the other regions, there is lot of moving pieces associated with it, in New England with the restructuring of our fuel contractor Mystic, we had a lot less generation output in New England than we did in 2013 and then in Ercot [ph], just like everyone else we faced some outages in the first quarter and that was from some gas unavailability down there. So there is a number of moving pieces. On the retail side, it wasn’t in the period --
Greg Gordon - ISI Group: So when I think about the $0.09 there isn't some -- there is not a meaningful portion of that let's say where you were upside down in your retail book, it's other factors like the roll off in contract?
Joe Rigby: No, our retail book, we managed it as we have talked to you about previously. We manage all of risk inherent in our portfolio in our wholesale book of business. So when you think about it, what we are doing is reflecting all of that in our disclosure and you see that. I would tell you, we face the same load charges, PJM for example, that everyone else did in the first quarter. But we also had an offsetting benefit of having generation and having the generation to load strategy it benefits us some although we did incur net cost to serve loads but that includes our wholesale load as well.
Operator: Your next question comes from Steve Fleishman [Wolfe Trahan]
Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Trahan: Could you maybe just be a lot more explicit on the financing plan for the different pieces and how much stock versus converts versus debt? And also the asset sales how you might most likely look at?
Jack Thayer: Sure, Steve, it’s Jack. So with respect to the financing side of the equation as we have discussed we will use a mix of convertibles as well as straight comment, we are still finalizing and we will finalize the mix of that as we go to market. And we will size that so that we’re tapping the substantial liquidity that exists in both those instruments and leverage the opportunity to tap different investor bases as we do so. Clearly the benefit of a mandatory convert is the equity credit we received while retaining opportunity for to share and the upside related to share performance during the duration of the convert. On the asset sale side as we mentioned we anticipate roughly $1 billion of proceeds from asset divestitures that we would use to fund this transaction, we would anticipate that those assets are in our non-core elements of our business. So when we think about maintaining the exposure to a power recovery where that exists most significantly is within our nuclear fleet, we would be looking to sell certain awful [ph] assets that have appreciated considerably in value and given the valuation methodologies in terms of how we are valued relative to IPPs or private equity firms, those assets can or likely to be more valuable in a private equity firm or IPP sense, you can use significantly more leverage than we can in our capital structure. And the loss of earnings associated with those assumed divestitures is incorporated into the $0.15 to $0.20 of earnings accretion calculation. So clearly we see that as an opportunity to sell assets that on a relative basis contribute less earnings to our overall EPS and invest those proceeds in a growing utility investment.
Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Trahan: And just a clarification on the asset sales. Are those assets that likely had debt on them as well so that we should use the $1 billion as a mix of debt and equity, or is the $1 billion replacing what otherwise would be equity issuance for the deal?
Jack Thayer: The debt that we have is at Exelon generation, so there's not plant level specific debt, we would anticipate that, $1 billion of proceeds is in lieu of equity used in the transaction.
Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Trahan: Last question on this, will you probably wait until you have close to all approvals to execute on these funding plans?
Jack Thayer: The bridge is in place for the duration of the approval process. We have the opportunity to issue at any times or during that bridge being in place and I think we will – as we get further into integration process, into the regulatory approval process, we will stare down and look at when is the appropriate time to look to issue equity. Certainly we have some big valuation of that is coming, the upcoming capacity auction, a summer with a tightening supply demand mix and an upcoming winter as well, so we have a lot of flexibility around when we might think about tapping the equity market and the convert market.
Chris Crane: Just one more thing to add on to that, Steve, the asset rationalization was going forward with – on the annual basis we look at core assets, their valuation, market valuation, look at non-core assets and we had determined that we were going to adjust the portfolio –
Operator: Our next question comes from Julien Smith [UBS].
Julien Smith - UBS: So, quick question if you will, going back to Dan's first starting point here. What is the ideal composition of regulated versus merchant? If you think about the company down the line are you going to follow your peers on the diversified side and become more regulated, or ultimately do you think about yourselves as having a meaningful commodity kicker to yourself?
Chris Crane: We still are very supportive of the commodity side of the business. This is not a mandatory diversification that we had to do because of any balance sheet tightening, it is about creating value and the opportunity that we have with it. There's not a fixed 65, 55% regulated to merchant. What we learned in the last downturn of the commodity cycle that we are coming out of is that we need to make sure that our commitments are sized to be able to be sustainable in that the investment thesis and the strategy for both sides of the business can stand on their own. So what we want to have it is regulated revenue that continues to grow at a reasonable CAGR as we make our investments in that side that support any debt or dividend requirements that we have at holding company which we think is a rational strategy on how we should size and pursue and invest going forward. We do not want to over lever that the holding company that to a point the utility businesses that we’re investing in, or acquiring would not able to service debt requirement we don't want to size the dividend to a point that it can’t be reasonably serviced to provide value back to the shareholders. And we also want to have the flexibility which this transaction maintains for us to be able to invest in the merchant side, the competitive side of the business in electric and gas assets as we go forward.
Julien Smith - UBS: Now, second question here, going back to the balance sheet. When it comes to credit metrics I would be very curious how much incremental leverage beyond the transaction does this create by shifting your regulated profile?
Jack Thayer: Julien, as you might anticipate, we’ve been in dialogue with the agencies and in the re-risk rating of the company pro forma for this transaction and the ability for both utility as well as merchants cash flow service the debt at the holding company we left ourselves room to make further incremental investments whether they be regulated or merchants in nature. So we clearly could have learned more heavily on the fixed income markets and made this transaction even more accretive. We felt the appropriate and balanced approach was to leave ourselves powered because as we’ve experienced from time to time particularly in moments of significant volatility whether it be in the retail business or whether it be in other parts of the merchant chain, it’s generally good to have powered should opportunities present themselves.
Julien Smith - UBS: And how does that jive with dividend expectations? Obviously it's a more regulated profile, what is the thought process?
Jack Thayer: I think the thought process is post this transaction the utility can be a 100% funded – dividend to be a 100% funded from the utilities, the speeds – we were already on that path, this clearly speeds that and it gives our board of directors significant flexibility around how they -- with Chris’ guidance may choose to return capital to shareholders.
Julien Smith - UBS: But you are not committing to a payout off of the utilities or anything like that?
Jack Thayer: We are not.
Operator: Your next question comes from Paul Ridzon [KeyBanc].
Paul Ridzon – KeyBanc: I'm just wondering, I know Pepco and BGE tried to get married once and Exelon has got history in New Jersey. Have you had any dialogue with regulators? –
Chris Crane: We’ve had some initial outreach with regulators to explain what the value proposition is for their stakeholders, so we learned a lot from some things that worked and some things that haven't worked in the past. We put that into our regulatory strategy in Maryland when we were able to secure the acquisition of Constellation and BGE 10 and half months and our regulatory team is ready to approach this one in the same way with, making sure we get our filings in, there's no delay on that, making sure we engage and open the dialogue up with regulators. The regulators have a tough job to do, they have to prove that this is in the best interest of the consumer and but we believe that we have prepared a package that shows that by our commitments that we’re making. And we will engage - I wouldn’t expect to hear a reaction from any regulator publicly. They have to see what we put in writing what we offer they have to go through the process. This is a tough job for them to do but we at the end of the day see a success path or we wouldn’t be doing it.
Paul Ridzon – KeyBanc: Again, just a follow-up question shifting gears, can you give us an update on Illinois and any movement on legislation that would ascribe a little more value to the value of nuclear?
Chris Crane: Yes, that story has gotten away from this, we continue to say we are not looking for legislation for a bailout of the competitive nuclear fleet in Illinois. We believe that is a market issue that our units are not being compensated for the firm fixed fuel that they provide in the capacity market and we're not being compensated for the clean carbon free generation that they are providing. So our focus on creating value for the nuclear fleet is more around market design and at the federal level. We pushed hard that, above and for a few years talking about the unintended consequences of the PTC and the concentration of excess wind generation and the pricing issues that it has in the Midwest primarily that is still what we’re pushing on. We have – we said a couple years ago it was going to be a problem, it has become a problem. There's a few ways that that we can get compensated for that, that as you all know we are working on. The market issues in the capacity market PJM, those changes coming to fruition, some of the short-term changes and the work that we need to do in the stakeholder community, to recognize the vulnerability that the grid has, we will be incurring with dependency on gas and we saw that during the polar vortex. So when we load at core, we load it for 18 to 24 months, it can run through any weather situation. It’s not dependent on fuel being delivered on an hourly basis or wind blowing. So that’s the stuff we’re working on. We believe in the competitive market, we don't believe in the subsidized market. We need to be compensated for the value proposition on the plan and that should not be a bailout from the state.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jonathan Arnold [Deutsche Bank]
Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank: Just curious as you sort of think about the company post this transaction and on the business mix issues you’ve addressed, does this give you the capacity to be a little less hedged than sort of sort of bet more heavily on your favorable view of the markets and maybe this be an opportunity just to update us on how you are seeing liquidity in those forward curves.
Chris Crane: From a macro level in servicing our commitments on the value of the dividend and making sure that we maintain the strong balance sheet this does contribute to that focus. All that Joe talked about the liquidity and where we are out with the hedging strategy.
Jack Thayer: Hey Jon, good morning. There is a couple of things we have said. We have seen liquidity begin to pick up in the marketplace, first to first of the year, that's too pretty much all the regions and in particular importance for us. We have seen liquidity in the NI-Hub and we believe a lot of that is in the back of what happened in January and February with some forward broadcast in some of the price appreciation and more importantly the volatility depreciation we saw and some of the retailers coming back to the market. I think from a hedging perspective, we really have already see it at the approach being less hedged. If you look at our disclosure, normally when you look at 2015 by the end of the first quarter of ’14, we should have been about 75% hedged. Our total portfolio is approximately 65% and we have been cleared that about 10% of that is in natural gas. So, we really have about 20% incremental exposed to the power market and we have had about half of that so about 10% incremental as to where we should be in ’16 as suppose to the power market. So we’ve really looked at and already beginning to be more aggressive and we work very closely taking into account with our balance sheet commitments are and making sure that we are aligned all of that.
Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank: So there is an angle that is giving you -- having a more regulated base but it gives you the ability to take a little more risk in the merchant business?
Unidentified Company Representative: Yes, I agree.
Unidentified Company Representative: Jonathan, clearly the message on our side is we have faith and belief in the power of recovering. We have maintained substantial exposure to that power recovery. We are seeing in the first quarter and we saw on our hedge disclosure, the meaningful uplift and impact of improving prices. We have seen significant improvement in prices subsequent to that and anticipate further market recovery particularly in the NI-Hub market as we go further out the curve. From a balance sheet flexibility standpoint, we already retained considerable flexibility and our ability to lag ratable where we didn’t believe fundamental supported current marks. We have exercised that perspective and most importantly we have been right and exercising that prospective. And as Joe mentioned, we continue to keep that considerable exposure in place as we anticipate further market recovery. So in all instances, while this does improve our earnings mix of regulated versus merchant, we do anticipate as the power market recovers will get to that roughly balanced 50/50 mix that Chris has communicated as being roughly optimal for our business.
Jack Thayer: Just to be clear as I said earlier the strategy that we were moving to is to have a value return proposition through our dividend that is funded to a more classical or typical methodology with the regulated entities dealing up to the holdco and in those entities servicing any debt that would be at the holdco so naturally that does allow us that those commitments are made that allow us flexibility on the generating side to verge as the analytics would tell us to on being able to capture the upside or if we think we are high then we could hedge out further.
Unidentified Company Representative: Certainly, just one caviar, certainly in the near term, both the merchant and the utility cash flows will support the holding company that as we see growth in the earnings power at the utilities that will the utilities will shorter more that.
Unidentified Company Representative: In the long term. Right.
Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank: Okay, and can I ask on, when you say 250 million, just a detail on the merger stuff, 250 million net synergies, is that net of tax, net of cost to achieve, net of something else, what is the, can you just kind of frame that number?
Jack Thayer : That is separate and distinct from cost to achieve. So as we think about cost to achieve and then the realization of those synergies would expect to retain roughly a third of the overall savings, it will get to a run rate. Synergy number of approximately $120 million to $140 million, we anticipate that our customers are the net beneficiaries of two-thirds of those savings and that we would keep roughly a third for the benefit of our shareholders.
Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank: Okay. So that way run rate is that 2017 that's the number in the 2017, $0.15 to $0.20 is that?
Jack Thayer : I would say further out, first of all yes and second of all as you do the math you will synergies is a very small elements of the accretion in this transaction, holding company that this transaction of boards. It’s the monetization of certain assets at higher value than what would be implied in our PE multiple and synergies are an important but very modest contributors to that in the $0.15 to $0.20.
Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank: Okay. And how should think about the customer fund? Is that something you would fund upfront as almost part of the purchase price or something that would kind of be funded over the time?
Chris Crane: It is intended to be given up front after approval as we integrate. So it is part of the cost to achieve.
Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank: Okay. I think that's and could I may be, could just one other thing and I am sorry if you have touched on this but what kind of assumptions you are making about end returns at the Pepco utilities?
Chris Crane: Jonathan, in terms of our earned returns, our internal forecast is very much look into the internal forecast of Pepco holdings. It's very much in line with the consensus estimates as you look with IBIS. In terms of, from a synergy standpoint, if that allows us to seed or getting closer to that earned return to reduce the regulatory lag if the operational benefits and uplift from improved operations supports higher returns all that will be up side to the economics that we communicated to you as part of this presentation.
Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank: Okay. Thank you very much guys.
Chris Crane: I think we have time for one more call?
Operator: Yes. Your next question comes from Michael J. Lapides.
Chris Crane: Good morning, Michael.
Unidentified Company Representative: Michael?
Operator: If your line is mute, please unmute your line.
Chris Crane: I think operator if you can go to the queue for the last and final caller.
Operator: Yes sir. One moment. Your next question is from Ali Agha.
Ali Agha – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Good morning.
Chris Crane: Morning.
Ali Agha – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Chris, one question, how comfortable are you with the new regulatory jurisdiction you are getting into. Obviously, Maryland you are very familiar with, but the other ones have been challenging to say the least and I am sure you would've been observing them. So what gives you confidence that you can handle those different than the way they have been handled in the past?
Chris Crane: Well, we think the way that Joe has taking the company, Pepco in the last couple of years, significant investment and reliability continue to develop the stronger relationship and his tenure in the position, we are comfortable in the direction we are heading. We understand the expectations of the regulator and will continue on the path that the Joe has taken the company in the last few years. The regulatory process is not easy in any jurisdiction and as I mentioned earlier, there is a significant responsibility upon the regulator to make sure that the utilities are providing the service level at the right economic point with reliability and safety of the system. We have to prove that we can do that in this case to gain approval and then we have the responsibility of maintaining our operations at that level to continue. So we believe we are strongly supportive and believe what Joe has done and what the Pepco team has been doing in their service areas and the path they continue on and we believe as it has been shown in the Pepco stand alone that things are very much improving.
Ali Agha – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: A separate question, in the past you've told us about that $2.00 to $4.00 uplift that you believe fundamentals justify in the forward curves, where do you think we are in that today?
Chris Crane: Yeah Joe will talk about that
Joseph Nigro: As Jack mentioned earlier, we have seen materially material improvement in each year end in the forward curve and if I look at not have worth about $5.50 and around the clock basis since the first of the year and was about $7.50 at west hub. As you see in our hedge disclosure that were up about $200 million to $400 million respectively in hedge group margins, 331 in ‘16. It will up about another $300 million in ’15 and approximately $400 million to $450 million in ’16 since 331. When you think about the upside, there is a big seasonal shape to lift at this point giving that we have seen big move in the winter GAAP basis and the underlying winter power prices but we still think ’15 to ’16 time period, there is is less than $2 of upside remains at Ni-Hub but there is still upside I mean on annualized basis. At the west hub, we think that most of it is pricing but again it's very seasonally driven and as you get out to ’17 and ’18, we see a little more up-sided Ni-Hub than we do in ’15 and ’16 and little more upside at west hub when we were doing ’15 and ’16. So it really seasonally driven at this point and we are taking an opportunity as we do hedging to the power price move to make sure that we are matching where we think the market is move. So our hedging is matching we are aligned to our views and what the market has done.
Ali Agha – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Got it. The last question, Chris and I am picking up from what you guys were saying I mean the markets are moving, the commodity prices are moving in your favor, your pieces seems to be coming together, stocks been obviously rallying as a result of that. From a timing perspective do you think, perhaps, was this the right time to be adding more regulated mix given that this is a 12- to 15-month approval process, kind of has its own levels of uncertainty associated with that? Would you have wanted to let this thing run I mean the way it had been running and has been running?
Chris Crane: Yes, we are not distracting or deterring ourselves from the upside of the commodity market. With the way that this is being structured with opening up more of the balance sheet using a view by the rating agencies of the Holdco utilities allows us to use to cheap debt at this time to pick up more regulated revenue. There is an equity component but it is not a significant component. So if you did the math and Jack was explaining it earlier this morning, it's less than 10% of our share count that would equity would be issued for. You still get somewhere of 90% of whatever the upside is that's coming from the power market. So you have to be opportunistic, you have to be able to create value. This deal creates a significant accretion in earnings per share. It allows us structurally to be looked at differently by the rating agencies and we get still when anything would come to the market that was a relative value deal, we would still be able to transact on it and continue to grow on that side of the business. So there was if you can create value with accretion like this, I think the time is whenever it comes available and if this was to distract us from the upside of the commodity or recovery and the power recovery, we wouldn't have done it but we can do both.
Ali Agha –- SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Fair enough. Thank you.
Chris Crane: Thank you. That brings us to the end of the caller. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today’s conference call. You may now disconnect your lines.

Operator:  Good morning. My name is Amy and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q4 2013 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks there will be a question-and-answer session (Operator Instructions) Thank you.  Ravi Ganti, Vice President of Investor Relations, please go ahead. 
Ravi Ganti:  Thank you, Amy. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2013 earnings conference call. Leading the call today are Chris Crane, Exelon’s President and CEO and Jack Thayer, Exelon's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by other members of Exelon's senior management team, who will be available to answer your questions following the prepared remarks. We issued our earnings review this morning along with the presentation, each of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website. The earnings release and other matters that we will discuss during today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today’s call obviously during this call and the risk factors section of the earnings release. Please refer to today's 8-K and Exelon's other filings for a discussion of factors that may cause the results to differ from management's projections, forecasts, and expectations. Today’s presentation also includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the nearest equivalent GAAP measures. We have scheduled 60 minutes for this call. I'll now turn the call over to Chris.
Christopher M. Crane: Thank you Ravi, and good morning to everybody. Before I talk about 2013, I will give everybody a little bit of update on the system status. This year, this winter have provided us with a lot of opportunities to perform storm recovery in the last 36 hours, we’re hit pretty hard with snow in the ComEd zone. The recovery went fairly well, in fact we’re back up and running at normal levels. BGE was hit by freezing rain and ice yesterday morning knocking out Exelon PECO 175,000 customers. As of early this morning, there were 45,000 customers left to recover. We have adequate resources on the system now. PECO was the one that was most slanted by any of the utilities by this storm. Over 700,000 customers have been affected thus far making it the second worse storm in PECO’s history, only beat out by super storm Sandy. We had yesterday 35,000 resources on the ground in the recovery phase and that is ramping up even more today. ComEd is dispatching over 300 of their resources and will continue to support the recovery. As of this morning, there were still approximately 430,000 customers; out of that we expect to make some solid results in the next couple of days. This could last for few more days and we are really focused on this health and safety of our customers with another storm coming in, so company is doing everything possible to expedite the recovery there. So I’ll switch now to 2013; it was a strong year for operations. Each utility; PECO, BGE and ComEd achieved top quartile and best ever our outage frequency in customer satisfaction numbers. Nuclear delivered a capacity factor of 94% and an all-time higher generation output. Gas and hydro availability upon demand was over 99%, and renewable energy capture was 93%.  We have been confronted by low power and gas prices, impacts of subsidized generation in sluggish low growth. With that said, we delivered on our financial plan. We achieved $2.50 a share which was right in line with our guidance and Jack will be providing more color on that in a minute.  We continue to manage cost O&M was better than planned, realizing $360 million in merger synergies and on track to 550 ComEd's by year-end. Previous actions have ensured solid credit metrics and balance sheet strength that allows us to continue investing and growth. You know about the $15 billion in utility investment we’ve talked of. Jack is going to provide more color on that also in a minute. We had more than $1.3 million smart leaders during 2013 end to other infrastructure upgrades and system hardening and transmission projects. We added 158 megawatts of clean generation primarily at our Antelope Valley solar facility and we have the substantial generation growth in our development pipeline for the next two to three years, approximately 500 megawatts and contracted win solar in the completion of our nuclear power upgrades. Public policy remains a critical focus for us. At the utilities, we saw meaningful improvement in the fair return on our investments in Illinois and Maryland, Senate Bill 9 in Illinois allowed us to achieve our grid modernization programs, which is driving customer liability and we are having constructive result on rate cases in Illinois and in Maryland. It is clear that Exelon and other competitive generators are not really compensative for their reliable generation. We’ve been active in the PJM stakeholder process since we auctioned results of last May to improve the rules. We continue to be a leading voice against subsidized generation and have had some success. We will continue the efficacy process going forward. Looking-forward, we see some challenges, but we hope to do see some light at the end. Continued pressure from subsidies and lower commodity prices are present, but the recent weather events have resulted in price volatility that we haven’t seen in a long time. This should result in supplier side risk premium adjustments, which will assist in the market recovery and we have given this and other fundamental shifts we remain positive. Today, we are providing guidance range of $2.25 a share to $2.55 a share for the adjusted period earnings for 2014 and now I’ll turn it over to Jack to provide more details.
Jonathan W. Thayer: Thank you Chris and good morning everyone I am on Slide 2. I’ll first discuss the fourth quarter and 2013 financial results and then turn to 2014 earnings guidance cash outlet and other insights on 2014 including our gross margin update. We achieved operating earnings of $0.50 for the quarter and $2.50 per share for the year, in line with the midpoint of our guidance expectations of $2.40 to $2.60  Turning to Slide 3 in the quarter results for utilities; 2013 was bad year for our three utilities. Our utility customers are realizing the operating and cost benefits of the merger, each BGE, ComEd, and PECO had its best operating year ever, hence will approve for the value of scale and the ability to leverage experience, cost utility, best practices and resources. Operating performance in each utility improved over 2012 in all key metrics including safety, reliability, customer service and customer satisfaction. For all three, reliability customer satisfaction and add frequency are in the top quartile of similar utilities in the United States. We continue to make capital investments to make our system even stronger and more reliable. For the fourth quarter ComEd delivered earnings of $0.13 per share and full year earnings of $0.49 per share at the top of our guidance range. Fourth quarter earnings decreased to $0.06 per share compared to the same period of 2012, related to the impacts of the October 2012 distribution rate order, partially offset by favorable weather, volumes and customer mix.  PECO delivered earnings of $0.12 per share for the quarter and $0.46 per share for the year, exceeding our guidance range. Fourth quarter earnings increased $0.02 per share over the same period last year; this is largely related to decrease storm cost and favorable weather.  BGE's earnings were $0.06 per share for the fourth quarter and $0.23 per share for the full year, in the middle of our guidance range. Fourth quarter earnings increased by $0.04 per share from the same quarter in 2012. Higher electric and gas distribution rates and lower storm cost drove the higher earnings.  In December, both ComEd and BGE received constructive results in their rate cases. The Illinois Commerce Commission approved to an increase of $341 million for commerce delivery service revenue, nearly 95% of the original request, a testament to the success of the formula rate mechanism. And the Maryland Public Service Commission approved an increase of $34 million for electric base rates. And $12 million for gas base rates. The 2014 outlook for lower growth remains modest. We expect less than 1% load growth in our PECO and BGE. And load growth to be flat to negative at ComEd. At each utility load growth is influenced by ongoing energy efficiency programs. PECO's modest growth of 0.3% reflects growth in manufacturing employment in the region. Strong growth in the residential sector is driving BGE’s 0.6% expected load growth in 2014. There is more detail on load for the utilities that can be found on page 27 of the appendix. Turning to ExGen’s results of Slide 4. ExGen delivered earnings of $0.21 per share in the fourth quarter, and $1.40 per share for the full year. For the quarter ExGen’s earnings decreased by $0.12 per share compared to the same quarter of 2012. The majority of the decrease was driven by lower realized energy prices across all regions. This was offset in part by higher capacity prices and lower O&M expense. 
 : Slide 6 provides our projected sources and uses of cash for 2014 compared to 2013 actuals. Cash from operations is expected to be $6.1 billion which is an increase from 2013 or $75 million due in part to higher distribution rates at ComEd and favorable income taxes and other settlements offset by lower gross margin and Exelon generation. 2014 CapEx plans are largely consistent with our estimates provided at EEI.  I will discuss our O&M outlook on the next slide, but would first touch upon our financing plans for 2014. We’re projecting $1.2 billion of long-term debt issuances at ComEd and PECO with the proceeds to be used for refinancings and incremental capital investment at ComEd. In early January, we completed more than half of our 2014 financing plan for the $650 million ComEd first mortgage bond issuance. The transaction consisted of $300 million of five year bonds with the coupon of 2.15% and $350 million of 30 year bonds with a coupon of 4.7%. The proceeds served to retire $617 million of debt maturities in addition to general corporate purposes.  In addition to the maturity comment, we have $525 million of maturities at ExGen which we’ve retried with cash on hand improving our credit metrics as a non-regulated business. As mentioned on the third quarter call, we think we have an opportunity to redeploy capital for growth opportunities through project financing of certain assets in our existing portfolio. To that end, I’m pleased to announce the closing of a $300 million L plus 425 term loan of ExGen Renewables I. ExGen Renewables I is the indirect holding company of Continental Wind, a $667 megawatt wind portfolio of 13 projects located in six states, refinanced in September of last year, this transaction had an order book that was well over subscribed consisting of high-quality investors resulting in our springing and pricing by 25 basis points to 50 basis points from our initial guidance. We think this serves as evidence that we have a strong portfolio of assets that can generate additional proceeds to deploy for the right growth opportunities. Slide 7 shows our 2014 O&M forecasts and our 2013 actual O&M. We project O&M for 2014 to be $6.575 billion, an increase of $100 million over last year. The O&M CAGR for the entire company from 2014 to 2016 is a negative 0.6% with ExGen O&M remaining roughly flat during that time period. This year-over-year variance is mostly driven by inflation and the anticipation of average storm costs at the utilities offset by merger synergies and favorable pension and OPEB costs. We expect to hit our run rate merger synergy target of $550 million in 2014. On Slide 8 as we told, at EEI we are investing $15 billion in our free utilities over the planning period, resulting in consolidated rate base growth of between 5% and 7%. We are targeting a minimum 10% ROE at each utility by 2017. Our utilities provide stable earnings growth for the company and could wholly fund the dividend of 2016. We expect consolidated utility earnings will grow 6% annually from 2013 to 2016. Slide 8 shows our projected utility earnings range from $1.10 to $1.40 in 2014 from $1.25 to $1.55 in 2016.
 :
 : In January we experienced severe winter weather in our load shedding regions as well as significant power and gas price volatility. Our balanced generation to load strategy, as well as our geographic and commodity diversity, served us well in this challenging environment.
 : Yesterday, ISO New England announced the preliminary results of their full capacity option for the planning year of 2017 and 2018. The clearing prices are $15 per kilowatt month in NEMA and $7.025 per kilowatt month in the Rest of Pool. These results are pending for approval.  The clearing prices reflect the tightening supply and demand balance in New England after to announcements to retire baseload generation. Our New England capacity position 2100 megawatt in NEMA and 735 megawatts in Rest of Pool will benefit from these higher year-over-year prices. As you will see in the appendix, our forecasted generation has decreased by roughly 50% in New England. Exelon worked with the supplier to restructure certain trends of a fuel supply contract resulting in a more flexible and a reliable supply contract. Despite the fact that our forecasted generation is lower, the changes in the fuel supply contract result in favorable gross margin variances in the portfolio that are included in the open gross margin forecasts. On Slide 10, we believe that PJM prices will improve due to full time retirements and increased costs for some generators to comply with impending environmental regulations.
 : Our hedging strategy continues to reflect this view. Our overall hedge percentages increased due to two factors; the restructuring of the New England fuel supply contract and shifting to a larger heat rate strategy of PJM. As of yearend 2013, we were 2% to 3% behind ratable in PJM relying on an even larger amount cross-commodity hedges to capture our view that heat rates will expand. At year end natural gas sales represented 12% to 15% of our hedges in 2015 and 2016. The changing fundamental drivers of the gas and power markets have already led to significant amount of volatility so far in 2014 spot prices. The power market have modestly responded. We will continue to evaluate the amount of upside we see in the market based on our fundamental views and carry positions that will allows us to benefit as much as possible from the realization of these use while meeting the other goals of our hedging policy. On Slide 11, ExGen have shown strong financial metrics and cash flows to maintain its investment grade rating and pursue opportunistic growth investments as they arise. For 2013, ExGen had an FFO to debt ratio of more than 37% and we expect this ratio to improve in 2014 to approximately 40%. ExGen’s investment grade, credit rating and robust balance sheet allows us to pursue growth projects. As we showed you at ETI, we have declining base CapEx of ExGen from 2013 to 2016. Our priority is the safety and reliability of these plans and these cost reductions will not compromise our ability to achieve those priorities. Our base CapEx in prior years was higher to prepare for license extensions and mitigate asset management issues. We are also able to implement cost management programs including reverse engineering, which contributed to reductions. These CapEx reductions helps to mitigate the reduction in rev net fuel. Pension improvements are also contributing to our strong financial strength when looking at cash relative to earnings. The rising interest rate environment results in lower pension costs and contributions. For 2015, we are forecasting a $100 million decline in pension contributions versus expense. Further ExGen has a favorable cash tax position. We have substantial near-term cash tax favorability compared to book taxes due to bonus depreciation, use of NOLs and other tax credits. Our longer term tax position has increased tax capacity for growth opportunities in renewable generation. All these factors contribute to our financial flexibility and robust cash metrics including EBITDA minus base CapEx of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion and free cash flow of $1.25 billion in 2014. We have a financial strength not only to see us through this period of low commodity process, but also to grow. Our healthy balance sheet, sustainable dividend and our discipline constitute a solid platform for sustained growth. As a reminder, the appendix includes several schedules that will help you in your modeling efforts. Now I will turn the call back to Chris for his concluding remarks, before we open the call for question and answer.
Christopher M. Crane: Thanks Jack. We continue to act aggressively on things we can control and really work on things that we can influence. We believe in the power market recoveries we repetitively said and we are managing our portfolio accordingly to maximize its profitability. Our investments in the utilities is very high priority. The stable earnings and the cash flow provided, will support sustainable dividend going forward. We continue to focus on cost cutting and driving the emergent synergies as we have discussed. We have talked about asset rationalization in the past and despite our best ever year in generation some of our nuclear units are unprofitable at this point in the current environment due to the low prices and bad energy policy that we are living with. Assessing the market operations and commercial policy solution is the focus right now. A better tax policy and energy policy would be the clear answer, but if we do not see a path to sustainable profits, we will be obligated to shut units down to avoid the long-term losses and that decision have the process should bring us to some conclusion by year-end. Our balance sheet strength enables us to invest in diversification. We will continue to add assets to the portfolio, that are earnings and free cash flow accretive. We will mitigate the market effects by pursuing aggressive costs cuts, asset rationalization and deploying capitals to drive growth. With that, we will open it up for questions.
 :
Christopher M. Crane: Hey Dan. 
Dan L. Eggers – Credit Suisse Securities, LLC: I was wondering maybe can if somebody could just give us some thoughts or some color on what’s going on in the forward curves right now. Obviously we’ve seen a lot of movement in the 2014 curve, but 2015 and 2016 has been pretty benign so far. Is there a liquidity issue out there, is it a fundamental issue and you can kind of when do you guys expect that to start to move?
Christopher M. Crane: Let me have Joe Nigro address that.
Joseph Nigro: Hey Dan good morning. I think there is a couple of issues that we are dealing with. First since the end of the year, the West Hub power, if we use that as the first proxy, is up across the board and really that’s been driven by the changing gas basis that we’ve seen in the Mid-Atlantic and we really haven’t seen any heat rate expansion. We have price appreciation if you look at the balance of 2014 and 2015 and beyond across the board to West on the back of the gas bases change. The bigger issue is really in NI-Hub, because the gas bases really hasn’t moved if you look at 2015 to 2018 since the end of the year. We really haven’t seen a change in gas bases nor have we seen much of the change in the NYMEX price for natural gas. We’ve seen the calendar 2015 price at NI-Hub go up slightly about $0.50 or so. I think it was as of last night on an ATC basis. But we are actually down from 16% to 18% and I think your question about liquidity is spot on. There is absolutely no natural buyers on the forward curve in NI-Hub. And then on top of that there is very little speculation on being done in NI-Hub from a trading perspective. Certainly we marry those things together, we did not see it. And the last thing I would add is as you remember as we walk into the year, we saw the calendar 2014 ATC prices raised and hear rate expand slightly and I think it was the back of some retailers and others coming to market and cover, but we haven’t seen any change on the backend and we expect to see that until we see liquidity improve.
Christopher M. Crane: And then Dan I’d just add, given the January cold weather issues and severe price volatility we’ve actually seen liquidity really back off just in a recent week. So, but NI-Hub liquidity is probably about as bad as we’ve ever seen it, and really even in 2015 there is almost no activities.
Dan L. Eggers – Credit Suisse Securities, LLC: And can I guess kind of on the point we’ve seen the multiple retailers drop out of the business in January already. What kind of landscape are you guys seeing as far as competitors and maybe more departures in the business I guess A and then B. Are you having more conversations with customers looking to maybe reconfigure how they are buying power to get in to more firm contracts and things like that?
Jonathan W. Thayer: Dan, there is a couple of data points to that, but first is there were a couple of wholesale solar procurements done in January. And I would tell you versus what we had seen in previous year, you saw some increased risk premiums and in some cases higher margins. I think that’s the first data point. The BGS auction will take place next week. The fixed price proportion next week and I think we’ll get another insight as to how people are thinking about it. From a retail perspective it’s really too early to tell, but I think you are right on. We have seen a number of folks announcing, they are getting out of the business, they are going to scale down the business. We have seen some small defaults return on expected in this kind of environment. I would fully expect that folks are going to take both year to reassess the risk rewarded suddenly growth volume products and when you think about the impending retirements that we’ve been talking about we use PJM proxy with some of the changes come as it relates to demand response bidding and just the GAAP basis issues we’ve seen as well pretty much all over the interconnect. I think it’s safe to say that we are going to expect people here to reassess what they think the value of a loan probably contracted and we would expect to see the volatility and the margins increase through time both retail and wholesale load volume contracts.
Jonathan W. Thayer: And Dan, I would just reiterate what Jack said. Our matched load to gen strategy really has played out well here in January. While others are concerned about uncontrolled costs to serve load. With our robust asset base, our portfolio management capability in the wholesale side has allowed us to take those issues off the table and led our retail team focused on what the customer’s need, whether they are concerned about prices, if they are indexed or exposed at all and how we can help them get through this. I think that's our advantage in our mass gen to load strategy. And I think it puts us well ahead of a lot of our competitors.
Dan L. Eggers – Credit Suisse Securities, LLC: So can I just take that to mean in the first quarter, that even with this volatility in January and into February on retail, the generation has offset that? So there has been kind of a net neutral so it hasn't hurt or helped appreciably? So can I just take that demand in the first quarter that even with this volatility in January and into February on retail, the generation is offset but there has been kind of a net neutral so it hasn’t hurt or helped appreciably?
Jonathan W. Thayer : It’s certainly the talk, but we are right on plan. We don’t have any concerns about this weather and the volatility that has been in the market.
Dan L. Eggers – Credit Suisse Securities, LLC: Excellent. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research.
Steven I. Fleishman – Wolfe Research, LLC: Yes, excuse me hi guys. Couple of questions; first and I’m not sure you can answer this, but on the nuclear plant et cetera, we are losing money in this environment, is there a way to give us a sense of how much lost earnings there is, let’s say in 2014 from plans that are not economic right now?
Christopher M. Crane: Yes, we are not putting that out yet. If we have to make a decision, if again we will tell you the upside, but we don’t have that number to published yet. 
Steven I. Fleishman – Wolfe Research, LLC: Okay, I guess you had mentioned this in your remarks, but on the bottom of Slide 12, you talked about that you believe that you are going to have positive earnings CAGR, half of this 2014 guidance over the long-term. Should we assume that assumes you are kind of $2 to $4 power price recovery broader or is that something where even without all that given potential savings on new shutdowns and other things you are doing that might be possible even without that?
Christopher M. Crane: Let me ask Jack go through the logic there.
Jonathan W. Thayer: Steve, it incorporates a number of things. It incorporates our fundamental views both around power prices as well as capacity and that would provide an important part of that positive earnings growth, offsetting the declines that the forwards would suggest in the business. We also have a continued focus on cost that we are pursuing and building on top of the $550 million of savings from the merger and we expect that to also be additive and then we’ve factored in the available capital and balance sheet space that we have and the opportunity to use that for further investment in organic growth or potential acquisitions or other means of growing our EPS base.
Steven I. Fleishman – Wolfe Research, LLC: Okay. Great, thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.
Jonathan P. Arnold – Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi good morning guys.
Christopher M. Crane: Good morning.
Jonathan W. Thayer: Good morning.
Jonathan P. Arnold – Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Just sort of strategic question despite might be for Jack. Jack, in volatility and the recent volatility we’ve seen is kind of what’s going to ultimately inform the force, why don’t use some of that financial flexibility to be substantially left hedged?
Jonathan W. Thayer:  That’s in our outlook. I’ll let Joe Nigro to talk about that.
Joseph Nigro: At this point in this cycle, if we talked about 2015 and 2016, until the only the two primary follow years that we are hedging, we’ve never had a larger opening power position at this point in over hedging cycle.  So we talked a lot and Jack mentioned some of the things that we did in the fourth quarter in trying to selling gas and rotating out of a very long position and we took advantage of the price rise, we saw in natural gas from about mid-October through the end of the year. In early January, the gas market actually came off zone and we took the opportunity to buy back a lot of these hedging that we’ve put on. So we’re still carrying a very long open power proposition. The second thing I would add to that is, there has been some movement in prices when we talk about rest of them may have 2015 in certain seasons like summer and winter and we compared that to where we think ultimately they should settle given the fuel price environment we are in and then will give an opportunity to rotate positions and make power sales and really think its associated on the seasonal basis, but sitting here today we’ve never had a larger open power position at this point in the form of commodity cycle.
Jonathan P. Arnold – Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. And then just one, because you mentioned that this restructuring of the gas or I guess its gas or fuel supply on New England, but if you are going to generate a lot less presumably that was a low-priced contract that’s going not to be as low-priced any more. So I’m curious is there a gain associated with that and when did it show up in 2013 as something that will be in 2014 or might not be thinking about that, right?
Joseph Nigro: As we look at this, the way its flowing through our financial statement, you've seen it in the hedge disclosure. We restructured a 1 giga supply contract that was positive margin overall. You're right, we had a substantial decrease in the output of our generation up in New England that you see in the disclosure, to the tune of about 50%.  The way the mechanics working and disclosure is such that we reduced our power new business to go and we added the value of that contract and we monetized into our estimated open gross margin, so the next change to the bottom line is zero, but it's just more in cash flow.
Christopher M. Crane: Just the big driver of this is around making sure we have fuel reliability and flexibility and can run the plans when they are most needed on the system, that was a huge driver doing that.
Jonathan P. Arnold – Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So is there a financial impact from the restructuring?
Jonathan W. Thayer: The financial impact that you see, if you look at our hedge disclosures quarter-over-quarter; for example in 2014, you'll notice we reduced our power units to go by $150 million. We reduced it by $100 million. A good portion of that is the benefit of this contract and we're locking cash flows that we reduce the power usages to go and we have grossed up the gross margin for that balance.
Jonathan P. Arnold – Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Sorry to keep kind of on this, but does that mean there is not as an upfront gain associated with it?
Christopher M. Crane: What they are trying to tell you it's built into the numbers you are looking at. There was an optimization that needed to be done for reliability upon this system that drove the contract restructuring. We were compensated for that and is in the numbers and it is positive, but it's in the numbers you see.
Jonathan P. Arnold – Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Can you quantify it?
Christopher M. Crane:  No, there is terms under the deal, no.
Jonathan P. Arnold – Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then just finally Chris on your last comments around assets and everything, at EEI you talked a little about PPA's and then there was a sort of potential puff to addressing economic situation of some of the nukes and then there was a story about something being negotiated and Illinois round club cities. Can you comment at all about that? 
Christopher M. Crane: Yes. Somebody ran with a story that was not true. We are not negotiating with the state of Illinois on PPAs. What my statement was at EEI and still in pass forward, we would like to get longer-term contracts on especially the MISO assets. It is not being compensated for the reliability and we have origination folk out working on that, but it's not with a state entity, it's through multiple paths to other parties that are securing long-term needs. We'll continue to work on that. As you know there is not many of those deals out there, but MISO – and now MISO sales would be our target to try to find those opportunities. 
Jonathan P. Arnold – Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much guys.
Operator:   Your next question comes from the line of Hugh Wynne with Sanford Bernstein.
Hugh Wynne – Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC: Hi Chris, you had talked a couple of times about your efforts to achieve changes in energy policy that might benefit the Company and I was wondering if you could expand on that a little bit. Then in particular, what you are hoping to see done on renewables and on CO2 regulation and perhaps what do you think may play out on those two fronts?
Christopher M. Crane: Our biggest push right now is at the federal and the state level is to stop subsidizing in generation. That's renewables and other sources of generation. It skews the market. It's doesn't give any of us the right signal should we be investing, should we be shutting down and we think that a good policy for the competitive market is let the assets compete.  So, we've done a lot of work in the last couple of years trying to tell that story and we hope that it's continuing or will start to resonate with more of the stakeholders as we go forward the other thing that we're continuing to push on and explore.  We do not get compensated as others for reliable baseload generation, we load a core, in a nuclear reactor we can run for up to two years with very reliable generation. We are not depending on the wind, the sun, or the flow of any fuel through the pipe it's there. So we think the capacity markets, not the energy markets should reflect the reliability and the dependability of those and Joe Dominguez and our regulatory folks continue to work in market space to try to find opportunities to improve the roles around that and we'll continue to push it.  As far as greenhouse gases, we’re not advocating for a carbon bill. We spend a lot of time working on that in the past, and Washington I don’t think is the place to try to resolve that issue right now. We continue to watch what the EPA is doing and what they have under their jurisdiction right now as it's been pointed out to regulate going forward. We'll monitor that going forward, how we make our investments around that or how we would make our disclosures around that. But we are not in the advocacy spot right now in that area.
Hugh Wynne – Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC: Okay understood. Could you maybe just elaborate a little bit on what type of compensation you think would be appropriate for the reliable baseload as opposed to what you are receiving already in capacity markets? 
Christopher M. Crane: Yes, I’ll let Joe Dominguez touch on that. 
Joseph Dominguez : Sure. So when we are talking about reliability, you are talking describe this fuel diversity or not allowing to get fuel on gas because of this volatility risks. The way I think that is being translated in stakeholder space, is you increase the requirements for firm fuel. And so obviously a nuclear unit has firm fuel, we load up 18 months of fuel in core. And the thought is that especially coming out of these winter events, the gas units will be required to have something that looks like firm fuel and that may involve firm transport requirements, it may ultimately involve a winter peaking season, whether it's an examination if whether sufficient gas can be provided to cover all the megawatts that are bid in the option. But those are the discussions that are better occurring. We think that will put upward pressure in the capacity market and allow nuclear units compensate from the firm fuel they have in the reliability they provided to the system. 
Hugh Wynne – Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC: Great. So, you're basically hoping that the requirement for firm fuel supply and transmission on the gas plants will drive capacity prices higher and you will benefit accordingly, is that fair? 
Christopher M. Crane: Yes, but I don't want to be limited to that. I think what we need to figure out for the utilities on the system is whether the gas units will perform, fully more in peak season and now we're going to a peak in the winter and that's really what comes out of this. And I think the ISO's are going to examine a number of tests requiring firm transport is one of them, but the other way to do it is, you just whittle down the number of megawatts that could participate in capacity option. Either way, we will see some uplift in the capacity market as a result of those [Indiscernible]. 
Hugh Wynne – Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC: Got it. Okay and thank you very much 
Christopher M. Crane: Sure 
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Michael Weinstein with UBS.
Michael Weinstein – UBS Securities LLC: Hi guys. On that same topic, could you talk about the PJM parameters that were released and what do you think capacity imports into PJM and how that might be changing? 
Christopher M. Crane: Joe Dominguez? 
Joseph Dominguez: I think the most significant ruling was limiting the sub angle DR. And so we see the effect that already that's approved by FERC. FERC has not approved PJM's request on the import limits as yet. As you know they issued a deficiency letter. Our review of the deficiency letter suggests that they can answer the questions relatively quickly, re-file and be in time for decision by FERC in advance of the auction.  In terms of the planning parameters, I think they would modestly reduce the number of imports, the number of megawatts of imported generation in this next capacity auction, that's my view based on what I've seen so far. 
Michael Weinstein – UBS Securities LLC: Honest projections. A couple of technical questions. Concerning the interest on ExGen just looks like in the guidance it went down to $325 million and the run rate of the fourth quarter would seem to imply about $400 million and net debt looks like it could actually increase. So I was just wondering what the cause of the decline in interest going forward?
Joseph Dominguez: Well, I think we can – I would say broadly that it's related to lower balance and we've been refinancing at lower levels. But why don't we take the more specific modeling questions offline. 
Michael Weinstein – UBS Securities LLC: No problem. And one last question. Have you baked into guidance any of the uplift from January like any of the risk – increased risk premiums or anything like that that might have happened or might be occurring, in your 2014 guidance? 
Joseph Dominguez: No, we haven't, where you talk about it from a retail margin perspective where performance in January nonetheless convincing. 
Christopher M. Crane: We do think it should be and eventually will be. As we looked at these auctions or the muni [ph] aggregation process, we never could understand the numbers on some of the suppliers that are able to make, and so we didn't win a lot of those. We pushed – as we looked at our own models, the place that jumped out was the volume favorability, the VLR that can be directly seen in a weather event like that. So, we have previously priced that into our offerings that would – that portfolio management would protect us from events like we just went through. So, that's why we're seeing right now we're on plan. 
Michael Weinstein – UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust.
Ali Agha – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Thank you. Good morning.
Christopher M. Crane: Good morning.
Ali Agha – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Chris, as you are thinking through your strategic plan for 2014 and perhaps beyond that, but looking through this calendar year, where does the prospect for regulated utility M&A fit into your planning right now if at all? What kind of priority would you give that to build up your regulated base? 
Christopher M. Crane: So, right now, we are not in a position where we would want to trade our equity for anything other than something that was a relative value deal. So, if you look at – we believe we're undervalued at this point and there is market upside. Between the market upside and the current valuations we're being given, we think there is upside to that. So, we would hold our equity – use of our equity only to something that would be a relative value deal that we could see the upside accretion in earnings and profitability. Other things that would be looked at, would just be balance sheet type growth activities, as Jack has pointed out previously.  So, off the balance sheet, we're willing to engage in anything that we can see on the near term as a positive accretion in earnings. But not create a dilution on the equity utilization just because we think most are trading at a premium. 
Ali Agha – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Okay got it. Also to clarify, you pointed out earlier also in Slide 12. When you look at your planning period and things are ultimately ending up with a positive CAGR in earnings. Are we looking at 2013 through 2018 or through 2016, what's the planning period, can you just define that? 
Christopher M. Crane: Put 2014 through 2018.
Ali Agha – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: 2014 through 2018. Got it. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Jon Cohen with ISI Group.
Jon A. Cohen – International Strategy & Investment Group LLC: Hey good morning. Just a question on, when you say you have balance sheet capacity. Is that also looking out long-term through 2018 or is that more over the next few years?
Christopher M. Crane: That’s looking out throughout 2018. Clearly we have more balance sheet capacity in the front years based on where the power curve is currently trending. To the extent that our fundamental view comes to fruition then clearly we'll have similar level of FFO relative to debt, that would create incremental capacity but consistent with prior comments. We think we are between $1 billion and $2 billion of balance sheet capacity into investing growth.
Jon A. Cohen – International Strategy & Investment Group LLC: Okay, and if your fundamental view on the power markets does not come to fruition and does that kind of… 
Christopher M. Crane: That we arrive at $1 billion to $2 billion to the extent that our fundamental view comes to fruition than it's been equally higher.
Jon A. Cohen – International Strategy & Investment Group LLC: Okay great and just one other question on the planning parameters; I noticed PJM broke out ComEd and BGE as separate LDAs, even though it looks like there is plenty of import capacity. Can you just talk about what their thinking was around that and does that help you at all?
Christopher M. Crane : Joe Dominguez will answer that.
Joseph Dominguez : Sure. PJM is right under the tariff to separately model zone. When there are concerns that the megawatts supply needed within the zone won't receive adequate compensation through the RTO pricing into a liability criteria. As you indicated the ComEd zone, transmission the PECO [ph] ratio looks like it's pretty robust, BGE is a little bit tighter.  But I think what this ultimately tells us is that as we get into the auction period, bidding practice within those zones is going to be very critical and what the cost of supply within the zone is going to be critical. PJM, we think wisely has taken steps to protect the liability in those zones by separately modeling the LDAs.
Jon A. Cohen – International Strategy & Investment Group LLC: Okay. And can you just clear up one thing, as a nuclear generator, what is your flexibility for bidding in avoided cost, I mean it looks like they don't specify an avoided cost rate for nuclear, it's mostly for coal and other fossil units, can you bid something other than just being a price taker?
Jonathan W. Thayer: The answer is yes, you can. There aren't the bulk rates, which is what you're pointing out, but there is nothing that prohibits nuclear from bidding an ACR.
Jon A. Cohen – International Strategy & Investment Group LLC: Okay, great, thanks a lot.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Paul Fremont of Jefferies.
Paul B. Fremont – Jefferies LLC: Thank you very much. It looks like for the year 2014, the effective tax rate came in at 33.8%, which is well below your guidance of 37.4%. I guess my question is what caused tax rates to be significantly better and also I don't see sort of a consolidated effective tax rate that you're assuming for 2014 in your guidance?
Christopher M. Crane : We'll have our tax VP address that. Tom Terry?
Thomas D. Terry Jr.:  The guidance you've been given is just a core effective tax rate. The effective tax rate in the financials and what you'll actually see realize reflects the utilization of renewable credits, which drives that down substantially below what you get which is ongoing core tax rate.
Paul B. Fremont – Jefferies LLC : So what is the consolidated tax guidance for 2014?
Thomas D. Terry Jr.:  Can we give that guidance?
Christopher M. Crane: We don't provide that Paul.
Paul B. Fremont – Jefferies LLC : Okay. And then is it again the renewable credits that's getting you to the much lower effective tax rate this year versus what you are originally guiding to?
Christopher M. Crane:  Yes. Paul you are seeing the continued build out of AVSR. You are seeing build out of wind generating assets through our renewable business. You should expect us to be a regular beneficiary of tax credits in lowering our overall tax liability on a cash basis as well.
Paul B. Fremont – Jefferies LLC : Even though you can't give sort of a consolidated effective tax rate directionally, should we assume something similar to 2013 and 2014?
Christopher M. Crane: Let us step back and look at how we want to discuss that. We've got more renewables coming on, we've got a pipeline. It hasn't been something that we've talked about in the past. I hate to do it on the fly right now. So let us regroup and we'll put something out or we'll address it on the next call.
Paul B. Fremont – Jefferies LLC : Okay. And then just real quick on your discussion of the supply disruptions and what you're going to talk about in the first quarter of 2014, will that discussion essentially only impact your 2014 number or could it also have an effect on sort of future periods that you said that you were including in your disclosures?
Christopher M. Crane: So, our disclosures are based-off of forward strip where we see the market on our short-term view doesn't come in to our disclosures. Joe?
Joseph Nigro : Yes. Paul, couple of things; one thing is this. None of our January activity is in this disclosure that we released today. As you know and you see in the disclosure, we have new business targets to go from the power side and the non-power side.  So, any value created whether it's in January or the balance of the first quarter for changes we see in value for the balance of the year would go towards meeting the business targets for the year.  In addition, I think the question your are raising is what the value on the forward curve of some of the activity and disruption we've seen in January. As we talked about, it's been much more significant in the front-end of the curve and very muted on the back end of the curve, and we haven't seen anything in the two weeks instead of past that has led us to believe that our retail is changing, appreciably yes.  But I do thing as we get to the end of the first quarter, we'll have better insight as to what the impact is on the forward curve as we move through time and what it means, but as of right now, our plan includes retail margins that we previously talked about when you think about like seeing on power that don't get back to the middle of that $2 to $4 range. If we see that expand, we would take that into account and recognize it to see it helps meet our new business targets or possibly expand them.
Paul B. Fremont – Jefferies LLC: Okay. And last question from me, we've seen announcements of new gas plant construction in PJM, can you expect this to be limited to sort of the Pennsylvania, Marcellus region or do you expect to see more activity in other parts of PJM.
Joseph Nigro: Paul, I think the general consensus is that you are going to see more in the Mid-Atlantic region prior to January 1, as you know, we saw substantial degradation in gas bases as it related to the Mid-Atlantic and the Marcellus area. It's not unreasonable to think you can see this in Ohio as well as the Utica shale starts to build out as quickly as people expect I do think though since we've seen an uptick in gas basis since the first of the year.  You have to take a step back and pause and reassess what the economics of the trends are because there's going to be some very seasonal differences when you look at the curve being up if you then pervade sort of the proxy $0.30 to $0.35 on an annualized basis. There is a big winter component to that whereas the summer and the shoulder months are still weak, but in general I think you would see it in Marcellus and Utica region.
Paul B. Fremont – Jefferies LLC: Thank you very much.
Ravi Ganti: We have time for one last question.
Operator:   And your final question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.
Michael J. Lapides – Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, guys I am going to make it easy on you asked and answered, I will follow up after the call.
Christopher M. Crane: Thanks.
Ravi Ganti: Okay. That ends our Q&A session. Thank you very much.
Christopher M. Crane: Thank you.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Tierra, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q3 2013 earnings call. [Operator Instructions] Mr. Ganti, you may begin your conference.
Ravi Ganti: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. I welcome you to Exelon's Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for joining us today. We issued our earnings release this morning. In case you did not receive it, the release is available on Exelon's investor website. The earnings release and other matters we will discuss in today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties, and the actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements. Please refer to today's 8-K and Exelon's other filings for a discussion of the factors that may cause the results to differ from management's projections, forecasts and expectations and for a reconciliation of operating to GAAP earnings. Leading the call today are Chris Crane, Exelon's President and CEO; Ken Cornew, Exelon's Chief Commercial Officer and President, CEO of Exelon Generation; and Jack Thayer, Exelon's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by other members of Exelon's management team, who will be available to answer your questions following the prepared remarks. We have scheduled 60 minutes for this call. I'll now turn the call over to Chris.
Christopher M. Crane: Thanks, Ravi. Thanks, everybody, for taking the time to join us this morning. Operationally, we had another strong quarter with great performance in both the utilities and the entire generation fleet. Financially, the third quarter was strong and results were higher than our guidance range. The third quarter operating earnings were $0.78 per share. Jack's going to cover that in more detail in his remarks. Low commodity prices, low load growth and tough retail margins continue to challenge our industry. While these challenges are mostly beyond our control, we are leveraging our core competencies to control what we can and influence what we cannot. We're focused on operational excellence, regulatory advocacy, financial discipline and investment that provides value to our shareholders. As I said, operationally, we had a good quarter and we're having a very good year. Once again, our generation fleet performed at high levels. For the quarter, the nuclear fleet ran at 94.8% capacity factor, and during the summer period had a 97.4% capacity factor. The fossil and renewable fleet had a strong quarter as well. In particular, the fossil, hydro fleet performed at exceptional level with a dispatch match rate of 99.1%. The utility performance remains very solid. All 3 utilities year-to-date improved on the customer satisfaction index year-over-year, and in some case -- places, we're reaching our highest numbers that we've seen in over a decade. No major storms did contribute to this favorable quarter for the utilities. On the regulatory advocacy side, we continued to push on many fronts. The rate case for ComEd and BGE are on schedule, with decisions expected in December for both. On the RPM stakeholder process, we continue to work with PJM and other stakeholders on improving the capacity market rules. The stakeholders are discussing reforms in the area of reducing speculation, demand response and imports. PJM has committed and continues to commit to propose tariff reforms to FERC in time to take effect before the next auction in May. We are very pleased with the federal court decision on the New Jersey LCAPP program. Combined with the decision in Maryland, these decisions uphold the principles of the competitive electric markets by finding state programs such as the subsidizing certain power generation -- generators are unconstitutional. Our financial discipline is key to our success. With rightsizing the dividend early in the year, our balance sheet remains strong and provides us with the flexibility to make investments in challenging times. We continue to look at ways to strengthen it further. For example, the work that has been done in completing the Continental Wind off-balance sheet financing that was closed earlier this quarter. We believe project financing allows us to grow the business in a credit-supportive manner, and again, Jack's going to cover more of that in his -- details in his remarks. On the investment side, we continue to invest in our regulated and merchant businesses to drive value for the shareholders. On the utility side, we are growing rate base with investments in gas infrastructure, transmission and distribution systems and the Smart Grid and smart meter installations. On the smart meters, the installation of the projects at all 3 utilities are underway in 2013. BGE has installed over 4,000 -- 426,000 meters through the third quarter. PECO is at 465,000 meters, and the ComEd smart meter deployment began in September is off to a good start, installing nearly 10,000 meters in the first month. At Exelon Generation, we've installed 153 megawatts of solar capacity as part of the AVSR to date. There are 2 blocks that have been delayed due to issues on the construction. Jack's going to talk about the impacts on capital and revenue on that when he -- we go through his comments. So for the full year guidance, given our year-to-date performance, our expectations for the balance of the year, we are narrowing the full range guidance from $2.35 to $2.65 to $2.40 to $2.50 per share. Now I'll turn it over to Ken who will discuss the hedge disclosure and put some color on how we're incorporating the gas basis into our hedging.
Kenneth W. Cornew: All right. Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. As Chris mentioned, I'll cover changes in natural gas basis and how we incorporate these risks while we hedge our portfolio, as well as our hedge disclosure. If you turn to Slide 3, I'll turn to Exelon Generations results this year and the outlook for the next 2 years. Challenges we have faced over the past year have continued over the third quarter, with natural gas modestly down across all years, power prices mixed across all regions and years, key grades modestly increased in the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest, very little volatility outside of ERCOT and the retail competition continues to be aggressive. These factors all combined to put further pressure on our ability to extract margin to our wholesale and retail businesses. To offset these pressures, we've mentioned $100 million reduction in 2013 O&M during the second quarter call. As seen on Slide 3, for 2013, the total reduction in gross margin from last quarter is $50 million. While prices were lower, especially in ERCOT, where summer peak prices came in lower than forecast, our hedge position and execution of $100 million in our new business target provided an offset to the open gross margin decrease of $150 million. Unfortunately, the lack of volatility in other regions and our outlook for the remainder of the year has caused us to reduce our expectations for incremental margin from our commercial business. Our non-power business continues to ratably transition from our to-go bucket to our executed bucket. It's important to note that we expect this $50 million reduction in 2013 to be offset by cost reductions, and Jack will be highlighting these a bit more as he discusses our full year guidance. In '14 and '15, our disclosure indicates a reduction of $50 million for each year in the total gross margin. In 2014, the open gross margin saw a decrease due to the significant peaks part spreads drop in ERCOT, as well as a reduction in the expected output from our wind assets. This was offset in our mark-to-market of hedges by the execution of some of our power new business to go. In 2015, our gross margin was impacted by price decreases in nearly all regions on our open position. As you've heard us say for the last few quarters, the retail space is extremely competitive and challenged. We have remained disciplined and have not gone after volume for the sake of volume and have maintained appropriate margin on our sales. We have not seen anything in the market to lead us to believe that we have turned the corner and are headed for growth in this business, and the guidance we gave previously on retail volumes and margins still stands. While we expect little to change, we will provide an update to our volumes at EEI. As we've mentioned to you earlier, we'll be providing you the details of our 2016 hedge position and gross margin estimates at EEI in a couple of weeks. If I had to make a statement directionally about what you'll see, I would say our gross margin estimates will largely be unchanged year-over-year, except for value of our hedges, which is simply a reflection of the amount of hedging we've done for '16 so far this year. Going to Slide 4. As you know, the impacts of shale gas on the United States energy industry are immense. We have seen the prompt-month price of Henry Hub natural gas fall from its highs of $13 in 2008 down to $2 in 2012. The decline in natural gas prices has had a corresponding impact on power prices. Much of this gas comes from the Marcellus Shale formation, which largely lies within the footprint of the PJM power grid. The surge in natural gas production has caused a fundamental shift in the pricing structure of gas in the Mid-Atlantic location, sometimes referred to as basis from a premium price area to a discount area. The discount is in relation to Henry Hub, the primary trading point of U.S. natural gas. The Henry Hub location has historically traded at a discount to the Northeast region due to its formerly significant gas production in the Gulf of Mexico and conduits of pipelines. The surge in gas production in the Marcellus has caused this relationship to reverse. With the rapid expansion of production within Marcellus, we've begun to see what was once approximately a $0.60 premium at M3 to Henry Hub in 2010 move to a discount of approximately $0.25. This change in basis in the basis relationship was expected and has been in steady decline over the last few years. Over the next several years, we anticipate new pipelines to be built and some pipelines to reverse, enabling the surplus to be moved to higher-priced areas. This will work in tandem with all other factors that will impact the market such as expanding LNG exports, exports to Mexico, industrial expansion and gas demand for power generation. The combination of these factors will stabilize Mid-Atlantic basis and support our fundamental view that natural gas will trade between $4 and $6 in MMBtu between 2017 to 2020. Over the last several quarters, our hedging profile has tracked at or ahead of ratable in PJM East. This has limited the impact of the basis move on our portfolio. Although Chicago basis has also been weaker recently, this had a minimal impact on PJM power prices at NiHub. We believe the size of the basis discount seen in the East will not be seen in the Midwest. This view is primarily driven by global supply and demand and pipeline capabilities for natural gas in the Midwest. We continue to stay behind ratable in our PJM Midwest power portfolio because of our view that heat rates will expand. Now I'll turn it over to Jack to review the full financial information for the quarter.
Christopher M. Crane: Before we go to Jack, I need to correct one thing I said. I said the range was going to $2.40 to $2.50. That's $2.40 to $2.60 is the new range.
Kenneth W. Cornew: Thank you, Chris.
Jonathan W. Thayer: Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone. I'll review the third quarter financial results, our full year guidance range, key events of the quarter and our balance sheet and cash flow outlook, starting on Slide 5. As Chris mentioned earlier, Exelon's results for the quarter exceeded our expectations. Operating earnings for the third quarter of this year were $0.78 per share, well above our Q3 guidance range of $0.60 to $0.70 per share. Compared to our guidance, favorability at both ExGen and our utilities drove us well above the range. While we expected to be at the upper end of the range provided, we continue to limit costs, resulting in lower-than-planned O&M across all our businesses. We are realizing merger synergies faster than forecast and that is helping results. The utilities accounted for just over 1/2 of the savings compared to guidance. As Ken alluded to earlier, the full year 2013 RNF production shown in the hedge disclosures was offset by ExGen, with lower O&M and interests. The lower O&M was driven by reduced O&M costs related to outages of power and lower labor and benefit costs. Across our operating companies, some of the reduced spending were onetime benefits, quite fewer than expected large storms, and others may reverse in the fourth quarter, but in general, our focus and execution on cost management helped drive these results. The $0.78 compares to our operating earnings of $0.77 per share during the third quarter of 2012. The quarter-over-quarter difference was largely driven by improved performance at our utilities, specifically at BGE and ComEd. I will go into greater detail on the quarter drivers in a few minutes. As Chris mentioned, for the full year, we are narrowing our guidance range to $2.40 to $2.60 per share from our previous guidance of $2.35 to $2.65 per share. With our strong year-to-date performance at the utilities, we are bringing up the bottom of our range. When we look at the fourth quarter, we see some unfavorability and gross margin expectations from our Constellation business, as shown in the hedge disclosures and addressed by Ken during his remarks. As I mentioned earlier, we were able to offset those reductions with cost savings. Additionally, since our second quarter earnings call, we had delays in 2 blocks at our Antelope Valley Solar projects, moving their in-service date and the related portion of our expected investment tax credit into the next year. Overall, we're confident that we can deliver 2013 results comfortably within the revised full year guidance range. Please turn to Slide 6. Turning to Exelon Generation on Slide 6. ExGen's results were $0.05 per share lower quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by lower RNF due to lower realized energy prices. This was partially offset by higher capacity prices, favorable nuclear performance, lower income tax, primarily due to AVSR investment tax credit benefits and lower O&M costs due to merger synergies. Before I turn to the quarterly earnings for the utilities on Slide 7, let me provide a brief update on our load forecast. In general, we saw a slight dip in our load expectations for the full year compared to the update I've provided on last quarter's call. This decrease was largely driven by lower residential usage during the summer and some uncertainty about the economy heading into the fourth quarter, driven by the recent government shutdown. Our overall load growth yield is still very modest and virtually flat for the full year 2013 when excluding the impact of RG Steel's bankruptcy for BGE. More detail on the utility load can be found in the appendix on Slide 19. ComEd's earnings increased $0.05 per share compared to earnings in the prior period last year. This is primarily driven by the benefits of higher distribution revenue due to recovery of pension costs, additional investments that resulted in a growing rate base and higher ROE from a rise in treasury rates. These are partially offset by unfavorable weather compared to the third quarter of 2012 when Northern Illinois experienced above-average heat. PECO's earnings decreased $0.03 per share compared to the earnings in the prior period last year. This decrease is a result of onetime items that occurred last year, with favorable weather and a benefit from the gas distribution tax repairs deduction not repeating this year. BGE's earnings increased $0.06 per share compared to the earnings in the prior period last year. The combination of lower storm costs without the direction of storm from July 2012 and improved electric and gas rates helped improve BGE's quarter-over-quarter earnings. Third quarter saw further progress for the utilities in the regulatory and legislative arena. During this quarter, BGE filed its Strategic Infrastructure Development and Enhancement, or STRIDE, plan to accelerate the modernization of its natural gas distribution system. In addition, ComEd and BGE continued with their rate case proceedings that were filed earlier this year. The ComEd distribution formula rate filing requests an increase of $353 million, which reflects actual 2012 expenses and investments and forecasted 2013 capital additions to our distribution network. We expect a decision by year end, with the new rates going into effect in January of 2014. Additional information on the ComEd rate filing can be found on Slide 20 in the appendix. BGE's ongoing rate case with the Maryland PSC requests an increase of $86.2 million for electric and $24.4 million for gas, adjusted for the actual data submitted in August of this year. We expect the final order in mid-December with new rates going into effect shortly thereafter. BGE rate case details are shown on Slide 21 of the presentation. Slide 8 provides an update of our cash flow expectations for this year. We project cash from operations of $5.8 billion. This is up from last quarter by about $225 million. The primary driver of the increase was favorable working capital at ExGen, mainly driven by higher accounts payable related to the AVSR project delays. Our CapEx forecast is decreased by $70 million from last quarter, mainly due to the AVSR construction delay I mentioned earlier and some lower-than-projected spend at the utilities. That decrease was partially offset by additional wind and non-AVSR solar project spend. Our current 5-year plan includes $16 billion in growth CapEx, with approximately $13.5 billion of that at the utilities where we have the ability to earn a stable rate of return. On the financing side, we have long-term debt issuances at both ComEd and PECO during the third quarter. In August, ComEd issued $350 million of 30-year bonds with an annual interest rate of 4.6%. In September, PECO's bond issuance was for $550 million, including $300 million of 3-year bonds with a 1.2% annual interest rate and $250 million of 30-year bonds with a 4.8% annual interest rate. We do not anticipate any additional long-term bond issuances during the remainder of the year. Our expected financing cash flows are $150 million lower than what we provided in our second quarter update, with the decrease largely driven by a reduced AVSR Department of Energy loan draw given the construction delays I previously referenced. On Slide 9, in late September, Exelon completed the largest-ever wind finance transaction, Continental Wind, a 667-megawatt portfolio of 13 projects located in 6 states and across 5 different wind regimes. Issued $613 million of project finance bonds with a 6% coupon maturing in February 2033. Net proceeds were dividended up to Exelon Generation. This financing is nonrecoursed to Exelon and solely dependent on the cash flows of Continental. The transaction is consistent with our previously communicated strategy to use project financing as a means of strengthening ExGen and Exelon's credit metrics. As a reminder, the appendix includes several schedules that will help you on your modeling efforts. Now I'll turn the call back to Chris for his concluding remarks before we open the call for Q&A.
Christopher M. Crane: Thanks, Jack. There have been a few reports in the past month commenting on the impact of the lower gas and power prices on our earnings. I think these reports all assume that we'll sit on our hands and not take any action and the market participants will not rationalize their behavior. In fact, we continue to take a hard look at our assets and determine their economic viability. We will shut down facilities that we do not see a path to a long-term sustainable profitability. We've built our record on reducing costs and improving productivity of our business, which is shown in the $550 million of synergies from our merger, exceeding our original estimate. Our hedging portfolio -- we are hedging our portfolio to reflect our fundamental view of the market and that it will improve. We continue to look for opportunities to grow. We'll continue to advocate for public policies and market designs that properly compensate our fleet, victories in the court and legislative regulatory fronts that will support our pricing. We'll continue to optimize the use of capital structures, different capital structures like the Continental Wind project financing and our current view of some of the analysts on Exelon's expect performance is not where -- excuse me, the current view of some of the analysts on Exelon expected performance is not where we see it to be. We believe that the analysts have it very wrong, and we would like to change that. With that, I'll open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon.
Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: You guys have been doing a good job on the cost side. Can you tell me, I think we've been assuming that total O&M and TOTI at ExGen, if you include CNG of around $5 billion, but given the headway that you've made on costs this year, could you tell us what the right run rate is as we go into 2014?
Christopher M. Crane: Greg, as you mentioned, we have pulled a substantial amount of costs out and we will update on our O&M at EEI. But I think it's safe to assume we are in the midst of our 5-year planning process that we're targeting flat O&M across the business plan at ExGen.
Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. Second question is, and this goes to the statement you made earlier and I think that you reiterated, there's a view that this negative gas basis that we're seeing in Pennsylvania is going to migrate west as this REX pipeline partially puts around. Can you go into a little bit more detail why you feel like the expectation that negative basis permeates West is incorrect?
Joseph Nigro: Greg, it's Joe Nigro. There's a couple of reasons for that. The first is I think you're right, we do expect the REX pipeline to move gas out to the Mid-Atlantic into the Midwest. Historically, we have seen the need for inflows to the Midwest area of natural gas to meet the demand and that, historically, come out of Canada in the Gulf Coast. We would expect to see the displacement from the gas moving in from the Mid-Atlantic and displacing that gas that, historically, has come out Canada and the Gulf. I think the other important point to mention though, Greg, is that gas basis is one component of it. When you look at our -- when we look at our fundamental forecasting and do all the puts and takes of what we expect from a generation change perspective over the next few years, you still only have gas on the margin a lot less than we do in the Mid-Atlantic. So the impact on the gas basis change when we see a $0.25 change in gas basis lower, for example, the impact on power pricing is less than $0.25 a megawatt-hour. So when you convert that to power, the impact isn't nearly as great.
Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Great. Final question for Chris, and I don't know how much of this you want to answer, but obviously, also, a lot has been written about the potential for further consolidation in PJM. You guys have done a remarkably good job notwithstanding the bad overall macroeconomic environment of making the best of your merger with Constellation. Would you try to -- do you think that in Exelon's future, there's further consolidation, given your -- how you've refined your expertise in managing costs and optimizing portfolios?
Christopher M. Crane: Greg, we've continually supported further consolidation in the industry not only across PJM where it can be done but in other RTOs also. We have a small group that's constantly looking at value-accretive potentials and will continue to look at that as we go forward.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Dan Eggers.
Dan Eggers - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Chris, I guess, just kind of following up at the end of your comments. You kind of talked about the idea that looking at the fleet and rationalizing assets if they don't make sense or you don't see a recovery as you guys expect. How do you frame out the timing of making these kind of decisions relative to kind of the long-standing internal point of view that market conditions are going to recover?
Christopher M. Crane: So we think through 2014 into the first part of 2015, we should see the uplift in the market. If we have it wrong, then we -- there's some assets that we'll have to look at for the long-term profitability. And that would be around the timeframe that I think it will be a very serious conversation taking place.
Dan Eggers - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: [indiscernible] to be about 12 months from now is kind of the time horizon you think that would be the kind of the natural progression you see a recovery?
Christopher M. Crane: Yes.
Dan Eggers - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And then, I guess, you guys had talked previously about your freeing up some capital because of the dividend reduction earlier this year, the idea of potentially buying more assets or getting more contracted assets. Could you just share your thinking on, A, what you're seeing in those markets? And B, what are some downward pressure on your -- at the upper end of your open gross margins and ExGen? Is that going to have a bearing on the timing and maybe deploying that capital?
Christopher M. Crane: Jack, you want to go [indiscernible]?
Jonathan W. Thayer: Sure. So, Dan, you've heard us speak about the reduction in the dividend gives us between $1 billion and $2 billion of balance sheet space or growth capital that we could use and deploy. As we look at various markets and assets, interestingly, you're seeing, in certain markets, very attractive pricing from an ownership standpoint in ERCOT, and obviously, we're a very major owner that isn't necessarily translating into perceived value into our merchant fleet. In other markets, there've been recent transactions in New England, as well, at attractive values. And as you know, through our Boston Gen acquisition, we are a significant owner in that region as well. There hasn't been a lot. I would say there has been a whole lot of speculation about PJM. There hasn't been any actual assets. And so we'll watch, as will others, as other companies may look to strategically realign to a more regulated footprint.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Steven Fleishman.
Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC: First question for Ken. I think, Ken, you mentioned briefly you'll be giving a '16 margin information, and I think you said '16 will be kind of flattish with '15. Is that on an open basis open gross margin?
Kenneth W. Cornew: Steve, I would say, if you look at our hedge disclosure and go down the lines between '15 and '16, we will relatively see flat '15 to '16 in open in several other areas. I would say we have a mark-to-market of hedges in '15 that's $450 million. We have been hedging 2016 and we have positive mark-to-market value at those hedges as well. And I just wanted to make sure you all were thinking about that and we'll go into much more detail at EEI in a couple of weeks.
Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC: Okay, but is the flattish more open or could it even be on a hedge margin?
Kenneth W. Cornew: The flattish is open in several areas. On the hedge, there is a lower hedge mark-to-market of hedges in '16 and '15, but it's not drastic. We have positive mark-to-market value, and like I said, I'd like to go through that more detail at EEI.
Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC: Okay. And then, Chris, just your comment at the end of the call that the -- your view that the analysts have it wrong with all the recent downgrades. How much -- when you say that, how much of that is the analysts have the kind of power market view wrong versus if the power market stays just as it is, that you can continue to do more to make sure Exelon handles the conditions better? Could you just give a little color where you see people having it wrong?
Christopher M. Crane: Yes, I'll start and we'll let Ken continue to fill in the blanks. When we talked about this upside in 2015 with the 22,000 -- 2,200 gigawatts -- 22 gigawatts coming out, there has to be a market rationalization of that, there's a tightening of the stack. We have gone back and the team is in process of modeling assets by asset again in the stack to make sure we have it right. We'll have more details on that at EEI, which -- Ken, do you want to fill in?
Kenneth W. Cornew: Hey, Greg, I think we're making -- I'm sorry, Steve. Steve, we're making a couple of comments there. Chris talked about what we see as upside, and I sound like a broken record when I do this, but I'm going to do it again. In 2013, so far, at NiHub, we're seeing an 8.6 heat rate. We're seeing close to $32 power prices. And then when you look out the curve, you see sub-$31 prices until 2016, with contango in gas and you see heat rates that are a full point lower. We have -- we scrubbed and continue to scrub our modeling of coal retirements. We look at all the announcements and the activity that's going on in the market, whether it's a plants that -- some may think we're retiring and are now being converted to natural gas, whether it's some plants that a lot of people didn't think are retiring that are retiring. And we've actually, given the latest information we've seen on coal plants, we actually are a little more bullish in our analytics about our $2 to $4 upside. We quite frankly have been conservative and has some plants running on coal long term that now have been announced to either being converted to gas, which will take them out of the stack -- take them up the stack and not running nearly as much or actually retiring. So we do think when the spot market rationalizes itself in '15, '16, you're going to see a very different heat rate environment than what the forward markets projecting. I think the other thing is important to realize here is, as Chris said, we're going to be very disciplined and rational about our actions if this is the market. And we're not going to sit on the current market valuations and prices and do nothing about it. So I think that's what we're trying to say. We do think the market will improve. We do think we need to be compensated fairly for the assets and what we provide with our fleet, and we're going to work hard at it.
Christopher M. Crane: It's hard to get your head wrapped around an implied valuation for our nuke set of $100 of kWe.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: So first, just in light of the latest transaction, Energy Edison, I'd be curious just to get your views in terms of what that did to the market versus your $2 to $4 expectations, if you could?
Christopher M. Crane: Julien, I think I just commented at that at some level, but let me have Joe Nigro dive into that a little more for you.
Joseph Nigro: We take into account all the changes that we see in the generation stack when we run our analytics of our fundamental forecasting. We've seen a number of changes over the quarter with some units that we expected to remain in the generation stack actually retiring, some units that we expected to be refueled no longer going to continue operations. We've seen some of the announcement of what specifically energy plants to do with refueling some of the assets that they'd be acquiring from E&E [ph]. When we take all of that into account, as Ken mentioned a minute ago, we still see that $2 to $4 of upside in the market, when you look at the changes coming to the generation stack between the dispatch cost for the coal that remains, the increased cost when -- for plants that are going to refuel, you're talking about PRB coal trains that are currently dispatching $25 a megawatt-hour and refuel environment that's closer to $40 a megawatt-hour, so that has an uptick energy and then we continue to see that 20-plus gigawatts of coal retirements that we expect in PJM alone. And when you put them all that together, as Ken said, we expect to see the $2 to $4 of upside.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Then as conversely, what do you think about the wind impact perhaps in subsequent years offsetting these retirements?
Joseph Nigro: Yes, we do see -- there's a couple of elements to that. We do see the impact of wind greater and greater especially on some of the plants at the nodal level of generation busbar as far as specific level, but we do factor that all into our modeling in the disclosures that we provide you represent the values of what we expect the plants to receive. At the generation busbar, we take that all into account.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Excellent. And then perhaps this is a more of a -- the high-level, as you think about your disclosures, the non-power margin executed versus to go, just thinking about the to-go side of that. For 2013, you're talking about $400 million executed, $200 million in theory to go. Given where we are in the year, how do you think about achieving that to go piece? Is that sort of in theory something that you achieve more on the spot basis in that sort of a transactional sense? Or is that something that you would -- you still need to sign contracts to get? I'm just trying to understand what you're saying.
Joseph Nigro: Yes, there's a couple of elements to that. The non-power bucket includes our fuels business both on the retail and wholesale side. It includes our services business on the retail side, so that would be energy efficiency, demand response, our BGE HOME business, our solar business and then lastly it includes the results of our proprietary trading book. What I would say is, as noted in the disclosure, the gross up of our services businesses are expensive. It really inflates the amount that remains to go, so the results of these businesses have been reflected on an EBIT basis in our earnings guidance. The gross up of those businesses the way it's reflected is approximately $100 million. So we're in line generally with the expectations that we remain with that non-power to go business. And again it's across the 3 areas I had mentioned, our services business, the seasonality to our fuels business and then finally a higher proprietary trading results.
Christopher M. Crane: Julien, just to reiterate those, a large piece of that is run rate business on our services and our natural gas sales that renew themselves on a monthly basis.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Great. And a quick clarification actually on the prior question. When you were referring to taxes in New England, is it that you want to acquire more there or that it's a potential sales opportunity? Sorry, if it wasn't clear.
Unknown Executive: We're looking at growing the portfolio where it makes sense and we see good returns. Conversely, if we think the market's right and it's a good time to harvest capital, we would also sell assets.
Unknown Executive: And Julien, some of the reference that's similar to the Continental Wind financing, there are opportunities that we can look at within certain of our parts of our fleet that could be considered noncore to look at structured finance opportunities as another means of extracting value. So ERCOT, New England and then our hydro assets would be areas where we might consider pursuing that activity, as well as incremental financing at the Continental holding company level.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: So project finance at the thermal -- some of the thermal assets?
Unknown Executive: Correct.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold.
Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: I just want to revisit the last question that Julien had there. On taxes, I think you talked about sort of disconnect between asset values and some expectations in the markets, something like that? And are you -- can you comment on recent changes and expectations around market structure and are you more inclined to be a buyer or a seller in that market?
Christopher M. Crane: We would like to be more of a buyer in the ERCOT market where we see the market rules going. The most recent assets that have traded have been slightly above a value that we would put on them, so we'll still participate. Nothing I've seen yet would say it's time to liquidate. We think there's upside to that market, so there's upside to those asset valuations for the ones we have. And we'll continue to participate as things come to the market. But other entities have placed a slightly higher value on than we can see getting out of.
Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay, that's great. And then can I just on the kind of wind question in the Midwest, this is Ken or Joe, is there a way of giving us a sense, you see that forward curve, but obviously, it's made up of expectations around hourly pricing. As you look out into 2014, '15 and '16, how much of an impact does sort of incremental hours of potentially negative pricing have on the sort of aggregate calendar year strip that we look at. Is there any help you can give us on that?
Joseph Nigro: Yes, we've seen negative prices at some of our nuclear plants up to call it 15% of the hours. When we look at the modeling that we do, we see that there's constraints on the system and congestions. We take that into account when we're building the value of the disclosure up from the bottoms up, I would call it. So we're not marking the generators to a NiHub price. We're marking the generators to a busbar price that has an expectation of what the congestion in marginal losses will look like at each of those plants for each of the years, and that included in that is the expectation of what the wind development will be in that time period and the impact that it has.
Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: So is there -- are you saying that you'll have more wind but more infrastructure and it's kind of a wash?
Joseph Nigro: Yes, we continue to grow the wind development in the Midwest, and we continue to see degradation in the basis value of some of our plants. And that degradation is reflected in the buildup of our disclosure. We do expect as you get out past the period that we've disclosed with some transmission changes, you could see possible improvement but that's not reflected in this current disclosure. This current disclosure reflects the degradation that we've seen.
Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: So is that 15%, is that specific to sort of like history and it's going to get worse from there or is that what you're expecting it to become.
Christopher M. Crane: Well, let me bring it up and summarize. I think I'll have Joe Dominguez talk about the project when we've got in the short term to mitigate it. So what we've taken in the model is the most conservative with the RPS standards as the state's being fully met. Then we have that with a lot of inflow coming from MISO into the system and the negative impacts of the worst-case scenario of meeting the full RPS standard is in the model. So that's -- we're not betting on something better to happen with that. But in the meantime, Joe, why don't you cover the project that you have in place there?
Joseph Dominguez: Sure. And just as Joe said, we're seeing 14% to 15% of off-peak hours at our facility that is most exposed to the problem. It is not a problem that we face at every one of our nuclear units. In fact, the problem really exists where you would imagine if we're geographically more located to where the wind is coming across the seam. We have been working, I think, this has been reported in the press and by some of you we've been working with PJM to wrap our nuclear assets down at night when we're seeing a negative pricing of vendor when PJM is saying a negative pricing. We work with PJM to market monitor to formulate a program that allows us to start doing that on a pilot basis. We've experienced first couple evolutions of that. It is difficult for us to capture all of these events because the events are ultimately as unpredictable as the wind itself. But that's 1 method that we're working through. The other thing that we've accomplished is some rule changes in MISO where the intermittent resources now have to have a price bid into the system, which will allow for their dispatchability. We've seen some improvement in negative pricing events really as a function of that rule change. I think as Joe indicated, this problem is very much acquired at the transmission constraints at this plant space stage. So as very different plants get the benefit of transmission expansion programs and other transmission work that is occurring in Illinois, it wouldn't necessarily be the case that the problem is going to increase, for example, from 14% to something greater in the off-peak hours. It is, however, an issue and it's an issue that has driven us to take position on introduction tax credit and other incentive programs that are distorting the market and that really explains the company's position over the last couple of years. When Chris talked about the ongoing policy work is going to continue to evolve across all of these areas, the subsidy work, as well as the regulatory response to the subsidies so that we can try to clear up this problem as best we can.
Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Can you quantify the offsets?
Joseph Dominguez: Well, I don't think so yet. But I think it's fair to say that, for example, the plant that we experienced the 14% impact in 2012, that impact is significantly less, I'm going to call it 4% to 6% lower in '13 as a result of some transmission expansion. We'll see how the market reacts to this. It's hard for me to differentiate between the dispatchable intermittent resource rule that was accomplished in and the transmission work but I think we can marginally improve it. That said, it's a continuing problem.
Operator: Our next question comes from Hugh Wynne.
Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: I wonder if you might comment on the demand assumptions that underpin your outlook for the power market recovery. And in particular, what are your expectations for energy efficiency gains. Just looking at Page 19 of your slide deck, it seems like we've seen declines in power demand across the regulated utilities system. So that's the first question. And the second question is what are your assumptions for the shape of the load going forward? And in particular, will there be a flattening of demand as demand response gets bid into the energy market in PJM?
Joseph Nigro: Hugh, it's Joe. A couple of things. From a demand perspective, we forecast about 0.8% load growth in our $2 to $4 modeling across the PJM footprint. So historically, you've seen a conversion rate of, call it, 0.6% to 1% -- of 1% versus a 1% change in GDP. We're down to about 0.3% conversion and it's on the back of what you're talking about energy efficiency and demand response. In addition to that, we've run a sensitivity that if we were flat over the 5-year horizon with 0 load growth, the impact to that $2 to $4 is about $1 of megawatt-hour, just to give you some frame of reference of what the load growth value represents. I think to your question on the shape of the load flattening, I think it's safe to say we have seen that already, given the fact that we have seen substantial amount of demand response. And we have seen the impact of energy efficiency. I think the element that I would add though in our $2 to $4 of modeling, we don't include any upside associated with the rule changes in PJM as it relates to demand response bidding into the energy market. For frame of reference, we saw a couple of times this summer, we're the first energy market went to $1,800 a megawatt-hour in the back of demand response bidding. And I think just as importantly from the Exelon perspective in September during the heat wave given some generation outages and transmission outages, they implemented about 6,000 megawatts demand response that if you're bidding in the energy market would have a price associated with it that would've made to telling people it's very different that it actually did. So yes, it does flatten the load but I think there is an ancillary benefit when you think about what price that demand response we'll be bidding at and it can set the locational marginal price.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd.
Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Most of my questions have been addressed but wanted to just go back to the retail business a bit, and Ken, I think you said that the margin outlook is unchanged. I wondered if you might be able to talk this a little bit about just competitive dynamics in the business, any trends you're seeing in terms of degree of competition or changes in the business over time?
Joseph Nigro: It's Joe Nigro. Our retail business, the market environment overall still remains extremely competitive, and it's extremely competitive both on the commercial and industrial side and on the mass market side. What I would say to you is we've seen some stabilizing effect on our margins, meaning we've talked to you that our margins on the C&I side for power have been sub-$2, and they remain so, but they've stabilized slightly below that. And our expectation in our plan as we look at next year is not to see much improvement in that area. We have seen consolidation with what went on with the [indiscernible] with the direct energy process of buying but the market is still highly competitive.
Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay, and just hitting on the heat rate outlook, you had spent quite a bit of time on the Midwest as you look at PJM East and West, what's your general view from where we stand now in terms of the heat rate outlook in the East and West?
Joseph Nigro: But I think Ken mentioned this earlier. We still hold a view of $2 to $4 of upside and the $2 when we're reflected is on the West -- on the eastern side of PJM, excuse me, and it's driven -- really, when you look at the changing composition of the dispatch stack in the locational margin price model, there are still hours that the eastern unit benefit from that change of the dispatch stack. So we have seen a degradation and basis as we talk about the gas basis -- gas that market basis is reflected in our analytical modeling and we're using those prices and with all that we do see the $2 of upside expected in the Mid-Atlantic.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Chin.
Brian Chin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Just a point of clarification on the gross margin comment earlier. When you said that the gross margin generally is unchanged year-over-year in '16, were you referring to only the open gross margin row or were you talking about the total gross margin, the $7.6 billion?
Jonathan W. Thayer: Brian, the open gross margin's unchanged. Most of our disclosure lines like our new business, non-power margins, those elements are largely going to be unchanged. We are hedging so we do have positive value in the mark-to-market of hedges. We will disclose exactly what that is in a couple of weeks. So I was referring to a similar 2015 to '16 outlook except for that we have had less hedging so somewhat less of mark-to-market hedge value.
Brian Chin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay, great. And then just as a reminder, the open gross margin includes capacity revenues so the drop in '16 capacity revenues is obviously being offset by something else in your open gross margin comment?
Jonathan W. Thayer: That's correct.
Brian Chin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay, great. And then my second follow-up question, we've seen other competitors out there where they've used a yield curve structure to tap a lower cost of equity for consolidation purposes. Can you just comment a little bit on to what extent does that present either challenges or opportunities for you and how you think consolidation can progress as far as Exelon is concerned?
Jonathan W. Thayer: So Brian, this is Jack. Where you've seen the YieldCo [ph] particularly at NRG have success, they really have a shareholder base that values those shares on the basis of exposure, the power markets and on an EBITDA-multiple basis. They had a modest dividend but they had an opportunity to carve off assets into a yield-oriented vehicle to optimize that. I think people own us for both our upside to power markets but also our dividend. And certainly, our renewables assets and the contracted nature of them as it factors into our ability to pay a dividend and drive value and reduced volatility in the earnings profile of the company, we think create value. That said, we do look at many structures, and we certainly have assets that align to those types of structures. And to the extent that there are -- that the price of capital for those structures and the need to acquire assets drives the markets higher, then the implied value of our renewables fleet should improve along with that.
Brian Chin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Does the renewables fleet that you own now more merit a closer look towards a yield curve structures so that way, you can compete on a similar cost of equity footing?
Christopher M. Crane: I think it has us look at more of project financing for the credit quality that it gives us and then bringing that cash back in for investment.
Jonathan W. Thayer: And the reality is, Brian, as you know, we can tap many markets to secure capital to grow our business. And if you think about who the investors are in those yield-oriented names, whether they're pension funds or insurance companies or other elements, we're capping similar capital, as Chris mentioned, through the project financing side. We could, through other means, secure capital as well from those entities at a lower cost of capital. And there are opportunities in a nonpublic vehicle to form relationships with entities to benefit from that lower cost of capital. So rest assured, we're looking at any and always optimize the cost of capital for our company as we look to deploy capital for growth and the implied yield or cost of capital on certain of those YieldCo is not lost on us.
Operator: Our final question comes from the line of Shahriar Pourreza.
Shahriar Pourreza - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Most of my questions were answered. Chris, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned that your cash flow outlook puts you in a position to make potential acquisitions in the space. Does your cash flow outlook also assume a scenario where EDF may put the nuclear assets to you as early as 2016? And what could potentially be a pretty challenging [indiscernible] environment? And I have a follow-up.
Christopher M. Crane: We do stress the balance sheet for any potential commitments that have to be made. If you look in the disclosure, we have the like-kind-exchange issue in the out years that where we feel that we're going to prevail on, but there was a probability shift and we had to put that in the disclosure. And we stressed the balance sheet to make that commitment before we agreed to the EDF potential point, we made sure that, that was stressed. So we are very comfortable where we're at right now with the balance sheet.
Jonathan W. Thayer: And remember there's -- as part of that contract, there's a baseball arbitrage type of valuation approach. So to the extent where the challenge course spread market, then that should show up in the implied value of those assets, thereby reducing the put value.
Shahriar Pourreza - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And then let me -- just one more question is under an assumption that the power price or heat rate recovery doesn't materialize and you find yourself in a scenario where you're rationalizing your fleet, a couple of the assets in those put options could also face cash flow challenges. I'm kind of curious on how the change in outlook could impact that transaction? Do you have like a clause where you can back out of the transaction or is it essentially the flexibility is going to come where the economic value of the assets are?
Christopher M. Crane: Yes, that's where the flexibility comes. If they're negative MPV and the negative cash flow would be in the valuation and so they're really not worth anything on the baseball arbitration. So we don't feel stressed over the deal. We think the upside we're getting from driving the synergies the cost savings out of it is the real focus of this.
Ravi Ganti: Thank you, operator. That ends the call.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator:  Good morning. My name is Kalia, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to our host Ravi Ganti. You may begin your conference.
Ravi Ganti:  Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Exelon’s second quarter 2013 earnings conference call. Thank you for joining us today. We issued our earnings release this morning. If you haven’t received it, the release is available on Exelon’s Investor website. The earnings release and the other maters we will discuss in today’s call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties and the actual results could differ from our statements. Please refer to today’s 8-K and Exelon’s other filings for a discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from management’s projections, forecasts, and expectations, and for a reconciliation of operating to GAAP earnings. Leading the call today are Chris Crane, Exelon’s President and CEO; Ken Cornew, Exelon’s Chief Commercial Officer and President and CEO of Exelon Generation and Jack Thayer, Exelon’s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by other members of the executive management team who will be available to answer your questions at the end of the prepared remarks. We have scheduled 60 minutes for this call. I now turn the call over to Chris.
Christopher M. Crane:  Good morning and thank you for everybody joining. We delivered on our financial and operational expectations this quarter. In the markets lower commodity prices continue to challenge us both in the near-term in the outer years. Ken Cornew will provide more detail on both the power markets and the capacity markets. Overall the prices that were received in the RPM auction this quarter were disappointing, but not devastating. We can’t control or influence the markets. We can control our actions, business practices and decisions. We continue to leverage on our core competencies, our reliability and efficiency provides a competitive advantage. By resizing the dividend we’ve strengthened our balance sheet and now have a sustainable dividend and the ability to invest and grow even when prices move against us. Moving to the financial update, the second quarter operating earnings were $0.53 a share within the guidance of $0.50 to $0.60 a share and Jack Thayer will discuss the drivers around that. We’re providing guidance of $0.60 to $0.70 per share for the third quarter operating earnings and reaffirming our full year guidance of $2.35 to $2.65 per share. Operations remained strong, while the full-year gross margin expectations at Constellation are lower as you can see from the hedge disclosure, the full company impact has been offset largely by reductions and cost and strong utility performance. And both Jack and Ken will provide more details around that. Moving to operational excellence on Slide 1, we’re on track for very good year operationally. Our Generation fleet performed well of this quarter, nuclear ran at 92.8 capacity factor in the second quarter despite our refueling outage days which is normal and for the loss of offsite power at LaSalle in April. Year-to-date performance for the fleet has been excellent with a capacity factor slightly under 95%. Our agreement with EDF provides an opportunity to do what we do best, run the CENG plants, safely, reliably and more efficiently. Fossil and renewable fleets have had a strong quarter as well. Fossil and hydro dispatch match rate was at 99.1% solar and wind energy capture were at 92.4% and the utilities had very solid performance thus far this year. All three utilities to date are in top decile safety performance and a continuing improvement in consumer satisfaction index year-over-year. On the regulatory advocacy side, in Illinois, Illinois State Bill 9 was enacted this quarter. It enables us to start executing grid modernization plans, including installation of Smart Meters to improve reliability. We’ve filed rate cases of both ComEd and BGE and this will now be a regular practice, as we have accelerated our capital into those systems. The RPM auctions, as I said, Ken will provide some more context around that, but like all competitive generators and PJM, we’re disappointed with the May results. Looking back on RPM and the auction process, it is a 12 year old process. From time-to-time, we have had issues arise around the process that have required us to go back to the stakeholder process and make amendments. We will be working with PJM and fellow stakeholders on improvements and recommendations to address the increased reliance on planned resources and also supporting PJM’s effort to enhance the MOPR rules as well as rules governing demand response. On the growth and investment side, we are bringing new megawatts online, growing our rate base with smart grid investments. We’ve installed 99 megawatts of solar at our AVSR solar facility year-to-date and expect to add another 102 megawatts to complete the project. We are adding approximately 46 megawatts to our wind portfolio in 2014, with our Beebe project in Michigan. The Smart Meter installation projects are well underway this year at all three utilities for 2013, BGE has installed 287,000 meters thus far, 980,000 are expected to be installed by year-end. At PECO, we have 364,000 meters in year-to-date with 562 expected by year end. And ComEd Smart Meter deployment begins in September with 60,000 meters expected by year end and we’ll continue to look for other opportunities to grow value. As we talked about before financial discipline is key to our management model. Our decision to cancel the EPUs at LaSalle and Limerick demonstrate our continued focus on financial discipline and value return. We can return capital in other places elsewhere in a value chain to realize value at a sooner pace. We are on track to achieve synergies associated with merger including $305 million of synergies in 2013 and the run rate of $550 million of synergies beginning in 2014. And we continue to look to pull cost out of the business across all businesses. The wholesale market and the competitive retail market are challenging. The impact on our gross margin expectations through 2015 have been noted. We are aggressively taking actions to offset these challenges by taking on additional cost cutting to focus on each business and optimize the portfolio. Now I’ll turn it over to Ken Cornew to provide some more specifics on power and gas markets in our retail business.
Kenneth W. Cornew:  Thanks Chris and good morning everyone. As Chris mentioned I’ll cover the recent PJM capacity auction, market trends, and then provide an update on the Constellation business. As Chris said in his opening remarks the results of the May capacity auction were disappointing. Results were lower than we and many others, including most of you on the call had anticipated. As you know this was largely due to the 90% increase in capacity imports over the previous auction and the amount of new generation that cleared. The volume of new generation that cleared in the auction is surprising given the lower clearing prices. We do not believe that it is reflective of the long-term capacity revenues needed to support new generation development. 10 gigawatts of coal did not clear in the auction, a record level and the amount of coal offered in the capacity auction continuous to decline from 67 gigawatts in 2013, 2014 to 59 gigawatts in 2016, 2017. These two facts bolster our view that more than 20 gigawatts of coal will be retired in PJM by 2016. Slide 3 depicts the fundamental changes to PJM supply stack that have occurred over the last few auctions. As you can see from this chart on the top left, the existing PJM generation stack as it existed in the 2013, 2014 planning year has become a smaller percentage of the overall capacity. There is a large amount of planned new generation expected to be online by 2015 and 2016 and the 2016, 2017 planning year imports, demand response, energy efficiency, combine for nearly 22 gigawatts of PJM capacity. When we factor all of these changes to the supply stack along with other input assumptions such as modest load growth projections and current forward fuel prices, we continued to see upside compared to the current forward PJM power markets. Like all of you, we continue to wait and watch for developments on some of these new planned resources. Needless to say, if the new planned resources do not materialize, it may create additional volatility in the market and potential for upside in power prices beyond what it in our current forecast. Additionally, the retired coal units are being replaced by some supplier resources which have a very different dispatch profile. This can lead to increased volatility in spot energy prices. We have many issues to consider from this RPM auction. Will the require transmission for imports to get built? Will the new generation get built at these prices? At what price does demand response participate in the energy market? Do these trends continue at the next auction or do they reverse? We’ve seen anomalies in the RPM auction results before and have successfully used stakeholder process at PJM and FERC to improve the auction process. The MOPR isses of the 2015, 2016 auction, were largely fixed by FERC. As a result of the stakeholder process at PJM. Exelon intends to work with PJM, other PJM stakeholders and FERC in reviewing the auction results and considering potential changes to market rules to address PJM’s increased reliance on planned resources. Slide 4 provides an overview of how we position the portfolio to benefit from our fundamental views. Forward power prices have fallen since we last updated you on the Q1 call. In particular, West Hub and NI Hub decreased by $2.90 a megawatt hour and $2.68 a megawatt hour in 2015 respectively. Natural gas prices decreased approximately $0.16 an Mmbtu in 2015, which has caused some of the decline in power price. We continue to see a disconnect in forward heat rates compared to our fundamental forecast, given current natural gas prices, given expected retirements, given the new generation resources and given our modest loan growth assumption. We have acted on this view and have widened our deviation in rateable across our entire portfolio in the past six months, which has reached approximately 8% under-rateable for 2015. The actual deviation in a pure underlying power position is even greater, when auctions and cross commodity hedges are factored in. Let me address the following question. What does this market upside really mean in terms of earnings or gross margins for Exelon? To put it simply, it depends on the unhedged position in our portfolio at the time the upside is realized in the market. The sooner the upside is realized the greater the impact. Our fundamental view remains that there are $2 to $4 of upside still to be realized in the PJM markets. This market upside will have a gross margin impact of around $550 million on a fully open basis. We will continue to evaluate the amount of upside we see in prices due to our views and carry positions that allow us to benefit as much as possible from the realization of these views. Now I’ll turn to Constellation’s results for this year and the outlook for the next two years. There are increased challenges in the business from all sides. As I mentioned before power prices are lower, forward heat rates are lower and there continues to be pressure on the retail segment from aggressive competitions and reduced volatility. As you can see on Slide 5 for 2013 the total reduction to gross margin from the last quarter is $150 million there are three elements equally contributing to this reduction. First we had lower than expected generation in the quarter, due to an unplanned outage at our LaSalle plant and delays in the online day for portions of our AVSR solar project. Despite these delays there’ll be an offset in terms of depreciation expense for AVSR in the Genco financials. The second element is under collection of revenues from PJM financial transmission rates or FTRs otherwise known as congested rates. For those of you that monitor PJM you likely know this under collection situation for entities that only these congestion rates are being paid significantly less than their full value. Third the remaining is due to $50 million reduction in our new business targets for the year largely attributed to reduced expectations at our wholesale gross margins. In 2014 and 2015 our disclosure indicates a reduction of $250 million and $400 million respectively in our hedged gross margin. The reduction in power price and the resulting impact on our under hedged generation contributes to the bulk of this drop. As you’ve heard us say for the last few quarters, the retail space is extremely competitive and challenged. We have remained disciplined and have not gone after volume for the sake of volume, but have maintained appropriate margin on our sales. Due to this continued competition and limited volatility, we revised our estimates from both a margin and volume perspective. Our expectation for the weighted realized margin of our retail business still remains in the lower end of our $2 to $4 a megawatt hour range. Our recent retail C&I origination margins are slightly below that $2, however, we expect to be in that $2 to $4 range in the longer-term. Additionally, we are lowering our volume expectations from what we published at EEI by 15, 20 and 25 terawatt hours for 2013, 2014 and 2015 respectively. We’re still optimistic that we can grow the retail business, but given the overall competitive environment, we have seen over the last 18 months, we’ve chosen to be more conservative in our volume estimates. To mitigate the impact of lower gross margins and new business targets, we continue to take a hard look at our cost and optimizing our process. We’ve reduced the Constellation O&M budget by roughly $15 million for 2013, 2014 and 2015. We’ll continue to look for additional opportunities to further reduce our operating costs for process and system improvements. In total, ExGen’s reducing its Q&M by $100 million in 2013, which includes the $50 million of O&M reduction at Constellation, I just discussed. We are targeting O&M reductions in 2014 and 2015 that will result in a roughly flat CAGR for ExGen. I’ll now turn it over to Jack, to review the full financial information for the quarter.
Jonathan W. Thayer: Thank you, Ken and good morning everyone. I’ll review the second quarter financial results, our third quarter guidance range, key events of the quarter at the utilities and our balance sheet and cash flow outlook. I’ll start with our financial results on Slide 6. As Chris mentioned earlier, Exelon produced results consistent with our expectations. Operating earnings for the second quarter of this year were $0.53 per share within our Q2 guidance range of $0.50 to $0.60 per share. We reduced O&M at ExGen and realized the favorable impacts of SB9. These positive drivers are offset by a favorable performance at Constellation. This compares to earnings of $0.61 per share during the second quarter of 2012. The key drivers of the quarter-over-quarter difference were lower realized energy prices at Generation, decreased capacity pricing and higher nuclear fuel costs. I will go into greater detail on the quarter’s drivers in a few minutes. For the full year, we are reaffirming our guidance range of $2.35 to $2.65 per share. Despite the reductions in gross margin as seen in our hedge disclosures, we are confident that we can deliver on our full year guidance range. This is due to the passage of Senate Bill 9, the outcomes of the rate cases at ComEd and BGE, the full $100 million of O&M reductions at ExGen and appreciation offsets due to the AVSR delay. We will continue to look additional opportunities to improve our cost structure and streamline the business. For the third quarter, we’re providing a guidance range of $0.60 to $0.70 per share. Turning to Exelon Generation on Slide 7, ExGen’s results were $0.15 per share lower quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by lower rev net fuel due to lower realized energy prices and lower capacity prices. This was partially offset by lower O&M costs due to merger synergies and lower income tax due to investment tax credit benefits from AVSR. Before I turn to the quarterly earnings for the utilities on Slide 8, let me provide a brief update on our load forecast. In general, the outlook for 2013 is improving as economic conditions continue to strengthen. Both ComEd and PECO are forecasting positive load growth for 2013 and BGE would be positive after removing the negative impacts of RG Steel. More detail on utility load can be found in the appendix on Slide 19. ComEd’s earnings increased $0.06 per share, compared to the earnings in the prior period last year. This is primarily driven by the reversal of the write-down of a regulatory asset we recorded in Q2 of 2012, based on ICC order we received in May of that year. We’re also seeing the benefits of higher distribution revenue due to higher allowed ROE and the impact of SB9. These are offset by unfavorable weather compared to the second quarter of 2012, where Northern Illinois experienced above average heat in June. PECO’s earnings decreased $0.01 per share, compared to the earnings in the prior period last year. This decrease is a result of the premium paid for redemption of PECO preferred stock during the quarter. Higher O&M costs for the quarter due to inflation were offset by lower income taxes. BGE’s earnings increased $0.01 per share, compared to earnings in the prior period last year. This is related to the increased electric and gas rates that were received in the recent rate order. Second quarter was a productive time for the utilities in the regulatory and legislative arena. During this quarter, BGE filed a rate case and in Illinois, the legislature overwrote Governor Quinn’s veto of SB9. The impact of SB9 is expected to be $0.01 per share in 2013 and $0.04 per share in 2014. In late May, ComEd also amended its rate case to reflect the passage of Senate Bill 9. The amended filing requests an increase of $359 million, which is $48 million more than the pre-SB9 filing. This request reflects actual 2012 expenses and investments and forecasted 2013 capital additions through our distribution network. We expect the decision by year end with a new rates going into effect in January of 2014. In May, BGE filed a rate case with the Maryland PSC asking for an increase of $101.5 million for electric and $29.7 million for gas. We expect the final order in mid-December with new rates going into effect shortly thereafter. We’re optimistic that we can build upon the results of our last rate case. We continue to target a 5% to 6% growth in rate base for all three of our utilities and have set a target 10% earned ROE by the end of our planning period. In the appendix, we’ve updated our rate base and ROE targets for the utilities. As you will see, we’ve maintained all three utilities long-term equity target ratio of 53%. However, in the short to intermediate term, we believe an equity to total capital ratio of 46% allows ComEd to effectively earn on all equity invested in both transmission and distribution businesses. Given our current situation and capital structure at ComEd with more equity would result in less than optimal earnings in the transmission business. Slide 9 provides an update of our cash flow expectations for this year. We project cash from operations of $5.6 billion, this is down from last quarter by about $270 million, primary drivers to decline include lower net income at Exelon Generation related to the revision in our full year portfolio targets and timing of tax refunds at ComEd originally anticipated for 2013 that are now expected in 2014. Our CapEx forecast has increased by $125 million from last quarter, mainly due to accelerated AMI deployment at ComEd, movement of upstream spend from the first quarter of 2014 into 2013, and the addition of the Beebe Phase I project in the Wind portfolio. Our current five year plan includes $16 billion in growth CapEx with approximately $13.5 billion of that at the utilities, where we have the ability to earn a stable rate of return. We’ve upsized our planned ComEd long-term debt issuance by $500 million from last quarter due to the aforementioned delay in tax refunds. PECO’s anticipated $550 million issuance and $500 million retirement, contemplates termination of its $210 million accounts receivable facility, which matures on August 30, 2013. Last month, we received commitments from all banks within the BGE, PECO, Exelon Corp. and Exelon Generation core credit facilities to extend the maturity date in one year. With the ComEd extension executed early this year, all $8 billion of our core credit facilities are now extended into 2018. This extension provides refinancing flexibility to Exelon as new banking regulations are implemented over the next several years. Yesterday, we announced that we reached an agreement with EDF to operate the CENG plants. As part of the agreement, Exelon will provide CENG with a $400 million loan at an interest rate of 5.25%, which will be used to provide a special dividend to EDF. Once the loan is repaid, Exelon will receive a preferred dividend from CENG. The agreement includes an option for EDF to sell us their stake in CENG in the future. The financial structure of the agreement allows Exelon to take over day-to-day operations of the plants. It is intended to be as close to financially neutral as possible for the owner companies enabling each to capture the value created by a world class operator like Exelon, operating the plants. We expect to close on the agreement in the first quarter or early in the second quarter next year. And as a reminder, the appendix includes several schedules that will help you in your modeling efforts. Now I’ll turn the call back to Chris for his concluding remarks before we open the call for Q&A.
Christopher M. Crane: Thanks to Jack and Ken. Exelon continues to excel at our core competencies. Operating our plants while keeping the lights on at the utilities and managing risk and optimizing our portfolio. We continue making productivity and operational enhancements to drive efficiencies across our business. Our strong balance sheet allows us to invest in our business and find ways to grow. When we screen growth opportunities, we look for value creating investments that are EPS, free cash flow and credit metrics accretive. We will act on those accretive opportunities at both an incremental level and a transformational level, leveraging our skill in markets. Our operating agreement with CENG is a good example as Jack has just outlined, we are investing $16 billion in our business over the planning period mostly in our regulated utilities as Jack stated we’ll result in a rate based growth of 5% to 6%. In conclusion, we faced a number of challenges. Exelon is focused on the fundamentals of our business throughout the growth process, as we continue to add value to our shareholders. And with that Ravi, I guess we’ll open up for questions.
Ravi Ganti: Yes, sir. Operator, we’ll now take questions from the participants.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley.
Stephen C. Byrd – Morgan Stanley: Good morning.
Christopher M. Crane: Good morning, Stephen.
Stephen C. Byrd – Morgan Stanley: I wondered if you could talk in a little more depth about the synergy potential with the additional nuclear units that you’ll be operating. Can you just talk in little more specifics about what kind of operational advantages you see from this transaction?
Christopher M. Crane: The first advantage is a reduction of $50 million to $70 million of expense at the current within the current operating model and that’s significant in itself. Beyond that is the flexibility to move resources around to continue to improve the talent development, not only within our own fleet, but the CENG fleet. We’re really focused as everybody knows on the long-term viability of the small assets and we think this will give us a much better chance to have the whole fleet operate at a higher safety and reliability while reducing cost.
Stephen C. Byrd – Morgan Stanley: Great, thank you very much. And then shifting over to your wind business and thinking about some of your contracted assets. Can you talk just generally about your appetite for either growing in that business or going the other direction and trying to monetize given the value of the contracted assets? How do you all think about the strategic path there?
Christopher M. Crane: Go ahead Jack.
Jonathan W. Thayer: Sure. So Stephen, it’s Jack Thayer. As we look at assets and it’s not just our wind assets. We look at what we believe the internal value of those assets are and then we bench that relative to what we see in the market as an implied value for those assets. As you think about those wind assets, one of the opportunities that we’re working through right now is our project financing on our wind facility and that we expect to raise, somewhere between $625 million to $700 million of balance sheet debt. To the extent that we successfully complete that and we anticipate that in September of this year, we’ll then be in a position to look at those assets on an off balance sheet basis and see what’s the optimal way to organize those within the Company. We also expect to use this off-balance-sheet structure to be able to the extent we’re adding to our Wind portfolio or our Solar portfolio to optimize their capital structure to gain as much earnings accretion from those investments as possible.
Christopher M. Crane: The only thing I would add, we have continued to grow in the renewable space as Jack said the Wind and Solar. But a long-term large scale business model on a highly subsidized product is something that we watch closely. The only thing I would add, we have continued to grow in the renewable space, with as Jack said, the Wind and Solar, but a long-term large scale business model on a highly subsidized product is something that we watch closely. We have clearly stated that we think that Washington picking winners and losers on subsidies, it is not a long-term plan. So, we will continue to monitor the Federal policy and the State policy as we look at growth potentials in that area.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon of ISI Group.
Christopher M. Crane: Hey Greg.
Greg Gordon – ISI Group: When you talk about hedging through the gas markets, just trying to leave your heat rate position open, how should we think about the way you are hedging in the context of, for instance, natural gas basis and PJM having collapsed relative to historical basis versus Henry Hub given the Marcellus situation?
Christopher M. Crane: I’ll get Joe to answer that, Joe Nigro.
Joseph Nigro: Good morning Greg. Greg in our disclosure we show you our hedge percentages by region and you can see if we use 2015 as a proxy year, we are approximately 50% hedged which is right on ratable in the Mid-Atlantic region. And in the Midwest we are about 40% approximately hedged, which would be 10% behind. As we have stated, we see the most amount of upside aligning to the Midwest region with all the changes that Ken talked about in the script. The big thing is as it relates to gap hedging is, the bulk of the trade that we have done in gas is relative to our Midwest position. And the gas basis there has been much more stable as you know the Mid-Atlantic basis has really seen a roll-down with the Marcellus shale, when you look at gas basis at city gate in Chicago over the last year or so, the degradation has been much, much less than what it's been in the Mid-Atlantic. So the trade aligns well with our Midwest position.
Greg Gordon – ISI Group: Okay so you tend to trade the more liquid contracts at the Henry Hub, so we should look at basis as being something that you have to manage if the basis starts to become more volatile?
Joseph Nigro: Absolutely, as you know as you move out on the basis, on the curve in time it gets more difficult to effectively execute the basis in different areas. We do use primarily the NYMEX contract and then if there is an opportunity we will layer in the basis as appropriate.
Greg Gordon – ISI Group: Okay. A couple questions for Jack. You had laid out some numbers in terms of what you thought you would generate in terms of we investable capital over the next several years after the dividend cut and that that was sort of your sort of warchest for opportunities should they arise in the business. Can you reiterate what those numbers were and have they dissipated significantly because of the downturn in the retail and wholesale power markets on the capacity outcome?
Jonathan W. Thayer: Sure. So, as you recall, we spoke to roughly $2 billion to $3 billion of balance sheet capacity in the first quarter call, with the degradation in power prices, we have seen that come in. It’s in a roughly $1 billion to $2 billion range now, and a way to think about this from a sensitivity standpoint is for every plus or minus dollar move from megawatt hour roughly to the plus side, $750 million of capacity is created to the down side roughly $650 million is lost depending on what power prices do.
Greg Gordon – ISI Group: Great. And Jack, where are you guys in terms of the evaluation of whether or not you're certain of your nuclear plants are viable in the longer-term and when might we get a decision on that?
Christopher M. Crane: This is Chris, I will cover that. We have worked hard over the last couple of years to continue to focus on cost to maintain some of the viability of the smaller units. As we have mentioned our Clinton facility in MISO, the nuclear team has come up with a fairly good plan to put the plant on annual refueling cycles, which keeps it viable for years to come as the market recovers. As one of the newest boiling water reactors, in our fleet and in the country, it’s a well-run plant, which last year had zero-force loss rate and so we are not ready to give up on it, we are continuing to optimize its cost structure, maintaining it safe but also neutral on the balance sheet. As we look at our other smaller ones, being able to bring Gannett into the Exelon cost structure, I think will give us time to continue to look at that, as we understand the policies that are revolving in New York, around capacity and transmission. So, there is nothing on the chopping block right now. It is constant work to look at cost. It's constant work to look at regulatory structure and if it does not improve, we will be talking more about those facilities.
Greg Gordon – ISI Group: Okay, my last question is – I know it sounds maybe like an odd question, but one of the things that you did in the restructuring of the joint venture with the put option with EDF is indemnify them against a serious nuclear accident. I know it is a tail risk, but it seems like a very large risk to be saddling your shareholders and bondholders with. Can you explain the logic there?
Christopher M. Crane: Bill you want to go ahead?
Jonathan W. Thayer: Yeah, we will get Bill to…
William A. Von Hoene: Yeah. Greg, this is Bill Von Hoene. As you know, the indemnification is for Price-Anderson exposure. Corresponding to their ownership interest in the plants, each unit in the United States has an exposure to this. There are 104 units and I think the exposed rate is about $117.5 million potential retro call for a Price-Anderson event, which is a catastrophic event, and understanding what that means, TMI was not a Price-Anderson event, Price-Anderson has ever been in both. So what you have is on a plant-by-plant basis. You have that exposure it’s limited on a per year basis to $17 million per plant. So essentially what happens here is in the event that there was a Price Anderson event which has never occurred and there was a call and the call is pro-rata in the plants and there was a call for the full amount. The maximum exposure would be about $50 million a year. So looking at that, looking at what the collective insurance arrangement is and looking at what the events are, that would be eligible for this; we do not consider this to be material to the transaction.
Greg Gordon – ISI Group: Great, thank you guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Eggers of Credit Suisse.
Daniel Eggers – Credit Suisse: Savings are your kind of the idea of eliminating inflation at ExGen, can you talk a little more…
Christopher M. Crane: Dan.
Daniel Eggers – Credit Suisse: Yeah. Can you hear me, sorry.
Christopher M. Crane: You sort of came in midstream there do you mind restarting?
Daniel Eggers – Credit Suisse: Yeah, sorry, sorry. So when you guys look at the O&M savings you are talking about at ExGen, both the cut this year and then sustain for the next couple years, could you give a little more detail on where those savings are coming from given the fact you guys are already pulling out so much money from the synergy benefits from the merger and the upsizing of that so far?
Kenneth W. Cornew: Yeah Dan its Ken, I can help with that. We are on the Constellation side continuing to look at vacant positions and attrition and sweeping them and not [fill in] them as we evolve with our transformation in our organization from the Exelon and Constellation merger. So we have been very disciplined about not hiring until we realized the full efficiency of the merger and the capabilities of the organization and you got to keep that in the context of what we are facing in the commercial markets right now. We had a plan that had retail growing at a more aggressive level, we had back that plan down as you could see in the hedge disclosure, and we backed our cost structure down accordingly. So, we also have continued opportunities on the Constellation side and while we finish our systems integration to improve processes, lower our cost on our IT systems. So, I'm very comfortable with half of that $100 million I talked coming from Constellation and even maybe some more. On the Genco side, it's really been about non-labor opportunities. Our pension cost are down with interest rates going up. Our insurance costs are a bit down and our ExGen CAGR was not very high to begin with before we rolled this extra $100 million out. We are around 0.5% already. So, we think it’s well within our capability to achieve that flat CAGR.
Daniel Eggers – Credit Suisse: Does the CENG savings get put into that number, Ken, or is that coming in somewhere else?
Christopher M. Crane: The CENG savings will be on top of this.
Daniel Eggers – Credit Suisse: So CENG savings are incremental to that number, okay.
Kenneth W. Cornew: That’s right.
Christopher M. Crane: That’s correct.
Daniel Eggers – Credit Suisse: And then I guess, Ken, just kind of on power market recovery and the $2 to $4 a megawatt hour which has kind of been the expectation for a while, heat rates did come back this quarter from where we had seen those, you have got a negative reset down. Did that mean that basically your outlook for power prices in general have also come down, because you have kept that recovery number at the same level? Or should have that recovery number expanded based on your fundamental view of where the market would have been say a quarter ago?
Kenneth W. Cornew: Dan, one thing to realize is we don’t want to be chasing as every time market prices go up and down. I would say $2 to $4 right now is conservative and our views are that there is substantial upside probably on the high end of that $2 to $4 or even more in the marketplace. We have beaten our models up, we have gotten some new models to challenge ourselves, we have challenged ourselves with some outside help and everything I see indicates that this upside should be there in the markets fundamentally when the system actually dispatches. When we are going to see it in the marketplace, we don’t know and we have to be prudent about how we manage the business accordingly, but I see, $2 to $4 being probably a conservative number right now, if you are looking at current market prices.
Daniel Eggers – Credit Suisse: Okay, I just – for the overlay just for context, how much demand growth do you guys assume you see in your territories on a long run basis to support that level of power price recovery?
Kenneth W. Cornew: Its under – in the PJM territory, which is what we are really talking about, with this upside Dan, it’s under 1%.
Daniel Eggers – Credit Suisse: Under 1%, okay got it.
Kenneth W. Cornew: And then we have some energy efficiency discounts on top of that.
Daniel Eggers – Credit Suisse: So, 1%, then you net back efficiency, so it’s more like 0.5% or something?
Kenneth W. Cornew: Between 0.5% and 0.75% is probably a good assumption.
Daniel Eggers – Credit Suisse: Okay, thank you guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank.
Jonathan Arnold – Deutsche Bank: Hello.
Christopher M. Crane: Hey Jonathan.
Jonathan Arnold – Deutsche Bank: Yeah I think Dan asked most of what I was just about to ask, so I’m going to keep this short. Just to clarify one thing, on the $50 million to $70 million, I apologize; I was on jumping between calls. Is that your the Exelon benefit from the shift or is that kind of a gross number in the entire JV of which your share is half?
Jonathan W. Thayer: It’s a gross number. Jonathan Arnold – Deutsche Bank Okay, so half of that is kind of what will accrue to you on top of the $100 million of other savings?
Jonathan W. Thayer: Yes.
Jonathan W. Thayer: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Julien Smith of UBS.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith – UBS: Can you hear me?
Jonathan W. Thayer: Yeah, we can hear you Julien.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith – UBS: So perhaps the first question and, again, following up on the last few here, just in terms of aggregate cost cuts, if you could kind of quantify here. Is it correct to take both the Exelon numbers and the half of the $50 million to $70 million from the CENG to get to kind of a total aggregate reduction in 2013 and beyond? And maybe the better question is, the $50 million to $70 million, when exactly do you start realizing that on a run rate basis?
Christopher M. Crane: So that is accurate to aggregate them. We will start to make the adjustments in the organization and achieve, start to achieve the savings after we receive the regulatory approval which is anticipated sometime around March 15th of next year 2014. So the restructuring to garner the savings will happen in 2014 in the long term run rate my anticipation would be 2015.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith – UBS: For the CENG portion specifically.
Christopher M. Crane: That’s correct.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith – UBS: Excellent and moving back to the power side for a quick second. You talked about FTRs and congestion, what is being done to resolve that? I mean is that something that we should expect that should turn around next year or is that a potential liability for next year as well? I mean, how have you positioned that with respect to your guidance and from a regulatory perspective as well?
Christopher M. Crane: So, Julien we have seen a run rate over history of receiving around 90% of our allocated ARR and FTR value. So this year that’s come down about 20% on us. It’s due somewhat to the allocation process and how PJM models the system and allocates ARRs in initial stages of that process. It’s also due to what I would call less than optimal seams, issues and dispatch, between MISO and PJM that are causing congestion issues at the seams and you get substantial congestion issues in the market, PJM can’t collect enough revenue on congestion to payback the ARR and FTR holders. So, it is a relatively new challenge for us. What we see is working with PJM and MISO to improve the seams issues as one of the first and foremost things we can do. We also see as the transmission system itself gets upgraded and starts to handle the capability of new supply. That will help the situation as well, but prudently we have to plan for lower collection until we see those changes occur.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith – UBS: So you would say that is baked into the 2014 and 2015 expectations at this point?
Christopher M. Crane: Yes.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith – UBS: Okay, all right, great. And then with regards to PJM policy overall, just kind of lastly here, obviously a lot of focus on transmission imports. Is the goal at PJM really to kind of tackle transmission and sort of how that’s done? Or is it more to tackle buying back and sort of that whole element of arbitrage, if you will?
Joseph Dominguez: Julien, this is Joe Dominguez. I think it’s probably more the latter, I think eliminate the incentive to arbitrage between the base residual option and the incremental options direction to stakeholder group is working at. I think we’re also looking at some of the deficiency penalties that determine whether there is sufficient pipelines credit and look at the milestones that need to be accomplished for all planned resources. PJM and IMM may have some other proposals that will come into this. They've started talking about that they may go into direction limiting imports but it’s early to tell.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith – UBS: All right. Great, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ali of SunTrust.
Christopher M. Crane:  Good morning Ali 
Ali Agha – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Can you hear me?
Christopher M. Crane: Yeah we can hear you.
Ali Agha – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: First, I just wanted to clarify – I know when you were talking about the cost savings it seemed to me that some of the savings for 2013 may be more 2013 specific – lower depreciation and what have you. But just to be clear, as I look forward should we assume that relative to the margin erosion that you’re seeing in 2014 and 2015 on the latest forward curve, that about $140 million or so of that is being offset from cost savings? Or how should we think about that on the 2014, 2015 outlook if I’m hearing you right?
Christopher M. Crane: It’s the complete long run cost savings that we talked about should be achieved by the first of 2015, which includes the CENG cost savings along with the Genco cost savings. If you want to talk about trajectory…
Kenneth W. Cornew: The $100 million Ali will be in 2013, 2014 and 2015, so achievable now and held for that period.
Ali Agha – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Got it. Understood. Then secondly, Chris to you, again, hitting you guys, I mean the $2 to $4 uplift, you've talked about that versus fundamentals, versus market, let's say that does not materialize, hasn't materialized today. Should we assume Exelon will continue to focus on cost, perhaps a Hunker Down strategy, wait for that to happen or I mean, strategically, do you step back and say, maybe there is something else that I need to do. Maybe my portfolio mix is not right, and the market is just not there. How should we be tracking that from your perspective?
Christopher M. Crane: Sure, on one side, we will continue to aggressively focus on the safety and reliability on our utilities side, which allows us to continue the opportunity to make significant investments over the planning period. So, you can see a real focus on the utilities over the next five years putting $13 billion to work and continuing to grow the rate base at 5% to 6%. On the generating side we are definitely within the 2013, 2014 year timeframe in a hunker down mode, watch all expenses, maintain the assets which we think we have a competitive advantage on our asset mix and watch for the market to come back and we think as all of you were the best leverage for a market recovery. On an annual basis, we always go back in the fall and say what if we get it wrong. What are our paths forward, what's our strategic planning we'll do that again this year, like we do every other year, we'll look at our fundamental modeling, we'll look at external sources of fundamental modeling and we'll look at alternatives, but right now we feel that what we've talked about on a market recovery should happen within the timeframe on the power side. Even with the disappointment of the capacity market on the 16 and 17 side. We see that power upside coming back. On the capacity side, like we said it’s disappointing but not devastating. But that’s one data point, we'll have to continue to work in the stakeholder process to fix this issue and look for any others but if we continue to see issues with the capacity market, it would be prudent for us to go back and make sure that we’re looking at the strategic mix in how we’re structured. We believe in it, we believe in the competitive market. We are wed to it, but we will always continue to reevaluate it.
Ali Agha – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: A last question are you still comfortable also with the dividend, the new dividend level even if that $2 to $4 is not materializing?
Christopher M. Crane: Yeah, definitely, if you go back to some of our earlier calls on this and Jack has reiterated that the dividend is essentially sized for the regulatory business to handle with the 65% to 70% dividend up to the HoldCo. So, we could maintain what we think is a very competitive dividend within Exelon or paying to the Exelon shareholders while we’re able to use the balance sheet of the competitive business to grow and see that those dollars and free cash flow back into the competitive business.
Ali Agha – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Paul Fremont of Jefferies.
Christopher M. Crane: Hey Paul.
Paul Fremont – Jefferies & Company: A couple of clarifying questions, when you talk about the 0% compound annual growth in O&M through 2015, I assume that does include the CENG savings that you’ve identified or is CENG incremental to that?
Christopher M. Crane: No, No Paul, it’s incremental to that.
Paul Fremont – Jefferies & Company: It is incremental okay, second clarifying question is I think you affirm the 2% to 4% guidance for retail supply margin, but you talked about margin pressure on the wholesale side, previously I think you provided a range of a $1.50 to $3 per megawatt hour on wholesale. What would that number has that number been revised?
Christopher M. Crane: We hadn’t revised the wholesale number Paul; I did reaffirm in my comments the $2 to $4 on the retail side albeit we’re expecting to be in the low end of that range. On the wholesale side as you can see in the volume chart, we provided you that we’re reducing the percentage of wholesale load that’s in our projections relative to retail. So we’re still seeing that $1.50 to $3 opportunity albeit the volumes are little lower than we expected.
Paul Fremont – Jefferies & Company: Okay. So but the margin – we should assume similar margins than as what you provided in the past?
Jonathan W. Thayer: Yes lower end of the range on the retail side right now though is what you should assume?
Paul Fremont – Jefferies & Company: Okay. And then in terms of the $50 million reduction, that you're looking to achieve at Constellation, is that linked to the lower volumes or is that – or should we assume that, that represents a reduction in the fixed cost in the business?
Christopher M. Crane: It's some of both Paul. The first, we did have a plan that had us growing our retail business, which meant growing in on the labor side and to the extent we're not growing, we can maintain current labor position, that is a reduction of our plan. We have also been very disciplined while we are integrating the Exelon and Constellation commercial platforms and we continue to do that on the IT side, while we're doing that we've been very disciplined about not finalizing our design and hiring open positions in the business until we get our efficiencies, our systems and our processes all where we want them to be. So, again, I'm very comfortable that Constellation can achieve that cost channel.
Paul Fremont – Jefferies & Company: So, with both, is it more skewed towards variable or evenly skewed?
Christopher M. Crane: I would say it's more skewed towards fixed and to the extent there is some variable because of our situation and our lack of growth in that business, there is some benefit there as well.
Paul Fremont – Jefferies & Company: And then, with respect to EDF, are you basically obligated under that put option to buy them out and who basically ends up doing the market assessment in that calculation.
William A. Von Hoene:  This is Bill Von Hoene. The put option obligates us to buy them out under a process that protects us we believe very carefully protects us in terms of having an accurate market value. Essentially the process calls for each side to designate an investment bank that's embedded to determine the fair market value and that is the fair market value of the EDF share. So, if this happens before we repay the dividend or repay the loan, that's net of that. They then try to agree on a price, if they're unable to agree on a price, there is a third party that is designated by the two investment banks and that party would determine a price and it would be baseball arbitration type of arrangement. There is also, built into it, flexibility to accommodate other business needs that we may have during the period of time, it might be called.
Ravi Ganti:  We will take one last question now. Go ahead. 
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Neil Mehta.
Christopher M. Crane: Hi Neil.
Michael Lapides – Goldman Sachs: Lapides from Goldman here. Real quick. Actually, two separate ones. One, gas generation, we're seeing lots of new build announcements in PJM these days, just curious if you think they're economic or not and are you worried about a wave of new combined cycles coming into PJM especially with gas basis and the Marcellus now upside down a little bit? Second one is can you give an update on the MATS litigation that is outstanding, I don’t know if a lot of folks are following this, but that case is actually sitting at the DC Circuit waiting on judges to be assigned and just curious your views about the risk around that litigation?
Christopher M. Crane: Let me cover the new build, first. We made lots of announcements, I don’t know if I would agree with there have been announcements on some CCJTs in PJM. Your earlier announcements were subsidized they had to be subsidized based off of the economics. I think they’ve all had their struggles to some extent on being built. There is others that are going to build that risk, I think it's less than a handful that I can point to right now, they’re doing that. We continue to evaluate their economics even with the stated cost per kilowatt number of $60 megawatt day clearing price does not cover the economics for us. So, at some of the latter – some of the newer announcements saying they could build for under 500 a KW, we don’t think it's includes owner’s cost, it’s not with an EPC agreed upon and the economics, we can't get the economics even on a Brownfield site just to get there. So, we continue to watch that and we’ll keep our eyes on it. But from the way, we’re modeling it, we don’t see it work. Now they could be first movers anticipating something in the fundamental models that we don’t see like a more significant growth rate greater or low growth rate, greater reduction on installed capacity. Some kind of new behavior on bidding on RPM but from our modeling we don’t see it. Second part I'll ask Daryl Bradford to discuss on the MATS?
Darryl Bradford: As you suggest the MATS litigation is fully briefed. It’s waiting for oral argument in the DC Circuit. We expect that to be scheduled sometime in the fall and while there is always risk in litigation. We carefully reviewed all the briefs and arguments and we think that the EPAs argument is very sound and court should sustain it. We'll get better read on what the court's reaction is to those arguments when oral arguments are held. But we do think the EPA rule should be upheld by the DC circuit.
Michael Lapides – Goldman Sachs:  Got it. Thank you guys. Much appreciate it. 
Ravi Ganti: Okay, operator that should conclude the call.
Operator: Thank you ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines.

Operator:  Good morning. My name is Brit and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Exelon Corporation’s First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you, Mr. Ganti you may begin your conference.
Ravi Ganti: Thank you, Brit, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Exelon’s first quarter 2013 earnings conference call. Thank you for joining us today. We issued our earnings release this morning. If you haven’t received it, the release is available on Exelon’s website. The earnings release and other matters we will discuss in today’s call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties as well as adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings. Please refer to today’s 8-K and Exelon’s other filings for a discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from management’s projections, forecasts, and expectations, and for a reconciliation of operating to GAAP earnings. Leading the call today are Chris Crane, Exelon’s President and CEO; and Jack Thayer, Exelon’s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. They’re joined by other members of Exelon’s executive management team who will be available to answer your questions. We have currently scheduled 60 minutes for this call. I will now turn the call over to Chris Crane, Exelon’s CEO.
Christopher M. Crane: Thanks Ravi and good morning to everybody and thank you for joining us. We had a very successful first quarter; we delivered on our financial expectations while having great quarter from an operational perspective. We had to make a hard decision, critical choice to resize our dividend within the quarter and if we struck the right balance between a strong balance sheet and returning value to the shareholder. It was the right decision to pursue our goal of long-term value return. And since January, the stock performance is indicative of the removal of the dividend uncertainty overhang, the beginning of the market recovery and in general a bullish view on natural gas. From a financial perspective, the first quarter operating earnings as announced this morning was $0.70 per share. It’s the top of our guidance range that we had previously given of $0.60 to $0.70 per share. Jack is going to provide more detail in his comments on the drivers around that. Our second quarter guidance that we are providing is a range of $0.50 to $0.60 per share for operating earnings which allows us to reaffirm our year guidance of $2.35 to $2.65 per share. Operations remained strong while the full-year gross margin expectation at Constellation is marginally lower as you will see in a hedge disclosure. It’s in line with our expectations, and Jack and Ken will provide more color during the call on the aspects of that. At present, we see no reason to depart from our full-year range. Focusing on operational updates, the fleet operated at an excellent level in the quarter. The nuclear fleet capacity factor was $96.4 compared with $93.6 for the same quarter last year. Nuclear set first quarter fleet record for generation at ownership bringing our 2007 by some 575 gigawatt-hours, that’s the fourth best quarter in the history of Exelon from a capacity factor standpoint. Our fossil and renewable fleet had a strong quarter as well, with the fossil availability of 98.4% in solar and wind energy capture rate at 94.9%. BGE throughout the quarter had a very constructive rate case and Jack is going to provide some more details on that. Switching to Illinois, SB 9 Illinois excuse me, we hope will be enacted this year. We are on a good path there, we have a had it passed with, we have good majority in the Senate and the House; we are waiting on the Governor to act. Once enacted on, we can start executing our plan of grid modernization included in the installation of the smart meters and improving the reliability of the infrastructure. Focusing on the market update, the power prices have improved since the beginning of the year as we’ve all seen. We continue to monitor markets closely to form our hedging strategy, we do believe as we previously said, there is more upside remaining in the older years. Gas prices have picked up in the near term, while holding a flat trajectory in the out years. However, there is more support for a bullish view towards gas in the forwards. The fundamental points to our existing view of the $4 to $6 an MMBtu for natural gas in the $15 to $16 range, we are constantly favoring the hedge program to these views. And Ken will be available to answer more questions in that area on the call. As we focused our look towards the balance of the year, our highest priority is maintaining our focus on safety, operations and financial discipline. Delivering on the financial results we promised will help us realize the synergy targets for the successful merger. We are on track right now to complete the $550 million run rate on synergies by the end of 2015. Looking at the growth project update, we continue to make progress on our projects that we previously announced. We successfully installed 69 megawatts of solar as part of our AVSR in the first quarter and expect to build-out another 132 megawatts in the balance of the year. The Smart Meter installation in two of the three utilities continues; BGE installed a 127,000 meter so far and have 150,000 are expected by year-end. At PECO, we’ve installed a 158,000 during the first quarter with another 160,000 expected by mid-June and the ComEd installation schedule is predicted based on House Bill 9 approval as I previously mentioned. So overall very solid quarter continuing to deliver on the promises. And now I’ll turn the call over to Jack to provide more details on the financial update.
Jonathan W. Thayer: Thank you, Chris, and good morning everyone. I’ll now review the first quarter financial results, our second quarter guidance range, the updates to our hedge disclosures and discuss our balance sheet and cash flow outlook. I’ll start with our financial results on Slide 4. Operating earnings for the first quarter of this year were $0.70 per share at the top-end of our first quarter guidance range of $0.60 to $0.70 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.85 per share that we reported during the first quarter of 2012. The key drivers of the reduction in earnings quarter-over-quarter were merger related share count differential and lower ExGen gross margin, primarily related to a combination of lower realized prices and lower capacity revenues. These impacts were partially offset by favorable weather of utilities and the addition of fourth quarter of earnings from legacy Constellation businesses. We delivered earnings at the top end of our first quarter guidance range through a number of smaller positive variances that include our nuclear fleet achieving a 96.4% capacity factor and favorable interest on tax related items. We also benefitted from approximately $0.04 per share of favorable O&M timing variance, primarily related to projects and outage timing. We expect this timing benefit to reverse over the remainder of 2013. Portfolio management results were unfavorable plan for the quarter, specifically we sold our access link early in the quarter did advance of an expected decline in prices due to moderate weather. Prices subsequently increased and are generating, we do not participate in this upward movement. Our updated hedging disclosure reflects this first quarter weakness. Importantly, while our near-term headwind; this shift in pricing is a long-term benefit due to the high ratables hedging strategy we pursued for 2014 and beyond. Starting with second quarter results, we will be able to update you on year-over-year progress for BGE and ExGen in a more comparable view similar to the sliding appendix detailing ComEd and PECO’s quarter-over-quarter drivers. As you saw from our earnings release, our GAAP earnings for the first quarter are a loss $0.01 per share, which is steadily $0.01 lower than our non-GAAP results but in line with our expectations. These items accounted for this variance. As you are recall during the first quarter, we disclosed that we will be taking a one-time non-cash charge of approximately $265 million or $0.31 per share in connection with our reevaluation of a lifetime exchange position from our ComEd asset sales in 1999. The remaining two items are the amortization of commodity contract intangibles related to the merger and changes in the mark to market of our hedges in the first quarter. The market to market impact of a loss of $0.27 per share is expected given the increase in commodity prices during the first quarter. For the second quarter, we are providing guidance of $0.50 to $0.60 per share. This compares to our realized earnings of $0.61 per share during the same period last year. The main driver for this decline are similar to first quarter explanations with power prices and capacity prices down from 2012 and includes the offset of improved rates at ComEd and BGE. I want to remind you that in the second quarter of 2012, we recorded a write down of regulatory asset at ComEd based on the ICC order in May of 2012. This was partially reversed in the fourth quarter of 2012 after the October rehearing. For the full year 2013, we are reaffirming our guidance range of $2.35 to $2.65 per share. Now I’ll provide the gross margin update for Exelon Generation. Slide 5 provides the first quarter hedge disclosure compared to the data as of December 31, 2012. As you can see, forward power prices increased in nearly all regions, in particular West Hub and Ni-Hub increased by $2 per megawatt hour or more across all of the years. This increase reflects two key factors, rising natural gas prices and expansion of heat rates in these regions. Importantly, we believe that the markets are beginning to reflect some of the $3 to $6 per megawatt hour, a fundamental upside that we have discussed previously. As for the end of the first quarter, we believe the upside is closer to $2 to $4 per megawatt hour. We still see a disconnect in lower heat rates compared to what a fundamental forecast would indicate given current natural gas prices, expected retirements and load assumptions. Importantly, ours is not the only voice highlighting the supply/demand imbalance. We believe we are beginning to see the share being materialized due to several factors. The spot market saw increased weather driven volatility during the first quarter and it seems to be a moderately more bullish sentiment across the industry around the natural gas and power markets. The increase in power prices drove increased open gross margin of approximately $350 million to $450 million per year. Factoring in the mark to market of existing hedges which decreased as prices mute higher, new hedging activity and changes to our targets we see a cumulative increase of approximately $350 million across the three years in hedged gross margin. You will notice that the Power New Business / To Go bucket shows a reduction across the years. It reflects the hedging activity that took place during this quarter for 2014 and 2015. In 2013, there is a $50 million reduction and expected portfolio management gross margin contributions for the reasons I discussed on Slide 4. Financing activity in the products we choose to hedge reflect our belief that the prices will move even higher. We are approximately 3% behind ratable in 2014 and approximately 6% behind ratable in 2015. We continue to utilize natural gas sales and options in our hedging strategy to retain upside exposure to higher power prices and expanding heat rates while protecting against downside gas movements. On Slide 6, we provide a review of our load expectations for the utilities. Overall, we see continued slow growth. In 2013, ComEd expects total load to be similar to 2012 results with only a small decline of 0.1% on a weather normal basis. This is in line with projections of moderate economic growth offset by growing energy efficiency. PECO expects overall growth of 25% which is 1% better than we believe at the time of our year-end call. This reflects economic growth in the region and an overall employment growth outlook. BGE expects overall declines and low driven primarily by the bankruptcy of one of its largest industrial customers RG Steel. Excluding this bankruptcy, 2013 load for BGE would have seen growth of 0.4% over 2012 levels driven by customer growth and economy and offset by conservation programs. Slide 7 provides an update of our cash flow expectations for this year. We still project strong cash from operations of $5.8 billion; this estimate is down slightly about $125 million from our original projections. Primary drivers decline include lower net income at excellent generation related to the previously mentioned revisions for our full-year portfolio management targets and timing of tax cash payments. We anticipate lower capital spend this year and part due to the cancellation of the Dresden and Quad Cities MUR projects. On March 25 PECO announced that it will be utilizing its excess cash to redeem its preferred stock. The redemption date is today and the total stated value of preferred stock to be redeemed is $87 million. As discussed previously, we also plan to call the $450 million of constellation junior subordinated hybrid debt this quarter with a coupon of [8.58%]. Additionally, you can see that we expect to end the year with $1.35 billion of cash across the company, the majority of which will be in held at ExGen given the size of that balance, we are reviewing the need to refinance $500 million of debt that is maturing in January of 2014. These actions were part of our plan to strengthen the balance sheet and maintain strong credit metrics as we mentioned during the year-end earnings call. Most importantly, all of our ratings and outlooks are now stable. In an effort to clarify some of the metrics, the rating agencies watch, we’ve included a slide in the appendix showing the calculation of those metrics. In closing on Slide 8, we look ahead to significant events for the remainder of the year. On May 24, the 2016/2017 RPM Auction Results will be published. Results will largely depend on how much new generation bids in whether from new construction or through transmission access. We expect a resolution of SB 9 in Illinois by the end of the second quarter, which if passed will increase operating revenues approximately $25 million and $65 million in 2013 and 2014 respectively. Additionally, under SB 9 we will increase capital expenditures by approximately $35 million and $45 million in 2013 and 2014 respectively. We also recently filed our ComEd rate case, which ask for an increase of $311 million. This reflects actual 2012 expenses and investments and forecasted 2013 capital additions to our distribution network. The new rates are expected to take effect on January 01, 2014 after the ICCs review. This filing does not reflect the SB 9 legislation, which if it becomes effective would require us to update our filing. We expect to file our next BGE rate case by the end of the second quarter. We’re optimistic that we can build upon the constructive outcome from the last rate case. We received approximately 62% of our request for electric rate increase and 71% of our request for gas rate increase. As a reminder, the appendix includes several schedules that will aide in your modeling efforts. And that concludes my comments. Now I’ll turn the call back over to Chris before we open the lines for Q&A.
Christopher M. Crane: Thanks, Jack. In conclusion, I want to reiterate a few things that you heard us say previously. We will continue down the path that we laid out on our February 7 call, which continues on with our primary goal remains strengthening the balance sheet, focusing on operations and looking for ways to improve operational efficiencies. We’ll continue to look for opportunities to grow the company, making opportunistic investments using our balance sheet strength were applicable and ensuring that actions will be accretive to the company, the company’s financial step. With that, we’ll open it up to questions.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon from ISI Group.
Christopher M. Crane:  Hi Greg.
Greg Gordon – ISI Group: So, this is the, I think this is good quarter by the way and we’re happy to see that pricing is starting to cooperate with your thesis, few questions on those fronts, and on cash flow. So the power of new business to go versus the mark-to-market has just opening gross margin. Is it fair to presume that you’ve lowered again your expectations for margins and or volumes given that out in 2013, 2014, and 2015, just given the persistently low level of pricing and low level of volatility as it relates to competitive energy supply?
Christopher M. Crane:  Yeah, Ken will address that and we will circle back if you have a cash flow question.
Kenneth W. Cornew: So Greg, that’s not the case. It’s actually in 2013 we have reduced our target expectation for Power New Business / To Go essentially because we got defensive on natural gas prices early in the quarter and hedged the portfolio tightly and missed an opportunity to gain some upside from spot prices in the first quarter. In 2014 and 2015, it’s actually a very different story. We have actually achieved new business targets as or better than expected in those years and when we do achieve those targets what we do is, we reduce the Power New Business / To Go line and it rolls into the mark to market of hedges. So our hedging position that we’ve had on that associated we are taking advantage of upside in the power markets is benefiting us on those two years.
Greg Gordon – ISI Group: Okay, great.
Jonathan W. Thayer: Follow-up on free cash?
Greg Gordon – ISI Group: Yes. When I look at Page 18, where you show the build out to your consolidated cash flow outlook, there is a lot of what I would relatively small changes but the two big ones are $225 million reduction in expected CFO from ExGen, but then also a $325 million decline in expected other cash flows. Can you dig a little bit deeper into those two items?
Jonathan W. Thayer: Sure. So as we discussed previously, some puts and takes as you point out, so from a cash from operations roughly $125 million decline relative to the expectations primarily related to ExGen and tax timing, offset on the CapEx side by the cancellation of Dresden and Quad Cities MUR. The primary driver of the change in cash relative to the beginning of your forecast is lower financing of ComEd, a $175 million and BGE of $52.
Greg Gordon – ISI Group:  I just want to understand why you know when course of this for the last several months, since you just gave us your fiscal year outlook recently. There has been such a dramatic change in the expected CFO from ExGen. Is it related to the hedging activity in the quarter that – in the first quarter that went against you on gas or is it sort of something else?
Christopher M. Crane:  The breakdown in the ExGen is roughly $250 million total change at ExGen’s specifically roughly a third of that is cash tax timing, offset by about $150 million of cash related net income. On the positive reduction CapEx, which I described related to the MURs and then the increase in the dividend on the financing line, so that is $250 million.
Greg Gordon – ISI Group:  Okay and then at the bottom the change in other, it was a $400 million held at the year-end call and it’s now only $75 million.
Christopher M. Crane:  It’s CP.
Greg Gordon – ISI Group:  Okay thank you.
Operator:  And your next question comes from the line of Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse.
Daniel Eggers – Credit Suisse:  Ken, just looking at the move up in power prices and the strength, you said that you guys hedged more aggressively early in the quarter and last later. Is there any relationship between the factors you guys, you’ve had some liquidity pressure out of the marketplace selling of that had an effect on power prices or did I misunderstand your first comments?
Kenneth W. Cornew:  Really when I was referred to hedging and it was associated with our 2013 decision. So we took a low 90% hedge position and took it to a high 90% hedge position in 2013 alone. We just – we got defensive on natural gas looking at early winter weather and obviously what’s happened over the last five years, as indicated the risk of natural gas prices falling didn’t happen, so we readjusted our portfolio in 2013. In 2014 and 2015, our hedging posture has been consistent with what we’ve talked about for many quarters now. We’ve held our position of going behind ratable as Jack indicated by about 6% in 2015, we’ve also held our position of utilizing natural gas and option to keep heat upside that’s another probably 8% in that 2015 portfolio. So we are maintaining a substantial upside position...
Daniel Eggers – Credit Suisse: (inaudible)
Christopher M. Crane: Yeah, so from a heat rate perspective, we are more like 14% to 15%.
Daniel Eggers – Credit Suisse: Okay. Can you just give a little color on what you guys are seeing in the retail markets as far as the competitiveness of that? Is that landscape changing all with movement in prices and generally in the past with new energy when prices rose, you saw more margin pressure in the business. Is that showing up Exelon didn’t look like it showed up in the hedging disclosure you guys gave for Non-Power New Business / To Go?
Christopher M. Crane: Dan, we’ve seen the same behavior in the retail market essentially over the past several quarters of margins being on the low end of expected ranges or experienced ranges. What’s interesting and maybe a little bit different about the first quarter this year is that customers are actually causing to decide to re-contract and buy power because for the first time in a long time prices have not dropped going through a winter and I believe a lot of customers are thinking that prices were going to go in a lower direction and it would be a great opportunity for them to lock in fixed price over the next couple of years. Prices have actually gone up. And now you see a little bit of pausing from especially commercial industrial contracting perspective. So very challenging and competitive environment remains, we’ve maintained our expectations in the disclosure for this quarter and we’ll continue to see how this shapes out.
Daniel Eggers – Credit Suisse: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.
Jonathan Arnold – Deutsche Bank: Good morning, guys.
Christopher M. Crane: Good morning, Jon.
Jonathan Arnold – Deutsche Bank: Excuse the background noise, sorry about that. Staying on hedging, I just want to make sure I understand the terminology correctly. When you say you’re 6% behind ratable, does that mean 6 percentage points lower than you would otherwise be or is it a percentage?
Jonathan W. Thayer: Its 6 percentage points lower than we’d otherwise be.
Jonathan Arnold – Deutsche Bank: Okay, thank you. And then on – is it reasonable to assume that you’re 3% (inaudible) as you are looking at 16% which is obviously not on the slide you have, but you would be incrementally behind?
Christopher M. Crane: Yes, Jonathan, we will build a similar strategy and similar position in 16% as we have in 15% that’s where we are right now.
Jonathan Arnold – Deutsche Bank: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Hugh Wynne with Sanford Bernstein.
Hugh Wynne – Sanford Bernstein: My questions go to the assumptions underlying the expectation of continued $2 to $4 upside in the round the clock PJM price post 2015. First on load growth, I wonder if you could tell me what your outlook is, I noticed that ComEd, PECO and BGE you have this large decline in load in ‘12 and you are not expecting much of the recovery if any in ‘13, what is your forecast for load growth across PJM in ‘14, ‘15?
Christopher M. Crane: Hugh, it is well under 1% at this point in our modeling. So we are not anticipating anything substantial or helpful on the load growth side when we are talking about our upside in power prices. It really is wholly driven by every time of the total asset.
Hugh Wynne – Sanford Bernstein:  Great. And then what is your expectation for I guess I would call share loss of load to increased renewable generation. To what extent do you think load and PJM will be incrementally supplied by renewable generation and what impact do you think that has on prices?
Christopher M. Crane: Hope I understand your question correctly, how much renewable generation do you think – are you asking that we have in our models?
Hugh Wynne – Sanford Bernstein:  Yeah.
Christopher M. Crane: We obviously have seen the build out of wind generation at the end of 2012 and with the PTC extension continue to anticipate significant wind development going forward in the next few years. So again that is another incremental generation add to our models. And quite frankly, it’s a conservative assumption of incremental additional win at significant levels and we still see the upside because of overtime. 
Hugh Wynne – Sanford Bernstein:  Okay. And then final question on steam electric F1 guidelines have been published in their proposed form. Have you altered in any way your expectation of plant retirements and what is your expectation currently?
Christopher M. Crane: Our expectation of planned retirements is relatively consistent, here we have a little over 20,000 megawatts of expected retirement PJM, 47,000 in the entire piece of interconnect, and those assumptions had us move very much for us in the past few months.
Hugh Wynne – Sanford Bernstein:  Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Steven Fleishman of Wolfe Research.
Steven Fleishman – Wolfe Research, LLC: Yeah. Hi, good morning. Just a question on the process on growth investments. Could you maybe give a little color kind of most likely areas that you would be looking at for growth investments and thoughts on, let’s say you could signed $500 million investment, would you likely need to finance it. Have that have stock at this point or could you, things of all that or do you really need to keep bring down that in the next couple of years before you could do that. Maybe just a little color on kind on where you’re on financing?
Christopher M. Crane: So, as far as the growth strategy and where we’re focusing, we have significant area within the utilities continuing to build-out on the modernization, the Smart Meter installation and reinforcing the reliability of this system and we continue to make those significant investments. If you go to the other side of the business, although we continue to look at mostly contracted type assets at this point and we’ll continue on with some wind development and also the development in the solar area. There is about $2 billion to $3 billion of growth in the next five years that’s within the plan right now. And none of that requires equity issuance it is within our cash flow on the current balance sheet. In this forward year, we are not refinancing, or slowing the refinancing and or using cash to cover our capital obligations to strengthen the balance sheet. If something came along that was large enough, that we thought was the right strategic step, but more importantly met the right financial hurdles, that evaluation would take into consideration if equity was required to cover the dilutive effect of the equity. And we don’t see anything around that right now, but that would be the hurdle that would have to be overcome before we would go there.
Jonathan W. Thayer:  I think Chris I’m sorry, we have got the space in the balance sheet (inaudible) after that, we looked at the balance sheet and drove our margin. 
Steven Fleishman – Wolfe Research, LLC: Just to clarify the $2 billion to $3 billion is that – are those growth investments that are already in the CapEx plan, are those, would that include potentially new things that haven’t been identified yet?
Jonathan W. Thayer:  There is cost in that for new things that have not been identified yet.
Steven Fleishman – Wolfe Research, LLC: Okay. And is there a way to get a sense of how much are those versus kind of core the spending already in Illinois and things like that?
Jonathan W. Thayer:  The $2 billion, to $3 billion Steven is actually on the balance sheet for projects that have not been identified, that are not included in our long range plan, that would be incremental and they would be in the areas as Chris described.
Christopher M. Crane: I think what we can do is follow back up with you and show you what’s broken down right now on the regulated side for CapEx. And what we know is in the pipeline on the generation side and then the balance sheet space above that for the plugs that we have for additional growth. We will pull that together.
Steven Fleishman – Wolfe Research, LLC: Okay. Thanks very much.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin from UBS.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith – UBS: Hi, can you hear me?
Jonathan W. Thayer:  Yeah.
Christopher M. Crane:  Yeah.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith – UBS: Excellent. So first question here obviously has two sides to it, as you look at the 2 to 4, how much is attributable to changes in demand responsible? Obviously they can now set prices that seems pretty material. And then secondly on the other half, how you’re thinking about changes in the added submission compliance in Illinois and the delay from 15 to 17 and how does that work into your math both with regards to moving from 3 to 6 and in the remaining 2 to 4 that remains out there if you will?
Jonathan W. Thayer: Julien, focusing on the 2 to 4 question first, we don’t have any modeling of increased volatility associated with scarcity pricing context and as you said demand response energy bidding in setting price. This analysis is strictly about the generation stack in coal retirements and that kind of upside is incremental to the 2 to 4. So that’s the first question. The second question was about our assumptions of coal retirement. So we have taken into account the best available knowledge we have in the market about every coal plant. We did not estimate that all the coal plants you’re referring to are going to be retired anyway. We run our models and don’t see really any incremental change in our estimates from that information.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith – UBS: And just clarifying question there. Clearly thrown as an incremental cost of dispatch is somewhat relevant to this conversation. How much of that element given now that they have a delay for two years have to play against your 2 to 4 or plays into your 2 to 4 today?
Christopher M. Crane: Little as none Julien. 
Julien Dumoulin-Smith – UBS:  Great, thank you very much for the clarification. 
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.
Stephen Byrd – Morgan Stanley:  Just one follow-up, Jack, you mentioned given the cash position that you had, that you continue to assess coming to that refinancing and you’ve just sort of thinking through your options, wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about that as you look at your cash balance over time and you look at the upcoming debt retirements, just wasn’t completely clear step, how to interpret the comments as you think about your options on the upcoming debt that’s coming due? 
Jonathan W. Thayer: So Steven, you can see that in this year, we are using the $450 million to retire the 8.625 senior subordinated debt which is obviously a very accretive transaction given the current interest rate environment. We have roughly $615 million coming due at ExGen in 2014 and that $550 million at ExGen and another $800 million at OpCo that matures in 2015. And part of the opportunity given the cash balance we have is to look at those maturities and determine whether it is appropriate. Given the other strategic calls on the cash that we look at that and balance that against calling those bonds as they mature and not refinancing them. Clearly if we do, do that then we have substantial room in the balance sheet for the types of strategic investments that Chris discussed earlier and that really goes into forming up that $3 billion of incremental capacity for the growth investment.
Stephen Byrd – Morgan Stanley:  Okay thank you and then more I think for Ken just following a little bit up on Julien’s question on demand response, less on the energy side maybe little more in the capacity side, just curious to your take on the recent decision from FERC about basically delaying the PJM demand response, protocol changes and just generally curious as to your take on where is demand responses headed, have you seen, your more or less activity. What is your sense for the wins change on demand response and how that’s impacting the other markets?
Joseph Dominguez:  This is Joe Dominguez. Let me talk first about the FERC ruling, we see that as a process ruling essentially what FERC was saying is that the PJM did not go through the appropriate process to make the kind of changes that we require to implement the modifications that it has proposed. We saw some put for those proposals and some of the FERC Commissioners, order is there but it was really a process decision that doesn’t indicate a substantive view of the issue by FERC.
Christopher M. Crane: And Steven just on the demand response claims itself. The demand response business continues to be consistent and significant. Obviously, we don’t expect to see the kind of growth we saw all over the past few years in demand response phase but there, in all our estimation there is still opportunity for growth in demand response business and we will see really how much clear is this. 
Stephen Byrd – Morgan Stanley: Excellent thank you very much.
Operator:  And your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs.
Michael Lapides – Goldman Sachs: Two questions, one on the regulated business and one on the non-reg. On ComEd just curious given the new legislation and assume that it becomes law either the Governor signs that or it becomes law with a veto override. Do you think that gives you the ability finally to earn your authorized on a forward test year forward rate base at ComEd? That’s the question on the regulated side. On the non-regulated side, we’re seeing lots of development announcements or movement in PJM for new combined cycles. Not tons, but there is one or two companies privately held developers each looking to build a combined cycle or two or three, just curious your views on the economics of new combined cycle in PJM.
Christopher M. Crane: We’ll let Anne cover the first part.
Anne R. Pramaggiore:  Hi, Michael, this is Anne Pramaggiore. Your question on the gap between the earn to allow ROE on ComEd, the legislation closes that gap. We still have a number of items on appeal from the first formula rate case filing back in November of 2011 and that constitute a portion of it. If we win those, we close the gap even further. It will continue to be a gap left even after assuming we have positive results on those two outcomes. There are some structural items that the commission has historically does not put it up for covering. Some portion of advertising cost, there is a couple of items. So there is a piece in there that will have to deal with even after we get through the legislation and the court cases, but those two efforts will substantially close that gap.
Michael Lapides – Goldman Sachs: Got it.
Christopher M. Crane: On the non-reg part, we are seeing OEM cost or construction cost coming down mostly because the technology, the unit ratings on the assets are getting a little bit larger so, the economics are improving but we still not see the market signals or the capacity market showing us that there would be economic at this point for us to be building something. So, there maybe other opinions on market forwards that the people are turned to be the first mover on but we’re not seeing the market signals yet, it’s, we justify us going in that direction.
Michael Lapides – Goldman Sachs: That implies that some of the folks, I can pick of two privately held developers that are each looking to build at least one combined cycle if not two in Pennsylvania, do you worry that they’re kind of jumping the gun a little bit in that, even if they build, even if they think the economics are good and you guys may not agree that it weighs on it everyone?
Christopher M. Crane:  No, what we worry about is as they try to bypass the rules of the capacity market or the revisions that we think are going through the capacity market. If they’re planning up and (inaudible) costs as the rules, it’s their option. We have still the low cost from an energy side, the low cost competitor access that we can compete with them on that side. And as long as they clarify the rules on the capacity side, we have no worry about them coming in.
Michael Lapides – Goldman Sachs: Got it. Okay. Thanks guys, much appreciated.
Operator: And your next question is from the line of Ali Agha from SunTrust.
Ali Agha – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey:  First question on the non-power margin business, that outlook remains the same for 2014, and 2015. How much visibility, do you really have on that business sitting here today? What’s the best way to gage how accurate that outlook is?
Christopher M. Crane: Yeah, our outlook is consistent in the same on non-power business. A lot of that business is regular, natural gas, retail business that continues from a renewal perspective and it has been very consistent for us. We also have some other services businesses that will regularly go from To Go to execute it, but we’ve been in these businesses for many years. And so we feel comfortable with those.
Ali Agha – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Okay. And Ken again to you, once would have thought how good its been that, some of the pickup in the forward floors has actually been due to the fact that in the near term gas prices have picked up, because of the unusually cold weather and as the weather settles down some of that may be given back. Do you mind to that or what do you think of that theory?
Kenneth W. Cornew: I do buy into a theory that says spot market prices do impact forward prices, but what we’re really talking about is the relationship of natural gas to power price. And when natural gas prices are essentially flat from December 31 to March 31 and power prices went up, that doesn’t associate with that period at all. So I think we are seeing more discussion in the market about this upside, we’re not the only ones with the view anymore. And as trading activity increases or liquidity increases, we would expect we will continue to see more of this upside overtime.
Ali Agha – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Okay. And Chris, one question for you, as you look at your portfolio to date and you look at your mix, I know you’ve talked about that in the past, are you comfortable that this is the right mix of rate versus non-rate to support both your dividend and your investment grid aspirations over the longer term period or do you think there maybe some changes at Quad at some point in the future.
Christopher M. Crane: No definitely we feel that we have the right mix and we have made the right call on the dividend that allows us to maintain a strong investment grade. As we discuss the sizing of the dividend, we are looking at the contribution of the regulated side on a more repetitive or consistent basis serving that while allowing the growth side, the competitive side to continue to utilize the balance sheet space that it creates in its own earnings. So we feel very comfortable that we have got into the right spot to weather multiple business cycles. 
Ali Agha – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey:  And the volatility of earnings related to the commodity side, you are comfortable that that is the aspect of your portfolio? 
Christopher M. Crane:  Yes, we are very comfortable dealing with the volatility, we like for more volatility to come back, however we are very comfortable with the volatility there. 
Ali Agha – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Fair enough. Thank you.
Operator:  And your next question comes from the line of Travis Miller with Morningstar. 
Travis Miller – Morningstar:  A quick follow-up on the non-power gross margin, and we see that didn’t changed between December and March, how much of that is due to volume? Volumes went up and margins came down vice versa?
Christopher M. Crane:  I would say none of it due to volume. It is just a ratable non-power ratable non-power businesses that we execute on and when we execute on the numbers will move from to go tech.
Travis Miller – Morningstar:  Okay. When we look at the merger back a year ago, I think some of the synergies and you talked a lot about the retail wholesale hearing, how much have you realized of that, how much is there left to realize that and just characterize how you’re seeing that part of the merger come through?
Christopher M. Crane:  In generation space that’s part of your question, we have seen the benefits of having this combined businesses in the combined portfolio. We did see those benefits in our 2012 actual results. Obviously in 2013 you’re hearing about a hedging position we took. That I think is going to result in the same kind of numbers as we had last year from a portfolio management perspective, but we still have a lot of work to do on integrating systems and integrating the platform, and we continue to work through that this year and we do expect to see consistently improved portfolio management and other earnings elements from the business when it’s combined versus or not.
Jonathan W. Thayer:  As soon as we controlled last year, in each year it gets harder to segregate, you’re not keeping separate books anymore but as we told you at the end of last year, your portfolio management on the integrated platform was another $400 million of gross margin. And as Ken said this year, we took a combined bet on minimizing risk of gas going down in the first quarter but we will continue to see the benefit of optimization and we’ve already seen the benefits in reduced cost around liquidity as we collapsed those lines. So what we – the thesis of the merger has worked out as we projected.
Travis Miller – Morningstar: Could we see incremental upside to that 2 to 4 per megawatt hour number you’ve given up, given the synergies? Is there still enough left to go that you could see your upside?
Jonathan W. Thayer: We are holding it to 2 to 4 and we will try not to change where it could be another $0.25 here – there is upside that that’s in this market and there is in portfolio management and we’ll continue to watch that report on it. But our disclosure is that have an expectations of these synergies already in.
Travis Miller – Morningstar: Great, very helpful and thanks.
Operator: And our last question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.
Christopher M. Crane:  Hey, Paul.
Paul Patterson – Glenrock Associates: Hey, how are you doing?
Christopher M. Crane:  Doing good.
Paul Patterson – Glenrock Associates: Just really quickly, most of my questions have been answered. But just – and I apologize if I miss this. But [Brocard] looks like the hedged numbers went down and I know some of that probably has to do with the expected generation going up, but even sort of factoring for that? It appeared that – it appears that you guys have less hedge I guess is, I tried back into it? Sorry, go ahead.
Christopher M. Crane:  That’s exactly right. We had an increase in expected generation from improved spots in 2014 and 2015, quite frankly, we did not hedge that increase. So by design the hedge disclosure is going to show that our hedge percentages have dropped to have more megawatts to sales and we have not sold them. We believe there is substantial upside in our cost relative to the current market prices then we’re holding that position et cetera.
Paul Patterson – Glenrock Associates: It currently looks like actually the number might have changed. That’s actually might have reduced your position, not just on a relative basis, because of the expected generation, but because it just looks like actually perhaps the absolute number had – but you actually reduced your hedge position even if you hadn’t expected increase in generation fulfillment?
Christopher M. Crane:  No, Paul we didn’t. We didn’t.
Paul Patterson – Glenrock Associates: Okay. Okay, that’s helpful, okay.
Christopher M. Crane:  We just held our position.
Paul Patterson – Glenrock Associates: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Christopher M. Crane:  Okay. Congratulations for those who were on the call. Thank you very much for joining us.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Tracy, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Exelon Third Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. JaCee Burns. Ma'am, you may begin.
JaCee Burns: Thank you, Tracy, and good morning, everyone. I'm JaCee Burns, Vice President of Investor Relations for Exelon. Welcome to Exelon Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for joining us today. We hope that you and your families are safe and sound, particularly for those of you on the East Coast, who have been dealing with the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy. You've really been in our thoughts a great deal. We issued our earnings release this morning. If you haven't received it, the release is available on the Exelon website. The earnings release and other matters we will discuss in today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties, as well as adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings. Please refer to today's 8-K and Exelon's other filings for a discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts and expectations and for a reconciliation of operating to GAAP earnings. Leading the call today are Chris Crane, Exelon's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Thayer, Exelon Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by other members of Exelon's executive management team who will be available to answer your questions. We have scheduled 60 minutes for this call. I will now turn the call over to Chris Crane, Exelon's CEO.
Christopher M. Crane: Thank you, JaCee, and good morning to everybody. Before I discuss the Exelon third quarter results, I'd like to take a moment to recognize the more than 8,000 PECO and BGE employees, contractors, mutual assistant workers, who are working around-the-clock to respond to Hurricane Sandy. This devastating storm slammed our Pennsylvania and Maryland service territories with heavy rain, high winds and is causing historic damage. Many of you know this firsthand, being in the New Jersey and New York area. We are grateful to the dedicated men and women in the field, who are repairing the damage and restoring service to our customers as quickly and safely as possible. And that's not to mention the thousands of out-of-state contract workers, including our ComEd employees, who have made their way east to assist in the service. We have today, for those of you in New York, around 50 underground technicians arriving in New York City to assist with the recovery of the underground system there, and we'll continue to keep our folks on the East Coast as long as we can to help in all regions. I'd also like to acknowledge the employees that are for -- in Mid-Atlantic nuclear plants for effectively preparing for the hurricane. And then they worked diligently to respond to the storm, particularly Oyster Creek, which was at the point where the storm came ashore, which felt the greatest impact. Because of their dedication, we are able to resume normal operations. With that, let's turn to Slide 2. The third quarter financial performance was very strong for Exelon, particularly at ExGen. We reported operating earnings per share of $0.77, which was well above the midpoint of our guidance range for the quarter. Based on our financial performance to date, we are revising our 2012 full year earning guidance range to $2.75 to $2.95 per share. This range incorporates the preliminary cost estimates of the impact of the Hurricane Sandy in our service territories, which we have preliminarily forecasted to be around $100 million of incremental O&M expense. We're in the midst of the restoration, so that could have a plus or minus 20%. We'll be finalizing it by weekend. The merger continues to go very well. We are on track to meet our commitments to various stakeholders, including our shareholders. We expect to achieve the $170 million merger-related O&M synergies in 2012 that we announced at Analyst Day, as well as the $500 million of run rate synergies beginning in 2014. In the course of the bottoms-up construction of our long-range plan, we have also identified an incremental $50 million of O&M cost reductions, bringing the total synergies to $550 million. As we complete the integration and continue to refine our financial plans, I expect we will identify further cost reduction opportunities. We've signed a sales agreement for the mandated asset divestiture in Maryland, received FERC approval for the sale and expect to close the transaction in the fourth quarter of this year. We are benefiting from our well-matched generation and load footprint as demonstrated by our year-to-date financial performance, highlighted by the Constellation portfolio optimization success. Our integrated operations are seamless, the management team is working very well together and the merger is working. Jack will provide you with more detail about the financial performance, but first let me give you our view on the current market environment and how we assess our overall financial priorities. I'll wrap up with a discussion on the outcome of the rehearing process at ComEd and the implications of the ICC's ruling on the pace and scope of future investments. So moving to Slide 3. During the quarter, we saw considerable volatility in the power and gas markets. In August, prices declined significantly to levels lower than June 30 prices, which were the basis for our second quarter hedged disclosure. In September, power prices recovered, driven largely by rising gas prices. However, we continue to see a disconnect in heat rates and forward power prices in PJM. We recently updated our fundamental analysis, which now indicates that even after the recovery and power prices, there is roughly $3 to $6 per megawatt hour upside not being reflected in the prices. The expected upside is the result of plant retirements, higher operating cost for compliance with environmental standards and a continued disconnect between heat rates and gas prices. We forecast that approximately 42 gigawatts of capacity will be retired in the Eastern Interconnect by 2016, with over 30 gigawatts of retirement already announced. Other third parties have even higher forecast of retirements. We believe NiHub has the most heat rate upside. At the current gas prices, we expect to see greater than 1 heat rate point increase over the current market, or approximately $6 of upside in 2015 at NiHub prices. Given the lower number of retirements in the MATS portion of PJM and less of a disconnect in heat rates, we see an opportunity of approximately $3 per megawatt hour upside in the PJM West Hub prices. There are 2 primary factors can explain why we are not currently seeing this upside. First, approximately 15 gigawatts of capacity will be retired in Eastern Interconnect this year and next. As these units come offline, we expect to see an increase in prices. Second, there is a potential for an increased liquidity in 2013 forward prices for the year -- calendar year of 2015 and beyond, as load auctions take place with delivery in 2015 and customers procure power in the commercial, industrial and the Muni-Ag space. For these reasons, we think we expect the forward curves to reflect the $3 to $6 per megawatt hour upside during 2013. We continue with our traditional ratable hedging but we are executing our Bull/Bear program in this period of volatility to capture the incremental value from a heat rate recovery while ratably locking in cash flows to support the balance sheet. We have flexibility in our program to increase or decrease our hedge within a 10% band of ratable. You've seen us exercise this flexibility in the past, where we have hedged at or above ratable and locked in on incremental value. Now we have slowed our hedge activity over the last few quarters from ahead of ratable at the end of 2011 to ratable levels. At this pace, we will trim below a purely ratable program over the next few quarters, absent a power market recovery. However, we will always look to shift our strategy when we see better pricing opportunities. We are also leveraging our financial and physical products, such as selling underlying gas and utilizing gas and power options in order to preserve the ability to capture the heat rate expansion when the ultimate pricing -- the price comes back into the market. And note that, that natural gas underlying an option hedge is less than 10% of our expected generation. This portfolio optimization is a core skill for Constellation. This year we were able to capture considerable value through the portfolio management by optimizing our generation load positions. In ERCOT, large moves in the forward summer heat rates allowed us to sell our peaking generation open link as forward prices rose prior to the summer, and we continue to perform this optimization into the spot market while we manage the load variability. In PJM, we saw low falling products that better match our generation through our retail and wholesale channels, reducing basis exposure and capture incremental value for our base generation. With that backdrop on markets, I'd like now to speak about our latest forecast for retail. As we discussed our -- in updated generation hedge disclosure, flip to Slide 4. As you heard us discuss in the last month, both the retail and the wholesale markets have been impacted by aggressive competition and pricing. We maintained the same disciplined approach to valuing and pricing the risk and the full requirements load that has led to success in our portfolio optimization in the past. This approach has resulted in us not winning as many of the recent Muni-Ag RFPs in Illinois and certain other competitive procurements in other markets. Our recent experience in the competitive environment has tempered our near- to mid-term outlook for our retail business. We have adjusted our commercial load expectations as reflected in our updated Exelon generation disclosure from what we presented back at Analyst Day. At Analyst Day, we were projecting 20% growth in commercial volumes from 2011 to 2014. Reflecting the current market dynamics, we are now projecting a 9% growth in volumes from 2011 to 2015. We still expect retail to support growth in our commercial business and serve as a key channel to market. We also view the current pricing dynamic as unfortunate, but a necessary aspect of what we expect to be consolidation of retail providers. This experience also highlights the importance of the ability that we uniquely possess to utilize other channels to market to optimize our portfolio. Turning to Slide 5. We can discuss the impact of these changes on our ExGen hedge disclosure. Compared to second quarter open gross margin improved by $600 million from the 2012 to 2014, as power prices increased across the curve. We have continued to hedge and have moved the portfolio back to near ratable. In our PJM baseload regions, we are close to ratable and we have utilized discrete hedging products to preserve the opportunity to benefit from the market realization of our fundamental views that forward market heat rates will move higher. In ERCOT and NEPOOL, we are slightly behind ratable, leaving room for upside participation in what we believe will be higher spark spreads. We are fully hedged in 2012, roughly 90% hedged in 2013, approximately 60% hedged in 2014. We've introduced hedge disclosures for 2015 that we have approximately 20% of our portfolio hedged in that year. We are mostly open in 2016 and highly leveraged to the recovery in power prices as reserve margins tighten. During the quarter, we benefited from our balanced load serving and generation portfolio, which is reflected in the $100 million increase in our total gross margin for 2012. In particular, due to the hot temperatures across the country, we experienced stronger-than-forecasted wholesale and retail loads, resulting in favorable variances as the majority of our contracts are executed at higher prices. In addition, we leveraged our dispatchable fleet across the country to realize higher margins during this period. The impact of the degradation in the retail market can be seen in 2013 and 2014 through the reduction in power new business to go bucket. The decrease of $50 million in 2013 and $100 million in 2014 is a combination of both a decrease in volume expectation as well as a lower dollar per megawatt hour margin. At our June -- at our Analyst Day in June, we shared that our retail C&I margin average, $2 to $4 per megawatt hour. With the increased competition, we're now seeing those margins at the lower end of this range. As we move into the selling season in the fourth quarter of 2012 and early into 2013, we will gain more insight as to where the margins and the volumes are trending. While we're disappointed with these reduction -- reduced expectations, history has taught us that discipline is more integral to value sustainment than unfettered growth. So we'll continue to monitor the competitive environment, strive to attract and serve new customers and improve our market share, but we will be -- remain disciplined in our pricing. Before we leave this slide, I want to tie it back to our discussion about the expected upside in the power markets. In the appendix, back on Slide 19, we provided our standard gross margin sensitivities. Hitting that, in 2015, we're only 20% hedged. A $5 move per megawatt hour increase over the current forwards will result in roughly $700 million of additional gross margin. In 2016, where we're mostly open generation position, this opportunity is approximately $1 billion or roughly $0.70 of earnings per share. If our fundamental view is realized, this is a boost to earnings that is not reflected in our current valuation. Now let's talk about our financial priorities and some actions we have taken as a result of the volatility we've seen in the markets and to give ourselves some more opportunity. So turning to Slide 6. Our #1 priority is to remain investment grade across all our registrants. Our investment grade rating is fundamental to the business, given our sizable collateral requirements, our counterparty and customer relationships and our significant nuclear capital expenditure. In close proximity of importance, our next financial priority is returning value to the shareholders through our dividend. We understand the importance of the value of the dividend to our shareholders. Our third priority is to invest in growth opportunities, smartly deploy growth capital to value -- to provide value to our shareholders. In order to fulfill our top priorities and sustain certain investments, which benefit from the anticipated market recovery, we've adjusted our capital spend plans. This repositioning of capital has 3 key components. First, we're deferring the Limerick extended power upgrade by 4 years. Second, we're deferring the LaSalle EPU by another 2 years. If you remember at Analyst Day, we announced the deferral of LaSalle by an initial 2 years, and this will create a 4-year overall deferral. The licensing activities, which is the amendment to approve that power uprate, will continue to be submitted to the NRC by the end of the year. This allows the flexibility to execute the EPU projects when prices recover. Lastly, we removed the undesignated renewable spend from our financial plan. In total, we removed roughly $2.3 billion of growth capital from 2012 to 2015 capital plans at Exelon Generation since our Analyst Day disclosures, which meaningfully improves our free cash flow over the period. The deferral of these projects is a matter of better aligning our growth capital spend with the expected timing of the power market recovery. We still believe that these projects add significant value and can earn attractive IRRs. The long-term -- the long-lived nature of these assets will allow us to defer the investment and still capture returns in a more balance sheet friendly manner. On Slide 7, we'll provide the comparison of our current ExGen growth CapEx forecast to what we presented at the Analyst Day. So flipping to that -- excuse me, they gave me a long script today. So flipping to Slide 7. You can see the impacts of the deferral of Limerick and LaSalle as well as the elimination of the unidentified renewable spend. We're moving forward with the EPU at Peach Bottom as planned. The additional 130 megawatts from this upgrate are expected to come online and generate returns beginning in 2015, resulting in an unlevered IRR on a go-forward basis well above 10% across the range of potential price scenarios. We are the farthest along with Peach Bottom. To date, at our ownership level, we have invested $55 million, with roughly $360 million of spend planned through 2016. In terms of investment dollars, Peach Bottom is the smallest of the 3 uprates and the size of the investment results in limited strain on the balance sheet. You can also see that we are moving forward with our plans for upstream gas. These investments provide strong returns with no impact on credit metrics as calculated by S&P, given their treatment of the reserve base lending facility that is utilized to fund the business. We view these investments as value-creation opportunities for our shareholders that support our strategy but with limited balance sheet impact. Now I'll speak to the decisions -- now I'll speak to how these decisions impact our balance sheet and how we think about the dividend going forward. We've maintained a strong balance sheet to help us weather this challenging market. With the expected year-end FFO to debt of 31% in 2012, we are strong heading into 2013. However, these metrics weaken as our higher-priced hedges roll off and we enter into the new hedges at lower prices. Based on 9/30 prices and with the deferral of the upgrade and the elimination of the undesignated renewable spend, our FFO to debt at Genco plus HoldCo is more focused -- excuse me, forecasted to be above the 25% to 27% range for 2014 and '15. We believe our metrics are sufficient to maintain investment-grade ratings. But with the recent market volatility we experience, we have to continue to monitor this. We believe the materialization of our fundamental view of power prices will allow us to strengthen our credit matrix and watch the markets closely to ensure that we have no structural changes that could impact our fundamental view of the $3 to $6 upside. It is, of course, also possible that the power prices will not recover as completely or as rapidly as our fundamental views suggest. In that regard, with the actions we've taken, we have time to see how things play out. But if they do not play out favorably in the next 6 months, revisiting our dividend policy will be in the range of options for preserving our investment-grade rating that management and the board will need to consider. Before I turn the call over to Jack, I'd like to speak to the implications of the Illinois Commerce Commission's decision in the rehearing of ComEd's formula rate, which is on Slide 8. On October 30, ICC granted ComEd recovery of the cost of funding its pension but denied the cost of recovery of 2 other key issues, which ComEd appealed in the courts, along with other items previously denied in the ICC May ruling. The adverse ruling on the interest rate and rate base issues impair ComEd's ability to finance long-term investment programs. While we remain committed to fulfilling the promise of the Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act and intend to meet our obligations under the law, we have to be thoughtful about making the investments, if we do not have a full cost recovery mechanism, as authorized by the legislation. As a result of the ICC decision, ComEd has deferred $450 million of capital expenditure through 2012 -- from 2012 to 2014 to 2015 year. Obviously, that schedule could shift as a result of regulatory, legal or legislative developments. At EEI, we'll be providing a more comprehensive update of the ComEd and other utility CapEx spends forecasted through 2015. Given the negative impact of the ICC decision, we believe the decision should be reversed. This will take time. So we'll continue to update you as we work through it. And like I said, we'll talk more about this in EEI. I'll now turn the call over to Jack, who will speak to our financial performance during the quarter.
Jonathan W. Thayer: Thank you Chris, and good morning, everyone. As Chris mentioned, I'll review the second quarter financial results, and then update you on changes to our 2012 cash forecast and earnings outlook. I'll start on Slide 9. We reported third quarter 2012 non-GAAP operating earnings of $0.77 per share versus $1.12 a share in the third quarter of 2011. Beyond the impact of the merger-related share differential and the addition of earnings from the legacy Constellation business, revenue net of fuel at ExGen is the primary difference between 2012 third quarter results and the third quarter prior year. The drivers of lower RNF include lower realized market prices and lower PJM capacity revenues due to the transition to the 2012-2013 capacity auction clearing prices, which averaged about $36 per megawatt day lower than the 2011-2012 planning period. When comparing our financial results for the quarter with our expectations, we delivered solid results for the quarter and we exceeded our $0.65 to $0.75 of earnings per share expectations. We outperformed our guidance range largely due to favorable RNF at ExGen and tax benefits at PECO and favorable weather at ComEd and PECO. ExGen's $0.53 non-GAAP earnings per share this quarter reflected about $0.04 of favorable RNF. This RNF upside is the net of approximately $0.07 of revenues from effective portfolio management optimization by Ken Cornew's Constellation team, partially offset by $0.03 due to lower-than-expected nuclear volumes. Chris already spoke about the source of the portfolio optimization benefit earlier, but I will add that event-driven opportunities such as this are difficult to forecast. When they do arise, having a skilled team that can execute and capture the benefits such as ours is an asset. Moving to the utilities. ComEd's non-GAAP earnings of $0.10 per share for 2012 third quarter includes $0.01 more earnings than expected from favorable weather, driven by the amount of cooling degree-days over normal. The number of cooling degree-days at ComEd this quarter exceeded normal expectations by nearly 250 degree-days or 40%. Likewise, PECO's 2012 third quarter non-GAAP earnings of $0.14 per share reflect an additional $0.01 of earnings above our expectations due to weather. PECO's 2012 third quarter results also reflect a larger than estimated benefit from the deductions associated with the tax treatment of repairs for gas distribution assets. We elected and recognized a similar benefit for the treatment of electric transmission distribution assets the same time last year. The actual benefit for this item came in higher than our estimate by $0.02. BGE's 2012 non-GAAP operating earnings this quarter were completely offset by storm cost. BGE's non-GAAP operating earnings would have been about $0.03 if not for the cost incurred for the derecho storm in July. Despite BGE's absorption of the storm cost, BGE will still contribute positive earnings to full year consolidated earnings. Turning to Slide 10. Our cash from operations projection is up $450 million since the last update. There are several puts and takes to this number, but it's largely due to changes in net income and changes in taxes coinciding with the company's annual tax filings. In addition, the latest cash from operations projection includes the updated expected net proceeds from the sale of the Maryland coal assets, as outlined in the 8-K we filed on August 9. Now I'll turn to Slide 11 on earnings outlook. On Slide 11, I'd like to provide our updated earnings outlook for 2012. As is typical at this time of year, we are narrowing our guidance range. We've had a few positive developments occur this quarter that warrant us raising the top of our range as well. We now expect 2012 full year earnings in the range of $2.75 to $2.95 per share, up from our initial earnings guidance range of $2.55 to $2.85 per share. The revised earnings expectations reflect the $0.10 of earnings per share ComEd will record in the fourth quarter to recognize the impact of the commission's rehearing decision issued on October 3. The guidance adjustment also considers the incremental earnings contributed by the favorable RNF at ExGen, offset by our preliminary estimate of incremental storm cost related to Hurricane Sandy. So in closing, our next update would be at EEI, where we will refresh much of the information we shared at Analyst Day, including capital expenditure estimates through 2015 and pension contribution expectations. That concludes my comments. I'll now turn the call back over to Chris before we open the line for Q&A.
Christopher M. Crane: Thanks, Jack. Before we move to Q&A, I just want to reiterate a few points. We've had a strong financial performance in 2012, even with the impact of the hurricane. As a result, Jack mentioned, we are increasing our earnings guidance range. While the recent market dynamics do give us concern, I'd restate we believe $3 to $6 per megawatt hour is not priced into the market, and our expectation is that we will see the upside for 2015 and beyond materialize in 2013. We've taken the right platform to take the right advantage of what we expect for the power market recovery. Investment-grade ratings and maintaining the dividend are our top priorities. We have options, we have time to maintain these objectives. To time our investments for the power market recovery in giving us some flexibility, we've repositioned our growth strategy and we deferred certain upgrade projects. We'll also, as we stated, eliminate the undesignated renewable spend. Lastly, we remain focused on protecting and creating value -- shareholder value through continued advancement of growth projects at Exelon utilities, Peach Bottom, Antelope Valley Solar Ranch and upstream gas. With that, we will open it up to questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Greg Gordon with ICI Group (sic) [ISI Group].
Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: I just wanted to ask you a few questions about the numbers from sort of the -- from the Analyst Day from April 30 to present. So when we look at power pricing, power prices dipped but have -- sort of substantial to come back more or less to where they were at the Analyst Day deck, slightly higher in some regions like Zone A, New York; slightly lower in other regions like PJM -- I'm sorry, like NiHub. But you have also done things to reduce CapEx, further cut O&M and your gross margin targets are substantially the same. So is it fair to say that your credit metrics, as things look today, are still within the 25% to 27% FFO to debt that you were projecting in April?
Christopher M. Crane: Yes, they are.
Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: So why would you, 6 months from now, when things aren't improving, be sort of thinking about a change in dividend policy if at the current forward curve you're still on those credit metrics? Is it that over time, you start to -- you're deferring capital expenditures but you can't -- you're sort of pushing out the decision but you can't permanently eliminate that decision unless power prices go up. Is that the right way to think about it?
Christopher M. Crane: Here's how I'd look at it. The capital isn't part of that decision any longer. If the markets don't come back, which we think they will, most likely we will not do those upgrades. So you've got to see the market recover and then you see the strengthening of the balance sheet, then you understand we should be back into a sustainable growth mode, optimizing our assets. Continuing to watch the markets come forward, if you look at 2012 and 2014 -- excuse me, 2013, 2014 NiHub or West Hub, those years on an ATC are back to where we were talking with you at Analyst Day, and some a little bit better. But if you look at '15 and '16, there's still a buck and change disconnect there. So we haven't seen them strengthen as much on the back end. We saw a lot of volatility in August. It was unbelievable where the numbers were going, we couldn't model them. We want to make sure that we're being very open and clear. We said we wouldn't surprise anybody. If that volatility comes back into the market, we don't see the recovery, you do not want to -- we do not want to be living on the edge, and the edge is 25%. We've been given some flexibility by the rating agencies because they think this is a stress period. But if something structurally change there and you're dealing with a 90% payout on a dividend for a long run and we have to question if we're getting value. You don't want to live on the edge. There is potential volatility, but I think we have time to watch it going into 2013.
Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. So just to recap and make sure I'm hearing you correctly, you've sort of moved yourself back into a comfort zone for the short term with the actions you've taken, but if we don't see the back end improve, those actions sort of aren't a permanent solution?
Christopher M. Crane: I don't think they would be a permanent solution under these market conditions right now. And that's why we've got to see the market come back up.
Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Great. Just a follow-up question on that. One of the things that is sort of an obvious observation is that this is probably leading to lower prices is the anemic low growth that you're seeing in your service territories. I think that's a concern that's come up on a number of other earnings calls in a number of other regions as well. Is there anything you can point to that's leading to sort of such sluggish activity? And anything that might lead to a potential change in that perspectively?
Christopher M. Crane: Well, the first initiating event for the market prices is the retirement of the assets that have been stated already, and we think that tightens the reserve margins there and should be reflected in the market prices. The load growth has been flat to negative. We continue to work on saving industry and trying to attract industry in. But I don't think you can beat energy efficiency over the next couple of years. So there -- on some sides, you're seeing housing come back. You're seeing auto come back. We saved the refineries in Pennsylvania, that's the load sting or a little coming back in. On the other side of that equation, you're seeing the effects of energy efficiency come in. So the real needle mover is on the market reflecting the tightening reserve margins of the retirements.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jay Dobson with Wunderlich Securities.
James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division: Following on the last question, given the volatility in August, is there a change in your confidence in your fundamental view? Or is it simply just the volatility itself? I'm trying to understand what's causing the injection of the dividend uncertainty.
Christopher M. Crane: We're not injecting that today. I think we've messaged clearly that we'll never surprise anybody. We talked about the levers we had back in Analyst Day, when we were looking at tight market forwards. We've come back to that point. August had more volatility than we expected. Now there's a couple of things that came in, in August. We think there was more coming to market, then the liquidity was there. It -- other portfolios were coming into the market. We need to substantiate that in the next quarter, next couple of quarters to see -- and we believe the prices would come back. But can -- I don't think we're shaken by the volatility but we do want to confirm our assessment, right?
Jonathan W. Thayer: That's right, Chris. Obviously, Jay, we have and continue to reiterate that we see heat rate upside in this market that is not being reflected, particularly in the '15, '16 time frame. The volatility in price you've seen this summer largely was driven by a couple of things, natural gas price movements and selling behavior in the marketplace. We have seen some recovery on the back of natural gas prices, but we still have not seen the market reflect what we think is a fundamental shift in the stack based on the retirement of over 40,000 gigawatts coal plants in the '15-'16 time frame.
James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division: Okay, fair enough. And then Chris, on Illinois, can you talk just a little bit about the legislative outlook? I know you filed an 8-K and are probably getting out and talking to folks about the ICC decision. Just I know you're appealing it, but what legislative attempts might be on the horizon?
Christopher M. Crane: We have Anne Pramaggiore here. I'll let her speak to that.
Anne R. Pramaggiore: Thanks, Chris. Our view is we've got free pass to resolving this issue, which is essentially recovering the cost of making the investment that the legislature envisions us to make over the next few years. One is the appeal path, and I think you've all seen that we filed our appeal. We also asked for an expedited appeal, and that was -- we did not -- we were not successful on that. So we're on the appeal path. The second path is to try to deal with this in the commission itself. There's a current rate case in front of the commission that is -- will be resolved by the end of December, and there's some opportunity to deal with it in that case. And then finally, obviously, there's a legislative path. So we view all those paths as options right now. We are talking to all parties and having conversations. I don't think we foreclosed any path, but we'll see what looks like the most opportune path and the one where we can get it done as quickly as possible so we can get back on track with making these investments and creating jobs in the state.
Operator: And your next question is from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.
Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: First question. Chris, when you were talking about just looking out into next year and recovery, I think you mentioned the dividend being one of the options that you'd have to address, maybe your fundamental view is not playing out as you hoped. What would the others be?
Christopher M. Crane: We would continue to look at other capital spends. Stacie Frank and treasury are looking at some things in project, financing some of our renewables we have. Now, they're not as large or meaningful, but if it's just to buy more time as we see the market come back, there are other steps that we'll be looking at.
Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And so those would be -- you see you have incremental sort of levers on CapEx, potentially?
Jonathan W. Thayer: Yes.
Christopher M. Crane: We have to be very careful about the next step. So the next step is, is this a reliability cut, and are you going to pay for it in the long run? So you look at some of the upgrade projects around digital systems at the nuclear plants or other things like that, that are addressing each of the infrastructure, which -- you really have got to be careful, but we will look at them. And if it's moving in some amount of time, months or a year and we don't think it'll be impactful, we can look at that. But again, they're not the 2.3 billion size that we are able to just pull with the actions we are taking now.
Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And then secondly, if I may. Like last quarter's 10-Q disclosed some pretty substantial pension contributions that you expected to have in the '16-'17 time frame. How should we -- I mean, firstly, have those numbers changed much as you update for this quarter? And how should we think about those as they fit into this plan?
Christopher M. Crane: Sure. We've been working on that. Jack, do you want to talk a little bit about that?
Jonathan W. Thayer: Sure, Chris. So Jonathan, as you might expect, with the declining interest rates, the liability has grown. Importantly, under Doug Brown, who heads up our investments organization under Bill, we had put in place a liability matching strategy that reduced the impact on the overall obligation. That current unfunded status, if you look at the pension, is roughly $3.9 billion. That's relative to an end of year '11 of $2.2 billion. And I would say that, that growth is despite the fact that we've seen a very strong performance on both the equity, as well as the liability matched elements of our pension assets. As we look forward, as you may know, the President has put in place a -- or is looking to put in place a policy that allows us to adjust the pension liability and how we fund that. And that would have the impact of pulling forward certain of our expenses and reducing our expenses in out years. This strategy, we'll be updating at EEI, and we'll be able to walk you through after we've issued the Q3 10-Q, the specific details of the impact of that adjustment. But it does result in further funding in the initial years but moderates that funding and reduces it in '16 and '17.
Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And could I just ask one sort of a related topic, is equity something you would look at as a way to bridge either the trough in the power cycle or maybe this pension funding issue as it comes -- it will arise?
Christopher M. Crane: So we would always look. But at this point, I believe that our equity is -- the value isn't reflected in our equity right now. So it would be unlikely that, that would be a fix. If we don't see markets recovering, something's fundamentally shifted. Issuing equity to buy time only to have to make some other decision in the future just seems more destructive than we'd be willing to take at this point. But that said, it's not totally off the table. We'll look at where we're at when -- middle of the year and see what fits best based off of the financials that we're facing.
Operator: Your next question is from Steve Fleishman with Bank of America.
Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Just a question with regard to the $3 to $6 and thinking about the base, you've been communicating that range for a while but the base has continued to move around. Should we think about the base being this 9/30 price stack when you think about the $3 to $6 that you're looking for?
Christopher M. Crane: Yes. That is right. It's the -- around the 9/30 and it's in the out years, gaining that recovery where it still has stayed flat. Jack, you got any more on that?
Jonathan W. Thayer: No, I think that's right, Chris. We have talked about, at varying times, the upside that we see in heat rate recovery. At varying times, we've said it's actually priced into the market and aggressively hedged at above ratable to lock in that value. And at this point, as of 9/30, that $3 to $6 is what we see as the fundamental upside.
Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay, great. And then just on the retail margin and disclosures, it looks like you are expecting some kind of normalization, maybe by the 2015 forecast, is that correct in terms of margins? Or are you assuming like lower end?
Christopher M. Crane: No, I think we do. Ken, you want to talk about that?
Kenneth W. Cornew: Yes. Steve. we do expect margins to revert back to historical, where we would think of more rational levels in 2015 timeframe. You are correct.
Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: And when we think about rational, is that the midpoint, the $2 to $4 for low end?
Kenneth W. Cornew: Yes, commercial industrial business, it would be in the midpoint area, the $2 to $4. Obviously, much larger for gross margin on the MATS market side.
Operator: Your next question comes from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: What do you know as far as the schedule of auctioning of the Illinois load?
Christopher M. Crane: Do you have any update on that? Yes, we'll ask Anne.
Anne R. Pramaggiore: Yes. I mean, I don't know if you're asking about municipal aggregation or the Illinois Power Agency. The Illinois Power Agency typically goes out in April. But with the load shift under municipal aggregation, I think there's a question right now as to whether they actually will go out in April. If the question is on municipal aggregation, we've seen about 50% of the residential load shift year-to-date. We've got about 60 more referenda to go next week. And if they all go, we'll see about 75% of the load move off of ComEd into the market by first quarter of next year.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: And when -- how soon would you act on the dividend if -- when you do your 6-month look and things haven't improved, under that scenario, would you do something immediately?
Christopher M. Crane: I couldn't venture to say that. We've got to see what's going on in the market. We have had a lot of conversations with the board if we got to that point, but -- and I said we wouldn't surprise anybody. We'll have many more conversations between here and there, but couldn't commit to a timeframe. As I said, we believe the market is going to come back. We believe the market has to come back. And so we're more on the side "let's get the market back" than we are "here's the date we would plan on cutting a dividend."
Operator: And your next question is from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Just on the credit quality. I mean, you want the investment grade, but again I think of you guys as being -- you're not exactly BBB-, right? I mean, how far down would you go, I guess? Is there any particular range we should think about here? Or...
Christopher M. Crane: Well we are at the HoldCo BBB-, BBB at the Genco. So we're there.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: I'm talking about the Genco. Isn't that where the big issue is? Or is it at the HoldCo, as well?
Christopher M. Crane: We wouldn't allow ourselves at any registrant to go below. Due to the constraints on the other businesses, would be too cumbersome and too costly.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Okay. And then Kewaunee, they're shutting that down, which would sort of lead me to believe that it could have been gotten for a song. I know it's not in PJM. I know that there are obviously different characteristics with their plant. I'm just wondering sort of your thoughts about that. The opportunity I'm sure you guys probably would have seen -- anything in terms of -- give us any flavor for that?
Christopher M. Crane: Demand has done a lot to improve that plant. There are good people there. It's sad to see a nuke come off, but there isn't a market to cover -- it's a small unit, so it's all -- and costs are a little bit higher. It's tough to compete in the PPA area for that. So the economics just don't work. We're -- across the board, we continue to look at the valuations of all the nuclear assets. And smaller, single site assets are more challenged with these power prices that are not only damaged based off of the lower commodity price but also some of the issues that we're having around excess wind generation. So we'll continue to look at plants as they come up, but it just doesn't make it.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Okay. And is there anything we should think about with respect to anybody in your fleet? Is there -- are there any Kewaunees to put it directly?
Christopher M. Crane: No. No, there's no Kewaunees that -- we go through our asset valuations on an annual basis. But we are looking at things to try to improve the financial performance. Our Clinton station, which is a large single-unit site, it's a high quality, newer asset, is struggling with this MISO market in the wind generation. We're looking at going to annual refueling cycles to save on our fuel costs that will help its sustainability on the grid. So we're in the mode of continuing to figure out how to help these things survive this market downturn versus the outright sell or close-type thing at this point.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Okay. And then on the positive side Sandy and the Rachel, I think, are in guidance, is that correct? And I know -- I think you said it was about $100 million for Sandy? What was the impact of the Rachel? I'm sorry, if I missed it.
Christopher M. Crane: Is that...
Jonathan W. Thayer: The derecho
Christopher M. Crane: Yes. You got that, Jack or Ken?
Jonathan W. Thayer: The derecho was roughly $0.05 -- or sorry, $50 million, $0.03.
Operator: And your next question is from Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse.
Dan Eggers - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Just if we can get into the retail conversation a little bit, I mean, Jack, you guys have been in this business for a long time. Is the pressure outside of Muni-Ag, are you seeing similar pressures on the C&I customer base kind of across the country? Or is this a more of Midwestern localized issue as you've seen some of the other big integrated utilities try and hedge their outlook this way?
Christopher M. Crane: Ken, do you want to cover that?
Kenneth W. Cornew: Yes. Dan, we've clearly seen pressure on both the Muni-Ag side and C&I space. C&I selling season is really Q4 and Q1, so we're now in the midst of what will be a 6-month run-on selling in C&I space because that's how the buyers -- this is the time here when buyers buy. So it remains to be seen whether the behavior persists. But clearly, through the summer, there have been -- there has been margin pressure in all segments of retail.
Dan Eggers - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And then I guess, Chris, just I don't want to belabor the dividend question. But when you and the board stepped back and kind of looked at the dividend relative to the business mix and the earnings power, how do you guys think about your coverage or payout ratios between the utility and the generation businesses as you formulate kind of comfort with a dividend at a certain level?
Christopher M. Crane: So what we've done in the past, we have a more traditional payout strategy for the utilities, 65% to 70%. And that resonates well as we benchmark to other regulated entities. On the growth side for the competitive part of the integrated, we have tried to benchmark more of the yield and keep track with the sector and the yield. Now since we've got a little bit more damage with the gas and our concentration in NiHub, our yield is 5.9%, last time I looked at it, where the others are probably 1% lower, if not more. So we're outpacing the yield. Now we get this $0.70 back, it's a different conversation. And we're more sensitive to the upside. And that's what -- we just got to reaffirm with -- in our policy as we look at this, is that the right thing? We think we're hitting the stress low, and we think the recovery is there. But that would be part of the conversation, how do you benchmark the yield and the payout percentage on that other side of the business?
Operator: You're next question is from Ali Agha with SunTrust.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Chris or Jack, when you look at the margin profile you laid out for us for '15, I guess you've now added that to your disclosure and you factored in cost escalation, et cetera. Should we be thinking of '15 still as flat to down year for you guys? [Technical Difficulty]
Christopher M. Crane: I'm sorry, we're having some technical difficulty here. [Technical Difficulty]
Christopher M. Crane: So you were asking about the margins that we baked into the disclosure on '15?
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Yes. And my question was when you look at cost escalations and the like, are we still looking at '15 relatively flat to even down for Exelon as a whole, given those margin trends you've given us?
Christopher M. Crane: Are you talking in... [Technical Difficulty]
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: On an EPS basis.
Christopher M. Crane: Yes, we are giving EPS for 2015. So we're only going to focus at the first of the year on '13. We don't go out there.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Yes, I understood. Understood. I was just looking directionally not really trying to pin you down on a number. A separate question, Chris. As you look at your portfolio today, and of course you have to sell those assets as part of the merger, but are all the current assets pretty much core for Exelon? Is asset sale or divestitures the source of capital that you may revisit given market conditions?
Christopher M. Crane: So there are some assets on the edge, they're not big assets. There's something in Las Vegas that's historical. There's a few small assets in California that we're looking at divesting. We continue to watch what we're doing in Alberta. But the meaningful assets are all core, and we think that they are undervalued at this point. I mean, you look at our nuclear assets and the implied valuation well under $1,000 of KW. I think anybody would buy it at that price right now. So I don't think we would look at asset divestitures in this devalued state besides those small ones, which won't be meaningful to cash flows. With that, we're going to wrap up before the music starts again. We apologize for any of the background noise or any of the issues. We actually have everybody spread across all the service territory attending to storm issues. So there's only a small portion of us back in Chicago here now. We'll be at EEI, and we look forward to being able to provide additional modeling information for the company as we address your questions and talk about more of the strategic focus going forward. So we hope all of you in New York, they get you back soon and everybody stay safe, and we'll see you in Scottsdale. Thank you.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Stephanie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Second Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Ms. JaCee Burns, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.
JaCee Burns: Thank you, Stephanie, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Exelon's second quarter 2012 earnings conference call. Thank you for joining us today. We issued our earnings release this morning. If you haven't received it, the release is available on the Exelon website. The earnings release and other matters we will discuss in today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties, as well as adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings. Please refer to today's 8-K and Exelon's other filings for a discussion on factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts and expectations and for reconciliation of operating to GAAP earnings. Leading the call today are Chris Crane, Exelon's President and CEO; and Jack Thayer, Exelon's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by many other members of Exelon's executive management team who will be available to answer your questions. We have scheduled 60 minutes for this call. I will now turn the call over to Chris Crane, Exelon's CEO.
Christopher M. Crane: Thank you, JaCee, and good morning to everybody. We'll start off on Slide 2. As you saw on our release this morning, Exelon has delivered solid performance for the quarter. Our operating earnings per share were $0.61 for the second quarter, in line with our expectations. Our nuclear organization continued to run the fleet well, turning in a capacity factor of 93.4% for the second quarter, a period that included 51 planned refueling outage days at 2 units. The first 6 months of the year, the capacity factor was 93.5%. The performance of the entire generation fleet was very good. Our commercial operations also performed well in actively managing the portfolio. In the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions, our decision to be ahead of ratable in prior quarters allowed us the opportunity to slow down our hedging volume in this quarter. In Texas, as prices moved up during the second quarter, we accelerated our hedging activity to lock in the upside of 2012 and 2013. In addition, our retail sales channels are meeting expectations for added margins and volumes. As you can see in the hedge disclosure, the second quarter had a dip in the market, but we believe in July, we've made up over half of that on the open gross margin, and Ken and Jack can address those questions as we get to the Q&A. At our utilities, this summer has brought extreme heat along with some violent storms. Our utilities system weathered the heat extremely well when we experienced 8 to 12 consecutive days of temperatures above 90 degrees across the 3 service territories. The storm brought more of a challenge, particularly in the BGE service territory, which experienced one of the most damaging storms in BGE's nearly 200-year history. Both Maryland and Illinois were hit by significant storms. In total, the utilities restored power to approximately 1.2 million customers during the first week of July. I would really like to thank our utility crews at BGE, ComEd and PECO for their tireless efforts to restore the service to our customers, also -- or often through intense heat periods. We spoke to you at length at our Analyst Day in June and provided you with a significant amount of information. We remain on track with what we told you. Not much has changed. Therefore, our presentation -- prepared remarks and presentation today are short, leaving additional time for questions. Additionally, in the spirit of continued transparency, we have provided additional information in our Appendix, which assists you in financial modeling efforts. I do continue to be extremely pleased with our merger. The operations has been seamless due to a large part to a very effective integration planning and how well we are working together. We remain on track to achieve $100 million -- $170 million of merger-related O&M synergies for 2012. Based on our performance to date, we are reaffirming our 2012 full year earnings guidance range of $2.55 to $2.85 per share, and we expect to be comfortably within that range. Jack will cover our financial performance in greater detail in a few moments, but let me first give you an update on regulatory developments at ComEd and BGE and our expectations for growth capital at Exelon Generation over the next 3 years. Turning to Slide 3. On June 22, the Illinois Commerce Commission agreed to rehear key elements of the ComEd's 2011 formula rate filing, including the treatment of the pension asset. We view the ICC's decision as a step in the right direction. ComEd's goal is to provide customers with better service, more choices and greater control over their electric bills. We are committed to working with the regulators to make sure we can make the investments necessary to fulfill these promises to our customers. We also believe our positions are soundly supported by the existing legislation. The ICC's timeline for rehearing calls are on order by September 19 of this year with hearings beginning later this week. Reversal of the original ICC decision on the rehearing items could improve ComEd earnings by as much as $0.10 per share in 2012. Turning to BGE. On July 27, BGE filed a combined electric and gas rate case with the Maryland Public Service Commission. The rate case reflects a $204 million increase in revenue requirements for both electric and gas, with the requested ROE of 10.5%. BGE needs to make investments in assets and systems to maintain and improve electric reliability, ensure gas safety and meet increasing compliance obligations. In order for BGE to continue to make these needed investments to serve the customers, it requires the opportunity to earn a fair return. We expect an order from the Maryland PSC by February of 2013, with hearings to be set for later in the fourth quarter. Now I want to spend a few moments on our growth capital expectations for Exelon Generation for the next 3 years. At our Analyst Day in June, we presented our CapEx expectations through 2014. In those numbers, we included $800 million of undesignated spend in our renewable business for 2013 and 2014. This is a conservative planning view, which affords us flexibility if we find the right opportunities. We continue to assess the viability of the spend. Our decision to move forward with projects will be driven by value creation for our shareholders, which will largely be determined by the extension of the federal investment tax credits and balance sheet flexibility. Antelope Valley Solar Ranch One in California is an example of this type of renewable project we find attractive. The 230-megawatt solar facility, progressing according to plan, the first portion of the project is expected to be online in October of 2012, and we expect commercial operations in late in 2013. Antelope Valley will be free cash flow accretive in 2013 and due to the project financing, we have minimal impact on our credit metrics as calculated by S&P. We expect to fully recover our investment by 2015. If we find similar growth opportunities, we will pursue them. We have created flexibility in our balance sheet by incorporating this undesignated spend. Before I turn over to Jack to review our financial results, there are a few things I want to reiterate. First, this quarter, we demonstrated our commitment to operational and financial results. I remain extremely pleased with the merger, it is working. We are already seeing benefits. As I said at our Analyst Day, we have the right strategy, the right platform, the right set of assets and the right leadership to manage through the market downturn and deliver unparalleled upside when the markets recover. In the meantime, we remain committed to our investment-grade balance sheet and our dividend. Exelon is the best-positioned company in the industry. With that, I'll turn it over to Jack to cover more details on the finances.
Jonathan W. Thayer: Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. My commentary will supplement the earnings press release issued this morning, which includes a substantial level of detail about Exelon's financial results. Let's begin with the summary of this quarter's financial results by operating company on Slide 4. Due to the merger, the composition of current quarter earnings for ExGen, BGE and Exelon are not comparable to last year. Thus, I'll highlight a few key results for the quarter in lieu of stepping through a comparison to last year. We are pleased to have delivered non-GAAP operating results of $0.61 per share this quarter. Our earnings are tracking well within our full year guidance range as a result of Exelon's operational performance. ExGen's $0.47 non-GAAP earnings per share contribution is in line with what we expected for the quarter. At the utilities, ComEd recorded $0.05 non-GAAP operating earnings per share this quarter, about $0.10 lower than it would've been if not for the impacts of the ICC order in their formula rate case. Given that the Commission agreed to revisit their ruling in ComEd's formula rate case, we're hopeful for a favorable outcome. The final decision will not be known until September 19. Thus, ComEd's financial results reflect the year-to-date impacts of the May order. PECO and BGE rounded out earnings this quarter with contributions of $0.10 and $0.02 per share, respectively. With respect to weather, ComEd's quarter results include a $0.01 benefit due to June's above average heat, while the financial impact from weather at PECO and BGE is negligible this quarter. At PECO, the above average heat experienced in the quarter was offset by fewer than normal heating degree days, and BGE's decoupling mechanism largely offsets the net impact of load variances. Updated load trend slides for ComEd and PECO are in the Appendix of today's presentation for you to review at your convenience. You'll notice that PECO's load outlook has improved since our Analyst Day presentation. As a result of positive development surrounding the acquisition of the ConocoPhillips and Sunoco's Pennsylvania oil refineries, PECO now expects a year-over-year, weather-normal decline of 2% versus the 3.3% decline in load previously projected. Turning to Slide 5. The commercial team continued to execute on the portfolio management and load serving strategies outlined by Ken at Analyst Day. We've made progress on our growth objectives in the brief time since disclosing our targets and have locked in an additional $150 million of gross margin towards our new business targets for the year. In our Midwest to Mid-Atlantic base load regions, we were able to slow the pace of our hedging activity this quarter in a flatter market price environment. In 2013 and 2014, our hedge percentages increased 3% to 5% this quarter versus a typically ratable 8%. This opportunity was created due to our efforts to be ahead of ratable in the previous several quarters when market conditions were more favorable. In the ERCOT region, we captured value from the link we carried into the quarter and timed our sales to capture the higher pricing prevalent earlier in the quarter. This execution led to a $1 per megawatt hour increase in the effective ERCOT realized energy prices for 2013 and 2014. We remain well positioned to meet our load serving sales targets. Our sales teams remain active in all competitive markets, renewing existing customers and attracting new customers from all customer classes. We'll provide a more comprehensive status check and update of our load serving business growth at EEI. An update of Exelon's sources and uses of cash is on Slide 6. We've had some movement in our planned CapEx spend for the year. However, the changes are primarily minor timing-related shifts, and all 2012 projects are still on track, including the $2 billion we're investing in attractive NPV positive growth projects. The more significant changes in our cash flow projections relate to tax settlements and debt financings. Regarding tax settlements, the majority of the $550 million decline in cash from operations is associated with a shift in the timing of refunds associated with settlements of our 2002 to 2006 tax filings with the IRS. The refunds, which have been agreed to by the IRS appeals, are now expected to be delayed until sometime in 2013 or 2014 due to a procedural change in the handling of partial settlements. Given the anticipated timing of the back settlement, ComEd is pulling forward a previously planned 2013 issuance to fund needs in the interim. At PECO, given the attractive interest rate environment, we are refinancing an incremental $100 million of the planned debt retirements, bringing total issuance to $350 million. This will also help reduce expected future financing needs. In June, ExGen completed its planned $775 million debt issuance with solid pricing that compared well to its 2010 debt offering. The 10-year and 30-year priced at 4.25% and 5.6%, respectively, compared to the 4.0% and 5.75% coupon achieved for the 10-year and 30-year offerings in September of 2010. These funds will be used for general purposes of the company, including investment growth. ExGen also announced they completed a private exchange offer for all the outstanding 7.6% senior notes due in 2032. Of the $700 million principal outstanding, more than 63% were tendered in exchange for cash and notes that will expire in 2022 and 2042. Going forward, this debt exchange will lower our annual pretax cash interest expense by approximately $7 million. And I'm pleased to announce that we are executing on an amended expense strategy for $7 billion in credit facilities, which will enable 3 key benefits. First, we'll extend the tender by 1 year on Exelon Corp.'s, Exelon Generation's and PECO's facility, and by 2 years on BGE's credit facility, resulting in a 2017 maturity for all our facilities. Second, we'll be able to realign the bank group with the combined company, bringing in new banks and ensuring all banks lend to each operating company within the Exelon family. Third, we'll capture current market pricing consistent with what we pay on ComEd's $1 billion credit facility refinanced earlier this year. We expect to close on the amended facilities in August. Before I open up the call for questions, I want to look ahead to next quarter's earnings. We expect Q3 non-GAAP operating earnings in the range of $0.65 to $0.75 per share, and we remain confident that we will achieve our full year earnings target of $2.55 to $2.85 per share. Our earnings guidance range adequately accounts for the impact of weather and incremental storms incurred in July. Most notably, it reflects $0.03 of incremental storm cost at BGE for the derecho storm. We are confident about achieving our financial targets this year, and there are several factors that give us line of sight on this goal, including our ability to hit synergy targets. To date, we've initiated and completed several milestones that will position us to achieve our $500 million run rate O&M savings starting in 2014. Staffing and selection was finalized at the end of June. Contract negotiations are in progress to incorporate our increased scale and scope and vendor contract pricing, and we eliminated an additional portion of our surplus credit facility. And with that, we're ready to take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon from ISI Group.
Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: So I noticed that the open gross margin numbers and the hedged gross margin numbers are down from the Analyst Day because you used a June 30 deck. But can you give us a sense of what pricing has done since then?
Jonathan W. Thayer: Yes. Ken, you want to...
Kenneth W. Cornew: Yes. Greg, June 30 was a relative low point from a pricing perspective, and prices were largely down from $1.50 to $2. As of the end of July here, we've -- the prices have rebounded about halfway, so $1 of that price is back in energy prices. So commensurate with that, as Chris commented on, we would expect to see our open gross margin calculation make its way halfway back up to where it was on April 30.
Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Great. And can you comment on whether there's been any sort of a public discussion about the pension issue as it pertains to your rehearing in front of the ICC amongst the commissioners or any other relevant parties?
Kenneth W. Cornew: There hasn't -- make sure I understand the question. You're asking, has there been any public statement by the Commission on the rehearing?
Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Or any other relevant interveners.
Christopher M. Crane: No. The rehearing process will start, I guess, the end of this weekend.
Stacie M. Frank: Yes. We've got hearings start at the end of this week. The date for the Commission's order is September 19. That's the drop-dead date for it. The one thing that is sort of a recent vintage that you may not be aware of is there was a hearing held before the House Public Utilities Committee on July 10. And we basically passed the resolution that we had filed on June 18, passed it through the House Public Utilities Committee, 22, yes, 1 no, on that date. So that was -- basically, what that resolution does is point out the 3 big issues that the Commission has taken up on rehearing and expresses the General Assembly's view that the 3 issues were not decided in accordance with the legislation of the account.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd from Morgan Stanley.
Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Just wanted to focus -- just building on Greg's question on the power price dynamics and the change. We saw some interesting dynamics in the sense of the power price falling at the same time that gas -- for gas rose. Could you maybe talk a little bit about the dynamics that you saw underlying sort of the disconnect between the movement in gas and power?
Christopher M. Crane: It's going to be driven off of load, but, Ken, do you want to...
Kenneth W. Cornew: Yes. Stephen, you did see a decline in heat rates in the last couple of months. Obviously, some of that is driven by increases in natural gas prices. We've noticed the tendency for power prices to be sluggish and how they move relative to gas. And really, as we got into the summer period and you started to see summer heat rates, the spot heat rates increased, that has created a rebound somewhat in the power price dynamic and you see power prices come back up. Again, it's a market that has a lot of different dynamics to it that are driven by future expectations or price, but as you see, reality in the spot market, it tends to have influence on longer-term prices as well. And I think higher spot heat rates have driven power prices up.
Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: That's very helpful. And then just shifting over to Illinois briefly, if the rehearing goes well in Illinois, do you expect next year you'd be in the range of your allowed ROEs? Or would you expect a modest lag at that time, if the rehearing goes well, sort of on the positive end of the range of outcomes?
Christopher M. Crane: Yes. If the hearing goes well, it resolves the issues that are causing us to under-earn. The -- if you remember the rate, the formula rate is based off of 580 basis points above the composite treasury. So we would get back to what we think the legislative package that had allowed us to earn what Anne [ph] is earning.
Anne R. Pramaggiore: Yes, so the 3 issues really takes care of the bulk of it. There's a few issues that the Commission did not take up on rehearing that will carry over, we'll take them up on appeal. So there's a little bit of cleanup on that, but we get very close.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman from Bank of America.
Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: A couple of questions. First, just there's been some commentary by other PJM generators that there's more maybe openness by PJM to review the MOPR rule in time for next year's auction. Could you comment at all on what you're hearing on that topic?
Christopher M. Crane: Yes. We're engaged in a dialogue with the generators and PJM. I'll ask Joe Dominguez to cover where we're at in the process now.
Joseph Dominguez: We've had several discussions with PJM and other stakeholders. We remain cautiously optimistic that we're going to get revisions to the MOPR process in advance of next year's auction. Obviously, our discussions are confidential. But I think there is widespread understanding of our concerns regarding the MOPR exemption process. And I think as time goes on, there's going to be an effort to change that process. That's about as much as I can say about those discussions.
Christopher M. Crane: We definitely want to do this in a cohesive manner and go under the filing to FERC on the, I think it's the 205s. More of an uncontested unified voice from PJM but don't plan on stopping. We'll continue to push the issue.
Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. Secondly, just should we still assume your asset sale related to the mergers closing will be announced sometime in August?
Christopher M. Crane: Yes, we expect everything wrapped up within the timeframe allowed. I think we have a 30-day extension that allows everything to be cleaned up by September 9. But it's well underway and don't expect bumps in the road.
Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And one last question, just on the tax cash flow item that you mentioned and the like, I hadn't recalled that being kind of delineated out as a special cash flow item. I just want to make sure that the kind of, let's say, the fixed income/rating agency community knew that there was a kind of a onetime tax cash flow item in this year?
Jonathan W. Thayer: Steve, this is Jack. We hadn't delineated out within the cash from operations, the tax item. But certainly, in our conversations with and our updates to the rating agencies, we're updating them on the expected timing of when those cash flows recover.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold from Deutsche Bank.
Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: My questions are mostly answered, but I just -- on this cash flow question, I just wanted to clarify the difference between the $1.4 billion to 5 common OCF in the Analyst Day, and the $975 million, is that pretty much all this tax item?
Christopher M. Crane: It's taxes as well as the recovery on the pension and other items related to the ICC order.
Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: So those were not sort of x'd out when you did the Analyst Meeting deck then?
Christopher M. Crane: The ICC rate order would have been x'd out, but some of the assumptions around working capital and timing, we did not build into our operating cash flow assumptions that time given the timing of the announcement relative to our Analyst Day. So that's an incremental, roughly $75 million hit to working capital and cash flow relative to what we showed at Analyst Day. So the significant portion of it is the timing of the tax that adds in.
Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: That was the best part of $400 million and then the ICC stuff is $75 million or so?
Christopher M. Crane: The working capital element related to the ICC order is $75 million.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin from UBS.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: So first with regards to BGE, I noticed you guys filed this rate case late last week. I'd be curious, to what extent do you expect kind of status quo your ability to earn your ROE next year under these new rates just kind of from a rate lag perspective? And then secondly, is there any chance given some of the reliability standards in the state to pursue any kind of quasi-trackers? Is there any outlook for that at all?
Christopher M. Crane: We -- the filing is based off of our desire for the ROE. And I think we've done a good job on stating the basis for that in the filing. So we'll proceed on that front. BGE has some room to make up, to catch up on earnings. As you know, when we announced the intention for our merger, we had to hold BGE out of their rate case. So that's caused some damage. And then there's with the timing and the recovery. But we fully expect to state our case and obtain those numbers. Ken, you want to talk about the Commission's philosophy on riders in Maryland and the potential of that?
Kenneth W. Cornew: Sure, and there's no question that Maryland Commission has not been particularly amenable to forward-looking adjustments. They didn't support any of those in the recent cases. However, we do think we have a compelling reason for proposing some of those. And then in parallel with that, we are still looking at opportunities to work with the Maryland legislature. We had some success in a, what was called the STRIDE Bill, looking at gas safety-related investments, which we almost got across the finish line, and we're going to be reintroducing that again. So we're going to be working both sides, both the legislative and the regulatory process.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Great. And then on the ExGen side, just to be curious, we've seen some shifts in power basis, 80 Hub, NiHub and perhaps, more interestingly, towards the East. How structural are some of these changes as we are thinking about it? Or are they due to more temporary type item?
Kenneth W. Cornew: Yes, Julien. And clearly, spot-basis figures have dropped significantly and it really is explained, in my mind, by coal and gas competition. So a significant amount of basis in the past has been driven by cheaper power prices in the Midwest, cheaper plants and higher costs and a higher heat rate used in the East. Now as gas and coal competition occur, those basis numbers drop. I think that's the main reason we've seen a squeeze in basis. I don't think there are major structural changes that are driving spot basis and forward basis right now. Obviously, with coal retirements coming in 2015 and some reinforcement of the grid, there are going to be some changes.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jay Dobson.
James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division: Chris, I wanted to follow up on your CapEx comments in your prepared remarks, particularly around renewables. If the PTC is not extended, how much of that $800 million in 2013, 2014 would go away?
Christopher M. Crane: We don't have an exact number. There are some projects that are still under construction right now. We have Antelope Valley that will go into 2013. We'll still look at other opportunities. I would say that the wind growth would be significantly reduced with the PTC going away. There probably will be some solar opportunities left, and we'll continue to focus on those.
James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division: And could you put a sort of number around what the wind going away would, just as we all sort of stare at CapEx and the like?
Christopher M. Crane: If you look at the numbers we have slated for 2014 in that rounded up CapEx spend of about $425 million, we would look at other uses of that if they created value. We just don't see the wind being there to use that to -- the market being there to need that expenditure. But we'll continue to look at others.
James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division: Okay. So we shouldn't assume the $425 million goes away, it might just be reallocated. So if we're sort of stay out of the bottom line of CapEx, don't assume PTCs go away, CapEx goes down, but maybe it gets reallocated. Is that the right way to think about it?
Christopher M. Crane: It has the potential to be reallocated based off of the value of the investments that we can find at the time. What we're trying to do in this period and we've talked about a sustainable growth, is really focus on the flexibility that we have on the balance sheet, look at what our potential investment opportunities could be. They meet the hurdle rates, they help drive the outyear earnings. So it's not that we would -- if wind's not there, we're not investing anymore. We go to different areas and see if there's a good value proposition. And if not, we don't spend the money.
James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division: Perfect. And Chris, do you all, as a corporation, have a view on PTCs?
Christopher M. Crane: We are -- we do have a very strong view on PTCs. We're -- and publicly, we're asking them to be stopped. We do have a wind business. We think wind should be in the portfolio, but what's happening, I think there's unintended consequences with all the fundamental shifts in the generating stack right now between coal retirements, natural gas coming down, trying to subsidize a single source can create some market distortions. And we're asking for a break period, let's let the market stabilize. That PTC has been in place since 1992, I believe. And I think that's enough time to jumpstart an industry, 20 years. So we've made it known even as a wind company that it should be stopped and let's stabilize the fundamentals so we all know where we can make our investments.
James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division: Okay, perfect. Just 2 more questions then. A quick one for Joe, I think. On the PJM MOPR, understanding it's all confidential of discussions, but assuming you got to something that was somewhat unanimous and uncontested, would it be your view that, that's something FERC is willing to consider and approve?
Joseph Dominguez: It is my view. I think if the stakeholders come together with proposed revisions that address some of the defects in the exemption process and their sufficient support of that, I think it would get through FERC fairly easily. Obviously, the process being that we get to that solution, and we have some work to do to get there. Again, we're cautiously optimistic we will.
James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division: Awesome. And then last question, I guess, to Ken. Just give a little granularity on sort of what you're seeing on retail margins in the Northeast.
Kenneth W. Cornew: Yes. As I've stated in the -- on Analyst Day, we expect margins in the $2 to $4 area, and we don't see any reason to change that perspective.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Chin from Citigroup.
Brian Chin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Just a quick clarification on Slide 15, which has been a helpful slide. In the footnotes, you guys talk about how the CENG O&M and D&A is not included in the stub estimate. Should that mean that it is included in the full year estimate? Or should we think of it that the accounting treatment for both the sub and the full year are comparable so we can really compare those?
Christopher M. Crane: Duane, do you want to...
Duane M. DesParte: Yes. No, the -- you can think of that as comparable. The full year earnings estimate only reflects BGE's contribution.
Christopher M. Crane: CENG's.
Duane M. DesParte: CENG, I'm sorry. I misunderstood the question.
Christopher M. Crane: So the -- we're only recognizing the net profits from the JV, not trying to fold in the operating expense. So from an accounting perspective, it's comparable, yes.
Brian Chin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Understood. And just to clarify...
Christopher M. Crane: And, Brian, just the rationale for giving you this is in our Generation statistics, we show the megawatt-hours under purchased power for CENG, and we wanted comparability to the extent that you wanted to model this on a P x Q basis so you could model in the full impact of CENG's P&L.
Brian Chin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Understood, understood. And then also, the reason why the stub estimate, the full year estimate price for taxes other than income, why they're similar, that's just due to rounding. Really, there's probably the full year estimate's probably a little bit higher than the sub estimate just prorating [ph] up, right?
Christopher M. Crane: That's right. It's rounded to the nearest $50 million, and it just -- it's the nature of the numbers that the spread is really within that $50 million advance.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Paul Fremont from Jefferies.
Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: I guess yesterday, we heard for the first time that MidwestGen may find its way into bankruptcy at some point. If they were to reject contracts, including, I guess, their obligation to deliver capacity under RPM, what would happen to -- will they have to rerun the auctions basically? Or what would happen with respect to sort of filling in that capacity that's already been sold in auctions?
Christopher M. Crane: Yes, I don't think we're prepared to address the MidwestGen and I hadn't heard about that. But the commitments in the auction, I don't -- they would not rerun the auction. Joe or Ken, you want to jump in? The fall for provisions are...
Joseph Dominguez: Yes, there are obviously the fall provisions and the incremental auctions for people to buy replacement capacity if capacity drops out for any reason. We're not going to comment on, as Chris said, MidwestGen's particular situation.
Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: And you if you were to take MidwestGen out of the equation, I mean can you give us a sense of what reserve margins might be sort of in Chicago because as I understand, that, that is a bottleneck?
Joseph Dominguez: I don't think we know what MidwestGen units clear in any particular auction. We can't know that. So we definitely can't do that calculation.
Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: And then the last question for me is, it looks as if gas prices, since the ones that you're using as reference prices are up like $0.10, so how much of the July improvement is due to higher gas? And how much of the July improvement in absolute price of power is due to market heat rate?
Joseph Dominguez: I would say, Paul, it's due almost entirely to higher gas prices. There has been higher spot heat rates in the middle and the Midwest region, lower spot heat rates in the ERCOT region, so it depends on what we're talking about here. But mostly, the increase in gas has driven a commensurate increase in power prices. And it's not really a fundamental shift from a forward sense in heat rates at all. Heat rates are very flat from a 13 to 16x rate.
Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: So I guess -- so what would've caused the deterioration in the forward market heat rates?
Joseph Dominguez: Heat rates are typically inversely correlated to natural gas, so they will fall. Heat rates are higher relatively than the year's historical heat rates have been. They reached a high point with the low point in natural gas a couple of months ago and have fallen. As we've indicated before, we believe that from a forward sense, these heat rates should be increasing fundamentally as coal plants retire. They're not doing so. Again, it's a sluggish and liquid market where in the '15, '16 timeframe, we don't see a lot of buying interest and buying activity.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs.
Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Just talk a little bit about some of the feedback you've gotten from the rating agencies, maybe even the fixed-income community more broadly, and post the Analyst Day in terms of kind of not having plans for either doing equity or convertible securities in the next year or so in your base case.
Christopher M. Crane: Yes, we typically don't go into a lot of detail about the discussions of the agencies, but we haven't had any conversations around it. We continue to look at our models. We continue to look at our growth opportunities. We are very comfortable with cash from operations covering our operations requirements, including the dividend. And so if there is an equity, it would be off of a growth opportunity that we want to pursue, and to uncover the upside of that would cover the dilution of the equity issuance. But there hasn't been any real dialogue beyond what we had with you at the Analyst Day.
Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And a question on the New York power market, there's obviously a very important docket still open at the FERC regarding, really regarding Zone J capacity pricing, but it will have a ripple effect throughout all of New York. Can you just give your kind of point of view about the regulatory structure of the New York market, whether you have any concerns about the regulatory viability of kind of how that capacity market is working and just insights into the ongoing FERC docket?
Christopher M. Crane: We think the New York ISO is looking outward to try to find ways to improve that forward capacity market, and we do want to support that dialogue to how to stimulate the right kind of investment into the market. I think they've had that discussion looking forward, too. As far as the FERC filing issue...
Joseph Dominguez: Yes, Chris, I think I'd just echo your comments. What we see in New York is really no different than what we've seen in New England and PJM. There are MOPR issues in New York. There are issues regarding questions about state subsidizing, generation, and I think we're working through those in the FERC cases that have been ongoing, we saw the Astoria [ph] case that we were involved in getting decided last month. And I think there are continuing stakeholder discussions about how to handle capacity needs. The Governor obviously has a plan and that is a combination of transmission and new generation and we're taking a look at that. I don't see any imminent problems there. I think they're the same issues that we confront in other RTOs, and I think we're going to work through them.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ali Agha from SunTrust.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Just clarifying on the ComEd, assuming you do get the reversal and the rehearing, as I recall, that $0.10 pickup that you talked about, that would be an annual impact, right? That would also flow into '13, '14 looking forward as well? Is that the way to think about that?
Christopher M. Crane: There's a catch-up period that's annual to recover that.
Anne R. Pramaggiore: Yes. So the 3 issues that are on rehearing at the Commission, gains that $0.10 in 2012, they are $0.05 and $0.06 in 2013 and 2014, respectively. So that's basically how it works out. And then you just have a little bit of cleanup as we've got some issues that'll take to appeal that didn't get picked up on the rehearing to get us all the way back.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: I see. Okay. And the second question, Chris, I mean looking a little longer-term, you -- obviously, the -- you are the babies of the commodity cycle, but your capacity prices are pretty much set through mid '16. And you look at the forward curves, your cost of production, et cetera, when do you think you're in a position to be close to the earnings base that you earned back in '11, the north of $4 earnings base? When will this company have that kind of earnings power in your mind, looking at this combined company?
Christopher M. Crane: There are so many variables in and around that. We have to see the effects in the market of how gas stabilizes out. We have to look at what the effects are with the [indiscernible]. It would be pretty premature to pick that date right now. We continue to really focus on high reliability, solid investments, keeping a discipline on the expense, working hard to build the right rate base within the utilities and get the right return, focusing on a higher contribution on the dividend in the earnings from the utilities. So there's a lot of things in play. I couldn't pick 2016 we're back there, but it's -- there's work that we can do, and we are doing it, and then there's the market fundamentals that will drive a significant portion of that.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Fair enough. But standing where we are today looking forward, it's not -- I mean the next 3 years most likely won't get you there. Is that a fair way to think about it?
Christopher M. Crane: I wouldn't go there. I wouldn't go one way or the other. We don't project earnings in the outyears and there's a lot of fundamentals around that. We do have a ratable hedging that secures us, slowly blends in while perturbations of market adjustments. But there's -- I don't know if I'd hit that point yet.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Nathan Judge of Atlantic.
Nathan Judge - Atlantic Equities LLP: I just wanted to ask about Page 5, the kind of middle of the page, just Midwest, Mid-Atlantic wholesale was pared down in a low-price environment. Could you just elaborate on what you were going for in that bullet point?
Christopher M. Crane: Sorry, Nathan, I'm just -- I got it.
Kenneth W. Cornew: This is Ken. You're referring to the bullet point on slowing down our hedging, paring down our hedging in the Midwest and the Mid-Atlantic?
Nathan Judge - Atlantic Equities LLP: Yes. I guess more thematically, are you revisiting your overall decision on whether to ratably hedge or not?
Kenneth W. Cornew: No, we're remaining disciplined and we will stay within a relative band around ratable hedging. We got ahead of our ratable plans starting in the third and fourth quarter of last year, seeing the potential for gas price roll down. So we got ahead of our ratable plan and this statement just points to the fact that we slowed down our hedging in the second quarter. Hedged at a slower than ratable case but fall back to a ratable position at this point.
Nathan Judge - Atlantic Equities LLP: And could you just update us as to what kind of options are being deployed now as a percentage of the overall?
Kenneth W. Cornew: About 5% in 2013, 7% to 8% in 2014.
Nathan Judge - Atlantic Equities LLP: And are those electricity? Are those gas?
Kenneth W. Cornew: Mostly gas, but there are some electricity options there as well.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Angie Storozynski.
Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research: My questions have been asked and answered.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Kit Canote [ph].
Unknown Analyst: Most of my questions have been answered also. Just one related to potentially to the discussion of the MOPR issues. There was a hearing in federal court on the LCAPP appeal that public service and others are conducting. A, do you guys have a view on how that might turn out? And B, in your view, does it matter how that turns out ultimately? I mean are there -- if say, LCAPP were to be overturned and seen as unconstitutional, would that have a retroactive effect in any sense or an immediate impact? Or would that potentially just be a kind of a signal to states in the future not to subsidize power plants?
Christopher M. Crane: I think I'll let Bill answer the details. I think it's clearly messaged to states what are the fundamental principles around the market design and the laws and the rules around the market design. We don't think -- if people had won, and we know people have won capacity bids within the specific year, and they can't comply, there's ways to get out. There wouldn't be a restructuring of the auction. But you want to talk about our view overall?
William A. Von Hoene: Yes. Kit, this is Bill Von Hoene. The -- Kit, you know the court, as you referenced, the court heard arguments yesterday for about 3 hours. The court did not render a decision, nor indicate when it would. The results that are possible are summary judgment one way or another or have the matter go to trial, and we don't have an opinion at this point, a projection as to what the court's going to do. But as Chris referenced, the results if they were favorable to us would be largely perspective. And we do think they would be material for what will happen in other states that may otherwise have an inclination to do the subsidized generation.
Christopher M. Crane: There's many participants in the market today that are willing to invest for new generation. We're doing so in our Nuclear operates. There's others that are doing so with new iron in the ground. We continue to model and have been modeling when that would be a good opportunity for us for those type of developments. And what we're messaging with the other market participants, the more that's done to subsidize generation, the uncertainty in the market is created, and we have to pull back on investing capital. So that's good infrastructure not being built because jobs are not really coming in, and that's the company's view and that's why we're taking the position we are.
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Paul Patterson from Glenrock.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Just to follow-up quickly on James' MOPR question. It sounded like, if I -- and maybe I heard it wrong, that there might be a stakeholder consensus among the stakeholders with respect to this MOPR issue? A little unusual for stakeholders. It's hard for -- I'm just wondering, did I hear that correctly?
Christopher M. Crane: I think actually, James' question was if there is a stakeholder consensus, do we expect it to get through FERC, and my answer was yes. But I also said that there's a good bit of work to do to get a sufficient number of stakeholders on board with MOPR revisions. We're in process with that. I don't think anything we will come to will have universal support. We're going to try to get majority support for some changes, we're cautiously optimistic we're going to get there, and that's as much as we can say about the process at this point in time.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Okay, fine. Great. The second thing is, whether in the third quarter here, a little bit in the second quarter, really hot weather in PJM and we didn't see any peaks, any new peaks. And I was wondering if you could sort of comment on that. I mean is that a demand response issue? Is that because there were some storms? Just I mean -- or were there peaks that I just don't know about at ComEd or PECO or what have you in PJM?
Christopher M. Crane: No, there were no new peaks. I mean, there was some curtailments in, I think, at least 1 day, if not 2, in East and MACT or West Virginia, but it showed that the transmission investments are working, there is adequate generation and that the system was able to cover the load. Denis, anything else?
Denis P. O'Brien: Yes, we'd have to do the math on it, but I think if you looked at the demand side response programs and added them to the peaks that each of the company's had, they would've had a new peak relative to past performance. So I think demand response is playing a role in eliminating higher peaks.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Do you think that might have something to do with the energy tariff now with demand response that was recently implemented at PJM? You know what I'm talking about. In other words, there's suppose -- the capacity market, there's the new pricing mechanism for realtime for the energy market that demand response can now get.
Kenneth W. Cornew: No, Paul, it's Ken. The demand response was called for emergency situations. And on July 17 and 18, really, speaking of the -- that full LMP concept was not in place at the time. This demand was last committed to the capacity market so that kind of -- the demand response was called for reliability reasons in the East as Chris indicated.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Okay. And then just finally, great disclosure, it was very useful. But I did notice that the BGE load slide, you had it for PECO, you had it for ComEd, and you had the BGE one for the Analyst Meeting, but I didn't see it in this one. Is there any update in terms of what you're weather adjusted demand growth looks like in that?
Christopher M. Crane: We hadn't put that in since BGE's decoupled. It really is just a pass-through. I don't know if you want to discuss your load anymore, Ken, but the...
Kenneth W. Cornew: The forecast for the end of the year is weather adjusted down 6/10 of 1%, about in line with what PECO and ComEd are showing.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Okay. And that's just basically what you've seen -- the reason why they've decreased from last time is because of just what the results have been? Is that pretty much what you're extrapolating? Is this the second quarter came in and that's why?
Kenneth W. Cornew: I Yes, I think that's correct. It's just an update based on the earlier parts of the year.
Christopher M. Crane: Okay. Thank you. And thank you again for your time today. We look forward to seeing many of you in the near future. I know we have many sessions where we'll be going out. In closing, again, this quarter, the Exelon companies have demonstrated its commitment to operation and financial results. We do maintain a disciplined approach to investing in the future, paying close attention to the market conditions and the policy decisions that have meaningful impacts to our business. I am excited about the opportunities that our unique platform brings, both through our existing operations, as well as towards our sustainable growth plans. I'm very proud of the progress that we made with the merger and more importantly, extremely grateful for the commitment and the dedication shown by everybody to remain focused on delivering the operational and financial goals as we advance through the transition. Our unique platform creates the opportunities, as I've said, for both the existing operations and for the future operations. And with that, thanks for attending.
JaCee Burns: Thank you, Stephanie.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Cassandra, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the fourth quarter earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions] And now I would like to turn the call over to Stacie Frank, VP of Investor Relations. You may begin.
Stacie M. Frank: Thank you, Cassandra, and good morning. Welcome to Exelon's Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. We issued our earnings release this morning. If you haven't received it, the release is available on the Exelon website. The earnings release and other matters we will discuss in today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties, as well as adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings. Please refer to today's 8-K and Exelon's other filings for a discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts and expectations and for a reconciliation of operating to GAAP earnings. In addition, during the call today, we will be discussing the proposed merger of Exelon and Constellation Energy Group, Inc. Today's discussion is not a substitute for the disclosures in the definitive joint proxy statement and prospectus that was mailed to shareholders on or about October 12, 2011. For important additional information regarding the proposed merger, including the associated risks and uncertainties, please refer to the earnings release and today's 8-K, as well as the definitive joint proxy statement. Presenting on our call today are John Rowe, Exelon's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Matthew Hilzinger, Exelon's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Ken Cornew, Exelon's Senior Vice President and President of Exelon Power team. They are joined by Chris Crane, Exelon's Chief Operating Officer and other members of Exelon senior management team who will be available to answer your questions.  I will now turn the call over to John Rowe, Exelon's CEO.
John W. Rowe: Good morning, everybody. It's always a shame to waste someone as talented as Stacie reading the Safe Harbor language, but the lawyers keep saying, she has to do it.  2011 was another fine year for Exelon. We had very strong financial and operating performance; we grew the company through acquisitions, which are working on both on an earnings and cash flow basis; we made progress on a range of regulatory, legislative and market issues; and we are getting ever closer to consummating our merger with Constellation. Our fourth quarter operating earnings were $0.82 per share. While December was a little disappointing due mostly to weather, our full year 2011 operating earnings per share of $4.16 were within our final guidance range, better than our 2010 results and well above our original expectations for the year. Our leading drivers in '11 were the strong performance of the generation fleet, led, of course, by our ninth consecutive year of over 93% capacity factors in nuclear that's helped significantly by our Texas operations. Tax benefits helped us a great deal. The impact of the Illinois Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act was positive, as was our summer weather. The good news was partially offset by costly storms at both ComEd and PECO and lower than weather-normalized load at PECO. ComEd had a terrible July storm wise, which we soaked up successfully, and PECO had both a hurricane and a freak fall snowstorm.  Matt will review the quarter-over-quarter and full year financial drivers in more detail. As you know, we made a $2.1 billion contribution to the pension at the beginning of the year, which along with Doug Brown's fine work on asset allocation, allowed us to end the year at 83% funded status. And remember, this is with very low discount rates. The contribution gives us added cushion in our FFO-to-debt credit metrics and will help us see the company through the current trough and power crisis.  We returned $1.4 billion to our shareholders in dividends. We are keenly aware that to all of you, the dividend is an absolutely critical part of our value proposition. It's what makes it possible for you to hold on with us while we work our way through the gas and power price trough. Our cash flows and credit metrics support our dividend and capital programs even as we accept a higher payout ratio. Chris Crane, who will answer most of the questions today about future performance, believes, as I do, in the continued importance to the dividend. Simply put, we get it. And he is as committed as I am to maintaining it. As we have mentioned previously, given our pending merger with Constellation, we are not providing full year Exelon stand-alone guidance for 2012 on today's call. We will provide combined company guidance at an analyst day that we expect to hold after -- in the spring after the merger closes. Turning to our operating results, I simply have to recognize Chip Pardee, Mike Pacilio, Susan Landahl and their team for Nuclear's fine year. Their capacity factor was 93.3% for 2011. As I said earlier, that is the ninth consecutive year they have beaten 93%. This is just a tremendous performance. They continue to renew their commitment. They continue to sharpen their edge. We are very, very proud of what our nuclear folks are doing. Exelon continues to be a leader in U.S. nuclear operations as we must be.  Both ComEd and PECO faced significant storms in 2011. PECO's response to very large storms was absolutely best I've ever seen and far better than most of the other Northeastern utilities, many of which found themselves in more than a little trouble. Despite its summer storms, ComEd's outage frequency statistics were the best on record. Both delivery companies keep getting better. Our power fleet in Texas, led by Chip Pardee and Sonny Garg, was very helpful to our earnings in both the first and the third quarters. Beyond the merger with Constellation, which is, of course, our major strategic endeavor, and I will cover a little later, we added significantly to our generation fleet in 2011. Our Exelon Wind business and the addition of the Wolf Hollow combined-cycle gas turbine in ERCOT added more than $40 million in earnings in 2011. Exelon Nuclear added 138 megawatts of clean and profitable energy to our power upgrade program in 2011. In September, we added 230 megawatts of solar generation to our clean energy development pipeline with the acquisition of Antelope Valley Solar Ranch, to be funded in part through a DOE loan guarantee and backed by long-term power purchase agreement. The project will come online in phases this year and next, enabling us to realize investment tax credits and recover our investment by 2015. As we work on these renewable investments and related generation, we are being very careful to make certain we engage in investments that protect our credit ratings and improve our near-term cash flows. Separately, Exelon Generation made investments in several transmission projects. We are seeing reduced congestion as a result around our Midwest nuclear plants as a result of these projects. They're a very good example of small things that have very positive leverage in terms of our value. As you all know, 2011 was a very active year in the regulatory and legislative arena. PECO fully transitioned to market rates at the beginning of the year and continues to pursue its investment in smart meters. ComEd received a rate case order in May and worked on passage of its infrastructure legislation. The latter allows ComEd to implement a formula rate and will spur significant infrastructure investment in the electric grid, including over $230 million in 2012.  Exelon, through Joe Dominguez, was a key player in the successful initiative to open the Ohio market to competition. FERC approved a formula rate filing for the so-called RITE line. We are closely monitoring the NRC's response to the Fukushima event. So far, the NRC has taken a thoughtful and measured approach to responding to this, and our nuclear organization is actively engaged in applying the lessons learned. EPA issued its final Air Toxics Rule in December, which will lead to the retirement of the older and more inefficient coal plants. The final rule is largely as we expected and provides flexibility in the time line for those plants that will be working to comply. And from Exelon's point of view, the key thing is that people shut down those plants they intend to shut down. We expect that the toxics rule will be implemented on time beginning in 2015. Unfortunately, the D.C. Court of Appeals granted a stay on the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule, which was supposed to go into effect on January 1. Our lawyers have reviewed it. We believe the EPA was within its authority, and the court will ultimately uphold the rule in large part. But although the stay is a setback, we believe that the Air Toxics Rule is the more important one in terms of driving plant retirements. We do not believe the stay will have a significant effect on the number of coal plant retirements to take place. And so far, what we're seeing is consistent with our expectations. Ken Cornew will address that more later. Now it's fitting given the gas markets that our operator today is named Cassandra, because there hasn't been a whole lot of good news in the gas markets lately, so we have a cheerful fellow, named Cornew, to talk about it. It is no secret that our prices have declined since our last earnings call and that natural gas prices are the key driver. Spot natural gas prices have fallen more than 15% since the beginning of the year, partly due to the continued news about shale gas development, but also very much due to the mild temperatures that we have seen so far this winter.  Energy prices have followed gas prices even more closely than usual and have reacted negatively to the stay of the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule in late December. Thus, we have given back the gains we saw in July when the rule was finalized. Power Team continues to believe that the reaction to the gas prices and the stay is overdone, and we expect some near-term price recovery. Ken will talk about all of this in more detail in a few minutes and will also address how we're responding to the situation.  Our merger with Constellation remains on track to close in the first quarter. We have received several more of the required approvals for the transaction, in particularly the all-important DOJ review, and we await final approvals by Maryland, the SC, the NRC and FERC. In Maryland, we were, of course, extremely pleased to have settled with a number of major parties to the case, including the Governor -- very much including the Governor, and we have now a schedule for final order from the PSC on February 17. We have asked the FERC to issue their final ruling early this year and remain hopeful that they will provide their final decision in the same time frame as the Maryland Commission. We will close the merger shortly after receiving all of the regulatory approvals. Now just before I turn this over to Matt, 2011 was really a very good year for Exelon. Every part of the company contributed to making it a good year. And while we don't like the current state of the power markets at all, I am absolutely convinced that we will find ways to keep beating what the computer says this all means.  And with that, I'll turn it over to Matt.
Matthew F. Hilzinger: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I will review a few details for the fourth quarter and full year operating results and provide some information to what lies ahead. The press release issued this morning and today's slide presentation includes a significant amount of information regarding this quarter's results. We'll start by highlighting a few key items shown on Slide 7.  Exelon closed out 2011 by delivering fourth quarter operating earnings of $0.82 per share and $4.16 per share for the full year, which includes $0.07 of unfavorable weather versus the prior year. We are pleased with our 2011 financial and operating performance and, as John discussed, our operating companies contributed significantly to these results. Moving to Slide 8, Generation contributed $0.54 per share to the fourth quarter operating results and $3.01 per share for the year. Generation's fourth quarter results reflect favorable market conditions of $0.06 per share, which is primarily driven by net favorability for the mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions and hydro production.  Now moving to ComEd on Slide 9, ComEd delivered operating earnings of $0.18 per share in the fourth quarter and $0.61 per share for the full year, resulting in an annual earned ROE of 9.3%. ComEd's fourth quarter results included $0.06 per share benefit for the revenue requirement reconciliation and the establishment of a regulatory asset for storm costs related to the implementation of the Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act passed earlier this fall. The infrastructure legislation provides a reliable mechanism for the recovery of the $2.6 billion capital expenditures ComEd will make to modernize and upgrade the system over the next 10 years beginning in 2012.  As required by the legislation, the Illinois Power Agency will conduct a procurement auction in February of this year for around-the-clock energy contracts for June 2013 to December 2017. The bids are due on February 10, and the Illinois Commerce Commission decision is scheduled for February 17. Moving to PECO on Slide 10, PECO contributed $0.11 per share to the consolidated fourth quarter operating results and $0.58 per share for the year, resulting in an annual rate-making ROE of approximately 11%. The PECO region encountered its share of weather-related challenges in 2011, including Hurricane Irene in the third quarter and the surprise snowstorm in late October. PECO's fourth quarter results were impacted by 20% fewer-than-normal heating degree days as a result of the unseasonably warm temperatures. In total, unfavorable weather cost PECO $0.05 per share for the year versus the prior year. With respect to load, ComEd and PECO's load trends details are included on -- in the appendix of today's presentation. For 2011, ComEd's total weather-normal load declined by 0.5% compared to 2010, in line with our third quarter projection. PECO's weather-normal total load declined by 0.9% for the year versus the projected 0.5% decline.  In 2012, ComEd expects total load to be similar to 2011 results, with only a small decline of 0.2% on a weather-normal basis. This is not a surprising projection given that many of the economic forecasts that impacts ComEd's load are expected to mimic 2011, including gross metro product, unemployment, housing starts and energy efficiency expansion.  For PECO, as a result of the ramp down of the 2 oil refineries and the third expected by July 2012, plus weak economic conditions and energy efficiency programs, total electric deliveries are expected to decline by 5.4% compared to 2011 weather-normal results. Absent the oil refinery impacts, PECO's 2012 load forecast would only be down approximately 1.8% compared to 2011. On Slide 11, you can see that we generated approximately $5 billion of cash from operations for 2011. ExGen HoCo's credit ratings are strong, ending the year with FFO-to-debt ratio of 52%, well above our target range of 30% to 35%.  With respect to our merger with Constellation, we have concluded our post-merger legal structure and now plan to merge Constellation Energy Company into Exelon Corporation, and then transfer all of the Constellation Energy Company subsidiaries, excluding BGE, to Exelon Generation. Constellation Energy Company's existing debt will be assumed by Exelon Corp. and BGE will continue to exist as a separate subsidiary under Exelon. We expect to execute the structure reorganization immediately following the closing of the merger, and both companies have received the necessary bank consents to proceed. As John mentioned, given the status of the merger, we will defer providing earnings guidance for 2012 until after we close. At our Analyst Day, we will provide consolidated earnings guidance for 2012, including our expected pension expense and contributions, and we will discuss the combined companies' strategic business objectives going forward.  Before we open the call for questions, I'd like to turn it over to Ken Cornew for the discussion on power markets and hedging.
Kenneth W. Cornew: Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I just -- I'd like to say, it's always a better morning these days when natural gas futures are up a little bit and for the past few days, they have been. So again, good morning. As John mentioned, I want to spend a few minutes this morning going over what we've witnessed recently in the gas and power markets, and let me start with the gas market.  Natural gas prices have continued to move lower on strong production and an unprecedented lack of winter weather. Weak estimated [ph] growth and general bearishness on economic growth are adding to the downward pressure. These factors are resulting in significant gas storage inventories that would persist with continued mild weather, which would be a drag on gas prices through 2012 and potentially into 2013.  Between September 30, 2011 and the end of the year, 2013 and '14 natural gas prices dropped by approximately $0.80. And as John mentioned, over the first 3 weeks of the year, prices have fallen almost another $0.30 and prompt month gas has hit levels last seen in January 2002. Longer term, in the 2014 and 2016 time period, we expect natural gas prices in the $4 to $6 range, which we believe is supported by the long-run margin on cost of production. This will be dependent on reasonable levels of gas demand growth, some of which we expect to come from coal plant retirements and the expected resulting increase in natural gas generation as a replacement source of power. Producer discipline will need to be a key part of the longer-term response to lower gas prices. We saw one announcement earlier this week of a shift from dry gas to more liquids-rich plays, and we would expect that will continue.  What's been more surprising to us over the last several weeks is the over response to these lower gas prices in the power markets. We continue to believe that the Mercury and Air Toxic Standards or MATS will have a significant impact on coal generation economics, causing the retirement of old inefficient and unscrubbed plants. We've updated our modeling of MATS to reflect both the recent drop in gas prices and the finalized rule and believe its impact on power prices into 2015 time frame to be in the $3 to $5 range at West Hub and NiHub. This price impact is due to a combination of coal retirements and their effect on the existing generation stack, as well as higher dispatch cost for newly retrofitted units.  Given the recent decrease in market power prices, our modeling is suggesting that little to no impact of MATS is priced into the current NiHub and West Hub market prices. While we expect power prices to decrease -- and let me explain why. While we expect power prices to decrease under a falling gas environment, we would actually expect heat rates to expand and not fall. For example, looking back to September 30 prices, we felt that the market was incorporating a significant portion of the mass regulations. NiHub's 2016 market prices was approximately $44 a megawatt hour, and gas was at $5.60 in MMbtu, implying a market heat rate of 7.8.  As of January 4, gas prices had fallen to $4.90. Our internal modeling, which reflects mass regulations, suggest that heat rates should have increased to approximately 8.5. However, actual power prices were close to $36, implying a market heat rate of under 7.5. This reduced heat rate indicates that the market is currently undervalued by at least $5 a megawatt.  Some of the weakness in the forward heat rates could be attributed to a potential lack of liquidity, the stay of Cross-State Air Pollutant Rule and early selling pressure. I should point out that this assessment changes every day based on movements in gas and power prices. So how are we responding?  First, it's important to note that our ratable hedging strategy has largely inflated us from the effects in 2012. We started to hedge 2012 when PJM prices were significantly higher. We entered the year over 90% hedged in PJM for 2012, limiting the impact on our revenue net fuel in the near term.  For 2013, as indicated in the December 31 hedge disclosure, we were near ratable hedge levels of 61% to 64%. Going forward, we expect to remain near our ratable hedging level. We have kept considerable length in the south portfolio in both 2012 and 2013 based on tightening reserve margins in the ERCOT market and attractive spot spreads in the on-peak hours, which we can capture with our peaking generation capacity in that market as we did in 2011. In 2014 and '15, we still have a significant open position. We ultimately expect energy prices to adjust to fully reflect the benefits of environmental regulations. In the meantime, we are using more put options, which with a decline in market prices could take us above our ratable hedge levels. This will continue to protect us from further moves down in gas price, while still leaving upside for power prices to return to levels more in line with our fundamental views.  As of now, our hedge percentages for 2013 and '14 include approximately 7% and 10% from put options, respectively. While we continue to remain disciplined in our hedging approach, we will also continue to be strategic in order to take advantage of upside in the market based on our fundamental views. We will accomplish this for use of put options, participation in various utility solicitations, leveraging our retail channel and carefully choosing the location of our sales.  This concludes our formal remarks. Operator, we're now ready to take some questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon.
Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: So obviously, we -- just to be clear, the open and hedged gross margins that you guys have laid out for us in your deck are from year-end, but pricing has continued to decline during the first 3 weeks of January, so we should be cognizant that on a sort of true mark, the open gross margins would be a bit lower. Is that accurate?
Kenneth W. Cornew: That's correct, Greg.
Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: And then I'm actually intrigued by your commentary on the heat rate phenomenon. Are you just seeing a lack of liquidity out the curve that might be related to sort of a change in dynamics because there's just fewer hedge funds, fewer big investment banks that are transacting in those markets, or are there other dynamics at play?
Kenneth W. Cornew: That's very well possible. I think -- now in looking at what's happened in January, we saw a significant decline in forward heat rates in the first week, week and a half of January. And then we did see a rebound in those heat rates at some level back to better levels but still not where we would expect them to be. I think liquidity is an issue, particularly in the out years. I believe there is -- there was some significant selling going on with -- the fear is that the gas market was going to continue to decline. I do think the stay of the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule had an immediate impact on forward power prices. So when you lump all these things together, you saw a lot of bearish sentiment in the market. Although some of that has recovered in the past week or so, I still see when I study spot market prices, spot market heat rates, when we look at our modeling, as I described in my commentary, I still see upside -- significant upside in the -- in heat rates based on the real fundamental factors that should be driving the market.
Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: And what's the importance -- does the importance of having a broadening retail channel sort of increase in this type of environment, or is it -- are retail pricing channels also coming under pressure with dramatic decline in gas?
Kenneth W. Cornew: Greg, obviously, retail pricing follows, at some level, wholesale pricing. So it's not the answer to the price decline, but the retail channel is a channel that allows for incremental margin. It is a channel that allows for you not to transact in the standard or over-the-counter product markets and with the liquidity commentary you and I both have just brought up, it's always positive to have other channels to transact in cellular power besides over-the-counter markets and standard trading ones.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jay Dobson.
James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division: Ken, just finishing up on that, so you'd suggest there'd be higher margins in the retail business than we see in the broader market, understanding that the retail and the wholesale are going to track one another. Just wanted to finish up on that last thought.
Kenneth W. Cornew: Okay, on retail margins, we have seen retail margins be cyclical and inversely correlated to price in natural gas cycles. However, there are a couple of comments to that. The market has not really been very cyclical in the last couple of years, and has been steadily declining. That competitive environment on the retail side, particularly in new markets, like Pennsylvania, where you do have many, many players looking for market share, has put pressure on margins. That being said, our -- in our business, we're seeing relatively stable margins in the areas where we're transacting.
John W. Rowe: Let me -- this is John. Let me try to flesh out what Ken just said because I think it's important. One of the reasons, there were many that you've all heard, but one of the reasons Exelon was interested in acquiring Constellation is that in general, the margin, if you go all the way to the retail customer, is somewhat larger than it is just selling into the wholesale market. And indeed, Constellation has been successful in securing quite attractive margins on regular basis. Now what Ken is trying to say is that when wholesale prices rise, retail margins tend to shrink a little. But when wholesale margins fall, it goes in the same direction, but there's a lag, and the retail margins get a little bit larger. I think I said that accurately, didn't I, Ken?
Kenneth W. Cornew: You did, John.
John W. Rowe: And that's part of why we want this whole retail market channel.
James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division: No, that's very helpful, Ken and John. I appreciate that. And then John, I'll let you direct to the question, but capital spending -- I appreciate Ken's comments on fundamental views around power prices, but certainly, gas prices are going to make some of these uprates certainly out in the '14, '15 time frame look a little less economic. So just wondering how you're thinking about CapEx over the next 3 to 5 years. And I isolate this on a stand-alone basis, obviously.
John W. Rowe: Let me open the can and then defer this to Chris, who's the one who's going to have the responsibility to make the ultimate reality here. Of course, we're reassessing capital programs. How we look at them is different depending on where we look at them. For example, at ComEd, with the new Illinois Act, we are going to get stable returns on increasing capital expenditures. When it comes to the nuclear uprates, we're going to take a fresh and hard-boiled look at that them as we do every 6 months. And we'll obviously take our most recent views of gas and power markets into account. When it comes to like Exelon Wind, well, if the contract is good enough with a counterparty that's good enough, that has even different capital implications. So Chris is going to be going through the whole capital program with this kind of attitude in mind. And with that, let me let Chris expand upon it because he's the one who's got to do it, and he's the one that you got to rely on for making this all work in a way that protects your dividend.
Christopher M. Crane: Yes. I agree with everything that John said. In starting with the balance sheet, we main -- have maintained a strong balance sheet that gives us the room to weather these cycles, ending 2011 at over 50% FFO to debt gives us that room continuing to stress the balance sheet and analyze these capital projects that will continue. As we see them now, the uprates, and those are the ones that get closest to the bubble, we'll have to watch closely and we do. We'll continue -- well, we've got time between now and 2015. And the beauty of these projects is the ability to stop, slow -- stop or slow or accelerate as we see and not be stuck with a lot of -- some capital that makes us finish a project that may become uneconomic. So we feel good about them. And we feel there's a lot of time through 2012 to continue to analyze and look at the market. We see the trend, but we've got to understand the trend and the sustainability of the trend. And we'll -- as I said, we have time and room to make the decisions through '12 and into '13 on how we continue to support '15 and beyond.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Chin.
Brian Chin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Just piggybacking off Jay's question. Could you remind us again what you've said in the past about to what extent the nuclear uprates have some degree of flexibility? If I recall right, there's some portion of those uprates that are a little bit more requisite than others. So just a little bit of update on clarity on that would be helpful.
John W. Rowe: Well, there were basically 3 parts to the nuclear uprate program, and 2 of the 3 parts were relatively low capital with relatively high returns. And now the ones that are left are the bigger capital requirements and the tougher decisions. Chris, why don't you pick up.
Christopher M. Crane: Yes. The first bucket was measurement uncertainty. It's a calibration method, allows us to get a few percent out of multiple units. The second bucket was on component replacement with new engineer standards, turbines, generators, more efficiency, and those projects are halfway through and are needed for plant life extension, but they also pay for themselves nicely with the returns on the more efficient components. And the third and the final bucket is most costly are the EPUs, the extended power uprates. They're at 3 facilities, LaSalle, in Illinois, Peach Bottom and Limerick. We continue to watch those closely. We have the Peach Bottom project proceeding on. We're in the early stages of the Limerick and the LaSalle project. We continue to watch them closely. They still have a positive -- they still meet the positive hurdle rates that we require them to. But the optionality around those, if we see the NiHub market can't support, for instance, we could stop the LaSalle project without any ramifications on maybe a stronger market in PJM West Hub or the East for Peach and Limerick. So that kinds of describes the optionality.
John W. Rowe: I think the important thing for you all to remember is, we probably have that optionality for another 9 months or a year. There comes a point when you have to either do these things or not do them. And Mike Pacilio was talking to Chris and I the other day, what he said was no news to Chris, but it was probably a good reminder for me, which is, "Don't just dither with these things and put them off." That doesn't work very well with large nuclear projects. So it's very important that we get very conservative, very hard-headed and reanalysis done over the next several quarters and make the right decision for you.
Brian Chin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: One follow up to that. That third bucket, the EPUs, is that roughly about 1/3 of the nuclear uprate in spending that we should see, so that way, we have some way of quantifying to what extent you've got flexibility on that, or is that not a reasonable assumption?
Christopher M. Crane: Yes. I think it was slightly more than 1/3. They're putting it in front of me now. So the EPU total was $2.5 million, if I've got this right, out of almost a $4 million project -- billion, excuse me, billion, out of a 4 project. So it's over 1/2 of the spend. It was a more significant portion of the spend. And I think we've disclosed that a couple times before, and we'll make sure we put it in our update to you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman.
Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Just before my question, I just wanted to -- I guess this might be your last earnings call, so we're going to miss your many metaphors.
John W. Rowe: Maybe my bottom lines, too.
Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I don't know if there's a real direct way to answer this question, but is there a gas price in your heads whereby it's harder to be so strong on just the ability to get through this period to get to MATS in terms of security of the dividend and credit?
John W. Rowe: Well, the answer is no, but that's only half an answer. Of course, the other half is yes. The answer is no because it's not just a matter of gas price. It's a matter of gas price and how long it lasts. It's the amount of time it takes to get through. And so, obviously, the first things we do are things like reanalyzing the power uprates. The next thing Chris is going to do is hunt for ways consistent with all our commitments in places like Maryland to cut costs. And we're going to deliver the merger synergies we promised you. We're going to do all those things, and that buys us a fairly substantial amount of space. But $2.40 gas isn't jolly. If you're really going to project that for 10 years, we've got a problem here. So Chris, you or Ken want to pick up on Steve's question? I mean, I don't think there is a number, Steve, but there is a mixer -- a mix of numbers and time. I'm pretty sure that Chris has got several years to work with this, and he's going to be working very hard to make certain that we keep the dividend and the coverages. Chris, Matt, do you want to add to that? This is what it's all about.
Christopher M. Crane: No. That's well stated. We've got time. We don't think these prices are sustainable. But if, for some reason, they are, we have time to make adjustments as required, and we're as committed to the dividend as ever, and it will never be a surprise to you. So the way we look at it, if we're in trouble, we're the lowest cost in the stack. Where is everybody else and how is this sustainable? So with the hedging, with room in the balance sheet, we have time and we'll prudently go through it. And you won't be surprised if something ever happens.
John W. Rowe: I told you in one of my metaphors, Steve, that we were the hyena looking for the dead stuff on the road. There's going to be an awful lot for Chris to eat if we see these low gas prices continuing.
Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. One other quick question. Just -- since I think your last call, we got the final MATS rule and we also -- PJM, I guess, came out at least with their demand forecasts for the next RPM. Any more color on kind of general direction of RPM based on the updates we've seen?
John W. Rowe: Ken or Joe, 1 of the 2 of you.
Kenneth W. Cornew: Yes, Steve, on the next auction, obviously, there are a lot of moving parts to this auction. Some decline in demand, which would have some downward pressure on price, but several other elements that would have, I think, upward pressure on price. We have some net CONE and gross CONE changes that should be positive. We do have an ECR calculation concept in which coal plants will have higher ECRs year-over-year. But what really is, in my mind, going to drive this next auction is how DR, and particularly unlimited DR prices itself in the next auction. With tightening fundamentals, I would expect unlimited DR, if it clears in the auction to be utilized in this stack. So that's a big component. But all in all, I'm -- I feel positive about an uptick in the auction. But clearly, there are a lot of variables still in play that we need to ferret out.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Hugh Wynne.
Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: I think I'll keep my questions for sidebar conversation with Stacie and I'd just like to do something I don't usually do, which is to throw out a compliment. Looking at your Slide 15 here, and there's one thing you don't mention, which I think is very important. In my experience, Exelon has increasingly stood out from its peers at a time of more aggressive in-your-face earnings manipulation towards your justifications for earnings growth estimates that now are clearly out of date. You, by contrast, have provided, on a consistent basis, numbers that I have found to be trustworthy earnings estimates that generally were conservative and a very transparent look at the future trajectory of earnings. So I just wanted to 2 compliment you on that. I think it causes your financial group to stand out relative to others, and I hope that Chris and Matt and Stacie will preserve that very fine tradition. So thanks for that, and that's really the end of my comment.
John W. Rowe: We're just a pack of pilgrims, and we want to keep your confidence as we march around in our grand black and white and gray outfits.
Stacie M. Frank: All right. I think that's a perfect opportunity and perfect segue to turn the call back over to John for some closing remarks.
John W. Rowe: Well, I am going to talk about Slide 15. Stacie, thank you. As Steve Fleishman suggested, this I expect to be my last earnings call as CEO. And that's after 28 years of trying to be useful to all of you and to customers, all the way from little Skowhegan in Maine to here in Chicago. Obviously, I'm absolutely delighted to be able to end a very long career with what I hope and expect to be the completion of the Constellation acquisition. Exelon is a great company, and with Constellation and with Chris' leadership, it's going to be an even greater company. The only thing that could make me happier would be if power prices and earnings forecasts were back where they were in '07 and '08. That would make me happier because it would make you happier and make all of us richer. And that's the objective I've had in mind for all 28 years. But even though these aren't the best of times for Exelon, I'm still very proud that we have run this for our investors, and we've tried to do what Hugh Wynne suggested and give you straight numbers as soon as we know what they might be. And as I look at the situation, yes, I loved it when Exelon was 40% bigger than Southern, and I don't like seeing Southern and Duke and Dominion having more market cap than us right now. But the point I would like to make is before we regulate it, integrates are on the top of the curve, and we're right now in the trench. Things in '08 were too good for us to be true forever. Things right now won't be forever either. And while you wait for better times to come at Exelon, you can know that Chris will be working like hell to beat the computer projections. You know that we have as good a management team to do that as anybody in the industry, and you know that we have a very good dividend to sustain you in the meanwhile. But I did ask my colleagues to go back and try to come up with one capsule of what we have done for you during my years with ComEd and Exelon. And during my tenure, your TSR was 295%, that's more than 10% compounded through last week. And that beats both the S&P 500, which was only 4% for that period compounded, and the utility index has a little over 7% for the same period. And I say that when we're in the trough. Exelon will be back, I have a high level of confidence, and the people around me are those who will make it so. As Chart 15 suggests, there are a bunch of things that I am very, very proud of, none of which I did all by myself, some of which I made a large contribution to, some of which I mostly stayed out of the way for. But those include the merger that created Exelon and the one we're now doing with Constellation. It includes the sale of ComEd's fossil plants and putting Generation into a separate market-based business. It improves -- includes solving the reliability problems at ComEd, and we're going to help bring better service to Baltimore, too. It includes keeping our word in Pennsylvania when we did the merger there. I had a leading Pennsylvania public official say, "You're almost the only people who ever kept all their commitments in the acquiring jurisdiction." That's really important because in this business, they always know where to find you. I'm giving everyone Chris' home number, and he is very grateful. And if you don't keep the commitments, you don't have a very good field to play on for the next time. And one of the reasons we have been successful with Governor O'Malley in working out a deal is that people like Governor Rendell and Mayor Daley said, "When these guys give their word, they keep it." And it's very important, and we will keep our word in Maryland just like we have in Pennsylvania and in Illinois, and just like we have for you. I devoutly wish that I could leave you at a time when we have a higher stock price, but we have kept our words. We have focused entirely on what is good for our investors, and we have delivered over a very long time. We shall do so again. Thank you very much.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Cassandra, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Exelon Third Quarter Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] And now I would like to turn the call over to Stacie Frank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Stacie, you may begin.
Stacie M. Frank: Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to Exelon's third quarter 2011 earnings conference call. We issued our earnings release this morning. And if you haven't received it, the release is available on the Exelon website. The earnings release and other matters we will discuss in today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties, as well as adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings. Please refer to today's 8-K and Exelon's other filings for a discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts and expectations and for a reconciliation of operating to GAAP earnings. In addition, during the call, we will be discussing the proposed merger of Exelon and Constellation Energy. Today's discussion is not a substitute for disclosures in the definitive joint proxy statement that was mailed to shareholders on or about October 12. For important additional information regarding our proposed merger, including the associated risks and uncertainties, please refer to the earnings release in today's 8-K, as well as the definitive joint proxy statement prospectus. Leading the call today are John Rowe, Exelon's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Matthew Hilzinger, Exelon's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by several other members of Exelon's senior management team, who will be available to answer your questions. And we'll now turn the call over to John Rowe, Exelon's CEO.
John W. Rowe: Thank you, Stacie. Our operating earnings of $1.12 beat our own expectations in the upper end of the range by a couple of cents and beat your consensus by $0.03. We are very proud of having achieved that because in the third quarter, we were haunted by intense storms. As you all know, we had a hurricane in the East and we had one month with the most severe repetitive storms that I have ever seen at ComEd. Matt will discuss the storm costs and restoration performance in most -- in more detail. But just let me say that at ComEd, Frank and Anne's ability to get the troops out again and again, to get extra troops in to deal with repetitive storms was really remarkable. And the preparation that Denis O'Brien and Craig did for the hurricane was really exceptional. PECO was one of the first utilities to have all of its customers back and did it with absolutely seamless public relations. So it was a tremendous performance.  Our nuclear organization continues to expand [ph] at world class levels. We have a capacity factor 95.8% in the third quarter. Now the standout driver, the thing that made our ability to recover all of those storm costs in the same quarter was our strong performance in Texas. Due to the extreme heat, tired men [ph] , we had on peak crisis in the ERCOT north zone of $107 per megawatt hour. We had some hours as high as $3,000 per megawatt hour. Our units generated 2.4 million-megawatt hours of electricity, which was an increase of 20% over last year.  Higher prices in the spot and the day-ahead markets, and the open generation link in our portfolio enabled us to gain about $0.10 per share in the third quarter from our Texas operations. Congratulations for this are due to Ken Cornew and his power team, for how they managed the open position, and to Chip Pardee and Sonny Garg for making the units perform when we needed them. This was just a good do-story for Exelon and it shows how different pieces of our system can contribute when they're really needed.  Based on our performance to date, we are reaffirming our 2011 full year earnings range of $4.05 to $4.25. But then[ph] Frank has allowed me to say we expect to be comfortably in that range, I would say, "Damned comfortably within that range." Matt will cover our financial performance in more detail in a few minutes but let me first give an update on the Constellation merger, our Solar acquisition and what's going on at EPA.  So far, all of the formal benchmarks are on track for an early first quarter close of the merger. We have mailed our proxies and scheduled our shareholder meeting for November 17. We appreciate the support of the transaction that we have received from so many of you and the earlier you cast your votes in support of it, the more momentum we will have. Our regulatory approvals are progressing nicely. We've made progress at both FERC and DOJ, and with the PJM market monitor. The key proceeding remains the Maryland utility commission approval and our negotiations with the governor's office in Maryland.  In order to address the concerns raised by the PJM market monitor, we filed a settlement agreement committing not to sell the plants we agreed to the best to other significant market participants in PJM. We don't think those people's own lawyers would have let them bid anyway but we don't believe this concession comes with a significant cost. We are very pleased that we have everything worked out with the market monitor. This is one of those benchmarks we've been looking at to make certain that we don't have the problems we had in New Jersey 5 years ago. We have received word from Massachusetts that no further approval is required. We expect an order from the New York commission next month and in Maryland, hearings before the PSC begin next week. We have made a number of additional commitments in our rebuttal testimony and we have refused to make some of the commitments which we have been asked to do. We are very happy to have a live negotiation with Maryland officials. We're not going to give away the real value in this transaction. We believe we can make this work for you, our shareholders, and for the customers in Maryland and we're hard at work convincing folks in Maryland that that is so.  Turning to the Solar acquisition, we announced that we had acquired Antelope Valley Solar Ranch One from First Solar. This is a 230-megawatt utility scale installation in Southern California. It will be fully operational by 2013 and then we have a 25-year PPA with PG&E for 100% of the output. DOE has provided the loan guarantee for $646 million of the total $1.36 billion investment. We are taking investment tax credits on the project and we'll also get a little bonus appreciation for assets placed in service by the end of '12. Putting all these cash flow benefits together, we expect to recover our initial investment by 2015. Once complete, Antelope Valley will be one of the largest photovoltaic projects in the world. This is another example of working within our Exelon 2020 plan to bring low emission, [indiscernible] power generation to the economy. With our tax capacity, we were able to do that without sacrificing our financial requirements.  Let me turn briefly to the EPA's regulatory calendar. As you all know, the administration has directed EPA to put ozone regulations on a slower track and we expect the new ozone standard to be proposed in 2013. At the same time, the administration has backed EPA's work on the cross-state and air toxic rules for power plants. While EPA has indicated it will take another month to release the final air toxic rules, we see their care and attention to detail as good things. The President has made it clear that he doesn't intend to abandon the effort to regulate hazardous air pollutants like mercury. Despite the passage of the TRAIN Act in the House, we do not believe a congressional effort to suspend the EPA's work will ultimately pass both houses and we do not see how it could sustain a veto, if it did. As you know, EPA recently proposed modifications to the cross-state rule. We think that's a good thing, not a bad thing, they're obviously trying to eliminate cases where the other rules had unintended consequences, we're all for that. So we continue to believe that Exelon will see the market benefits on additional EPA regulation that we have been discussing over sometime. Now, what's more important is we're already seeing the actions that we really care about. The last PJM auction resulted in over 1,800 megawatts less coal bidding than before. About 7,000 megawatts less coal capacity cleared the auction. To date, about 10,000 megawatts of coal-fired capacity in PJM has been announced for retirement. We have revised our estimate upward from 10,000 or 11,000 to be retired to about 15,000 megawatts retiring over the next few years in PJM. This is partly due to the pending environmental regulation and partly due to the fact that many of these units simply aren't economic at today's natural gas prices, and with today's low loan growth. So we continue to think the market will improve and our views on this are supported by increasing sharp freds [ph] and the general power market behavior that we have seen, and Ken Cornew is with me today and will be happy to discuss that in more detail later.  Now, let me just comment on a couple of other things. First, the NRC continues to take a careful and thoughtful and decisive response to the events in Japan at the Fukushima plants. The staff has evaluated the findings of the task force and presented a prioritized action plan. The commission recently approved the best near-term actions. The Tier 1 priorities include reassessing policies, procedures and in fact, guidelines. We expect additional requirements, requiring hardened vents and spent fuel pool instrumentation, as well as more backup equipment for station blackout response. While these Tier 1 requirements will be handled decisively on a short timeline, there will be an opportunity for industry input. We believe the NRC is handling the Fukushima event in a very responsible manner. Now, we are turning gears. We are actively involved in the AEP Ohio and Duke Energy Ohio rate and marketing cases. And in this case, neither of these companies was enthused about how much capacity was supposed to go to market. We have intervened strongly, making it very clear that we didn't wish to impair either company's ability to recover its current investments. But at the same time, making it clear that we wanted future investments judged by market standards. We have achieved settlements. We had both AEP Ohio and so is the Duke, one done now?
Unknown Executive: It is.
John W. Rowe: We have a settlement with Duke also? Not only does this create an opportunity market for some 70 million-megawatt hours of electricity, I view this as one of the most important step forward for competitive markets in the past decade. As you all know in the late 90s, it seemed like everything would be competitive and then after Enron, things rolled back. So here we have cases of utilities that have been strong advocates of competitive -- of regulated monopolies agreeing to a larger percentage of market participation. I think that's a very good thing indeed and Joe Dominguez and Scott Brown and Delia Stroud of our team just did a tremendous job working on these things in a way that won't possible [ph] for the other utilities but was definitively pro-market.  Closer to home in Illinois, we watched Senate Bill 1652 and the accompanying trailer bill on an hourly basis. The trailer bill passed the Senate yesterday by the required majority to overturn the governor's veto. The trailer bill passed out of House committee this morning by about -- I think it was 17:1 or 16:1. We believe both bills will be presented to both houses in the next day or 2 but you'll know when they pass as soon as we do. Frank Clark is on the phone and so is Joe Trpik and they can talk to you with more detail about these. But I think this is a remarkable effort to fund the legislature who both try to improve the electric service in Illinois and to do so in a way that's fair to ComEd and Enron. I'm very pleased about this work. So just to finish off and turn it over to Matt, again, and again we find a way to deliver earnings. And I think we are on track for a very good year at Exelon and there is no part of the company that hasn't made a contribution. As you all know, Tom Terry's tax work has been exceptional this year, but all of the basic units are pulling together and we're giving you results. So with that, Matt?
Matthew F. Hilzinger: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. This morning I will review the operating results for the quarter in more detail and share a few thoughts on power market performance and cash flow. As John mentioned, Exelon delivered operating earnings of $1.12 per share this quarter, $0.01 per share better than the same period from the prior year.  Moving to Slide 9, Generations operating earnings are up $0.04 per share this quarter, compared to last year, largely due to improved portfolio and market conditions. It reflects PECO's transition to market at the beginning of the year and our third quarter of Texas performance.  As you can see on Slide 10, we are near our ratable hedge targets for 2012 and '13, although we slowed down the pace of our hedging this quarter, we continue to make sales and able to benefit from the higher pricing we saw periodically through the quarter at the West Hub and NiHub. We attribute the higher pricing primarily to 2 factors: first, the markets' reaction to the Cross-State Air Pollution Rules; and second, additional heat rate expansion at the West Hub and NiHub consistent with historical levels of similar natural gas prices.  On the right side of the slide, you can see that prices increased following the release of the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule in early July, the increase began when some limited amount of emission allowances began trading in early September. Those future rates cleared at prices more than double the EPA price of approximately $1,100 per ton. Since then, the EPA has modified the state emissions budgets and we are currently seeing 2012 SO2 emission markets quoted at $700 to $1,100 per ton, which is at or below the EPA's expectations.  With respect to heat rates, NiHub heat rates continue to build on the improvement we saw earlier in the year and both NiHub and West Hub heat rates expanded by approximately 1 point during the quarter for 2012 and 2013, which were supportive of higher prices as natural gas prices remained low. You may have also noticed that our expected generation in the South and West region is up since our second quarter across all years. As a note, we are now including the expected generation from Wolf Hollow and Antelope Valley Solar Ranch, 2 acquisitions that we completed during the third quarter.  Turning to comment on Slide 11, operating earnings for the third quarter of 2011 were $0.17 per share compared to $0.18 per share last year. Incremental storm costs were up $0.06 per share this quarter compared to last year, due to a very busy summer of storms. ComEd's crews managed an unprecedented total of 10 major storms in close succession this summer, including the July 11 storm that we mentioned during our second quarter earnings call, which affected nearly 1 million customers. In each instance, ComEd's restoration performance was commendable under very challenging conditions.  Moving now to PECO on Slide 12. Operating earnings were $0.16 per share, which reflect a $0.02 increase in incremental storm costs versus last year due to Hurricane Irene. As many of you experienced directly, Hurricane Irene caused extensive flooding and wind damage and interrupted service to nearly 7 million customers in 14 U.S. states. About 500,000 of the affected customers were in the PECO service territory. Those at PECO were partner in the aftermath of Irene was the extraordinary job of restoring service to 99% of their affected customers within 72 hours. PECO management proactively mobilized thousands of employees, contractors and workers from other regions, including ComEd before the storm hit the service territory which enabled the immediate and effective restoration response. With respect to load for ComEd and PECO, total weather-normalized electric deliveries are down for the quarter, compared to the prior year at ComEd and are essentially flat at PECO. The slowdown in growth in the economy is weighing on the electric demand in both regions. Almost every economist we watch has reduced the U.S. gross domestic product growth expectations for this year and shows that they are not expecting the economy to gain a lot of momentum in the near term.  Based on our year-to-date performance and the decline in our expectations for the fourth quarter, we are modifying our full year load expectations. For 2011 we are now projecting a decline in load from last year of 0.6% at ComEd, and a decline of 0.5% at PECO. The details regarding our load results and outlook, they can be found on Slides 28 and 29 in the appendix of today's presentation.  On Slide 13, you will find our updated cash flow projections for this year. During the third quarter based on new IRS guidance issued on August 19, ComEd and PECO can immediately deduct expenses associated with certain repairs, which will reduce their tax liabilities and generate an additional $300 million cash flow operations. We expect to receive about approximately $250 million this year and a $50 million in 2012.  As John mentioned, we will fund Antelope Valley Solar project with a combination of a federal financing bank loan which is guaranteed by the Department of Energy, cash on hand and other short-term debt. Interest rates on the loan will be fixed at an attractive spread of 37.5 basis points above U.S. Treasuries of comparable maturity, adding to the financial attractiveness of the project. Maintaining a strong balance sheet and identifying -- executing value-added strategies has positioned us and the year with strong cash and with strong credit metrics. At the year-end, we are projecting FFO to debt of 47% at ExGen in HoCo, which is well above our 30% to 35% target and gives us flexibility heading into the next few years to manage the changes in our Generation markets.  Before I close, I'd like to touch on a couple of additional items starting with pension on Page 14. At the end of the third quarter, our pension was funded at 83%. Two significant factors that impacted our funded status are discount rate and asset returns. The discount rate is used to determine our pension obligation at pension costs for the following year and is determined at December 31st of each year and is based on the yields of long-term, high-quality corporate bonds, which we can't control. However, we can and have influenced the asset returns generated by our portfolio based on our investment decisions.  In 2010, Exelon implemented a liability hedge strategy and rebalanced the portfolio to a less equity-concentrated asset allocation. Our investment strategy has resulted in significant outperformance of our plans relative to the S&P 500. The $2.1 billion pension contribution in January, in conjunction with our liability hedge strategy has, in large part, reduced the impact of lower discount rates on the pension unfunded status costs and contributions. As a result, we do not currently anticipate substantial changes to our plan in 2012 pension contribution. Consistent with the prior year, we will provide our latest 2012 pension contribution projections and sensitivities at EEI in a couple of weeks. On October 14, we received an order from the FERC on our incentive and formula rate filing, the RITE Line transmission project. FERC approved an 11.43% return on equity without hearing. The rate includes others [ph] for our RTO membership and for projects, risks and challenges. In addition, the order grants 100% CWIP and abandoned and recovery, and regulatory asset treatment for preconstruction costs. All incentives are subject to PJM including the RITE Line as Regional Transmission Expansion Plan, known as RTEP. The plan will pull[ph] with PJM's RTEP process by participating in a stakeholder process currently under way to assess modifications needed to the existing RTEP requirements to address FERC Order No. 1000 and policy-based transmission expansion.  Finally, when we present at EEI in a couple of weeks we will introduce the status of our 2014 hedge disclosure. Due to our pending merger with Constellation, we will not be introducing 2012 earnings guidance. In closing, we delivered another quarter of strong financial results and remain on track to deliver earnings solidly within our earnings guidance range for the year. And with that, we are ready to take your questions.\
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon from ISI Group.
Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Gentlemen, when you look at what happened in Texas, obviously, you had a big benefit from the heat wave, the $0.10. I think it appears that you're open gross margins reflect, I think in part, higher results going forward from Texas just given how tight that market has become. Is that true? And can you give us some sense of whether you think there's a structural repeatability to the type of option value you retain there and how that fits into the industrial logic of the merger?
John W. Rowe: The -- Stacie and Ruth Ann are not gentlemen, but other than that, I'm going to defer it to Ken, who is a gentleman, to answer that.
Kenneth W. Cornew: Hey, Greg, clearly as you can see in our hedge disclosure, the increase in heat rates in Texas has added value in our open gross margin. In addition and that obviously we picked up the Wolf Hollow, the second half of the Wolf Hollow plant, which we had the first half PPA, and we have a solar facility there picking up some generations. So about half of its increase -- half of the increased generation in our hedge disclosure represents increased dispatch on our plans and half are the new acquisitions in Texas. In the kind of market that is set up for this kind of volatility if you have supply/demand equilibrium driven by either longer-term supply/demand fundamentals or in some part, in this case extreme weather, extreme drought that caused the conditions that we saw in August and somewhat through September. So the heat rates picked up to a point where they represent more value, option value, for peaking assets. I think this is something that can continue obviously driven many of the fundamental long-term drivers which we discussed, as well as weather, but this is an indication that, as you get closer to equilibrium, you will see more power volatility and see higher value for the kinds of assets that we have in Texas. From a retail business perspective, we like the retail business. The retail business is the most effective way for us to find hedges for our portfolio that's designed to serve retail load. We have that, in large part, in the Mid-Atlantic, we have it in Texas with our Mid-American peaking assets, so this in no way changes our perspective on what the value of a retail business and load following in a portfolio can do for you. We just don't like to sell it when it's not valued fairly in the market, and we'll sell it appropriately when it is valued fairly in the market.
John W. Rowe: I don't think we see any consistency coming out of these Texas prices, but on the other hand, as Ken said, the closer Texas gets to equilibrium, the more frequently we should see these periods of high prices.
Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: I have 2 other questions, the first is, in Maryland, I know you're currently negotiating -- trying to negotiate a mutually beneficial outcome. If feels like the biggest area of dispute is your willingness to build 25 megawatts of renewals and their desire to have several hundred megawatts of renewables, what do you think the most likely -- some mutually constructive outcome there might be?
John W. Rowe: Well, it's a -- it's add more dimension than that. I think the Public Utility Commission's RFP on capacity suggests that it has some interest in a large number of megawatts produced in the most economic way, whatever that is, and that means probably gas. The governor's office is clearly interested in more renewables and so the negotiation has to be designed to achieve an [indiscernible] optimum efficiency between a number of different perspectives. I do think you have your finger on it. I think an ultimate settlement requires more renewables.
Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And my final question, and maybe this is more up yours and Bill Von Hoene's alleys since he's on the board of NEIL but what is your perspective on what's going on at Crystal River 3 with the significant delamination event there as it pertains to sort of introspection on your part on the care and maintenance of your units as they age?
John W. Rowe: Well that I, you got me, you've got Bill Von Hoene, you've got Joe Grimes. And Joe, I'm going to kick this off but I think you're going to have to pick it up from Bill and I because there are those who do not think 2 lawyers are the best people to opine on containment integrity. But the real message for us is anytime you have to make a hole in the containment, do it with exquisite care and be very, very careful about what you're doing. Also, go into a containment like that as rarely as possible but, Joe, would you pick up on that please?
Joseph Grimes : Yes, John. We have no plans in our near-term planning scope which would have us do any concrete cutting on any of our structures similar to a containment. We are continuing to closely follow the activities associated with the concrete crack indications and we don't currently have any concerns for our facilities.
John W. Rowe: Bill, you want to add anything to that?
William A. Von Hoene: The only thing I would add, Greg, is that, as you know, the claim is under consideration at NEIL currently and there's been no determination as to how we have to handle Metal B forthcoming.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Jay Dobson from Wunderlich Securities.
James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division: John, I was hoping I could follow up on the last question regarding Texas and understanding that operationally that was just a fantastic result and the folks that operate deserve a lot of credit, but as we look out to the next year, you would be assuming that Constellation merger has closed, you'd be operating from at least a neutral and probably a short position rather than a long position, and I'm just wondering how, as you look forward, your comments regarding retail, how you're thinking about these tightening markets in a retail context, both strategically but then also as you frame up and prepare for the consummation of the merger. How you think about hedging particularly in Texas, tactically understanding that you will have a large short position you will be taking on your books.
John W. Rowe: We are strategically somewhat less comfortable with shorts than Constellation has been. We believe one of the great virtues of the merger is it puts their retail marketing capability with our Generations. And we like that in Texas as in other places. Ken Cornew, who will be heading the whole trading shop for the combined company, will be working with both Chris and Mayo to try to come up with a conservative, adequately hedged approach to handling places where we have more load than generation. I think the real difference is that learning, as we all have from the last 9 months, we probably hedged a little sooner than Constellation has historically or a little more completely, in other words, we take the tail out a little further. It was possible to do that, indeed, Ken was able to sell some power at very high prices from our fleet in the wake of the heat and then buy it back a few weeks later at cheaper prices than he can produce it for. So to us, it's a matter of learning from the whole thing. We believe Constellation will turn out to have had some losses in Texas. Ken's last guess is that they're smaller than our gains, but we don't know yet and you'll find that out in the Constellations' earnings call. What's really important here is the 2 things are stronger together than separately and we're going to impose a conservative hedging discipline on the whole. Ken, would you like to add to that?
Kenneth W. Cornew: Just a couple of comments, Jay, to add to that. We do have, when you combine the fleet, a substantial amount of geek load coverage capability in Texas, so from a peak perspective, I don't think we have the situation you're describing. Maybe more from an expected generation situation, is what you're describing, and we've served loads for many, many years. We've served a 23,000-megawatt peak in ComEd, we served almost a 9,000-megawatt peak in PECO for many years with Generation, with certain baseload generation more in the Midwest than having to add a peak into it with a well-rounded portfolio in the East. And we know how to do it, we understand and know how to create a portfolio that will fit our needs in Texas and quite frankly, I think it'll be pretty easy for us to do that once we bring the portfolios together. But I have to say, we haven't brought the portfolios together and we'll be taking a deeper dive when we do.
James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division: And just a detailed question on Texas, how long was the Handley plant out in the early third quarter?
Kenneth W. Cornew: The Handley plant was out approximately 7 weeks and the rest of our fleet operated superbly.
James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division: That's great. And then, John, on the Mark 1 retrofit, have we gotten our head around what those costs might be? I understand from the second quarter, we do feel they're going to be small but has there been any granularity on what that might cost?
John W. Rowe: There really isn't yet. Strangely, what the commission is doing on debt hardening, I think will add more cost to the Mark 2s than the Mark 1s, but Joe, and Jeff, would you pick up on that question?
Joseph Grimes : Yes, I mean, at this point in time, John, we again don't see any significant costs in 2012 and we actually expect to continue that the cost for compliance for both the Mark 1s and Mark 2s will be very manageable. We'll have a better estimate on those compliance costs once we get through the technical review process with the industry and the NRC through next year.
James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division: That' great. And then, Matt, just one quick detail finance question, I remember from the second quarter you had a tax benefit from the transfer of cash to a qualified nuclear trust and you indicated in the second half of the year you'd have about a $0.01 benefit, did that book in the third quarter? Or is that pushed to the fourth?
Matthew F. Hilzinger: No, it came through in third quarter.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.
Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Quick question on Texas, I noticed in the release, you mentioned having had this outage at one of the units early in the quarter, which I guess is before the real spike, so I guess I have 2 questions on that. Would we have seen a notice of better result, if that outage hasn't occurred and then how in terms of the way you hedged would that outage have impacted the result had it happened, say, in August?
Kenneth W. Cornew: John, we are aware that the outage was in the middle of the summer. Did happen and it was in July and in part of August, we are aware of our situation operationally staying very close with Sonny Garg and his organization. We decide to expand the length of our portfolio in August to keep our position where we wanted it to be. We got the plant back sometime in August. We got another half of Wolf Hollow sometime in August. Those things went in our favor. If the plant was running full time and market prices stayed the same, we would've made more money. But when more plants come online, you know that impacted prices well, so it's hard to recreate how that will occur but we're very happy with our result. It was executed flawlessly by Wolf Coon [ph] and our sales trading team and the results show it.
Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: And then another -- one other thing I have for you is, it seems I guess in the last -- since the end of the quarter, we've seen the score [ph] of heat rates in PJM and related Hubs, roll over beyond 2012 a little bit, and adding that '13, '15 window, what do you attribute that to -- I mean, is it hedging activity in the market, is it the fact that gas is held up a little better in the out years, 2012, any sense of what's causing that?
Kenneth W. Cornew: Jonathan, my guess is, it's more of the hedging activity that's happened since the quarter's turn. When, I guess, the September 30 prices as you see in our hedge disclosure, reflect higher heat rates than we've seen, a little bit higher than we've seen in the last 20 days, although heat rates have held up really well, anytime you get cycles of hedging activity, you'll see some movement in power price one way or another and I think that some of it I would've told you based on September 30 prices a larger amount of our forward upside from the environmental regulation was in those NiHub and West Hub price and in the last 20 days or so, it's shown me that there still is more upside, particularly in the NiHub levels, so I think heat rates have moved up substantially to reflect the reality in spot prices and the reality of price impact from environmental rules and you will see that cycle a bit as gas price or power price moves with short-term market activity.
Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And then if I could just on one other topic on the pension, it looks like that the move into fixed income was very timely. And should we think about this the mix that you shifted to as being static now with that big improvement in the bond portfolio, is it possible we see you rebalance this again?
John W. Rowe: Well, I think it's directionally static. Doug Brown, who manages it, is here. Do you want to pick up on it, Doug?
Doug J. Brown: We view that as a dynamic allocation that we constantly re-evaluate, so we're very happy where it is right now but if rates were to go lower we could lighten up on the hedge. We're firmly committed to that strategy, we'll always have a hedge but we constantly evaluate, so it could move in the future.
John W. Rowe: Unless that sounds too much of a debt, Doug has been very firm with our risk management committee on our board. He thinks year in and year out, we actively matching our investments more to our exposure than we were before. And we have been better off 3 years ago, 4 years ago, if we'd started Doug's plan earlier, so while I'm sure he'll change it from time to time, the direction of a larger weighting toward debt I think is a pretty constant Board commitment. Doug, will you agree with that?
Doug J. Brown: Yes, John, I would agree with that. And I think as rates will eventually go up and the funded status will improve, we will actually continue to increase the hedge level and the matching portfolio strategy.
Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: So when you talk about asset allocation and then a liability hedge, is the hedge something different from just increasing the bond waiting or is it basically the same thing?
Doug J. Brown: It will be the same thing. We roughly have about 40% of the assets in what we call the liability hedge portfolio. It's a physical bond portfolio of treasury at high-quality corporates that match the interest rate characteristics of the liability.
Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. So -- and it's only a hedge in the sense that it's just a higher percentage weighting that you used to have before?
Doug J. Brown: Yes, much higher. We essentially didn't have very much of a hedge at all previously and we moved to a rather high level right at the moment.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Bank of America.
Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Just, first a question regarding merger approval in Maryland. Could you maybe give us kind of a summary sense of what do you think the main issues are that need to be resolved still with the state of Maryland -- like what are the couple of critical path issues with them?
John W. Rowe: Well, I think we did that largely, Steve, on an earlier question. The issue is, what does the state as an entity, really want as an adequate demonstration saw [ph] benefits to Maryland? And we put in a package to start with, match to scale, the first energy allocation package. We knew it would be a little different when you're talking about buying the State's largest utility. And the real issue is trying to guess what the commission wants because you can't talk directly to the Commissioner and to work with the Governor in the governor's office as to what they want and as an earlier question explored, the governor's office appears most interested in more renewables. The commissioners may have some interest in accelerating the timing when additional gas capacity comes online. I think those are the nub issues. We hope we have largely made the city happy with the offer to build a new office building in the city, but this is a multiparty negotiation and it can all change a little before it's done.
Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. I guess just conceptually, the issue of wanting more gas generation is more of a general issue that has a lot of broader implications, as I know you know, than just this merger. So how do you resolve something like that in the context of a merger?
John W. Rowe: Well, the problem with a merger is you're at a point when you're need to negotiate is at the highest, that's what the prices you pay for the benefits you get. I don't think anyone thinks the whole issue of how much new generation comes on in the East when we solve in the merger proceeding, but there is a public benefits test here and we're going to see what's more important to people directionally. As you know that -- and you know this as well as I do, this issue isn't confined to Maryland, we went through it in one way in New Jersey and at FERC, it comes up in Illinois on the proposed Tenaska plant. Everybody likes markets except when they want something else.
Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. One other question, totally separate on the EPA rules coming, I guess soon, just what's your perspective on how -- I mean obviously a lot of the industry is pushing for more time, in some cases, kind of like a blanket extension of time. Kind of what's your perspective in how EPA is going to deal with the mix of the more time and the economic worries issue in this? And reliability issue, I guess, it keeps getting brought up in this ruling.
John W. Rowe: I think we're going to try to make people prove that reliability point. There's a lot of talk about reliability problems that simply don't exist and we're constantly pushing that they announce their shutdown plans and then let FERC and PJM investigate whether there are any reliability issues. We think they will, in fact, be very few and we're being very pugnacious about saying, "If you're going to claim a reliability problem, prove it." EPA has some discretion. We would certainly urge EPA to use its discretion where there are real reliability problems but not phony ones. And from an Exelon economic point of view, it doesn't trouble us much if people get a little more time where they're actually putting on a new scrubber or some other major rehab. But we're adamant that nobody should get more time for a plant they're gonna shut down anyway.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Julien Smith with UBS.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: So I wanted to ask, you commented briefly before on Casper and seeing some of that flow through, I mean, perhaps being a little bit more explicit about it, how much of an uplift do you expect to see into implementation into year-end given where pricing is today and then maybe can you comment a little bit more granularity call it, West Hub versus NiHub on that just to get a kind of...
John W. Rowe: I'm sorry, I can't answer that but I think the short answer is we think a lot of that effect is already in the market but Ken, go ahead.
Kenneth W. Cornew: We have just [indiscernible] in our modeling scene about a $1 or $2 uplift in prices from the cross-state rule. We think that is largely in the market, both NiHub and West Hub, the $2 is more of a NiHub number and the $1 is more of a West Hub number.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: With regards to residential retailing and aggregation, there seems to have been quite a few developments of late in Illinois, it seems like there's this accelerating trend. Perhaps you could comment, somewhat in light of your pending merger, on your own activities and perhaps activities of others in the State to that end and where you anticipate seeing that moving as we look at 2012?
John W. Rowe: Well, we believe that with what's happened in power markets, what's happening in more regulated jurisdictions, the opportunities for retail marketing are consistently increasing. Most large customers have switched where they can, that's true in both Illinois and Pennsylvania and in other competitive markets, but we're seeing more switching by small commercial customers, the beginnings of serious switching by residential customers, with more in Pennsylvania than in Illinois but the trend is the same and more efforts by municipalities to aggregate and this is one of the reasons why we value the Constellation purchase, because they're further along in developing both the marketing groups and people and the backup IT platform than we are. With that, I'll turn it over to Ken.
Kenneth W. Cornew: And we think assistance in our marketing to commercial and industrial customers in Illinois and that business remains a solid viable business. We focused our attention on industrial and commercial customers in Pennsylvania and have spent most of our time developing those systems and people and capability to market to that segment. We continue to push and move into the Ohio area in the industrial and commercial segment and as John indicated, once we bring together the Constellation retail element, we will be in the residential market. We have no activity in that market right now.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Great. And then the last quick question, you kind of alluded to it previously with regards to Maryland, perhaps just commenting a little bit more broadly, what -- would you feel comfortable participating in the RFP as its proposed currently or any further flavor around the participation in what's been proposed?
John W. Rowe: I'd like Darryl Bradford to pick that up. My own view is we might participate in the RFP but be more likely to be a nonconforming bid, but Darryl?
Darryl M. Bradford: Yes, John. The RFP has been extended out now so that responses aren't due until January as you may know, the commission issued an RFP the Maryland Energy Administration had some questions about the shape of the RFP and whether it should be expanded to include renewables. So it's a matter that we're going to continue to watch and evaluate. From our viewpoint, what that RFP looks like yet hasn't been settled, so I wouldn't want to speculate on what we're going to do with it.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: A quick clarification there actually there was an allusion to DPL South or [indiscernible] expanding it on that front is -- any comment on that one?
John W. Rowe: I'm sorry, I didn't understand the precise question.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: It seems as if there was a comment in the RFP regarding perhaps extending it to the DPL South region of PJM. Is there any comment around that? Can you comment on the renewable expansion of the RFP.
Darryl M. Bradford: Yes, I think it just highlights the fact that from our viewpoint at least, this is still forming and what it's going to look like and what it's going to encompass is, from our viewpoint, not yet settled and so we'll look forward to hearing from the State as to how this is shaped, what its requirements are, what other RFPs are going to be there and then we'll look at it wholistically.
Stacie M. Frank: Cassandra, I think we're going to turn it back over to John for some closing remarks.
John W. Rowe: Well, first, thank you, everybody. Second, if Chris Crane and Bill Von Hoene and Darryl Bradford, Calvin Butler are really successful, by the time we get to our next earnings call, we might have closed Constellation and that if that's the case, it would be a very good thing indeed, but if that's the case, this will be the last time you'll hear from me on one of these and so I just want to make some points very crisply about what's going on here. Again and again, over the last several years, we have beaten estimates, we have proven that the machine works across the board as different parts of the company, find the extra at different times. And yes, it's coincidental just which one performs when, with the extra value. But what's not coincidental is we've got a whole lot of hounds hunting and they do it really well and they're not here because they're pretty, they're here because they produce results. And that's true in our nuclear operation, it's true in the 2 delivery companies, it's true with our rate-making people, it's true with Tom Terry's work on taxes, it's true with Joe Dominguez's remarkable work in Ohio with Duke and AEP. I mean, things are working here and Chris Crane will be as absolutely dedicated to value as I am, and this management team will be as dedicated to value without me as it has been with me. And you know and we know because your forecast for the next couple of years aren't much different than ours, that the next couple of years are going to be tougher on an earnings basis. And you know and we know, that there's nobody else with the same upside that we have down the road. And it really is fortunate in my view that we're starting to see glimmers of that upside in power markets already. Energy just isn't going to be free in those markets indefinitely. So I really just want to end this by saying, you have one hell of a team working for you here and they will continue to deliver. Thank you very much.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Theresa, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Exelon Corporation Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Stacie Frank to begin. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Stacie Frank: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Exelon's Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for joining us today. We issued our earnings release this morning. If you haven't received it, the release is available on the Exelon website. The earnings release and other matters we will discuss in today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties, as well as adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings. Please refer to today's 8-K and Exelon's other filings for a discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts and expectations and for a reconciliation of operating to GAAP earnings. In addition, during the call, we will be discussing the proposed merger of Exelon Corporation and Constellation Energy Group, Inc. Today's discussion does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, or a solicitation of any vote or approval. Furthermore, today's discussion is not a substitute for the registration statement on Form S-4 that Exelon filed with the SEC on June 27, 2011, that included a preliminary joint proxy statement prospectus or for the definitive joint proxy statement prospectus and other relevant documents that Exelon will send to a security holder in connection with the proposed merger. For important additional information regarding the proposed merger, including the risks and uncertainties associated with it, please refer to the earnings release and today's 8-K, as well as the joint proxy statement prospectus.  Leading today's call are John Rowe, Exelon's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Matt Hilzinger, Exelon's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by other members of Exelon's senior management team, who will be available to answer your questions. We've scheduled 60 minutes for the call, and I'd like to now turn the call over to John Rowe, Exelon's CEO.
John Rowe: Thank you, Stacie, and good morning, everyone. As you know from our earnings release we had another fine quarter. Our operating earnings were $1.05 per share, which I think significantly exceeded your consensus expectations. We have had a very busy summer at both ComEd and PECO with extreme heat and violent thunderstorms. One in July, on ComEd, knocked out over 850,000 customers, and it took us nearly a week to get them all back. But the ComEd system is performing better than ever before, and handled without major trouble, a new all-time peak of 23,753 megawatts on the 20th of July. ComEd got a reasonable result in class rate case considering the appellate court decision that you had all heard about 6 or 9 months ago. And it's continuing its work to get Illinois Senate Bill 1652 enacted. This legislation would support a broad infrastructure improvement program and finally bring some real regulatory stability to Illinois. We simply don't know what the odds are of the governor signing it. He hasn't been sounding promising to date, and we don't know whether the legislature would overturn the veto. It is certainly possible that they would because they want these jobs very badly.  In Philadelphia, PECO continues to produce genuinely exceptional financial results. And it has handled its extreme heat superbly. PECO also hit an all-time peak last Thursday and again topped it on Friday. During the second quarter, Exelon Generation's capacity factor in its nuclear fleet was 89.6%, largely as a result of 103 refueling outage days at 4 units. For the first 6 months of the year, the capacity factor was 92.2%. And in spite of a year of -- with an extraordinary number of refueling outages, our nuclear group continues to strive to achieve its usual 93% this year. Our performance this quarter was distinguished by some positive tax items, which are not simply accidents, but the result of very hard work by Tom Terry and his tax guidance. We are on or slightly ahead of plan just with basic operating use, but the tax benefits allow us to increase our earnings guidance for 2011, up from $4.05 to $4.25 per share. This range already includes about $0.04 per share of incremental storm costs from the major July 11 storm, which we will book in the third quarter. Now we've had continued storms in ComEd. I don't have a good number yet on the expense of the whole, but that was the big one, and we've already got that pretty well boxed.  Needless to say, I am personally very pleased at being able to increase the earnings guidance. Our merger work in Maryland is marching along right on schedule, and one of these days, I'll wake up retired, hopefully as early as January, so I would really like 2011 to be a good year. And right now, it looks like it's going to be a very good year, indeed. Turning to the merger. We made all of our regulatory filings within a month of announcing the transaction. We filed our S-4 proxy statement with the SEC at the end of June. The FERC and DOJ processes are proceeding on course. The Texas and New York processes are on track. We hope to get a decision in Texas next month and New York before the end of the year. The NRC is likely to complete its review by January. In Maryland, the schedule has been set to have a Public Service Commission decision on January 5, 2012. If you look at those dates, you see the basis for my hope that we actually can get these all done in January, or perhaps in February. We continue to work with the stakeholders in Maryland, including the governor's staff. We have several Exelon officers based in Baltimore to ensure that dialogue remains constructive throughout the process. This is one of the lessons we've learned from all of our work in New Jersey 5 years ago. It is: get your own people on the ground, get direct information and have people get to know you firsthand. So far, everything is on pace and on schedule. I believe we do remain on track to close the merger early next year. Chris Crane and Mayo Shattuck are in the process of defining the new leadership structure. They will make the announcements of the first layer of executive management announcements late this summer. Over the last 3 months, we have visited with many of you, I'm sure with all of our larger shareholders. And I'm pleased to say the reaction from you has been generally very positive, indeed. Nearly everyone I have talked to and my reports from Bill Von Hoene and Stacie and Chris are similar, recognize that this deal works. It makes financial sense from earnings position, from a cash flow perspective and from a credit perspective. The combination of our Generation fleet with Constellations' customer-facing business provides a strong platform for growth. And the transaction allows us to diversify our fleet across various forms of clean energy, and enables us to execute our Exelon 2020 vision for a clean energy future. Being clean is a competitive hallmark for Exelon. It will become even more advantageous as we move into this new era of EPA regulations. More and more, through a combination of economics, gas prices and pending environmental regulations, we expect to see the market bias towards cleaner forms of energy. Earlier this month, EPA issued its final Cross-State Air Pollution Rule, what we used to call the transport rule. The final rule contains many of the provisions that the Clean Energy Group, to which Exelon belongs, suggested and provides more regulatory certainty for lowering NOx and sulphur dioxide emissions beginning as early as next year. We applaud EPA's use of a market-based solution with interstate trading where it could. Overall, we think the rule will have a positive impact on wholesale prices, albeit with some regional differences. We're still evaluating the rule, and we'll learn more as we see allowance trading in advance of the January 2012 start date.  On the Air Toxics Rule, EPA extended its comment period until early August, but has maintained a strong commitment to finalizing that rule in November. This is of the utmost importance to EPA, and I expect them to hold to that timeline. The administration has made it increasingly clear the EPA has its full support. As we expected, the capacity markets were the first to reflect the environmental regulations. Current prices in the most recent PJM auction suggests that generators are taking a long-run economic approach to bidding, and companies continue to announce coal retirements and new plans for complying with the regulations. In PJM alone, plant operators have announced plans to retire more than 8,000 megawatts of operating coal capacity. We continue to believe that there will not be repeal or multiyear delay of the EPA regulations, despite some congressional attempts to do so. As you can all can tell from that current budget stalemate, doing nothing is a congressional strength, and we are glad to be at the position where that's good enough for our purposes. Opportunities to get one-year extensions when needed for compliance will be evaluated by EPA, maybe justifiable in a number of cases and indeed, Exelon would not oppose that. What we care about is when they are going to shut down a plant, they do it promptly and on time. We do not support and do not expect delays in the closing of plants that are not going to be upgraded.  I want now to turn to the nuclear industry's response to the events at Fukushima and its implications for the U.S. nuclear industry. We are very pleased that from the very first days, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has taken a fact-based, balanced and objective approach to assessing U.S. nuclear plants and that the administration has backed the NRC in this regard. Our own Chip Pardee has worked daily in coordinating with regulators, policymakers, the Nuclear Energy Institute, INPO and our peer companies. He is chairing the industry's Fukushima Response Steering Committee. On July 12, an NRC task force issued its 90-day report, which states clearly that U.S. nuclear plants are safe and also describes areas for regulatory improvement. We expect the NRC staff and the commission to work very diligently in both effectively learning how to improve the regulatory structure but also making certain that it stays fact-based. The industry will work through both INPO and NEI to make certain that all this happens. The issues identified in the task force report are largely those we expected. Very importantly to us, the task force report appears to find that current standards for the storage of spent fuel and the license renewal process are sound and appropriate. Since these were areas that defined the high-end of the potential cost to us, we are pleased to see that they have achieved this level of stability. How the NRC implements the remaining task force recommendations will take time to know. The cost to Exelon is still impossible to determine in any degree of detail, but we expect when we know that it will be spread over a number of years. Nonetheless, with the challenges ahead for the country's oldest and dirtiest coal plants, I would rather have the challenges of Exelon's nuclear fleet any day. The fundamental competitive strengths that we have remain intact. The value of our fleet will improve as power markets improve and EPA regulations are applied. Our uprates program continues to provide us with a low risk, low-cost growth vehicle. We have added 194 megawatts since we began the program in 2009. We have the ability to reassess market conditions as we go. Thus, we have decided to remove the Three Mile Island and Clinton EPUs from the plan due to economics. But we are moving forward with our other uprates and plan to bring another 185 megawatts online between now and the end of 2013. So let me end with the following. This quarter's results represents the 11th straight quarter in which we have met and generally beaten your expectations. We've beaten our own internal forecast. The reason for this is not always the same. Constant attention to operations is part of it every quarter, including this last one. In this quarter, some tax benefits were a big part of the change. But the key message I would like to leave you with is that we keep finding things to improve the system. We are absolutely, totally, rigorously and pathologically dedicated to doing that.  We can't guarantee that we'll be successful in doing that every quarter as we go forward, but I believe this company is placed, positioned and hung out to dry on the proposition that we can keep things better than the models. With that, I'll turn the call to Matt Hilzinger.
Matthew Hilzinger: Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. I'll start my remarks this morning on Slide 10, and follow with some additional commentary on our second quarter results and update on hedging and recent regulatory activity.  Earnings release issued this morning provide significant detail about our second quarter results. We are pleased to deliver another quarter of financial results that met or exceeded your expectations. Exelon's second quarter operating earnings were $1.05 per share, compared to $0.99 per share in the second quarter of 2010. The earnings drivers for all 3 operating companies are highlighted on Slides 11, 12 and 13.  Our second quarter results include the recognition of a onetime tax benefit of $0.07 per share at Exelon, resulting from a provision under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 that allows transfers of cash or investments from our nonqualified nuclear decommissioning trust funds to our qualified nuclear decommissioning trust funds, generating a tax deduction at the time of transfer. Exelon originally exercised this provision in March of 2008 and recognized a significant cash benefit based on the proposed regulations back in 2008. However, since that time, the IRS issued final regulations with provisions that allow us to carry back the deduction for 2 additional years from 2008 to 2006, resulting in earnings of $0.07 per share from the accumulation of interest and lower tax expense. We also expect to recognize about $0.01 per share benefit in the second half of the year for this item as well. Moving on to Slide 14 for an update on power markets and hedging status. Power prices in both the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest have recovered steadily since hitting their lows in late February. As you can see from the chart on the lower left, Midwest heat rates improved quite significantly as power prices increased despite the decrease in gas price, indicating in part the recognition of environmental compliance requirements by market participants.  With this improvement in Midwest power prices, we increased our hedging activity, including participation in the Illinois Power Authority solicitations conducted on behalf of ComEd and Ameren. As highlighted in our hedge disclosure section of this presentation, we are slightly above a purely ratable hedge for 2012 and 2013. With further improvement in forward prices in July, we continue to leverage our market views for executing sales within the quarter by selecting the product mix and using various channels to market to add value to the portfolio. Turning to Slide 15. You can see the diversity in our Generation and sales mix. While our nuclear assets are the core of our Generation portfolio, a sizable ownership or control of other assets complements our nuclear base and allows Power Team to serve more structured products, including retail. Following the roll off of the power purchase agreement with PECO, we continue to utilize several channels to market to minimize liquidity and congestions. Exelon Energy, our competitive retail business, has experienced significant growth, primarily in Pennsylvania. Their delivered electric sales volume for the period January to June 2011 increased by over 50% to 9.6 million megawatt per hours compared to the same period in 2010. Turning to ComEd. The Illinois Commerce Commission issued its final order in ComEd's 2010 distribution rate case at the end of May. ComEd received a revenue increase of $143 million versus its revised request of $343 million, with the new rates starting in June. The ICC order aligned with many of the recommendations in the ALJ's proposed order, approving a 10.5% ROE and a capital structure with equity slightly above 47%. We view this as a reasonable outcome considering the commission's order reflected the impacts of the Illinois appellate courts decision and the depreciation reserve, which represents $85 million of the reduced revenue request. ComEd targets an earned return on equity of 10% or better. However, due to the final outcome of the ComEd rate case and the recent impact of the 2 very severe storms that hit the Chicago area in June and July, ComEd will struggle to earn its target ROE this year. As a result, we have adjusted our full year earnings range down for ComEd.  Going forward, absent the effectiveness of the Illinois Senate Bill 1652, ComEd is looking at alternatives such as formula rate legislation or more regular rate case filings using a future test year in order to achieve more consistent 10% or better earned ROEs. Turning to load. Our expectations for both ComEd and PECO for the balance of the year are very similar to what we indicated last quarter. In the Chicago area, we aren't seeing any major changes in load or the economy that suggest we need to be more or less optimistic.  In Philadelphia, despite a lower gross metro product growth estimates since the last quarter, we anticipate no material changes to our 2011 load forecast. You can refer to the appendix for the slides on load trends and key economic indicators. Moving on to Slide 16. Last year, we announced our intention to pursue the RITE line, a high-voltage 765-kV transmission project in the Midwest through a partnership with the Electronic Transmission America, referred to as ETA, a joint venture of AEP and Mid-American holdings. The updated project timeline reflects the execution of the partnership agreement between Exelon and ETA that was formalized on July 13. The agreements establish operational, financial and management terms to the construction of a line that will extend from Illinois through Indiana to the Ohio border. We expect this line to improve reliability and reduce congestion to this territory once it is fully operational later in the decade, subject to a number of variables including approvals at PJM and FERC. The execution of the partnership agreement cleared the path for the FERC rate and incentives filing, which was submitted on July 18. The filing reflects a total of 12.7 return on equity, which includes a base return and incentives. The filing also requests other incentives such as our ability to recover abandonment costs and construction work in progress. We have asked the FERC to issue an order on this binding by October and are beginning to work to include the line in the PJM regional transmission expansion planning process. Our latest cash flow update is on Slide 17. Our business continues to generate strong cash flows from operations of $4.3 billion, and we expect to end the year with $350 million in cash. Cash benefits associated with the nuclear decommissioning trust funds special transfer tax that I described earlier will be realized in 2012. Capitalizing on the financial health of the business, we're able to deploy capital for value enhancing investments when such opportunities present themselves. This was the case with our $305 million acquisition of Wolf Hollow, a 720-megawatt combined central plant.  This acquisition aligns well with our existing footprint at ERCOT. It works from a financial and credit standpoint given our existing PPA for 50% of the output of the plant, and it will further complement our combined portfolio once we merge with Constellation. We purchased Wolf Hollow at a very attractive price compared to other recent transactions, and it will be funded upon closing with cash and available liquidity resources. The acquisition is pending approval from the Texas PUC, which we expect to receive in the third quarter. Before we open the call for questions, I'd like to provide you with our business outlook for the rest of the year. As John said, we are raising and tightening our full year guidance range because of our strong year-to-date performance, tax related items in the first 6 months of the year and our view for the balance of the year. For those of you who track storms, we have included in our guidance about $0.04 per share of incremental storm costs related to a severe storm that hit the Chicago area on July 11. This storm ranks as one of the worst to hit the ComEd region, impacting in excess of 850,000 customers. These storm costs have been included in our consolidated third quarter guidance range where we expect to earn between $1 and $1.10 per share. Our confidence and our higher full year guidance range is based on the impact of weather so far this year, including storms, new distribution rates at ComEd beginning in June, consistent operational performance and continued effective management of our own up costs[ph]. We delivered strong financial results in the first half of the year even before the tax items that came through, and we are on track to maintain our earnings commitments to you over the remainder of the year.  I will now open the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.
Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG: My question relates to the nuclear task force report and then the suggestions in there that it might be to put hardened vents on the Mark 2 containments. And I think we're right, some of those are Exelon plants. You have any indications you can give us on whether -- what the cost of that might be if that was the way they head with this?
John Rowe: Chris or Chip, we've done some of that altogether. Would you flesh that out for me?
Charles Pardee: Sure. This is Chip speaking. We have started our technical reviews if, in fact, those vents are deemed to be required. And we don't yet have any firm price numbers, but they're not extraordinary costs. These are not significant engineering or construction tasks, so I can just answer qualitatively that those should not be numbers that you would be able to discern.
John Rowe: Chip, you've done some of those already, haven't you?
Charles Pardee: Yes. Not on Mark 2s, on Mark 1s. But there are sufficient parallels that we can start from a pretty sound basis.
Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG: Could you give us a sense of what it might have cost on the Mark 1s and what the date of those costs were, roughly?
Charles Pardee: They were early enough, decades ago, starting through the 90s and such that I wouldn't care to extrapolate those costs up forward. But again, they were not large numbers, Jonathan, in the big scheme of things.
Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG: So could we be -- are we talking tens of millions or single-digit millions?
Charles Pardee: I don't know yet, but neither -- again, neither will be big movers for us.
Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG: Okay. And then my second question, if I may, on -- in the event that the legislation in Illinois was -- doesn't sort of get over the finish line, what would the likely timing of another rate filing be?
John Rowe: Ann, would you pick that up?
Anne Pramaggiore: Sure. We are looking at probably early 2012 for that, but we're still in the process of making decisions. Obviously, we're working hard on the legislation, and that's our first choice at this point, John. That's roughly the timing, Jonathan.
Operator: Your next question is from Greg Gordon of ISI Group.
Greg Gordon - Morgan Stanley: So the -- your -- on Page 22, your estimated open gross margin is based on forward curves from June 30. But I think we all know since the CSPA (sic) [CSAP] Rule came out, power prices have moved up several dollars since then. So are you seeing the same thing that I'm seeing in that prices are up a few dollars, therefore, all things equal, your open gross margin will be modestly higher? And then second, the real big question is, do you think that really truly reflects the fundamental impact of CSPAR? Do you think that just reflects the fact that we have a heatwave? How much more, if any, do you think sort of fundamental pricing needs to move as a reflection of what you see in these rules?
John Rowe: Greg, Ken Cornew is good at telling you whether the hot food wants a ham or bacon, so he will answer that.
Kenneth Cornew: Greg, we have seen the days immediately following the announcement of the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule, we saw the PJM markets move up about $1 and the ERCOT move up a little more strongly, about $2. Since then, we continue to see some movement. And now, the markets are more like $2 to $3 up, particularly in the out years, in '14, '15. I think the majority of that move does relate to the announcement of that rule. There has been, also, in the market, a realization that the fundamentals that make their way into the spot are real, and they're likely to continue in the forward market. So we'll be seeing some heat rate move up and corresponding price move up in the markets because of that. And that wasn't just the heatwave. That started in the middle of the second quarter, backed off a bit with the drop in gas, but has recovered again. So is there more? Potentially. We need to see exactly how emission allowances start trading [indiscernible] start figuring out what kinds of allowances they're going to need to dispatch their plants, but we haven't seen that yet in the market.
Greg Gordon - Morgan Stanley: Great. And on the flip side of that, we're starting to hear a lot about the amount of productive gas capacity coming online in the Marcellus Shale and that, to some degree, that is not getting to market because of liquids and transmission capacity being constrained. But I know there's a lot of money flooding that zone to try to fix that. Are you concerned about gas basis being a headwind as we get into '12 and '13 that could mitigate the positive impacts of the things that you just discussed?
Kenneth Cornew: Well, as you know, Greg, the basis numbers had decreased substantially since the onslaught of eastern gas development. To the extent Marcellus Shale continues to replace shale from Haynesville or other more standard production from the Gulf, you might see a little more decline in the basis, but that gas market, for the last 9 months or so, has been relatively stable. Supply and demand seem to be well in balance. Storage figures are a little lighter than they were a year ago. We feel like the gas market likely will stay in this current range for a good amount of time.
Operator: The next question is from Steve Fleishman of Bank of America.
Steven Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch: John, I think you mentioned on the Air Toxics Rule that the -- you expect the EPA to hold to their schedule and that -- and then you said they had the -- you feel they have the full support of the administration. Any sense of kind of data points that further indicate that?
John Rowe: Well, I think that there was a quote from either the President himself or his staff recently. Kathleen, do you remember exactly what they said?
Kathleen Barron: Well, there was -- I think you're probably recalling the statement from the Chief of Staff, and that was a few weeks back, indicating that the White House was supporting EPA. And then more recently, in the context of the appropriation discussion, again a reflection that they would veto a big pull back from EPA and its ability to finalize the rules.
Steven Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch: Okay. And then I guess one other question, just on this RITE transmission line. Could this basically allow NiHub Power to potentially get into SinHub or ADHub [ph]? And how many megawatts could potentially go across this line?
John Rowe: Chris, will you pick that up?
Ronald DeGregorio: John, this is Ron DeGregorio. I'll take that. This line will allow for a greater flow of energy and power from the various points that you mentioned. The ultimate size and power flow of that will happen as it relates to the specific design, but we're talking nominally, 3,000 to 4,000 megawatts.
Steven Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch: 3,000 to 4,000 megawatts. Okay.
Operator: The next question is from Jay Dobson of Wunderlich Securities.
James Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc.: A question for you, going back to the nuclear task force, you indicated that both the diligent process but perhaps more importantly a fact-based process was your hope. And I was just wondering if you could square that with at least the Chairman's desire of the NRC to get this sort of rules out in 90 days similar to the task force report. It would seem to almost make that fact-based approach maybe a little more challenging, if you had thoughts there.
John Rowe: Well, I can try. The Chairman clearly wishes to look decisive. None of us wish to stand in the way of being decisive about these things as long as they got the facts in. The full regulatory staff was not included in the preparation of the 90-day report. It is almost inconceivable that the Chairman and the other members of the commission won't want to hear from their own in-house experts. In addition, they have to give the industry some opportunity to comment on specific proposals. I can assure you, we won't do that just for the point of delay. We would like early clarity as much as the public would like early clarity. But these are very complicated things, and it's my guesstimate that the commission is going to need more than 90 days in at least more complex areas. Chip, what would you like to add to that?
Charles Pardee: I think that pretty much covers it. We're watching the other commissioners weigh in at this point in time. And I think from what we can tell, we'll see more clarity around the response to the question in relatively short order is my belief, but until such time the commission finishes weighing in, I don't think we'll know more about timelines or the degree to which the public will participate in the process.
James Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc.: No, that's very helpful. And I guess for clarity, your cost estimates of compliance with whatever new rules, you won't be willing to make that available to folks like us that are interested, probably about the time the rules are made. So to the extent it takes longer than 90 days, we should anticipate that it'll take you that long to come up with the cost estimates.
John Rowe: When we can give you a number that is with -- at a breadbox level of accuracy, we'll give it to all of you. I mean right now, all we know is that some of our worst fears, particularly about the fuel pools, do not appear to be happening. And so that's very good thing, indeed. But we just can't give you a number yet because we don't know what we have -- what they have in mind. The vent hardening is not a very big issue, but some of these other things could cost significantly more. And you won't have to ask. When we know, we'll get it to all of you as fast as we can.
James Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc.: And then, Matt, just a couple of clarifications. What was the storm cost in the second quarter? I think you were saying the $0.04 you would incur for the July storms in the third quarter. But I know you had $0.03 in the year ago second quarter, and I wasn't clear what the second quarter of '11 had for storm costs?
Matthew Hilzinger: I think it's around $0.01 to $0.02 of storm costs in the second quarter. So we had some storms in June and probably estimated to be around $0.02, June.
James Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc.: Okay, got you. So we got $0.01 or so benefit from -- relative to a year ago. And then on the tax issue, Matt, you said there'd be another $0.01 in the second half. Is there a reason to believe that wouldn't be in the third quarter or -- just to understand your characterization of the second half versus the first.
Matthew Hilzinger: Yes, the $0.01 is connected to the first $0.07. And it's just -- it's waiting for some final clarification from the IRS. So it's going to largely be dependent upon that. We like to see it in the third quarter, but it could move to the fourth. But it's dependent upon the IRS.
Operator: Your next question is from Hugh Wynne of Sanford Bernstein.
Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.: I had a question for Chip. You gave us a point of reference for thinking about the cost of the vent hardening on the Mark 2s. The NRC's report had 3 principal recommendations, and I was hoping that you might be able to give us a way to think about the capital or O&M costs associated with those that they're looking for you to ensure that you've got adequate protection against seismic and flooding throughout your plants, they're looking for you to enhance station blackout mitigation capability and finally, they're looking for you to strengthen the emergency preparedness to address prolonged station blackout. And just if I reference back, say, to what occurred after 9-11, is there some way that you could give us parameters to think about the O&M or capital costs associated with those?
Charles Pardee: I don't know how much clarity, additional clarity, I will able to provide. But I don't know if you were able to listen to the call that NEI had yesterday on largely the same subject. And one significant differentiator that we do see thus far with the 90-day report versus actions that were required post-9-11 is that unlike the events of a decade ago when our principal corrective actions involved adding significant security staff and -- significant additions to security staff, which, as you know, are ongoing O&M expenses versus highly concentrated on once-and-done capital improvements. From what we can see this time around, the task force largely concentrates on the physical attributes of the power plants, which tend to lend themselves to capital versus O&M improvements. I do know that we have completed our first round of seismic and flooding walk downs at our power plants. We did that several months ago as an immediate action post-Fukushima. And we have not found significant deficiencies with our current design basis features, so I am not anticipating at all any large expenditures around the minor deficiencies that we did find. But until such time NRC is more specific about whether or not further strengthening of our seismic or flooding defenses will be required, I can't really speculate the costs. I do know that again, though, those would lend themselves to onetime capital costs instead of ongoing O&M commitments that we'll have to make year-over-year.
Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.: That's helpful, actually. On the enhancing the statement -- station blackout mitigation capability, it seems to me that the types of steps that NRC is got in mind are not dissimilar to those that you probably had to take when they looked at the potential for an airplane impact on your nuclear power plants after 9-11, although this time, they're also contemplating, I guess, a 2-station blackout, 2-unit black out. When I went back and looked at your CapEx numbers at ExGen in the years following 9-11, I really couldn't see a major upward move in capital expenditures. Is that a fair read across the likely implications of these new guidelines?
Charles Pardee: I think that is a fair read across. Now -- and as you can tell, both John and I are both hedging our answers with there is little definition to what the specific actions that we'll undertake actually are. But I think you have that directionally correct. It appears thus far that we'll end up doing, generally speaking, more of the same in improving the robustness of our layers of protection. And certainly, not starting from a redesign of significant safety systems or anything like that.
John Rowe: Hugh, I don't know if this is helpful or not, but it's the best I can do. After TMI, there were major structural changes in plant design requirements. It seems to me that the tone of the post-Fukushima review is not that we'll go back and redesign all the old plants, it's that we'll have to have more consistent measures in place to respond to things that might exceed the design basis. I think Chip and his colleagues call those SAMGs. But they tend to be much lower in expense than major rebuilds, and you might take a look at it that way.
Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.: I guess that was exactly my final question. The third recommendation, strengthening emergency preparedness at the plants is what possibly could give rise to higher O&M costs. And I noticed going back again to ExGen's experience in the years following 9-11 that the major increase in costs that was seen there was really associated with O&M. And I know at the time, you guys had to go out and hire mercenaries like a renaissance prince to protect your plants. But is there a concern that you may face a significant uptick in O&M costs due to the need to strengthen the emergency...
Charles Pardee: From all we can see right now, Hugh, the answer to that question would be no. And if, for some reason, the complexion changes, as John said, we'll get back to you in prompt order. But I just am not seeing it at all. The defenses that we're talking about with regard to robustness against natural disasters and such are aren't the same as adding security officers as the history around 9-11 dictated.
Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.: Right. So in summary, you guys are not really that concerned about either investment cost increases or O&M cost increases as a result of these recommendations?
John Rowe: Hugh, we're not in any panic at all, but we take every round of this with pilgrim-like gravity. I mean, this was a massive nuclear accident. While small compared to the tsunami and earthquake itself, it's still somewhere between TMI and Chernobyl on the bad things scale. And we will take everything the NRC is doing with the greatest seriousness. We will work with them as closely as they will let us to get efficient and effective responses to this. But I think what we're saying is we don't, at the moment, see anything that has a major impact on the economics of these plants.
Operator: Your next question comes from Brian Chin of Citigroup.
Brian Chin - Citigroup Inc: Recently -- on the merger developments, recently, there's been a few parties that have seemed to signal that further plant divestitures beyond what you guys have announced might be necessary. Can you just provide any comment or color on that?
John Rowe: Bill Von Hoene will pick that up.
William Von Hoene: We did, as we previously stated, a very careful analysis prior to the filing of our agreement and in our filings with FERC and our dealings with the Department of Justice as to what we believed would be the necessary divestitures with reference to the tests that are applied by those groups. We believe the divestitures that we proposed, which, as you know, is about 2,700 megawatts are sufficient to meet those tests. And we're aware of the filings -- I think you're probably referencing in FERC, the recent interventions in FERC last week, but we do not believe that we will be required to do additional divestitures to meet the tests that those entities had historically used.
Operator: The next question comes from Paul Fremont of Jefferies.
Paul Fremont - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Just as a quick follow-up to Brian's question, based on what the PJM market monitor was recommending, how would that affect the proposed 2,700 megawatts? And would it potentially delay the timeline for approval at either DOJ or FERC?
William Von Hoene: Paul, as you know the intervention by the market monitor did not recommend any specific additional divestiture but did indicate that in the market monitor's view, that additional divestiture would be required without quantifying that. As we studied that, and we discussed this last week, the things we would note is that the analysis performed by the market monitor differs significantly from the type of analysis that has been typically performed by FERC. And so the application of that analysis would be new and would be something that FERC had not done in prior mergers. So our expectation is that FERC will continue to apply the standards and analysis they have used and that we meet those tests and that the market monitor's depiction deploying different tests that FERC has not used will not control. What FERC will determine is whether, based on the interventions, a hearing is necessary, and were there to be a hearing ordered by FERC, that would prolong the proceedings. But we don't expect that, that will happen, and we think we will be able to address all of the interveners in a way that -- which is consistent with other approval before FERC will obviate the need for any additionally hearing will keep us on schedule.
Paul Fremont - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Also when you announced the merger, you had initially talk about announcing the first level of reports within a 90-day period. That looks like it's been delayed. Is there something we should think about that sort of driving the delay in that announcement?
John Rowe: I think the only thing that's affecting the delay since we reviewed some of it with our board just yesterday is just when and how to communicate to certain people. We're trying very hard to keep this a happy merger at -- in both companies. And right now it is, and I think we're going to try to keep a soft hand to make certain it stays that way.
Paul Fremont - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: And I guess my last question is, with respect to Commonwealth Edison, it looks like there's $0.03 that was stripped out as nonrecurring for the distribution rate order. But there also looks like there's another $0.03 onetime item that's included in your $0.15 operating number for the second quarter of 2011. What's the difference between the 2?
Matthew Hilzinger: Yes. Paul, it's Matt Hilzinger. These are items that we've either included or not included in operating earnings in the past and are reversing. And we're just keeping symmetry to where they were originally included. So that was for the money -- for the EPS that was included in ops, that has to do with underground cables and some working capital kind of a lead-lag amount that we basically had reserved through operating earnings in the past, meaning that we took the charge to operating earnings in the past. We're getting recovery of that so we're reversing that through operating earnings. The items that have been excluded from operating earnings that you're saying had to do with severance back in '09 and Medicare Part D, those were originally excluded from operating earnings. And so we're excluding that now. So we're just providing some symmetry as to how they went through the original P&L.
Stacie Frank: I'm going to turn the call back to John Rowe for closing remarks.
John Rowe: I was looking at a summary statement on my own investment portfolio this morning, and observed that the best thing in the last 60 days was gold. Well, I'll leave you with this thought: Exelon is safer than gold, it's got more upside than gold and it pays a 5% dividend, which is damn hard to get out of gold. Thank you, everybody.
Operator: Thank you for participating in today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Teresa, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Exelon First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Stacie Frank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Stacie Frank: Thank you, Teresa, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Exelon's First Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for joining us today.  We issued our earnings release this morning. If you haven't received it, the release is available on the Exelon website. The earnings release and other materials we will discuss in today's call contains forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties as well as adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings. Please refer to today's 8-K and Exelon's other SEC filings for a discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts and expectations, and for a reconciliation of operating to GAAP earnings. Leading the call today are John Rowe, Exelon's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Matthew Hilzinger, Exelon's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by several other members of Exelon's senior management team, who will be available to answer your questions. We've scheduled 60 minutes for this call, and I'd now like to turn the call over to John Rowe, Exelon's CEO.
John Rowe: Thank you, Stacie. It's a shame to waste such a talented woman on the Safe Harbor notice. That seems to be your loss at life.  In the first quarter, we again turned in very strong operating and financial performance. Our operating earnings were $1.17 per share, which meet both our expectations and those we have read on The Street. It won't always happen but it sure is nice when it does.  Our earnings at Generation were helped by the performance of our units in Texas during a February cold snap there. They were helped, as you expected, by the roll off of the PPA between Exelon Generation and PECO. They were also helped by the positive effects of bonus depreciation, which lowered Pennsylvania income taxes.  On the operating side, our nuclear fleet turned in a 94.8% capacity factor during the quarter. Congratulations to Chip Pardee and Mike Pacilio. Our first quarter performance gives us confidence that we will be well within our guidance range for the full year of $3.90 to $4.20 per share. Matt will discuss the financial results in more detail shortly.  I want to talk about a couple of other issues that concern you and concern us. The EPA proposed these rules last month on air toxics and on the 316(b). Both were proposed on time and in ways that were generally consistent with what we expected. We remain confident that EPA will issue the final toxics rule and expect that rule to go into effect as planned with compliance in late 2014 or early 2015. There has been a lot of noise about these rules, and there will continue to be noise as people fight them. I don't think the noise will go away, but I don't expect Congress to do anything to change the rules. The EPA is simply enforcing the requirements of the existing Clean Air Act, as that act has been interpreted by the courts including the Supreme Court of the United States. The last major amendments to that act are now over 20 years old. Neither the rules nor their implementation should be a surprise to anyone.  My confidence is bolstered by the fact that the Senate failed to pass legislation that would stop EPA from regulating greenhouse gases. That legislation only got 50 votes, so it seems highly unlikely that the Senate could find the required 60 votes it would need to block EPA's health rules on mercury, arsenic or other toxins. If the Senate didn't choose to block carbon regulation, it is not going to pass legislation that most people believe will negatively impact the health of babies, children and pregnant women. According to the EPA's estimates, the health benefits from controlling mercury could be as high $140 billion, while the cost of compliance would only be around $11 billion. While one should take these numbers with a little skepticism on both sides, it's hard to argue that the cost benefit differential is not huge.  On the reliability front, the impact is manageable. Each NERC region has excess generating capacity. 2/3 of the coal fleet has already installed or is in the process of installing the controls necessary for compliance, and much of the capacity from coal plants that do retire can be replaced by underutilized existing gas plants.  For Exelon's fossil units, the proposed rules have minimal impact. We have already made the decision to retire our Eddystone Units 1 and 2, and Cromby Station, with the first 2 of these units set to retire at the end of next month. We are evaluating compliance options at Eddystone 3 and 4 and Schuco oil peak. Our share of the expected compliance costs at Kanuma Station, where we own 21% is expected to be small. Coupled with the Transport Rule, which will be finalized in June, we believe that our plant owners will evaluate compliance with the Toxic Rule on a holistic basis. Turning to 316(b). We are pleased with EPA's decision to avoid the "one size fits all" rulemaking. They have allowed flexibility in compliance methods and time lines. Their rules enable cost-benefit analysis and give discretions to state permitting authorities. Cooling towers are not mandated as the best technology available for all plants. It appears to us that screen technology can be employed to comply with the impingement requirements at a small fraction of the cost of cooling towers. We expect the final rule on the 316(b) sometime in July next year. Turning to the RPM capacity markets. You all know that May will be an important date for us. As we have discussed in the past, the environmental regulations will have an impact much earlier than their compliance dates particularly in PJM, where the capacity market looks forward, 3 years.  EPA's proposed regulations, along with our market fundamentals, will be key input into the capacity auction, the results of which will be known on the 13th of May. Coal prices continue to face upwards, which help; natural gas prices remain low, which does not. Milling behavior for coal generators and also for demand response will be key. These are the big open questions that will impact -- affect capacity auction results. Demand response may also be impacted by PJM's filing at FERC this month to clarify the rules for how demand response is measured and eliminate double counting issues. It now appears that the legislation passed earlier in this year to incent new gas generation will not have an impact on this year's PJM auction. We are also pleased that FERC, in its recent discussion involving PJM's minimum offer price, rule called the MOPR [Minimum Offer Price Rule], acted decisively in defending competitive markets and the value they bring to customers. FERC rejected exemptions from them, MOPR for state action, like that at New Jersey, which were designed to incent new capacity with out-of-market mechanisms.  When we take all of this together, our view remains that the results of the auction for Exelon's feet -- fleet will be similar or slightly better than last year, but we simply won't know until we see them. On the nuclear front, we are of course following the events in Japan everyday, as are you. They will be a focus for us and for our regulators, as they should for the next several years. It is clear that the situation in Japan will have implications for the industry here, but it is still too early to define or quantify those implications.  The NRC is taking an active role to continue its strong record of ensuring the safety of the U.S. nuclear fleet. We know that certain areas will get more attention, probably the maintenance with spent fuel pools, the adequacy of containment structures to withstand extreme events and emergency planning procedures to deal with the sustained loss of power.  At this point, we don't see significant near-term implications for the license renewal process. We are fully engaged and will work with regulators, industry groups and elected officials to satisfy everyone with the operation of our fleet. We have completed the four recommended actions from [indiscernible], performed walk-downs at each of our plants and verified their capabilities to mitigate extreme events that we have designed into the process. Nothing in that review raised new doubts about the safety of our plants.  Chip Pardee has testified before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and in the Senate forum in Illinois hosted by Senators Durbin and Kirk. He has briefed members of Congress and their staff on Exelon's response procedures specifically. We expect some increased fees from the state of Illinois. Currently, we are working with the Illinois Emergency Management Association in that regard.  Exactly what the U.S. nuclear industry will be required to do is still an open question, and putting an estimate on any cost is premature. But we do expect there could be incremental oversight or process changes, and we will deal with those issues squarely. Until we have a better picture of how things may change, we have not modified our [indiscernible] plans.  So far in 2011, we have spent $65 million of the $450 million capital expenditure program planned for this year. A large part of that is associated with turbine replacements at Dresden, Quad Cities, and Peach Bottom. We received NRC approval earlier this month for 32 megawatts of uprates at Limerick, which we will bring online this year. We will continue to evaluate the power uprate program as we go, but at this point, it is too early to make any changes. It continues to appear to be a net benefit for shareholders. On other fronts, we continue to pursue ways to increase our value. Exelon Generation is trying successfully to reduce congestion around our units in the Midwest. We have discussed in the past the transformer replacement at the rising substation near Clinton, which is on schedule to be completed later this year. In addition, Generation will invest approximately $5 million in reconductering the 345 kV line to reduce congestion around our Quad Cities plant.  In our wind business, we are moving forward with 230 megawatts of wind in advanced development in Michigan. We will look for opportunities to develop our Wind portfolio further but are insistent that they be based on long-term contracts. So the last quarter was filled with a number of significant events. Life is never boring for Exelon or its analysts or for its shareholders, but we have turned in a very good quarter, and I am very proud of what the Exelon team delivered for you this quarter.
Matthew Hilzinger: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. My key messages for today are on Slide 5. I'll begin by discussing our first quarter results, and then I'll give an update on our latest market views and load results.  In the first quarter of 2011, Exelon's operating earnings were $1.17 per share compared to $1 per share in the first quarter of 2010. Our earnings improved over last year as a result of higher realized energy prices mainly in the mid-Atlantic region due to the end of the PECO power purchase agreement, higher capacity revenue and higher nuclear volumes due to fewer refueling outages this year compared to the prior year.  Exelon's first quarter results were better than our guidance range because of three principle reasons: first, favorable revenue net of fuel and taxes due to an extreme weather event in February; second, a position change in Pennsylvania's state bonus depreciation policy; and third, favorable O&M that is primarily timing in nature. The weather event in Texas occurred in early February, when cold weather and unit outages caused ERCOT to implement emergency procedures. Our ERCOT generation assets performed well, which contributed approximately $0.02 per share to our bottom line.  Exelon's first quarter results also reflect a $0.03 benefit related to bonus depreciation in Pennsylvania. Historically, Pennsylvania disallowed the recognition of bonus depreciation in the same year it's allowed for federal purposes. However, in February the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue issued a bulletin permitting the recognition of 100% bonus depreciation in the same year as recognized for federal purposes. As a result, PECO and ExGen will recognize a lower-than-expected state tax expense for 2011. In addition the $0.03 recognized in the first quarter, we expect to recognize an additional $0.03 of favorability for this item during the course of the year. The key drivers for ExGen's quarter-over-quarter earnings are on Slide 6. You may recall on our fourth quarter 2010 call in January, we highlighted our expected increase in revenue at ExGen due to the expiration of its power purchase agreement with PECO. This contributed $0.19 per share to Generation's earnings in the first quarter.  On Slide 7, you can see a snapshot of our hedge position as of March 31. You will notice from the chart on the left and from our updated hedge disclosures, that our hedge percentage for 2012 is closer to a ratable level. Based on our commodity views, we completed the majority of our sales during the higher-priced periods during the quarter. In addition, the amount of put options has remained relatively unchanged since the end of last year. You can see from the chart on the right the 2012 and 2013 PJM West Hub prices started and ended the quarter around the same level, while NiHub prices have not fully returned to the levels of year-end despite the recovery of gas to year-end levels. We continue to leave a reasonable open position in the Midwest in 2013 in order to allow more time for price recovery. Looking at the back end of 2014 and '15 forward curves in the chart in the bottom right, you can see that the rebound in price recovery was more pronounced in the last half of March compared to earlier in the quarter. In addition to increases in gas and coal prices and the events in Japan, we believe a portion of this reflects the impact of the recently proposed Air Toxic Rule. We recently updated our analysis of the Air Toxic Rule and our revised estimate for the projected impact on energy prices is in the range of $4 to $6 per megawatt-hour. We believe that the 2014 and 2015 PJM West Hub forward prices shown in the chart reflect most of this uplift. However, based on our analysis, it appears that only a limited amount of the potential uplift is reflected in NiHub's 2014 and 2015 prices. As a reminder, our portfolio is essentially open in 2014 and '15, which allows us to capture that upside when it's priced into the forward markets. ComEd's year-over-year earnings are on Slide 8 and additional details are available in the earnings release attachments issued earlier today. Approximately $0.06 of the quarter-over-quarter reduction in EPS was due to last year's catch-up benefit for the uncollectible rider that we booked in the first quarter of last year. Turning to Slide 9 for ComEd's load results, ComEd's quarter-over-quarter weather-normal total load decreased by 0.1% compared to last year as a result of lower usage in the residential class. The quarter results are in line with our expectations, and we anticipate the Chicago area housing market conditions will continue to challenge year-over-year growth in the residential class. We expect to see positive growth in the residential sector in the third quarter of this year, assuming Chicago area home prices have bottomed out by then.  As predicted, large C&I continue to deliver year-over-year growth and small C&I had a modest increase over the prior year. We continue to anticipate flat load growth for the year compared to the prior year, and as such, our prior forecast remains unchanged. Earlier this month, we received the ALJ's [Administrative Law Judges] proposed order in the ComEd's distribution rate case filed last June. The ALJ proposed $166 million revenue increase, which had a $14 million calculation error, bringing the actual amount of $152 million. This compares to the ICC staff reply brief amount of $113 million. We expect the commission's final order by the end of May, which will become effective in June 2011. At the end of May, the commission will also issue their final order for ComEd's alternative regulation proposal, which is designed to establish a recovery mechanism for proposals such as Smart Grid.  In legislative news, the Public Utilities Committee of the Illinois House held several hearings over the last few weeks for Illinois House Bill 14. As a reminder, this is legislation that would enable ComEd to make major investments in the electrical grid to modernize the system and would also provide a formula rate mechanism for more timely recovery of ComEd's costs. We are working to build broad stakeholder support for the bill, and we expect to know more before the spring session of the Illinois General Assembly ends in late May. PECO's quarter-over-quarter key drivers are on Slide 10. PECO's earnings now reflect the new distribution rates from the gas distribution rate cases approved last year.  Turning to Slide 11, PECO's weather-normal total load growth for the quarter decreased by 1.1% compared to the prior year but was slightly better than our projections. The quarter-over-quarter 1.1% decrease was principally driven by large and small C&I, partially offset by modest growth in residential. The growth in the residential class was due to better-than-expected improvements in key economic factors, mainly, increases in real disposable income. Large C&I load growth was negative this quarter compared to the first quarter of 2010, primarily due to inventory restocking that took place in the first quarter 2010 and lower usage in the pharmaceutical sector. Our outlook for load growth for the full year has not changed, as we continue to expect total load to be flat for the year. Turning to our cash sources and uses on Slide 12. We are expecting to generate cash from operations of $4.3 billion this year. Our end-of-the-year cash forecast remains the same at approximately $400 million, which factors in the dividend and investment in our growth projects such as uprates and wind development projects that are currently underway.  We are generating strong cash flows and have also taken concrete steps to further strengthen our short-term and long-term liquidity positions. In January, we reduced our 2012 through 2014 cash requirements by contributing $2.1 billion to our pension funds and increased the funded status from approximately 70% to nearly 90%. In February, we refinanced $6.4 billion of credit facilities at Exelon, GenCo and PECO with favorable rates and turns, and the agreements are in place for 5 years with an option to extend them for two 1-year periods. This gives us flexibility to manage future refinancings. These steps, along with a continued focus on financial discipline and cost management, positions us well to meet our funding requirements, including dividends and growth capital and maintain strong credit metrics. As an additional note, we have provided in the appendix to today's slide on Page 40, more details on the specific calculation of Exelon's consolidated credit metrics. Before I close, I just want to reiterate John's earlier statement about 2011 guidance. I continue to believe that we will deliver full year operating guidance comfortably within the range of $3.90 to $4.20 per share especially considering our better-than-expected earnings in the first quarter and the additional $0.03 we expect to recognize from Pennsylvania bonus depreciation during the rest of the year. For the next quarter, we expect operating results in the range of $0.90 to $1 per share. That concludes my remarks, and we can now take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Dan Eggers with Crédit Suisse.
Dan Eggers - Crédit Suisse AG: I guess first question just as it relates to kind of the RPM outlook with the EPA rules draft that is out there, some decisions on demand response. Have you guys gotten more or less enthusiastic about the outlook for this auction from what guys thought you were seeing at the fourth quarter hump?
John Rowe: Well Ken is always enthusiastic, so I'll let him answer the question.
Kenneth Cornew: Yes. I think we are where we've been talking about being for the last few months. We see the 2 big drivers in RPM being -- have the supply side into this auction, and that is -- the coal plants and how they bid their costs given the environmental regulations John talked about and how much demand response shows up at the auction. So right now, we see -- our modeling shows a result that is very similar to last year. If less demand response shows up and generators bid their costs, we could see some upside.
Dan Eggers - Crédit Suisse AG: Okay. And I guess maybe, Ken, just kind of an ancillary question. When you look at the NiHub pricing and you're not seeing any sort of response for the toxics rules or much of a margin for the coal generators, who are you seeing out transact in the curve to kind of bid away what seems like kind of obvious changes in the market? And are you guys managing your hedging strategy? Is there even a greater temptation to kind of lay off hedging, given kind of the mismatch between the market today and the underlying fundamentals.
Kenneth Cornew: As Matt indicated, we do see upside in NiHub prices. I continue to look at spot heat rates and historical heat rates for the last couple of years and see heat rates in the 7.5 to 8 range. And in the forwards, we're still seeing the low 6s for heat rate. So I believe there is upside in NiHub prices, and that continues to rationalize itself in the spot market. As Matt said, we are adjusting our hedging strategy in accordance to that belief and keeping some more position in the NiHub, relatively speaking, and in '14 and '15, in particular, were largely open as we indicated. So we see that our portfolio is well positioned to take advantage of that upside. That market is not overly liquid, particularly when you talk about trading in the '14, '15 time frame, so we expect to see more rational pricing as that market starts to develop more trading activity as time goes on.
Dan Eggers - Crédit Suisse AG: And Ken, just on the last question, just kind of on market liquidity. Are you guys seeing much liquidity selling '13 and '14 power today in any market? And or is it too fragmented to get a real read on what ultimate market conditions are going to be?
Kenneth Cornew: Again, we're seeing really good liquidity at West Hub, and that market has a lot of participants. And NiHub it's -- it tends to be more in lumps. When the Illinois Power Authority comes out to procure more power going forward for a couple -- on behalf of our and ComEd customers, we will likely see liquidity at that time in the NiHub market. But the NiHub market is relatively thin in that '14, '15 time frame in particular.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank
Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG: I'd just like to follow up on Dan's question a bit. You say you're largely open in '14 and '15, but which implies that you have got some positions on in those years, and you also said the market is very liquid. So you know, is this a change -- have you done some hedging that might have been contributing to pressuring the curve? Or -- and are you sort of backing off doing that? Or is it -- have you really just done nothing?
Kenneth Cornew: Jonathan, we have done some hedging in 2014 commensurate with our ratable hedging program. We did see, at the beginning of the quarter, some pressure on NiHub prices likely driven by entities doing some hedging. We did most of our hedging early in the quarter, and we think the market's rebounded somewhat because that pressure has backed off.
Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG: Okay, so your lesser -- you were more active and now you're less active in those out years, basically?
Kenneth Cornew: That's correct. And obviously, we look for all the different channels. We talked about the hedge, not just underlying OTC [over-the-counter] transactions, it's the retail business, it's potential put option strategy, it's different locations like Ad Hub [ph], it's different locations in the East relative to load auctions and the retail business. So there are wide variety of channels for us to perform our hedges in 2014.
Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG: And Ken, have you sort of tried to gauge the timing for when the market sort of will reflect, you know, your view of fundamentals and then the kind of where we're headed on environmental? Do the rules have to go final? What's the catalyst? Is it just a time issue, how far away we are...
Kenneth Cornew: Jonathan, I think a lot of it is how far away we are, and I think it's going to be time. Clearly, if the rules become final and more knowledge is out there as to what the plants are actually doing, that will end up being reflected in power markets, so that will help. But I think time is the biggest issue right now and it's just going to take some time for the markets to rationalize what we think they will.
Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG: Okay. And if I may, just on -- I noticed that the nuclear uprate CapEx that you referenced in the slide ticked down from $475 million to $450 million for this year was when, intuitively with -- I guess, you'd think the cost of doing things like this might be on the rise. Has the scope changed or is the cost that's changed? Or what drove that?
John Rowe: Ken will get that.
Kenneth Cornew: No, Jonathan, it's just timing. The project's scope hasn't changed. Execution and building, things like that have some flexibility as we work through the projects, but they're still on budget, and we'll adjust the timing over the next quarters and you're still on schedule.
Operator: Your next question is from Hugh Wynne with Sanford Bernstein.
Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.: I'd like to get your updated views on what impact we might expect on kind of maintenance CapEx for the nuclear fleet from Fukushima Daiichi and the cooling tower regulation. I know that we don't have the NRC recommendations on hand, so it's impossible to give a detailed response to what they're going to say. But on the other hand, I think you mentioned that the adequacy of containment structures is obviously an issue that's going to arise from there now or so. If we had to begin to think about the implications of Fukushima Daiichi and the cooling tower regulations on your fleet, could you perhaps talk to the units that might be affected and how we might scale potential capital expenditure implications?
John Rowe: I'll let Chris start, because he knows the detail much better than I, to kind of give you a little frosting that I can't. Go ahead Chris.
Christopher Crane: Just breaking down. The way the 316(b) was issued for review, we feel there's a lot more flexibility and it's not "one size fits all," which would drive us into more expensive remediation methodologies to cooling towers. So we have -- and we'll continue to evaluate our fleet. But we do not see a material increase in capital expenditure required for the cooling towers. Now that said, it's a state-by-state interpretation and we'll continue to monitor over the next couple of years as permits come up, how we work within the states. Our biggest issue in that area has been in -- is reflected in our decision at Oyster Creek based off of the state's decision there for the Barnegat Bay. On Fukushima, we think that the analysis that is under way will continue to support the design -- the structural design of our various reactor types, and it will reaffirm our operating strategies to ensure that we do not challenge the structural integrity as a potential event happens. We see the expense and the focus coming more in operating strategies in preparations for beyond-design basis accidents, things you just can't anticipate, and we'll work with the regulator and the industry on those. We have differentiated ourselves significantly in operating strategy. And everybody's read the articles over the last couple of weeks that have been in most of the papers and they've heard from the U.S. regulators and the administration, many politicians about those differences. So we're not anticipating large capital expenditures, maintenance CapEx or installation of any major upgrades and we'll just continue to work. Trying to quantify the expense where we think more of it will come in, it's too early now. Again, I don't see it as significantly material at this point. But Chip Pardee is leading the industry group, working with NEI and INPO to make sure that we're closely in communication with the regulators and the administration -- the politicians so we can resolve the concerns and continue with the high safety records in preparation standards that we have.
Matthew Hilzinger: I can't do the detail as well as Chris does, and you all know that we can't preclude the possibility of some material CapEx requirements. But I really think you ought to focus on the fact that from everything I know, and I think I'm speaking for my colleagues too, the fundamental problems here were not with the Mark 1 containments themselves. The fundamental problems here were with getting fuel to the diesel generators and responding to a situation that they lost outside power. And that is something we've already gone a lot to address at our plants. And as Chris started to say, in fact, did say, we've already been doing things to deal with that and expect to be asked to do some more. Chris, did I overstate that?
Christopher Crane: No, no, that's right.
Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.: If I could just ask one quick follow-up to that, your plants are located near two large metropolitan centers. And I think one of the more remarkable things about the Fukushima Daiichi disaster is that the scale of the evacuation that was required from the vicinity of the plant. Have state officials indicated that there is any concern on their part regarding evacuation plans or the feasibility of evacuation in the event of a problem?
Christopher Crane: No, we haven't had any dialogue with the states on any level of concern about that. It will be a subject that will come up. We believe our current evacuation plans are at the right level. They don't just stop at 10 miles. I mean, we've talk about a 10-mile EPZ. We actually do have monitoring out further than 10 miles where protective actions could be stated if warranted. I think the reality is our operating practices would prevent us from getting beyond those -- that limit. You'll hear a lot from anti groups using that as a major issue, and they'll be trying to use that to attack specific plants that they've been after for years. But we just -- we don't see that as being a valid issue, and we think that the debate will take place and the regulator, we'll be looking at it. But we don't see any changes or anticipate changes.
Operator: Your next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs
Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: I've got a question for you. In the EPA analysis of the HAP [hazardous air pollutant] MACT [maximum achievable control technology] rule, they outlined that the anticipated amount of wet scrubbing was going to be minimal, and that it was going to be mostly dry sorbent injection and maybe a little bit of dry scrubbing. Just curious, do you think that's viable both on Appalachian coal and PRB [powder river basin] coal? And how do you think about what the potential different uplift in power prices would be under one set of solutions, meaning maybe wet scrubbing versus under another dry scrubbing and sorbent injections?
John Rowe: Well, since I thought all this stuff was coming, I sold the coal, so I'm not the expert on that. And I'm going to let Joe Dominguez, who is, respond to that one.
Joseph Dominguez: Thanks, John. I think it is going to be different for PRB units, where we have predicted for some time that DSI [dry sorbent injection] is an option. I think you're probably going to see more scrubbing, more wet scrubbing and dry scrubbing on Appalachian units, and perhaps a little bit more than EPA has predicted in its models. Where DSI applies, there is obviously going to be a variable-cost impact, and we're going to look very carefully at what happens with SO2 emissions. And it's -- there's a potential there that you could see on a megawatt-hour basis, an increase in variable costs of somewhere between $4 to $8, depending on how much SO2 has to come out if you use a dry scrubber. In that instance, the impact isn't necessarily felt in the capacity market, but on the energy side of the equation where units remain, they don't retire, but they have higher variable costs and higher dispatch costs.
Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Got it. John, just curious, different topic. Your kind of latest thoughts on industry consolidation on M&A and on your broader portfolio of assets and companies.
John Rowe: My latest thoughts are just what my thoughts have been for several years. I keep saying that consolidation makes sense in this industry, that it's essential in this industry. We always look and we're as cold-blooded as it can be when it comes down to the economics. We won't overpay for a deal and we won't enter transactions that give away all of our upside to a power market recovery. It's really important to us. We've talked to enough of you about it to know that you don't want us to do that. We won't give up our financial discipline and we're committed to protecting our investment-grade rating. I mean we know that we would have a prettier, more balanced company if we had a larger share of regulated operations along with our generating business. But simple, plain old shareholder value trumps that sort of strategy every time, so we are where we have been. I'm reminded, my troops didn't tell me to say this, So I'm probably out on a limb, but the Pope was asked to comment on Mel Gibson's movie about the crucifixion, and he had said, "it was as it was." We are as we were.
Operator: Your next question is from Brian Chin with Citigroup
Brian Chin - Citigroup Inc: Following up on a key wins question on gigawatts for coal retirements. Can you give a little bit more color on how you thought about the site-wide averaging rule? And how many units may not be shut down because they happen to share a site with another unit that has to clean their scrub? Can you just give a little bit more color and how you thought about that?
John Rowe: Yes. Joe, you want to cover that?
Joseph Dominguez: Sure. Presently, Brian, we don't see the site-wide averaging as being an option that's going to be available to a lot of units. It doesn't necessarily affect our retirement analysis at all materially.
Operator: Your next question is from Paul Fremont of Jefferies & Company.
Paul Fremont - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: I guess, John, you've mentioned in past conference calls, you've talked about possible combinations I guess, with Nicor, with Progress. I was just wondering if we could get a comment out of you on maybe advantages or disadvantages of combining with a company like Constellation?
Christopher Crane: We don't comment on anything specific that hasn't already gone by. And we won't -- this lady is not for commenting on rumors.
Paul Fremont - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Second question would be with respect to your prediction of, I think it was -- I think, $4 to $6 of higher energy prices based on what's coming down from the EPA. Can you give us a sense of what gigawatt retirement assumptions you come to for PJM?
Christopher Crane: We still expect to see a retirement of somewhere between 9 and 11 gigawatts in the PJM territory, Paul.
Paul Fremont - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: And is that mostly -- is that sort of biased towards the eastern part of PJM because of the Appalachian coal versus being able to comply with DSI for PRB?
John Rowe: I think it's more balanced. We continue to look at smaller units being economically challenged to the extent that DSI opportunity makes it a little easier to comply. Natural gas prices and power prices aren't making it easier economically for these units. So when you look at the whole picture of value for smaller coal units, very, very challenged right now, and particularly challenged at least, if we see lower capacity results in the next off.
Paul Fremont - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: And sort of my last question is, I guess, Calpine in one of its -- during its Analyst Day sort of talked about the impact of trona on variable cost as being in the $5 to $15 range. Is that sort of consistent with what you would project as an increase in variable costs using DSI?
John Rowe: Joe, you want to cover that?
Joseph Dominguez: Yes, I just gave a number, a range of $4 to $8, and I've seen estimates that are $10 or more. I think to get to those numbers, you're really using DSI to capture a lot of SO2. To just capture mercury and capture hydrochloric acid, the numbers are going to be significantly lower. But it's going to depend on how those particular owners decide to use DSI to capture SO2 for Transport Rule purposes. So it could be as high as that. We see the range being $4 to $8.
Paul Fremont - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: And your $4 to $8 also includes the various waste disposal costs that are associated with it or not?
Joseph Dominguez: No, that just is the variable costs of it. If you're talking waste disposal, you're talking about the residue and the ash treatment. We're going to see how the coal ash rules come out. That's going to be incremental to the numbers that we talked about.
Operator: The next question comes from Ali Agha from SunTrust
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: John, when I hear your message on the fact that the fundamentals, obviously, the forward curves, are not being reflected in the forward curves, is there anything that Exelon can do proactively in anticipation of that return to fundamentals i.e. would a share buyback be something you could consider, given your confidence in how the markets will ultimately move? Is that something that you would consider?
John Rowe: We could consider it, but we aren't going to do it. We've gotten a lot of anxiety with credit rating agencies over having -- one was done what they thought was one too many before, and it would be very unlikely that we would do a share buyback. We do believe these fundamentals will turn out for our benefit. We want to keep our balance sheet strong as we work through the trough. And the best places we can react to this are places you've already asked about, which are things we can do with Ken's hedging strategy, his efforts to find longer-term contracts that reflect these realities and our efforts to reach the market more effectively so we're less dependent on pure spot prices.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. Second question, and you addressed that early as well, assuming that the right value is out there and can be obtained by Exelon -- I mean, conceptually when you look at your portfolio, you mentioned the fact that perhaps having a slightly more regulated balance maybe good. But at the end of the day, are there any sort of holes, if you will, in the portfolio that do you think need to be filled? For example, do you think that you will need a bigger marketing organization to go with your large generation fleet?
John Rowe: That's asking the lady the question she already refused to answer. Our virtue will remain intact, at least in so far as I can protect it. Look, we've talked about the things that interest us many, many times. We're not coy about that. We'd like more regulated assets if the price is right. We like more generation assets, especially nuclear and gas, if the price is right. We like more renewables if the price is right, we get enough contracts. We like safer channels to market, and we won't say anything about any specifics.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: I understood. Last question, could you remind us in your '11 guidance, what is the implied ROEs assumed for ComEd and PECO versus what the actuals were in '10?
John Rowe: Matt, will you do that breakdown?
Matthew Hilzinger: Yes, I will. So on PECO, I announced -- and I'll start with '11 in PECO because it's really, I think, it's most relevant now that they've got their new rates in. But their -- the guidance was around 12%. And the bonus depreciation would probably push them a little bit higher on that, maybe up close to 13%, but that's partly what we're seeing at -- mostly what we're seeing at PECO. At ComEd, we target an ROE of 10%, and that's what we would expect out of ComEd over the long term. I think in 2011, we might see something closer to 9% to 9.5%. But we're going to largely see how the ComEd rate case comes out, but we're going to eventually as we go into '12, see somewhere around 10%-plus.
Operator: Your next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank: I wanted to follow up a little bit on the prepared remarks. You spoke about an uplift from the Toxics Rule of about $4 to $6 a megawatt-hour. I was wondering if you could provide more granular view as to what the constituents were? I don't know if you were trying to get it that from, call it a DSI or trona perspective? Or if that was more of a comment relating to retirements?
John Rowe: Right. It's a combination. It's for -- when we run our models and particularly in the Midwest, we don't see that the Midwest prices are reflecting an uplift from these rules. And our models are indicating a $4 to $6 uplift from retirements and from increased cost of dispatch. That combination of elements are both reflected in the $4 to $6. As we said before, we think we are seeing that in West Hub prices eastern part of PJM, we don't see those uplift reflected in the NiHub prices at this time.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank: Great and just to be clear about it, $4 to $6 applies to both PJM West -- or PJM East, rather, for your portfolio and NiHub?
John Rowe: It does. It does, and it's hard to decompose what's actually driving market prices. But we think largely that $4 to $6 should show up in the future in the NiHub price, and right now, at least a lot of it is showing up in the West Hub price, in the '14, '15 or under.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank: Great. And then, maybe a follow-up on hedging policy and all that. I'm looking at -- or contrasting your first quarter disclosures against your 4Q for the Midwest, just looking at the 2013, it looks as if hedge prices implied were fairly low, if you kind of do the back-end available math, if you will. But then, conversely, there was a very high implied price for the last quarter versus EEI. So could you perhaps in aggregate comment, are the '13 hedges, you spoke abut liquidity previously, are they biased towards peak or off-peak? Or is there some way to think about that at all? Just as we look, future call it as you roll forward into new hedges?
John Rowe: And I think you are asking about the effective realized energy price in '13 at NiHub, is that correct?
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank: Yes, precisely.
John Rowe: Yes, but the large majority of that reduction in that effective realized energy price is merely a fact that we put on more hedges at lower prices and our previous hedges were at higher prices, so we're going to see the effective realized energy price come down. Coupled with that in this quarter, we looked at '13 NiHub prices and saw that the drop was primarily driven by summer and fall months. And our hedging position in the Midwest has a significant amount of energy sold in the Jan through May period because of the 3,000-megawatt ComEd swap. So we didn't see as much mark-to-market uplift on the swap commensurate with the price drop that we really modeled later on in the year, so that's helping drive down the effective realized energy price. But again, the majority of that change is merely the fact that we're putting on more hedges in a lower market.
Operator: Your next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Macquarie
Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research: Two questions. One, could you quantify the uplift to first quarter results from the timing of O&M expenses?
John Rowe: I think it was $0.03, Matt?
Matthew Hilzinger: Yes, it was $0.03, and it was primarily related to generation and O&M spend in the nuclear operation. And it was just -- it's simply some work that we had expected to get done and has been pushed off to the balance of the year. So it was clearly a benefit that we had in the first quarter but we would expect to spend to that through the balance of the year.
Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research: Great. And now about PECO. You mentioned the better-than-expected residential load growth, but your assumptions for 2011 went up pretty significantly from 0.1% on a weather-normalized basis to 2.1% within one quarter. Could you explain in more detail how is that possible?
Denis O'Brien: This is Denis O'Brien with PECO. Your question is about the residential numbers? And the growth...
Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research: Weather-normalized load growth, expectations went up from 0.1% to 2.1%?
Denis O'Brien: That's just, I believe, economic growth that we project through the years, through the rest of the year as we have modeled with all of our economic data for the region. I'll ask Phil to add anything else to that.
Phillip Barnett: Yes. I'll just add to that, as we look at the forecasted GNP for the Philadelphia metropolitan area, it's forecasted to be 3% for 2011. That's up from 2.3% of what we were expecting at the time we did the budget. We've also seen a pickup in the employment levels. Unemployment rate is projected to be down to 8.3% for 2011 versus 8.9% in 2010. We're also seeing a big pickup in real disposable income of 2.9%. We've also seen steady growth in the number of customers and an increase in the confidence level of consumers as well. So it's very -- just very positive signs on the macroeconomic conditions.
Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research: Okay and how is it reconciled with energy efficiency initiatives in Pennsylvania and the fact that C&I load is actually weaker than what you expected.
Phillip Barnett: Yes, we are seeing an impact in the energy efficiency programs overall. The deemed savings is about 1.2% reduction in load for 2011 versus 2010. On the large industrials, what's happening there is, we see in 2010, we saw some restocking on the inventory in the first half of the year, which we don't expect to repeat as much in 2011. We've also seen a couple large industrials have some onetime load reductions in 2011. They had a large pharmaceutical company who was a little slow to transition to market, and they ended up using their own gas generation supply load in the first quarter. We don't anticipate that to happen in the balance of the year. We also saw another large customer who had a substation that was out for over a month and basically had to import power from a different supplier, that too, it was a onetime item, which we don't expect to happen again.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions. I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. John Rowe for closing remarks.
John Rowe: Thank you everybody, and I appreciate the compliments on the quarter. We were very happy with it. I just like to finish with this little wrap-up.  As we all know, the world that we were in love with came to an end back in 2008. Since that time, we have delivered operating earnings of $4.20, $4.12 and $4.06. As you can tell from our results in the first quarter and our reconfirmed estimate range, we are in a very good position to give you numbers like that again this year.  When next year and 2013 come, we cannot fully overcome the downward pressure that has existed on electricity prices. You know that, and have been pricing that into our shares for at least a year, probably 2 years now. But I urge you to look at how well this machine is operating. We continue to produce results that are better than the models indicate. I think we can keep doing that as we go forward, and you can't be sure until you see it, which is why we don't always put it in a forecast. But there are a lot of good things going on within this company, and there are good opportunities that Kevin and his team keep finding in the power markets that you can't put just in a linear extrapolation.  So I feel very good about this quarter. I feel very good about last year, and I think we will continue to deliver you results that are just a little better than you might by playing with your models. Meanwhile, thanks for your patience and I appreciate the compliments on the quarter.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes Exelon's First Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Exelon Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Stacie Frank, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.
Stacie Frank: Thank you, Lynn, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Exelon's Fourth Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for being with us today. We issued our earnings release this morning, which is available on our website at www.exeloncorp.com. The earnings release and other matters we will discuss in today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties, as well as adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings. Please refer to today's 8-K and Exelon's other filings for a discussion of factors that may cause these results to differ from management's projections, forecasts and expectations and for a reconciliation of our operating to GAAP earnings. Leading the call today are John Rowe, Exelon's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Matt Hilzinger, Exelon's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by other members of Exelon's senior management team, who will be available to answer your questions. We've scheduled 60 minutes for this morning's call. I will now turn the call over to John Rowe, Exelon's CEO.
John Rowe: Good morning, everyone. Thank you, Stacie. Happy New Year.  2010 was another year of fine operating and financial performance for Exelon. I'll start with some of the key factors. As you know, from our earnings release, our operating earnings were $4.06 per share, handily beating our original expectations for the year and at the top end of the range we provided you last quarter. We accomplished this through a strict attention to cost control across the business. We met our target for operating O&M for 2010, despite starting the year with pension and OPEB expense that was $35 million higher than 2009 and a challenge in our budget of $100 million to offset rising costs. This was our second straight year of delivering O&M below the 2008 level of $4.5 billion. Revenues in Exelon Generation were helped by better-than-expected market conditions across the portfolio. Higher capacity prices from the scheduled reset of PJM capacity rates were expected but nonetheless helped in delivering on our commitments.  At both ComEd and PECO, weather effects, particularly in the summer months increased earnings over last year by about $0.16 per share. I would point out that we saw very little load growth in either company, although, we're always a little uncertain about our weather assessments. There may be a little more than we're seeing, but it was basically very close to flat. We generated cash from operations of $5.3 billion, $1 million more than our original expectations. Our higher net income, our tax planning work and cash benefits from bonus depreciation were the primary drivers. Our cash generation in 2010 allowed us to contribute $765 million to the pension plans, including a $500 million voluntary contribution last August. Separately, we contributed $200 million to our OPEB plans. And of course, the best thing of all is that we returned $1.4 billion to our shareholders through the dividend, which we held stable at $2.10 per share. In operations, both ComEd and PECO maintained strong performance, while managing costs despite intense storms. In each case, we were a little disappointed in the duration indices, although I believe we're either in first quartile or close to it. But we were very pleased by our frequency of interruption. ComEd achieved its highest customer satisfaction scores in more than five years, and PECO had its best ever customer satisfaction scores. Exelon Nuclear turned in its eighth consecutive year of capacity factors over 93%. While that starts to sound routine, it's simply isn't. The management focus that goes into consistent operations at these levels, with a fleet our size, is a clear competitive advantage for Exelon.  We added 59 megawatts of new nuclear generation to the fleet through our uprate plan. We have another 98 megawatts projected to be added in 2011 across a number of sites including Limerick, LaSalle and Quad Cities. For Exelon Power, 2010 marked our first acquisition of wind assets with the acquisition of John Deere Renewables, now, of course, called Exelon Wind. This portfolio positions us as an important player in renewables policy-making. And as we told you before, we have long-term contracts to lock in our earnings expectation and cash flow. If it’s suggested in the President's speech last night, we have continued growth in requirements to purchase renewables. This puts Exelon in the place of selling as well as buying. We also lived by our own creed and advocacy in retiring some of our oldest plants. We received FERC approval for short-term RMR agreements on Cromby and Eddystone through the retirement dates that we've announced in 2011 and '12. We also solved the long-standing dispute with the state of New Jersey regarding the early retirement of our nuclear plant at Oyster Creek. This provides certainty that we will not be required to install cooling towers, which the plant simply could not afford, while still allowing us to capture the majority of the estimated remaining value in the site.  We are preparing the transmission system for a cleaner future. We move forward with $178 million of transmission upgrades in downtown Chicago. We expect to complete these by the end of 2011. Our transmission team is pursuing high-voltage transmission development across the Midwest to move renewable energy to where it is needed most. And Exelon Generation is taking steps to reduce congestion around our units through projects like the transformer replacement near Clinton Station that is planned for the fourth quarter. So let me say that I am very pleased with what our management achieved in 2010. This was a tough year, and across the board, PECO, ComEd, Nuclear, Power Team, Exelon Power, our Business Service group, on a business entities met their cost goals. And in the case, Power Team found ways to get some extra revenue in a very challenging power market. Now turning to 2011. As you've seen in the morning's release, we are expecting another good year, with operating earnings somewhere in the range of $3.90 to $4.20 per share. Our estimate reflects a number of items, which go in both directions. PECO has now transitioned to fully deregulated markets, and new electric and gas distribution rates went into effect on January 1. The below-market power purchase agreement between PECO and Exelon Generation ended, which will allow Generation to realize about $20 more per megawatt-hour in 2011 on power sold to PECO customers.  Exelon Energy, our retail sales arm, is growing its presence in the East as a result of PECO going to market. The pricing on financial swap between Generation and ComEd had a scheduled increase at the beginning of the year, adding about $150 million of revenue, net fuel over 2010 levels. Our financial results will continue to be helped by the hedges put on by Power Team for 2011, which were in the money by over $1.7 billion at year end. That includes the swap in Illinois as well as the other contracts in other regions. We expect demand at both ComEd and PECO to again be flat on a weather-normal basis. Now on the other hand, we of course must continue to limit cost increases and to work ever harder on financial discipline across the enterprise. PECO had a favorable rate case settlement during the year. ComEd is working hard with other utilities in Illinois to pursue a legislative proposal, to invest in modernizing the grid in return for a formula rate structure. While it is too soon to tell the outcome, the proposal would be an economic development engine for the state and would give ComEd more timely and predictable regulatory mechanism for recovering its costs.  As we have reported before, tax legislation passed in December accelerates $1 billion of cash flows. We are using that along with other funds and the tax benefits thereof to make a $2.1 billion contribution to the pension plan. Using the funds for this purpose meets our obligation to our employees. It reduces a long-term corporate liability and takes advantage of the tax deductibility of the contributions. It means that our future operating cash flows are more available for things like our nuclear uprate and other long-term growth opportunities. Needless to say, it also makes those more available to protect your dividend. We of course, radically improved the funded status of the pension plan, and this allows us to accelerate our plans to rebalance the asset mix of the trust. And what we're doing is moving from our present equity contribution to a higher level of debt, so that we reduce the volatility and match the assets more closely to the liabilities. Now, 2011 is going to bring a lot of things that bear on our future value. These include environmental regulations, changes in energy and capacity markets and the prospects for the broader economy. We believe, and every check we make confirms, that EPA will issue its proposed rules for hazardous air pollutants in March, and the final rules are scheduled for later this year. Both because EPA is committed to this end and because there are legal requirements under court order, we expect EPA to move vigorously in this regard. We all know there will be a great deal of political debate about whether these regulations are, in some way, too much too soon. Since we haven't seen them, we can't opine on whether they're too much, but the Clean Air Act's been around for a long time and compliance requirements are hardly a surprise. EPA has shown what we believe to be commendable reasonableness on the 316 b Clean Water rules. The agency has indicated that it expects to issue those rules in March as well. Final rules on 316 b are expected in mid-2012 with compliance staged over some period after that. Lisa Jackson, the EPA Administrator, has stated that a one-size-fits-all approach does not work and that closed-cycle cooling may not be the right technology at all plants. We believe that to be good news for Exelon and the entire industry. So there will be a great deal of news on the EPA front. With respect to energy and capacity markets, situation remains murky. As you all know, gas prices remain low. We are, of course, very interested in the results of the May capacity auction in PJM. We believe they will be higher than last year's results. The question is, how much higher? The reduced demand forecast from PJM will exert some downward pressure on the markets. It is possible that the recent New Jersey legislation to pay for new gas plants will also be a downward force. However, we believe that under FERC precedent, FERC will move to require a reasonable minimum bid price for these units and do so in time for May's RPM option auction. We are also evaluating other options on how we would respond in the event the governor signs this legislation into law. There are very large number of factors affecting the result of May's capacity prices. These include the amount of demand responsive participation, the number of plant retirements that are definite, and bidding behavior reflecting what people really can commit themselves to do with coal plants in the face of both gas prices and the coming EPA regulation. They also reflect timing of transmission upgrade. We keep trying to evaluate all of these moving parts, as do you, and we will do our best to put them all together again once PJM releases its planning parameters and FERC issues its ruling on the demand-response market saturation. However, the reality is that we, like you, will not know the May prices until the auction takes place in May. The long-term trend to us is clear, however, capacity prices must rise if new entrants and to be afforded.  Now as I said earlier, we're all aware that gas prices remain low. In the fourth quarter, we did see tangible increases in energy prices. We had West Hub forwards up about $3 per megawatt-hour. Some of that has sagged off in January, but prices still remain above the September 30 level. NiHub prices remain challenge, but our hedge prices in the Midwest are helping us here. We will continue our ratable hedging policy, which we've talked to you about many times. It has served us well through this period of low prices. And of course, Ken Cornew and his team are constantly looking to lock in longer-term power contracts that give us both some value for our capacity and reflect the value of environmental costs in the long-run price of energy. And while we don't get many, when we look out in the longer term we do see some that give us this sort of value. So that is 2010 and 2011 as we see it. As I said earlier, we are simply very pleased with 2010 performance. And we see no reason why we can't do it again for you in 2011. Matt?
Matthew Hilzinger: Thank you, John. Happy New Year, everyone. This morning, I will discuss our fourth quarter and full year results and provide additional details for our 2011 earnings and cash forecast. My key messages for today are on Slide 6. Starting with the fourth quarter, we achieved operating earnings of $0.96 per share for the quarter, compared to $0.92 in earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2009. Our fourth quarter results were mainly attributable to higher capacity revenues and higher nuclear volumes partially offset by unfavorable market conditions and increased nuclear fuel costs. For the year, Exelon's 2010 operating earnings were $4.06 per share. We are very pleased with our financial performance for 2010, because we were able to deliver earnings well above our original guidance range despite the slower economic recovery anticipated a year ago. Now a few thoughts on our latest hedging activity and current market conditions. As we mentioned last quarter and as you can see on Slide 8, we increased the pace of our hedging activity for 2012 during the first half of the year when prices were higher. And we have since slowed down as prices moved lower. Also, as you can see on the chart on the left, we increased the percentage of put options during the year, which comprised most of our sales above purely ratable sales plan. The use of put options provides downside price protection but allows us to capture higher prices as they rise. Chart on the right highlights that PJM West hub energy prices continued to improve with some contribution from increasing Eastern coal prices. Midwest energy and natural gas prices have remained relatively unchanged over the past quarter. Our hedging disclosures, which are in the appendix of today's presentation, now incorporate all of Exelon Wind's sales. Wind assets located in Illinois, Michigan and Minnesota are included in the Midwest region. All other Wind assets are located in the South and West region. Moving to Slide 9, ComEd had a great year despite lower-than-expected load. ComEd was able to absorb increased storm costs and the impacts of an unfavorable Court of Appeals ruling, principally due to their proactive focus on cost management. ComEd's load results are on Slide 10. A weak economy continues to weigh on ComEd's load growth. ComEd's weather-normal load growth for the fourth quarter of 2010 declined by 1.2%, driven by lower residential usage which was largely a result of the continued impact of high unemployment and higher foreclosures in the Chicagoland region. Chicagoland's regional unemployment rate of 9.3% is in line with the U.S. rate, while the GEP of 1.6% for the region lags behind the U.S. statistics. Looking ahead to 2011, we are expecting flat usage next year compared to 0.2% for 2010. We believe that the Chicago economy is gradually turning a corner. However, we expect the improvement in the residential class will be offset by the efficiency efforts and large C&I growth will be slower, reflecting the stability of the gains experienced in 2010. Turning to PECO on Slide 11. PECO also had a very good year and delivered solid earnings despite historic summer storms. As expected, PECO's fourth quarter results were lower than last year due to the scheduled reduction in the collection of CTC revenue. As a reminder, this was the last year of PECO's CTC revenue collections, as PECO has made its full transition to competitive markets. On Slide 12, PECO's weather-normal load was flat for the fourth quarter and essentially flat for the year. In the fourth quarter, PECO experienced positive growth in the large C&I class, which was offset by decreases in residential and small C&I classes. Looking ahead to 2011, we expect PECO's electric deliveries to be flat consistent with 2010, as a result of larger energy efficiency impacts in 2011 that will offset economic improvements, particularly in the residential class and large C&I classes. Small C&I sales are expected to contract this year, but at a lesser rate than in 2010. Turning to 2011 earnings outlook, we're expecting another good year for Exelon, with operating earnings in the range of $3.90 to $4.20 earnings per share for the full year and first quarter results in the range of $1 to $1.10 per share. Exelon's 2011 operating earnings will be led by ExGen, primarily due to the expiration of the PECO power purchase agreement with ExGen. Under our normal hedging policy, ExGen has been locking in forward sales of its 2011 expected generation at market rates since 2008. 2011 effective realized energy prices for the Mid-Atlantic are expected to be approximately $20 per megawatt-hour higher than they were in 2010. A portion of this increased revenue will be offset by lower capacity prices once the 2011 and '12 planning year rates are effective in June. We expect ComEd and PECO's 2011 operating income will be supported by increased distribution rates. PECO's new distribution rates were effective at the beginning of 2011. For ComEd, new distribution rates subject to approval will be effective in June. Our full year operating earnings estimates also reflect higher state taxes of $0.03 attributable to the recently enacted Illinois income tax rate increase. On Slide 13, our 2011 earnings guidance assumes O&M on a consolidated basis of $4.68 billion, a $290 million increase over 2010 primarily driven by three items: First, $90 million for wage and inflationary increases; second, $55 million for increased nuclear costs driven by two more outages in 2011 than in 2010; and third, $50 million for the inclusion of a complete year of O&M projections for Exelon Wind. Going forward, we expect future O&M increases for Exelon to be more in line with a 2% growth rate particularly in 2012 and 2013. Our pension estimates on Slide 14 reflect our year-end valuation and the $2.1 billion pension contribution announced earlier this month. The incremental contribution will be funded by $500 million of cash from operations, $850 million bonus depreciation benefits and $750 million in tax benefits from the contribution itself. Slide 15 has more information as to why we decided to make the $2.1 billion contribution to Exelon's pension plans. Under the Pension Protection Act effective in 2008, we are effectively required to fund our pension obligation over a seven-year period. With this contribution, our funded status is expected to be about 90% by the end of the year. Accelerating our funding enables us to reduce the risk on the balance sheet and reduce the sensitivity of our funded status and contribution requirements to future changes in the discount rate. The pension contribution improves cash flow due to lower future funding requirements, particularly in 2012 and 2013. It also lowers pension expense, provides additional cushion in our already strong credit metrics and creates additional debt capacity. Moving to Slide 16, we expect operating cash flows of $4.3 billion in 2011. And combined with our strong credit metrics, we are well positioned to meet our operating commitments, make investments in growth opportunities and fund the dividend. As you can see, we expect to spend approximately $700 million at ExGen for investments in uprates and wind projects. As planned, we will continue work on our uprate projects across the fleet, including MUR uprate projects at Braidwood, Byron, Limerick and LaSalle, all of which are expected to be fully operational over the next few years and EPU projects at Peach Bottom and LaSalle. We will also continue the completion of the three Michigan wind projects that were in advanced stages of development at the time of the acquisition. At the utilities, we anticipate spending over $400 million on new business Smart Grid investments and transmission upgrades. As shown on Slide 17, John has discussed many of the key events that we are focused on 2011. As we actively work our way through 2011, we will continue to focus on managing our costs, anticipating events that can have a significant impact on our business and adapting accordingly to maximize opportunities and minimize challenges.  And at this time, operator, we are ready for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Daniel Eggers with Crédit Suisse.
Dan Eggers - Crédit Suisse AG: John, you made a reference to kind of the RPM outlook and some of the pluses and minuses that we've seen since the fall. If you were to add those altogether relative to some of the expectations that you guys shared at the EEI conference, are you more positive, less positive or indifferent to the outlook to the auction results this spring?
John Rowe: I'm never indifferent. That's not one of my sins. We really haven't been able to add them together in a new and interesting way. I suppose, we're a little less optimistic at the moment than we were in September, but not a lot. And we just have to see, because we know a couple parts that move negatively. But there are some things out there going positively too. Ken Cornew, would you like to add to that?
Kenneth Cornew: Yes, Dan, obviously the level of PJM demand forecast that they produced in January would have downward pressure on modeling of prices. Also in consideration of any kind of subsidized generation, essentially as a price taker like what's proposed in New Jersey legislation would also have downward pressure. As you know and are well aware of and have been vocal about, there are other moving parts. PJM's going to issue its planning parameters in February. FERC's going to have to rule on minimum-offer pricing and demand-response saturation. And ultimately, the big drivers, the EPA environmental standards and reduced energy margins and how they play into how coal plants bid in the next auction. So we still see upside, and we're going to be watching very carefully what happens in the next two months.
Dan Eggers - Crédit Suisse AG: Ken, I guess, maybe kind of thinking about some of the forward hedging opportunities and some of the longer-term, full-requirement auctions, with the move in coal prices particularly in the West, where you guys have a lot of generation, are you seeing a forward curve that is economic for people to bid in the '12 and '13 time horizon? Or are coal prices at a point now where there seems to be a fundamental disconnect to the physical power markets?
Kenneth Cornew: Clearly, Dan, the margins from coal generation in the Midwest are getting squeezed down when you look at forward prices. Forward prices and heat rates have moved up more aggressively in the Mid-Atlantic than in the Midwest in the past quarter. And obviously in January, they've come back a bit as John mentioned. I still think there is upside, particularly in heat rates at NiHub. We've talked about how CATR could impact power prices. We think there might be a little bit of that in the forward market, but not much of it. We talked about how MACT standards in '14 and '15 could improve prices more significantly. Transmission congestion has been pretty significant in the last 20, 30 days. A lot of transmission work is going on in the Midwest region. We think some of that's making its way into forwards, and I think that it will turn around over time.
Dan Eggers - Crédit Suisse AG: So Ken, does that mean that -- are you more reluctant to bid Midwest power forward or sell power forwards, or is the hedging bias is more in Mid-Atlantic right now, just because it's a more efficient market from your perspective and the Midwest will come later?
Kenneth Cornew: A little more complicated than that, Dan. But relatively speaking, if we do think there is upside, we will try to maintain that upside outside through option strategy, through what hubs we actually sell power at, and we do consider the different products on-peak and off-peak. I think there is more upside in on-peak Midwest prices. So a lot of what we've done in the past quarters has been focused on the Midwest off-peak. And we'll continue to look for ways to hedge the portfolio, while maintaining that upside. I think if you look at our hedge disclosures and our sensitivity charts, you'll see that we've done a pretty good job in that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Steven Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch: Just first, a quick technical question on the O&M increases, the 2% per year you were talking about. Is that pretty consistent at both the utilities and at Gen [Generation]?
Matthew Hilzinger: Yes, it's close. There could be a little bit over 2% in some areas and under in other areas. But we've set the target to average 2%.
Steven Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch: And then separate topic on the issue of New Jersey that was brought up in terms of this coming auction. John, I think you mentioned FERC precedent would not support what they're trying to do. Could you maybe elaborate a little bit on the FERC precedent on this?
John Rowe: Sure, but it's better that Joe Dominguez does, because I've kind of gone to the extent of my knowledge, I think it's called the minimum threshold. Joe, would you answer?
Joseph Dominguez: Steve, when we're mentioning precedent here we’re looking at the New York ISO case that recently came down, applying a minimum offer price rule in the New York market. There's also been activity in the Forward Capacity Market in New England. These are not to new issues to FERC. FERC has applied minimum offer price rules for these markets. We believe that both PJM suppliers and others will bring this issue to the FERC very quickly, and that will get a ruling before the next auction.
Steven Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch: I seem to always ask of you, John, but now that we've had one of these, I guess, monster mergers, any kind of updated thoughts on your M&A strategy?
John Rowe: We are always looking. We look in different directions. We are absolutely value-driven. We will not change. We will not abandon our value-added strategy out of the loss of an old man, out of the envy of other people's shiny press releases, or for any other reason. But as to the recent two Duke, Progress announcements it looks to me like a very sensible merger. I commend both Jim and Bill on doing it. It's the right way to make things happen. It will make a good company. We, of course, had looked at Progress ourselves. At our current share price, the accretion dilution numbers did not meet our tests. They apparently did for Duke. We have nothing but respect for what they're attempting to do. And we expect to see more of it across the industry. But it is one more example that Exelon is always paying attention. But we do this for value only.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.
Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG: Just wondering if we could get a little more color on what you think is going on with the underlying usage trends, particularly in ComEd, which seem to be coming quite weak compared to what you have been anticipating when you entered the EEI slide, I guess, in early November?
John Rowe: I'm going to ask Anne Pramaggiore to answer that because she's closer to it than I am.
Anne Pramaggiore: We did come through 2010 lower than we had originally expected. What we saw was a drop-off in the fourth quarter, really September through November. We expected a decline in that part of the year but not as dramatically as we saw. And I think our view of that, you have to break it down by class. The large C&I performed very well throughout the year. I think it overall increased at about 2.6%. And we have some sectors that were in, some of our manufacturing sectors, where we saw double digit increases. So I think overall, that sector's strong. Residential underperformed, and small C&I continues to underperform for us. I think we're seeing generally, the Chicago economy lagging what we see nationally. Our foreclosure rates are higher. Repossessions were up 20% over 2009. A personal bankruptcy is up pretty significantly over 2009. Disposable income is not up. So we're just seeing general tough economic trends in our region. And the other dynamic that we think, impacted residential here is we had the hottest July in 15 years. So we had very high bills during the summer. We saw our call center rate increased by about 23%, and that was driven predominantly by customers concerned about high bills. So we may have seen a reaction coming off that hot summer. So that's the way we're interpreting it. We're looking out to 2011 flat, which is we revised. Originally, we thought we were going to see a little pickup in 2011. But based on this trend with the economy in the Chicago region, we're looking to a flat 2011.
Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG: Can I just ask on one other topic on we've seen you go from a hedging position that was well above your ratable plan range to something a little bit closer to that range over the last several quarters and your slides make a comment about willing to recognize future upside, et cetera. Should we consider that where you see the curves today, you're going to continue to hedge slower than plan and allow that trend to continue? Or are we, do we go ratable from here? What's your current strategy?
John Rowe: Well, mostly ratable. But let Ken answer that in detail.
Kenneth Cornew: John is right. We're going to continue our ratable hedging program. As we've said before, we are going to focus on maintaining upside through our product strategies, focusing on the retail market, looking at and watching very carefully, what congestion looks like in the forwards versus what we believe. But we're going to remain disciplined, and you should expect us to follow close to our ratable plan.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Paul Fremont with Jefferies.
Paul Fremont - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: First question that I have is if we go back about a year in time, you had been originally projecting 5% type increases in O&M, particularly at Exelon Generation. What accounts for the improvement to what is now a much more favorable level? And does the pension contribution play a significant part in the growth revision?
Christopher Crane: This is Chris. So the pension has a positive effect overall. You have to, first of all, go back to what we did a couple of years ago. In 2009, we've made a reduction of over 500 headcount in the corporate office. We continue to work on cost-containment methodologies. We had some catch-up in certain areas on some infrastructure spend. But I think overall, this year's increase over last, as Matt said, is driven by a couple of things. More refueling, a couple more refueling outages, the wind expense and others. But we feel fairly comfortable with what we've done in our contracting space and our services space, and what we will be doing in our labor negotiations to maintain that 2% going forward.
John Rowe: In other words, we keep trying.
Paul Fremont - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: The amended rate request at Commonwealth Edison, is that primarily to affect the full year expected impact of the September court ruling?
John Rowe: Significantly, but let Anne answer it in detail.
Anne Pramaggiore: I think we've also had an adjustment in there based on the bonus depreciation. I think that's the big driver of that adjustment.
Paul Fremont - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: You had an $18 million number in there as expected for the fourth quarter. So should the annualize effect be roughly just 4x that, or $72 million?
Anne Pramaggiore: What you see in the adjustment is predominantly the bonus depreciation adjustment. That's mainly what drove it. What's not in there yet is the Appellate Court ruling. That's still sitting to the, I think, 326 now. So that still includes the roughly $80 million from the Appellate Court ruling on depreciation.
Paul Fremont - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: So its annual impact is $80 million.
Anne Pramaggiore: Yes, and you'll see the staff position takes that out.
Paul Fremont - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Got it. If I look at market heat rates, it looks like there's significantly more improvement in market heat rates in the Mid-Atlantic versus the Midwest from I guess, third quarter disclosures versus fourth quarter disclosures. I would have expected because coal sets the price more of the time in the further West you go, that you would see the opposite trends. So what would you -- how do you account for the sort of the relative underperformance of the region that seems to be more coal-intensive than the East?
John Rowe: Well, I think the answer is you want to get to gas, because it's where you are in the knee on the curve. But Ken Cornew is the expert on these.
Kenneth Cornew: The Mid-Atlantic increases in heat rates in the fourth quarter largely driven by what spot prices were dealing, driven by coal prices picking up, also driven by gas basis increases in the East. So really the driver of the Mid-Atlantic increase was a combination of coal price pressure and gas basis pressure. We didn't see that. We saw pretty flat coal prices in the Midwest in Powder River Basin coal. So we didn't see as much of an uptick in heat rates in the Midwest because of that.
Paul Fremont - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: If I look at sort of the effect of the hedges coupled with your gross margin numbers, it looks like ExGen would be up a little bit in '13 relative to '12. Is there anything that we should think about in terms of the utilities, whereby I would guess they should be at least as strong in '13 as '12? Or is there something there that I'm missing?
John Rowe: I think that you're probably right about PECO. ComEd has got to get through this existing rate case and either get a more attractive rate regime than other Illinois utilities have experienced or cut a change understanding with the legislature. Or else it will have to take more drastic cost-cutting measurements including things we really wouldn't like to do. Frank, would you like to pick up the answer to that? This is Frank Clark.
Frank Clark: Well, that's comprehensive, John. We won't really know until we get at least a preliminary order from the hearing examiner with respect to the current rate case probably by the end of the first quarter. I'm optimistic that 2012 and '13 will be solid years for ComEd. I'm very optimistic that we'll either get good regulatory outcomes or efficiency in cost containment to offset it.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Hugh Wynne with Sanford Bernstein.
Hugh Wynne - Bernstein Research: I was hoping you might elaborate a little bit in your comments on the EPA and their forthcoming 316 b regulations regarding cooling-water intake. I guess, I'm interested in your views as to what considerations the EPA might take into account in determining which power plants are having a material ecological impact on the bodies of water they use for cooling water, how they might differentiate among plants on this basis, and what their developing thinking might imply for your fleet? Which plants might be most at risk?
John Rowe: I'm going to start and then turn it over to Joe Dominguez, Hugh. I think it is a mix of analysis over many years plus community activism. I'll give you two examples of that. Dominion has quick-cooling towers in the Brayton Point Station in New England, a power plant I watch when I fly to see my mother-in-law, because -- and of course, used to run, and so I pay attention to it. And there, there were long years of studies on what was happening to the Winter Flounder population and what I think is called Mount Hope Bay. And it was sort of the accumulation of those studies over many years that I think motivated both EPA and Dominion and the ultimate settlement. It was also the value of the plant. There were a couple plants there that could support it. Arguably, you would say the same about Oyster Creek. I mean we thought it should run for another 20 years without the towers. But there were a lot of people who had studies of different weight in New Jersey saying there was localized impact in Barnegat Ba0079. And so you had a lot of political pressure surrounding it. So I think what goes on is a mix of science and community pressure, and that affects both state regulation and EPA. But Joe, can you be more wise.
Joseph Dominguez: I don't think so, John. I could use different words but say basically the same thing. I think what we might see, Hugh, is some recognition of sensitive order bodies are going to be treated differently than the great lakes and rivers. So I think EPA's going to pay a special attention test to where as John just indicated. You may see a change in the design intake criteria threshold but all of it's going to boil back down to some sort of cost-benefit analysis, we think, on the environmental impact versus the cost of the towers, and EPA is going to I think very carefully look at the fish studies and the other biological impacts in making determinations. The thing that we felt was very good Commissioner on Jackson's December 16 letter was she clearly ruled out one-size-fits-all, which would have been problematic for Exelon. But it would have been very problematic for just about everybody in the industry.
John Rowe: I'd like to add one thing, Hugh. I'm scampering out on a limb now, and all my lawyers will be frightened; I like them that way. But EPA technically does not mix its air and water decisions together. Their different statutes administered by different arms of the agency. But there is an overriding economic issue here, which is EPA and the administration are not going to enforce their regulations in a way that makes 2/3 or 3/4 of the power plants in the country uneconomic. And the real issue I think on water is to get at those that are in the most environmentally sensitive area, and on air, to shut down the oldest, dirtiest and least economic. A very strong case can be made and we have helped hire consultants to do it, then you can replace 20% to 30% of the coal fleet and mostly, it can be picked up easily by existing or new gas fired capacity. But I don't think -- once those numbers get up in the 30%, 35% range, the economic costs become much more challenging. And you put too many things together you start fueling the Tea Party objections to everything EPA is doing. And so I think you see some rough practical balance emerge. And I still think that balance will be good for us.
Hugh Wynne - Bernstein Research: If I could, a follow-up question to that. If you've said that you think the EPA will pay special attention to estuaries over rivers and lakes, I guess, I haven't spent enough time underwater perhaps, but what is the difference between estuaries and rivers and lakes in terms of the impact of these cooling water intakes have?
Joseph Dominguez: It's fish concentration, basically, and spawning grounds for fish. So estuaries traditionally have been very rich habitats for fish spawning. So you have an impact on fish larva that you don't necessarily see in the great lakes or you don't necessarily see in freshwater rivers.
John Rowe: I was going to say we believe, like swamps, that I think Joe's answer was much better.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.
Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Can you give a little bit of an update on the Exelon transmission? And can we go and know a little bit of granularity just in terms of size, scale and time line for specific projects if you know them at this stage? Or at least for kind of when you'll make major significant filings for projects at either PJM or elsewhere?
John Rowe: I’ll do my best and then Chris will fill you in a little more. But we started off with Exelon transmission looking around the whole country to see if we could find and develop a number of big for profit projects. What we found was that the local utilities either want the big projects themselves or don't have much interest in somebody like us coming in and building them. And the odds of getting a lot of them done didn't seem too good. So we sort of narrowed the goals of Exelon transmission. I think its real value add is probably more localized, but we do have one big project, which is the so-called RITE line that we're exploring with AEP, which would be a very big project to carry power east. With that, let Chris flesh it out.
Christopher Crane: Yes, that's the biggest project on the tables the RITE line that we announced and we gave a little bit more color and EEI on and we continue to work on the agreements between the co-owners and the design cap, it’s a couple years out for a large investment. The most significant thing that we've done with the organization, above and beyond that, is building the analytic tools inside the organization to do a larger system planning awareness of the whole PJM footprint. So we'll continue to work in partnerships with other utilities as opportunities come up.
Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: A while back, you guys had talked about some of the transmission work in and around the Chicago area, just kind of a planning, I think, in case certain coal plants are not operating down the road. Can you just give us an update on where that stands and what the impact of those projects likely would be?
John Rowe: I'll ask Frank or Anne to fill in, but let me say that ComEd took a look at those projects, realized that there was a significant probability that some of these plants would go down and put those transmission projects into its plans. Anne, do you want to be more definitive?
Anne Pramaggiore: We have a project ongoing. Right now, we received our certificate from the Commission. And we're looking to have that major project, building a new substation and some new conductor heading south of the service territory, south of the city, I should say, through our service territory, and that we're targeting completion towards the end of this year.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin with UBS.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank: I wanted to ask you with regard to the Illinois legislation that you guys proposed a few weeks ago. Just one, with regard to the time line there and the expectations for this year and then secondly, with regards to how that meshes with the Appellate Court case?
John Rowe: Only God and Frank Clark are able to make estimates as to the time line of the Illinois legislation.
Frank Clark: General assembly results should be out of session they should adjourn by the end of May that often gets delayed a bit. But it's very likely, by the end of May, we'll know whether our interest in legislation for a formal rate will be received or not. In the meantime, we still have our rate case going forward, and the timing of that is very similar to the end of May. And we will see. It's impossible to make a prediction how we got a strong rate case and the regulatory results in Illinois have been less than we would have hoped for in the past looking at some of the utilities outcomes. I don't want to be overly optimistic, we’ve enjoyed strong results in the general assembly, so we’ve also have received something less than that. So my best expectation right now is that we are working very closely with the leadership in the general assembly, Anne and John have done an extraordinary job visiting all of the leaders, and all of the decision makers, they know exactly what we're trying to do. And if they embrace it we’ll get a good outcome. If they don't, we won't. There's no money being offered to offset anything. It's very straightforward, it's all about economic development. It's directly related to independence for the State of Illinois and job creation. And I think at least received with warm reception. We'll see what happens when it begins to move in the House and in the Senate.
Stacie Frank: Operator, I'm going to turn the call over now to John for just a few final remarks, please.
John Rowe: Our real news today is simply that we beat our earnings forecast again, as we have done quarter by quarter through 2010. And we expect to perform equally well in 2011. The important things to remember about Exelon are simple. We continue to have the best upside in the industry by far. How much is in '14, how much is in '15, how much is in '16, your guess is probably as good as ours. But nobody else has the same upside. And the fully regulated with the high market to book ratios will have real challenges keeping that. While you're waiting for that upside, we give you a 5% dividend. It got even safer with the bonus depreciation. We're continuing to add capability through our power uprates. And as we've shown you by beating our own O&M forecast, we continue to have capability to find new ways to save money. We can't manage 2013 and 2014 till we get to them. We won't have any miracles. But what we do have is the ability to constantly hunt both on the revenue side and in the cost side for new opportunities, $1 million at a time or $0.01 a share at a time. Whatever we can find, we continue to hunt. We continue to deliver. I have a wonderful management team around me that shares that junk-yard dog attitude towards money. And that's true when we look at acquisitions. It is also true when we look day-to-day. We'll run our models. You run your models. We will beat our models.
Stacie Frank: Thank you. That concludes our call today. We appreciate you joining us.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

===== 2010 Q3  (2010-10-22 11:00:00) =====
Executives: John Rowe - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer  Matthew Hilzinger - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer.  Stacie Frank - Investor Relations  
Analysts :  Greg Gordon – Morgan Stanley Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank Paul Patterson – Glenrock Associates Hugh Wynne – Sanford Bernstein  
Operator: Good morning, my name is Dorothy, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Exelon Third Quarter Earnings Review Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session (Operator Instructions). Thank you, I will now turn the conference over to Stacie Frank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Frank, you may begin.
Stacie Frank: Thank you, Dorothy, and good morning everyone. Welcome to Exelon’s Third Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for joining us today. We issued our earnings release this morning. If you have not received it, the release is available on the Exelon website at www.exeloncorp.com. Before we begin today’s discussion, let me remind you that the earnings release and other matters we will discuss in today’s call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties, as well as adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings. Please refer to today’s 8-K and our other filings for a discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from management’s projections, forecasts and expectations, and for a reconciliation of operating to GAAP earnings. Leading the call today are John Rowe, Exelon’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Matthew Hilzinger, Exelon’s Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by other members of Exelon’s senior management team who will be available to answer your questions. We scheduled 60 minutes for the call this morning. I will now turn the call over to John Rowe, Exelon’s CEO.
John Rowe: Good morning everyone. We are delighted to report that we had another good quarter, another quarter that beats consensus at least until some of you change that consensus earlier this week.  Before I get to the quarter in some of the areas I want to comment on specifically, I would like to spend just a minute refracting. This is the 10th anniversary of Exelon’s creation. The merger ComEd and PECO remains the largest and most successful merger in the recent history of the utility industry. Over that 10 years, our total shareholder return has been 107% compared to the S&P 500, which is only 2% and the Philadelphia Utility Index at 76%. We have increased dividend by almost 250% from $0.85 per share in 2001 to $2.10 per share this year. We have improved the operational performance of our nuclear fleet to capacity factors which has consistently averaged over 93% in recent years. Both ComEd and PECO have improved their reliability record and ComEd has significantly improved its safety record to more or less catch up with PECO’s. We have generated strong earnings and cash flows and continue to do so during a cyclical trough in the commodity market. We have exhibited financial discipline to maintain investment-grade bond rates even while the power markets are weak. The hedging approach of Power Team has created close to $3 billion in incremental value over the past two years to have commodity prices have suffered from. Now, all of this history of course, but we think we have created that history while building what is absolutely the best platform for future upside in our business, and we think most of you agree with that. Turning to the quarter, as you saw in our announcement this morning, we recorded operating earnings of $1.11 per share. Our nuclear fleet obtained a capacity factor of over 95% for the quarter. We were helped by a warm summer in both Chicago and Philadelphia, which contributed [inaudible] of favorability versus normal weather. With constant attention to cost control and constant efforts to lock in, attractive hedge prices helped as well. Our year-to-date results put us in a strong position for the full year. We are again adjusting our operating earnings guidance range currently at $3.80 to $4.10 and raising it to the upper half of that range or $3.95 to $4.10 per share. Hard work with a little good fortune has brought us a long way since the estimates we had back at the beginning of the year. On the last quarterly earnings call, I outlined in detail one of the key elements of our value proposition. We think we have more cleaner, lower carbon, lower air pollution power than anyone else in our industry. And we continue to believe that that power will be rewarded by better prices as EPA tightens its environmental regulations, and as the combination of both tight environmental regulations and low gas prices effect the energy and capacity markets across PJM. Let there be no doubt, EPA continues to move forward. Indeed, it is required to do so by orders of the Federal Courts including The United States Supreme Court. At the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the Clean Air Act last month, administrator Lisa Jackson reiterated her commitment to move forward with hazardous air pollution rules on schedule. The common period for EPA’s Transport Rule expired on October 1, clearing the way for EPA to move forward with developing its final rules on nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides. Now, of course, some of my colleagues in the industry contend that this timeline must shift and there may be a case or two where that happens, but it is a very different thing to the way climate legislation that is to prevent the enforcement of hazardous air pollutant regulation, even tea party people don’t like mercury in their tea. We do not believe EPA’s enforcement activities will be greatly delayed. A change in EPA’s authority to regulate hazardous air pollutants would require rational action to overturn the Clean Air Act. Absent that sort of congressional action and action its approval by the president, EPA’s regulations go forward. Now, while many people say this cannot be, generators are already planning for the future. We have already seen announcements of more than 4000 megawatts of coal to be retired or mothballed in PJM over the next five years. This of course includes our own units at Cromby and Eddystone which will be retired by mid 2012. And we are progressing with FERC on the reliability must-run compensation until that time. There had been other announcements as recently as those by AEP earlier this week of additional smaller and older units in PJM that has been identified by their operators as “fully exposed” EPA regulations. I was wondering with my colleagues how one illustrates this the other day, and what came to mind was a picture of a ‘59 Cadillac. The kind of plants that we are talking about here from the late 40s from the 50s are as antiquated as a ‘59 Cadillac would be today and it should come as no great surprise that their life is nearing an end. We think there are about 11,000 megawatts in PJM, which are at a significant level to be retired as EPA moves forward with its hazardous air pollutant regulations. We will be prepared at the financial conference to show you the form of our analysis of this in greater detail. But when these and other retirements occur and when generators begin to incorporate the cost of additional requirements in the surviving plants, we expect to see both capacity and energy prices begin to rise. As we have discussed with you before the price at which Exelon Generation sells power is fundamentally a product with three factors, natural gas prices which we agree will be low for some time. Energy prices and capacity prices and as you know we have already seen some improvement in capacity prices in the PJM option last May. The upside in future energy and capacity prices are clearly positive for Exelon and its long-term value. We don’t know exactly how much or exactly when; if we did, we would love to tell you; you don’t know exactly how much or exactly when. But we know and you know that this is the fleet that is best positioned to prosper in the second half of this decade. That is why our operating performance, our healthy balance sheet and the yield from our $2.10 per share dividend are all the more important now, simply put Exelon offers the best upside in our industry and a dividend yield of nearly 5% as we go forward. Many of you recognize what a key value factor that dividend is, and Bill Von Hoene’s recent tour to visit you, many of you have asked can you sustain it with the earnings pressure you’re likely to experience in 2012 and 2013. While ultimately, our board is required to make a dividend decision each quarter, I have carefully reviewed our financial and market projections for the next two, three and five years with our boards at our most recent annual planning meeting. Our board shares my view with maintaining our dividend is extremely important. Neither my management nor I nor our board see a early recovery in gas prices. We see the same shale gas pressures as you do, we see the same supply in demand factors that you do. But we don’t need a big recovery in gas markets to maintain our dividend at its current level. And if gas prices stay where they are now forecasted, I believe we can maintain the dividend and continue our planned capital expenditure programs as well of course as meeting our pension obligations. My management team, my board of directors and I expect that our strong balance sheets, our careful hedging practices and our operating performance will enable us to maintain the dividend until power prices recover. And let me be absolutely clear, I personally will do everything I can do to make that happen. Our financial strength also gives us the opportunity to invest in assets that align with our strategy to be clean in competitive markets. Our agreement to acquire John Deere Renewables during the third quarter is one example of that strategy. We have been looking at wind opportunities consistently over the past few years, and up until this one, we had not seen one that met our return-on-investment criteria The John Deere Renewables acquisition presented a very unique opportunity for us to enter the wind business without compromising the coldblooded financial discipline you expect us to employ. This highly contracted portfolio provides a stable set of cash flows for the next 15 to 20 years. These cash flows are not dependent on merchant prices, which continue to be very challenging for wind operations. The acquisition gives us a credible voice as the owner of wind assets in the development of renewable energy policy, while protecting Exelon’s value as the nation’s largest nuclear operator. We have already completed the financing for the transaction at attractive rates and we expect to close the transaction by the end of the year. Turning to our utilities, I have already mentioned the reliability that PECO and ComEd continue to sustain. But let me spend a minute or two on the regulatory and political landscapes of each. PECO has now procured the remaining 2011 energy supply towards customers and reached settlements with the parties in its electric and gas distribution rate cases. The proposed rate case outcome is fair to PECO, thanks to the group work of Dennis O Brien, Paul Bonney and their team. There is only a modest rate increase of about 5% for the average residential customer, after 20 years without a distribution rate increase. I expect PECO will be in a good position to earn reasonable returns on its equity. ComEd has a distribution rate case underway. We expect the first round of testimony from the ICC staff at interveners next week. Our regulatory and legislative position continues to improve in Illinois, but we must continue to work with the stakeholders in both the legislature and the commission. To that end, ComEd filed a petition yesterday for rehearing in the appellate court on the decision relating to its September 2008 rate order. At the same time, ComEd is pursuing other solutions with the Illinois Commerce Commission to allow it to go forward with its Smart Meter pilot program. On the political side, we along with everyone else watch what must be one of the wildest elections in recent memory. We think there is a small chance of a short curve extension of the dividend tax cut during the lame duck session. We are of course working with nearly all our EEI peers on that. The gubernatorial elections in Pennsylvania and Illinois are more close and our leadership teams have good relationships with both candidates in both states. Here in Chicago, we will elect a new mayor in February. I should say very clearly that the entire business community, and particularly myself, will miss Mayor Daley. He has done his absolute best to be a fair and productive mayor and we will just all miss him. But there are a number of very qualified candidates and we have relationships with most of them. I’m confident that we’ll be able to work with whoever wins the race.  Whatever the politics around us, Exelon will remain focused. We are focused on good operations and constantly improving those operations. We are focused on financial discipline, and delivering value for you. We are focused on our earnings and our cash flow and will continue to be. That focus has enabled us to deliver good earnings in each quarter this year, it has enabled us to improve our estimates for the whole year, and I am confident that focus will enable us to continue to perform to the class that we are experiencing in commodity prices. And with that, I’ll turn this over to Matt Hilzinger over to the financial drivers in more detail.
Matthew Hilzinger: Thank you, John, and good morning everyone. This morning, I will provide an overview of the results for the third quarter and highlight a few key drivers and our expectations for the remainder of the year. I will also give a brief update on the recent events in Illinois and an update on our hedging and load forecast. The key messages for today are on slide 7. Our financial results for the quarter are shown on slide 8. As John mentioned, Exelon delivered strong results again this quarter. We recorded operating earnings per share of $1.11 just above the top of our earnings guidance range. Our strong earnings performance was a result of volumes driven by weather and higher capacity pricing at ExGen, which increased on June 1st. The key earnings drivers on a year-over-year comparison basis for each operating company are listed on slides 9, 10 and 11. I won’t step through each driver during today’s call as the drivers are pretty straight forward. I will call your attention to ComEd load on slide 12, based on our normal weather results total load for ComEd in the third quarter was 1.1%, which was a bit a lower than we had expected, nevertheless our positive load was led by strong growth in the large C&I customer class primarily in the auto and steel sectors. We are pleased to see continued growth in the large C&I class, as this is positive sign that manufacturing is still growing in the region. The number of residential customers grew slightly over last year but residential was down from the prior year. We are still projecting year-over-year growth in ComEd’s load, however, we have revised our four-year load growth projection downward from 0.8% to 0.4% to reflect the actual results for the third quarter and our updated view of a slower recovery. Let me now address the recent ruling from the Illinois appellate court. Earlier this month, the Illinois appellate court issued its ruling and response to appeals filed by various stakeholders regarding the ICCs 2008 order for ComEd’s distribution rate case filing on two issues. The first issue relates to the ICC order granting ComEd a rate increase on a rate base that included pro forma capital additions, net of depreciation for assets that were placed in services after the test year or prior to the effective date of the new rates. On appeal, the Illinois Attorney General and others argued that ComEd’s rate base should be decreased by accumulated depreciation for all plants during the pro forma period. Despite a number of prior cases where the same pro forma adjustments have been made, the court ruled in favor of The Attorney General. With respect to this matter, we expect to record a pre-tax reserve of $18 million in the fourth quarter of this year, and a pre-tax reserve of about 30 million in the first half of next year to reflect revenues that are potentially subject to refund. The second issue from the appellate court ruling relates to the ICCs original order allowing ComEd to recover cost for the Smart Meter pilot via separate rider. On appeal, the court found that the use of a rider for recovery of discretionary capital spending constituted into single issue rate making and therefore it was impermissible. As a result, ComEd recorded a pre-tax charge of $4 million in the third quarter and could potentially reduce pre-tax earnings by $7 million in the first half of 2011. We anticipate that the court’s opinion will effect ComEd’s distribution rate case currently under review with the ICC. If as expected the ICC were to treat pro forma period accumulated depreciation consistent with the Illinois appellate opinion, we estimate that our requests were at $396 million increase in revenue would be lowered by approximately $85 million. In response to the appellate court ruling, ComEd filed a request for rehearing yesterday at the appellate court to reverse the court’s September 30th ruling. ComEd is also evaluating other regulatory alternatives and developing plans to address potentially unrecovered revenues in its pending rate case. Moving to PECO load trends on slide 13, PECO’s weather normal activity is up 0.5% this quarter compared to the same quarter last year and about where we expected it to be in the third quarter. The favorable load activity this quarter is primarily driven by an increase in residential customers’ average usage with the small and large C&I classes showing flat to negative growth. For the balance of the year, we’re estimating relatively moderate load growth primarily in the residential customer class. Our economic view and forecast for the year is consistent with our view of the continued slow recovery in the Philadelphia region, and we expect full-year growth for 2010 to be about 0.2%. With respect to the PECO’s rate cases, PECO resettlement during third quarter with all interested parties on its electric and gas distribution rate cases, the settlements reached provide for an overall increase of 225 million in the electric rates and 20 million in gas rates. The settlement is subject to review by the Administrative Law Judge, which we anticipate will be completed in the next few weeks. Final approval from the commission should follow by mid December. PECO’s transition to market rates will be completed when the new delivery and energy rates are effective on January 1, 2011. Moving to Exelon Generations, our detailed hedging disclosures can be found on slide 17 through 26. However, on slide 14, you can see an analysis of where we stand today compared to our ratable plan. Many of you know that we regularly evaluate our hedging decisions to ensure that we are responding to what we are seeing in the market, and also protecting our balance sheet and cash flows. Our hedging plan affords us the opportunity to add value to the portfolio through timing of our sales, regional allocation, product selection and leveraging the wholesale and retail channels. At the conclusion of the second quarter, we were hedged about 57% to 60% in 2012, which was about 11% ahead of ratable plan. There are a couple of reasons why we are ahead of ratable plan. First, in the second quarter, we saw Mid-Atlantic prices rise by 8% compared to the end of the first quarter and more so than in the Midwest region. That pricing was attractive to us, so we executed more hedges in the Mid-Atlantic region and slowed down in the Midwest region to capture that increase. By the end of the third quarter, we have seen prices in PJM West decline by about 8%. Second, we continue to pursue value added load following products that leverage the load following capability of our Generation portfolio. These opportunities are typically in the form of agreements of up to three years in duration and they are in line with our three-year ratable hedging plan. These agreements, which are driven in large part by your customers’ desire to lock in longer-term contracts are procured through various wholesale utility solicitations and our retail affiliate Exelon Energy. As of the end of the third quarter, we slowed down our hedging for 2012, and we are now 62% to 65% hedged, which is about 8% of our ratable plan. During the third quarter, we continue to see a low spot gas price environment place downward pressure on forward prices. Although, natural gas and power prices have been decreasing, prices are approaching a level where we believe there is potential upside in energy prices driven by impending environmental regulations. As a result of potential upside and because of our current above ratable position, we slowed down our hedging in the third quarter, and we expect that we will be closer to ratable level by yearend. As you would expect, we will continue to evaluate market opportunities while we monitor forward fuel and power prices and the status of EPA regulations. Moving to slide 15, which summarizes our sources and uses of cash; you can see we continue to generate significant positive operating cash flow. Our latest forecast for the year reflects our pending acquisition of John Deere Renewables Company, which we finance with Exelon Generation bond offering this quarter. In addition, the Small Business Job Act, which was signed into law last month extends the effective period for the bonus depreciation tax benefit. In fact, we have started to see an after tax cash flow benefit in the range of $300 million to $350 million with approximately a $140 million in the fourth quarter of this year and the remainder in 2011. As a result of the bonus depreciation, we reassessed our financing needs for the year and determined that the $250 million debt issuance previously planned at ExGen is no longer needed. Our updated forecast reflects a yearend cash position of approximately $300 million, which we plan to use to help fund our pension obligations next year.  I am also very proud to tell you that today we closed down a $94 million credit facility with 29 community and minority banks representing a $27 million increase over the last year. This partnership is very important to Exelon, because it allows us to combine our financial goals with our commitment to diversity and strengthen our community relationships. Before I close, I’ll review a couple of items excluded from operating earnings, but included in GAAP earnings. First, we took a $0.05 non-cash charge in the third quarter for the impairment of certain SO2 allowances as a result of the proposed Clean Air Transport Rule. This EPA rule proposes a new emission allowance trading plan that severely restricts the use of existing SO2 allowances currently used in the Acid Rain Program and replaces it with new trading allowances.  As a result, the value of our old SO2 allowances is close to zero. As it relates to the second matter, I’m pleased to announce that we settled the involuntary conversion and CTC matters with the IRS this quarter. The terms are consistent with the IRSs offer extended during the second quarter, so there is no additional charge to the income statement as the settlement terms are consistent with our prior reserves.  As a result of the settlement, we expect to pay tax and interest totaling approximately $200 million with a $500 million payment in the first half of 2011, partially offset with a refund of approximately $300 million by the end of 2013. In addition, Exelon expects to receive a separately refund of approximately $300 million by the end of 2011, principally relating to the settlement of the 2001 tax accounting method change for indirect cost. The agreement is subject to final approval of all terms and calculations by Exelon and the IRS. The remaining tax position associated with the 1999 sale of ComEd’s fossil generating assets referred to as the like-kind exchange matter has not changed. We continue to expect that this matter will be litigated. In closing, we are very confident that we will end the year with operating earnings in the range of $3.95 to $4.10 earnings per share. Maintaining strong operating performance coupled with a close eye on our cost will position us to close out another year with strong results. We look forward to speak with many of you again in a couple of weeks during the Annual EEI Financial Conference, as a reminder our 2011 earnings guidance will not be ruled out during the conference. However, we will provide you substantial information to assist you in your evaluations including our updated hedge disclosures which will reflect activity to 2013. With that, we are now ready to take your questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Morgan Stanley.
John Rowe: Good morning Greg.
Greg Gordon – Morgan Stanley: Good morning, thank you very much. Two questions, the first is as you look out across the forecast horizon over which you feel that the dividend is maintainable, can you comment on your view of where your credit metrics trend, if you are in a sustained low gas environment and whether you envision having to do anything to maintain them that’s different from the current financing plan? And then the second question is, you had an extremely active M&A backdrop here this year, both consolidation of merchant generation and consolidation of regulated infrastructure, and what you see as any sort of predilection on the part of Exelon to participate or not participate in that activity?
John Rowe: Let me hit the first part first. We consider maintaining our investment-grade credit rating as the most important constraint on our ability to pay the dividend. And when we did the modeling that I described and reviewed it with our board, we believe that we will be able to sustain a 30% ratio on S&P’s key funds flow from operation over debt requirement metric. We think there might be room to sustain investment grade ratings if you fell below that to say 25%, even in a stress K in a particular stress year as long as S&P felt that that wouldn’t last for more than a year or so, but one wouldn’t like to complain on that. In looking at our ability to sustain the dividend, we’ve not only looked at what’s happening with gas prices and some variations around that. We’ve looked at our ability to adjust our capital programs, and our continued ability to manage our cost. And in that context we do not foresee having to issue equity to sustain those credit ratings. Now, you can run as many different models as we do, and you can always find one model that might require something like that, but that’s not our expectation or anticipation. And the point I was trying to make very, very carefully is in this environment payout ratios doesn’t concern me much, but maintaining an investment-grade credit rating concerns me a great deal. I’m committed to doing that, but I don’t believe it will require any extraordinary new capital actions to do that. I think the place you should look for us to try to adapt is in some of our capital expenditure plans. Now, switching to M&A, I think by now you all really know me, I have been around longer than moss on oak tree. I am always looking, because I think consolidation is a good thing and an important thing. I continue to believe that good deals remain hard to get and hard to execute. God knows we’ve tried, but we will continue to look and we’ll continue to be absolutely rabid that it has to add near-term value for you, our investors, if we are going to do anything. We believe more scale will be good. We would like to have some assets that are more counter cyclical with our merchant generation. We’d like to have more merchant generation if we can get it to a low enough price. But when we look, we look first at the financial return, second at how we can do it consistent with maintaining our investment-grade rating, third whether it diversifies our own risks, and we’re just very bloody careful like we have been for a very long time.  You all know I am willing to try, you all know I’m willing to fail before I’m willing to pay too much. I’m not going to change on that. 
Greg Gordon – Morgan Stanley:  Thank you.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold from Deutsche Bank.
John Rowe: Good morning Jonathan. 
Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank: Hi, good morning. Can you hear me?
John Rowe:  We can hear you...
Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank: I just – I wanted to clarify one thing John, you said in describing the John Deere acquisition. You said it was – it would give you a credible voice in development of renewable policy, and also protecting Exelon’s value as the largest nuclear operator. Can you give us a little more insight into what you mean by how this helps to protect value?
John Rowe:  Sure. If the government is going to continue to require people to buy wind beyond its apparent economic value; we want to be in a place to sell. On the other hand, we also want to be in a place where we can look at congressmen or a legislator in the eye and say, look we’re on both sides of this table. We can make money selling, but we don’t want our customers to have to pay too much money. And we think we have more credibility by being at the table. But let me say that that’s just a factor in all of this. What really motivates me here is we could have really very safe investment in what is in many ways a more speculative field. But as I look at the economics evolving down the road, and I’ve said this in many speeches, gas is just playing queen for the foreseeable future and almost all the purely economic decisions would be gas.  My political friends on the left want to subsidize wind and solar. My political friends on the right want to subsidize nuclear and carbon sequestration for coal. And meanwhile the market says gas, gas, gas. But as we go down the road five, 10 years, some of those factors are going to change. I think the economics of solar continue to improve, and it seems to me there are possibilities, not so much in the next year or two, but in five or 10 where we have very economical packages of wind and gas or wind, solar and gas. And I would like Exelon to be positioned to do that when it’s an opportunity for either political or economic reasons.
Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank: Thank you. If I could just follow up on another topic, I noticed it looked like you trimmed the spending on operates a little, but, yeah is that -- can you just -- what exactly are you doing in terms of keeping those on track given some of what you said about pricing and about the CapEx in general?
John Rowe: Chris, would you pick that up, Chris Crane?
Chris Crane: Yes, I think what we’re looking at right now is on timing, moving some projects around. But as we described, we continue to evaluate the projects and the basis of engineering are further defined on each specific one, the cash flows will be advanced and the timing will come into play. I think we will update a lot more detail at EEI when we go through our presentation. But this is just the project timing.
Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank: But they still make economic sense, if you’re keeping them in the plan I guess.
Chris Crane: Yes, we’re still positive on them, they are still making sense. There will be requirements as we go along and that’s why we gave arranged on how much we want to invest on each specific asset. 
John Rowe: I mean we have stress tested with these projects, against its fairy wide variety of assumptions that may continue to make sense. But, if we should get an even worse gas price scenario than we foresee, we have to say delaying some of these things might make more sense if the choice was delaying them or cutting the dividend.  But we simply don’t want to cut that dividend, it’s pretty clear what we think we owe you on that, but we are going to do our level best to keep that. Now, where this all gets tied in with the prior question Jonathan is that, as we look at this, you could get to a point of saying well should we come to you and say its worth it issuing some equity to sustain the EPU program, well we might do that if it comes to that but that’s not what we foresee in certain time.
Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank: Okay, that’s very helpful. Thank you for the clarity. Can I just ask one other slightly unrelated topic, but which has really been intriguing us in the numbers? You said that at PECO you have 29% above normal cooling days and you said that was worth about $20 million after-tax to the bottom line versus normal. And last year in Q3, weather was about 6% below normal and 19 million negative, it just seems somehow these numbers don’t quite compute, I know weather adjustment is not an obviously exact science, but it feels like there should have been either lack of an impact attributed to weather in Q3 last year or considerably more benefit from weather in Q3 this year. Could you help us understand that a bit better?
Matthew Hilzinger: This is Mat Hilzinger. Yes, there is some fluctuations, particularly as you get, remember last year we had a particularly cool summer, this summer we had a particularly hot summer. I think there are some – there is always some anomalies in the calculation, but I think as we look at this year, I think there is a total of around $0.11 year-over-year on the core and about $0.06 on a normal basis. So, I don’t weather still heading [Inaudible] add to that, but that’s how we see it.
Unidentified Company Representative : Pretty much covered, it does have to do with more of the extreme weather conditions, the weather normalization primarily done over a 30-year weather normal average and what we saw last year was extreme mild conditions and what we are seeing this year is extreme hot conditions.
Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank: Okay, I just thought 6% last year wasn't that extreme and 30% this year was extreme, but let's follow up off-line on that. Thank you for your time.
Stacie Frank: Thanks Jonathan. Dorothy we will take the next question.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson from Glenrock Associates.
Paul Patterson – Glenrock Associates:  Good morning.
John Rowe: Hi, Paul.
Paul Patterson – Glenrock Associates: I wanted to sort of just ask you on this coal plant retirement issue. Do you see the -- do you see this impact of the regulations actually in the forward curve? And if not why not? Is it because we're seeing new generation in terms of alternatives and regulated generation coming online or demand response or energy efficiency? Is that -- what do you see actually happening in the market with respect to the forward curve and these plant retirements?  And related to that, as you know, there's a first FERC NOPR for demand response that's caused some in the generation community a lot of concern. How do you see that potentially impacting power prices?  Just your thought process on that and on the positive side with respect to power pricing, the PJM scarcity pricing proposal, if you could just give us a flavor as to how you think those two things might affect you guys and just the forward curve and the $64 question is whether or not we are seeing this retirement issue showing up or not?
John Rowe: My own view is that we haven’t seen very much of it in the forward curve yet, but the fact that it’s real probably explains why the forward curve for electricity market isn’t following the GAAP curve down literally. But you asked three parts to the question, and I’m trying to keep you on generalities while Ken Cornew gets his wits together to actually answer that. On demand management, we have a very clear position. If demand management is real, verifiable and deliverable and cheaper than generation, great, but our principal concern is both FERC and PJM is to make certain that which is this is that which is delivered, and penalties are proportionate, if it is not. So with that, partial answer to your question. Ken, do your best and then maybe Joe Dominguez, if you think Ken and I missed anything from, because there were three very different pieces to express.
Ken Cornew:
 : But as John indicated the forward curve doesn’t represent a great deal of price increase flow. The environmental impact of EPA regulation likely doest represent some element of it on a risk adjusted basis, and as supporting a price increase of $10 over the five-year along with all the other fundamental elements that are going on to the market. So, again, a small piece, but it probably is in there on the risk adjusted basis. On demand response and the FERC NOPR couple of points, of course the more demand response that’s introduced into the market tends to clip volatility in the market that impacts power prices.  Our position on demand response is that to the extent it’s economic and competitive with other sources of generation, we are all for it to the extent the policy drives uneconomic decision to increase demand response. I think that will be there for market and there for competition. But another thing I’d say about demand response is at PJM and other RTUs are very carefully analyzing the saturation points of demand response products to make sure that the system runs reliably. And I think when you look at the demand response that’s actually figured in the last capacity market. They are starting to push closer and closer to that saturation point and PJM looks about saturation point at something around 8.5% of the capacity markets. So demand response will have its limits associated with reliability as well as what’s going on with the FERC NOPR. Finally on scarcity pricing, scarcity pricing, we think is essential for a competitive market. When there is scarcity, we should see uplift in spot power prices to incent new generation to come online, particularly peaking and capacity resources. Scarcity pricing needs tight supply and demand and so in the near term, we haven’t seen that kind of tight supply and demand that would result in a lot of scarcity pricing even if the policies in the PJM systems move into that direction with what’s happening and what we expect to happen in the capacity market and the energy market associated with natural tightening of supply and demand and EPA regulations driving more retirements. We would expect to achieve scarcity pricing to have a bigger positive impact on power pricing in the future.
Paul Patterson – Glenrock Associates: Okay, but I guess what I was wondering here is just a few things. I guess it sounds to me like you guys are not opposed to full LMP pricing for demand response, it’s just a question of whether it’s verifiable? Is that sort of what we are talking about?  And in terms of the PJM, and some of there scarcity pricing proposal that they have forward. I mean, if that were to be implemented do you see a substantial potential price increase if that pricing proposal is in fact enacted if FERC goes along with that?
Ken Cornew: On the first point, we are opposed to full LMP competition for demand response. Demand responds should be compensated based on LMP minus the cost of the original generation, so that’s the LMP minus [e-com] and that’s would make sense and that’s what’s economic … 
Paul Patterson – Glenrock Associates: Alright, but if it isn’t, I guess if they go with a full LMP, which is what the FERC NOPR says, do you see a potential negative impact on power prices as a result of this and can you give us a flavor for that I guess.
Ken Cornew: To the extent it introduces on economic and more demand response, yes. We have seen a lot of impact downward on power price. The saturation point on the reliability side will keep that limited.
Stacie Frank: We’ll follow up with you.
Paul Patterson – Glenrock Associates: Okay, I don’t mean to take up too much time, thank you.
Stacie Frank: Thank you. Dorothy, we’ll take another question.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Hugh Wynne with Sanford Bernstein.
Hugh Wynne – Sanford Bernstein: Hi, I just wanted to follow up on the discussion of the balance sheet and the dividend. When I look at your margin, I’m sorry, your hedging disclosures from yearend and compare them to those at September 30, I see that the estimate of Exelon generation’s open gross margin was about $5.8 billion for ‘11 and ‘12 at yearend and now it’s about $4.8 billion for those same years, so down about a billion bucks. It would, one consequence of that might be an effort by the company to reduce its debt commensurately so you can maintain that investment-grade rating through those years when the hedges are rolled off. But it seems from reviewing your balance sheet and cash flow statement that although you’ve generated about $1 billion bucks this year-after-year, CapEx and after-year dividend, there’s no commensurate reduction in the total debt, at least not when I take into account what you’re going to spend for Deere. So what am I to read from that? Do you feel that your total debt is at the right level already in an environment where earnings are no longer sustained by the hedges or would you plan to bring it down significantly over the next several years?
Matt Hilzinger: Hugh, this is Matt Hilzinger. So when we look at kind of our debt level and capitalization, we look at it over our plan in horizon and there are, as you know, in ‘12 and ’13, those are challenge years. I think the numbers, the 5.8, the 4.8 are on an open basis, so we have been hedging and so there’s not quite that same reduction in cash flows that you would normally impute through just a pure open basis. And we have, what I consider to be, adequate balance sheet capacity right now. We’re projecting our FFO to debt metric at the end of the year to be about 35%. As John said, we target a range between 30 and 35. And so there’s some room to take on even a little bit more debt or take on a few or lower cash flows as we kind of go through that planning period and we spend a lot time working at that in evaluating it. And it does go into a lot of the conversation that John had raised. But no, we don’t expect to see our debt come down at all, but we do expect it to have and stay within the FFO to debt metric in 30% and 35%.
John Rowe: Matt, I think what the numbers Hugh laid out might overlook the amount of money we put into pension this year.
Matt Hilzinger: That’s true.
John Rowe: I think that might be the reconciling factor. I’m getting a couple of nods around the table. [Multiple Speaker]  
Hugh Wynne – Sanford Bernstein:  I included pension and OPEB in that calculation. If you just look at net debt at yearend to September 30, including pension and OPEB, I think it's down by the better part of $1 billion. But if you subtract out the cash you raised for John Deere, then there’s not that much change.  So, I think the takeaway, if I understood you correctly, is that you believe the current level of debt is sustainable in the long term even after the current hedges roll off and that you have no intention to bring it down from these levels therefore. Is that put in a nutshell or..?
Matt Hilzinger:  Yes, that’s right Hugh, and I would also say that, but we are also putting on hedges going forward, right? So it’s not just having the current hedges roll off and being exposed to compete open market. As we go through a planning period and we do evaluate kind of our hedging and putting on ratable hedging positions to protect those cash flows.
Unidentified Company Representative :  The ‘11 and ’12 open gross margins have been heavily impacted upwardly by our hedging program. When you are out years and you see neither [ph] of the prices increasing up here $40 by 15 and PGM was up prices getting over $50 those open gross margin calculations are going to be going up also.
Hugh Wynne – Sanford Bernstein:  Great, okay, thank you very much.
Matt Hilzinger:  Thank you.
Operator:  Dorothy, I think we’ll let John make some closing remarks and then conclude the call.
John Rowe:  Well, thank you everybody. We are very pleased with the quarters that just finished, we think this year will finish much better than it looked when we begin it. And as I said earlier that’s due to a awful lot of hard work by all of my colleagues here and a little bit of good fortune on the weather. So, we are planning as you would expect for continued soft economy and continued soft gas prices. We think, we can give you a another good year, next year and what we are really focusing on is how to make ’12 and ’13 a little better than either your models or our models to forecast them, I am confident that we will find ways to do that.  And also that we’re very focused on managing our cash and resources, so we can stay in the dividend, we think 1.9% dividend plus some 20, 15 outside is a very unique value proposition and we’re going to do our best to deliver it for you. So thank you very much.
Operator:  This concludes today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good Morning. My name is Cynthia, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, we would like to welcome everyone to the Exelon Corp. Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn today's call over to Stacie Frank, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Stacie Frank: Good morning. Welcome to Exelon's Second Quarter 2010 Earnings Review and Conference Call Update. Thank you for joining us today. We issued our earnings release this morning. If you haven't received it, the release is available on the Exelon website at www.exeloncorp.com. Before we begin today's discussion, let me remind you that the earnings release and other matters we will discuss in today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties, as well as adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings. Please refer to today's 8-K and our other filings for a discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts and expectations, and for a reconciliation of operating to GAAP earnings. Leading the call today are John Rowe, Exelon's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Matthew Hilzinger, Exelon's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by other members of Exelon's senior management team who will be available to answer your questions. I will now turn the call over to John Rowe, Exelon's CEO.
John Rowe: Thank you, Stacie. Good morning, everyone. As you all know from our press release, our second quarter performance exceeded both our own earlier expectations and your estimates. Exelon turned in operating earnings of $0.99 per share compared to our earlier estimates at $0.80 to $0.90 per share. Matt will explain how we were able to do this in more detail, but constant attention to operating performance across all of our business units were a big part of the story, and so we're improving power market conditions. The weather also helped. We've had so much heat in Philadelphia, almost twice the normal level, Denis O'Brien, who is a bit of a skeptic looked at me the other day and said, "John, if this stays up, I'm going to believe that climate problem you've been working on is real." It is, and we might be even be seeing it. As a result of our strong first half, we are raising our operating earnings estimate for the year to $3.80 to $4.10 per share. Now normally, on these calls, I spend most of my time talking about the highlights of the quarter. I'm going to leave that to Matt Hilzinger today and talk about the subject that most of you are asking us to address. That is our longer-term earnings potential. Most of you tell us that you respect our operating performance. We appreciate that, I think we deserve it. Most of you described our assets as a solid foundation for future earnings growth. That's true too. Most of you recognized that we have some upside next year, as the full requirements contract expires between Exelon Generation and PECO.  But you'll likely question how two, three, four years from now, we will be able to prosper in a world of low gas prices and dimming prospects for carbon legislation. That is precisely what I want to address this morning. Put simply, we expect some drop in 2012 earnings. But we believe by that time that the trough in our revenues will be nearing its end. This morning, I'm going to cover three reasons why we believe that. First, EPA regulations will affect both capacity and energy markets and we'll do so sooner than many think. Second, there are already tangible signs that power markets are recovering. And third, Exelon's investments and rate cases over the next few years give us further opportunities for income enhancement. Exelon is not a passive beneficiary of changing circumstances. Our confidence in the long-run value of our property and our operations is a product of envisioning a cleaner energy future and acting on that vision since we formed Exelon 10 years ago. These actions include forming Exelon Generation as a separate company, thereby, giving our shareholders the upside; selling the ComEd fossil fleet; continuously upgrading our nuclear fleet and most recently, planning the retirement of fossil units at our Eddystone and Cromby stations. Our approach is laid out in Exelon 2020, our path to a low-carbon future. While it is an advocacy piece, it is not just an advocacy piece. It is a way of capitalizing on Exelon's nuclear fleet and a way of positioning our investments to add value for our investors in a world that demands cleaner power. Now let me start with what we see from EPA regulation. Slide 3 of our deck illustrates in a simplified form the welter of regulations that are coming to the nation's coal-fired generation fleet over the next few years. You all know, you're going to make your own estimates of how much Exelon could benefit from climate change legislation, and you all know that, that is not very likely in the near term. But EPA regulation of traditional pollutants, regulations that are now being issued, regulations that are required by existing statutes and court decisions are far more imminent and far more certain, and carry similar positive benefits to Exelon over the next few years. In May, the EPA issued its proposed coal combustion waste rule making, compliance with the final rule likely will be required by early 2015. Depending on the ultimate approach, EPA estimates compliance costs of up to $20 billion. In June, EPA issued new measurement and monitoring requirements for sulfur dioxide. It estimates that those requirements will cost the industry approximately $1.5 billion. And in early July, EPA issued the CAIR replacement rule, now called the Transport Rule, to regulate NOx and SOx. Emission reductions are required as soon as 2012, with further reductions required by 2014 and 2015. EPA estimates a compliance cost of $2.8 billion per year.  Now EPA is also under court order to issue hazardous air pollutant regulations, which include both mercury and acid gas. It must do that by March of next year, and compliance is mandated by late 2014. The hazardous air pollution regulations are likely to be the most challenging and most costly for coal generators to address. Now these regulations benefit Exelon in two ways. First, when investments are made in control technology to address these regulations, they increase operating costs for the coal-fired generators and ultimately increase the clearing price for energy. And second, for many small units, which cannot economically meet these requirements, they will have to shut down. And the loss of this capacity should begin to be apparent in capacity auctions as early as next May. Now you all have seen estimates from various sources, so have we, that try to determine the magnitude of these impacts. The Petroleum Industry Research Association, which many of us use as a consultant, predicts that as many as 30,000 to 40,000 megawatts of coal generation will be retired. PIRA predicts that about 14,000 of these megawatts will be in PJM. Some of you have predicted that larger numbers will be retired. After last year's capacity auction, the PJM Market Monitor concluded that over 11,000 megawatts of coal already did not recover their avoidable cost and that is even before the new EPA regulations take effect. This leads to three obvious questions. How much coal will retire, particularly in PJM? How soon will those retirements occur? And what effect will this retirement have on capacity and energy markets? We know they will be substantial. We know they will be relatively soon. We know they will continue throughout most of the decade. The issue is just how much, how fast. When we at Exelon look at these issues, we are mindful of the fact that these regulations must take into account the need to ensure continued reliability of the system. Localized transmission upgrades will be necessary in certain situations. There will be some short-term reliability must-run agreements, while upgrades are completed or new peaking capacity is installed. But we expect EPA to want those agreements to do what is necessary to keep capacity available and not to incent them to run excessively. Reserve margins in PJM are generally sufficient to enable orderly retirement of coal generation, as these localized transmission issues are addressed. And while some of the EPA regulations will be challenged, this is very different than cap-and-trade. Cap-and-trade required Congressional action to be sent [ph]. New EPA regulations will take effect unless Congress takes steps to stop them and neither political party wants to be against clean air. Coal operators are already reacting to the scissors of low market prices and possibly new regulations. In PJM, coal generators have already announced close to 4,000 megawatts of retirements or restricted operations, these include our own Eddystone and Cromby units and several AEP units. Outside of PJM, Xcel Energy and Progress have also announced substantial retirement plans. More tough decisions will be made in the near term, and they will have to be made well in advance of the final compliance deadlines. The next PJM capacity auction in May of 2011 covers the period from mid-2014 through mid-2015. That is precisely the period when coal ash, the transport regulations and hazardous air pollutant compliance will be required. These will have significant consequences to clearing prices, and the upside to Exelon is unmistakable. Every $50 per megawatt day as a change in capacity prices, translates to almost $350 million of additional capacity revenue for Exelon in 2014 and subsequent years. Beyond the capacity market, energy prices will also rise from higher operating costs for coal-fired generators. Coal-fired generators set the margin in PJM around 50% at a time. Energy prices also rise from a change in the dispatch stack as coal is retired and replaced with natural gas. These changes add up quickly. A $5 per megawatt-hour increase in energy prices would be $700 million to $800 million of incremental annual revenue to Exelon on an open basis. We expect that at least some of that upside will be realized in the next two to four years, as operating cost increase for coal-fired generation. Some of that uplift will come in 2012 from the cost of new allowances for SOx and NOx under the Transport Rule. Based on EPA's estimate of allowance pricing, and EPA generally has the incentive to make its estimate low, these increases could be from $2 to $3 per megawatt hour as early as 2012 and 2013. Now calculating the effect on Exelon is not as simple as it is for a hypothetical level of carbon legislation. But all of this adds together to say Exelon's clean generation will grow in value in a relatively short time. We are of course positioning our portfolio to capture that value. We do that through a continued top performance of our nuclear fleet. Chip Pardee and his team achieved the capacity factor of 94.8% in the second quarter. We do this through our nuclear uprate program, which will add 1,300 to 1,500 megawatts of baseload nuclear power and support reserve margins as coal plants begin to retire. And we do that through our utilities' industry-leading energy efficiency and Smart Grid programs. Now let me turn to the second reason why I have confidence, which is we are already seeing some signs of power market recovery. While natural gas is the least exciting area that we look at, natural gas prices on the forward curve are remaining consistent with Exelon's long-term fundamental view. While we have seen lower spot market gas prices, we continue to believe that long-term prices will lead to reflect long-run marginal cost and the uncertainties associated with that. But more importantly, market implied heat rates in NiHub have already improved in the spot market. They have improved in the forward bases since last quarter, and we believe there is still modest upside in forward market heat rates. This means that even without changes in gas prices, forward energy prices at NiHub could increase by several dollars per megawatt hour for this reason alone. And finally and most tangibly, the PJM capacity auction results announced in May, showed that the competitive markets are working. About half of our capacity is in the eastern zones of PJM. Prices there increased by $100 per megawatt day, just since last year. In the Midwestern RTO ranges, prices started much lower but they increased about $10 per megawatt hour. The demand forecast was up by 1.7% over last year's auctions, and net demand increased by 2,000 megawatts as a result of FirstEnergy's entry into PJM. The higher clearing prices across PJM translate to about $400 million in incremental annual revenue to Exelon as compared to the auctions a year prior. Looking ahead, we project that the May 2011 RPM auction will result in further increases in price across our region. In other words, an even better price than 2010. Exelon Generation is of course poised to capture that value.  Our hedging program protects the cash flows of the company, so that we can invest in the system, support the dividend, maintain our investment grade ratings, all of which are critical to maximizing the value of our utilities and our nuclear fleet. But we also retained the most upside to recovery of any merchant generator. Our 2012 open position is still 50% larger than that of the next largest merchant generator. And to further capitalize on our fundamental view of heat rate expansion, while protecting ourselves against decreases in underlying commodities, we use both gas and power put options, approximately 10% of our expected generation in 2011 and 7% in 2012. Our third reason for optimism is our plan for organic growth. You are all familiar with our nuclear uprate program. In the second quarter, we brought about 30 additional megawatts online at our Quad Cities nuclear station. In transmission, we continue to evaluate and invest in projects that improve reliability and relieve congestion. Exelon Generation has an agreement with Ameron to install a new transformer in early 2012 that will relieve congestion around our Clinton Station and improve pricing for our Midwest fleet in 2012 and beyond. Ameron has already made the requisite FERC [Federal Energy Regulatory Commission] filings for the upgrades, and we expect FERC approval later this summer. Exelon Transmission and various other participants in what is called the Smart Study have completed the first phase of an analysis, which identifies three alternatives for high-voltage transmission lines to connect from Illinois eastward in PJM. Going forward, the Exelon Transmission team will tighten its focus on near-term projects and continue to assess where transmission value can best be captured within Exelon. ComEd filed with the Illinois Commerce Commission last month to invest $178 million in reinforcements to our downtown Chicago transmission system, this would ensure reliability in the event of equipment failures and also in the event some generating units serving the loop are shut down. PECO is already pursuing about $70 million of transmission upgrades near Eddystone and Cromby stations, which are necessary to ensure localized reliability after these units retire. And at our utilities, we are following our respective state policies and developing a balanced approach to our Smart Grid spend. In Pennsylvania, we are required to build out a complete system. In Illinois, we are trying to do various substantial demonstration project, and to seek to understand the technology and its effect on our distribution network and customers. Both PECO and ComEd are pursuing new base rates in their distribution business. We expect that these rate filings, along with reasonable load growth over time will position both utilities to continue to achieve earned returns on equity in the 10% range. In summary, whether one is taking a hard look at future EPA regulations, acting on what is happening in the power markets today, we're pursuing a disciplined organic investment approach to our system. Exelon has and is taking advantage of the best upside position in our industry.  I will now turn the call over to Matt, who will talk in greater detail about our financial performance for the quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2010.
Matthew Hilzinger: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. As John mentioned, that I will provide an overview of the results for the quarter and highlight a few key drivers compared to our earnings guidance, and how we expect the results will affect us for the rest of the year. I will also give a brief update on our hedging activity and load forecast. The key messages for today's call can be found on Slide 6.  I echo John's sentiment on this quarter's performance. It was exceptional. We recorded operating earnings of $0.99 per share, well above our guidance for the quarter, primarily due to two drivers. First, higher rev net fuel at ExGen, mainly attributable to increase nuclear volumes and improved market conditions, and second, favorable weather at PECO and ComEd. Our second quarter results were achieved despite incurring $0.03 per share of cost for severe storms that hit the ComEd and PECO service territories. With respect to the storms, thousands of dedicated employees under the leadership of Denis O'Brien, Frank Clark and Anne Pramaggiore, worked tirelessly to repair damage resulting from severe storm activity in late June. ComEd restored 90% of the 800,000-plus customer outages, resulting from two waves of storms within 24 hours. PECO mobilized its emergency response organization to restore service to the 330,000 customers affected by one storm that lasted 30 minutes. Both ComEd and PECO continue to raise the bar for rapid storm response and delivering on our commitment to keep the lights on.  Our quarter-over-quarter drivers for the operating companies can be found on Slide 8, 9 and 10. In lieu of walking through the quarter-over-quarter results, I'll spend my time providing additional insight into the two drivers that led to the second quarter earnings being above our guidance. Starting with PECO on Slide 11. PECO's demand was higher than our plans for the quarter due to favorable weather. During the quarter PECO's actual cooling days were approximately 77% above normal. On a weather-normalized basis, PECO's second quarter load results for the large C&I class was above our last forecast, with most of the improvement coming from the Manufacturing segment, primarily steel and petroleum. The second quarter results for the residential and small C&I classes were less than our last forecast due to continued high unemployment and the impact of PECO's Act 129 Energy Efficiency program. After updating the full year load forecast to reflect second quarter results, PECO's full year load growth estimate is now 0.1%, which still reflects second half load growth largely consistent with what we told you in our last earnings call in April. Turning to ComEd's load update on Slide 12. ComEd's territory also experienced warmer-than-normal weather conditions. As a result, ComEd's actual results for the quarter were above plan with cooling degree-days for the quarter at almost 40% above normal. ComEd's weather-normalized consumption total for the second quarter was slightly better than our last forecast. Load activity for the large C&I and residential classes was more positive than expected, driven by continued recovery in the Steel and Auto segments for large C&I. Based on what we saw in the second quarter and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we are maintaining our full year forecast of 0.8% at ComEd, with the second half load growth largely consistent with what we told you in April. Moving to Generation. Generation increase in rev net fuel for the quarter as compared to plan is a result of exceptional nuclear performance and improved market conditions. Generation's plants achieved a 94.8% capacity factor for the quarter, the best quarterly factor since the first quarter of 2009. Market conditions were better than our plan for the quarter particularly in the Midwest, where spot prices were higher than planned, which enabled us to benefit from sales of our open position. Since last year, we have held the view that there is upside opportunity in Midwest power prices. We continue to see signs of that view materializing. Slide 13 gives visibility to that upside that we expected. The NiHub and PJM West 2011 and '12 off-peak energy prices increased since the first quarter. At the same time, we are seeing coal prices stabilizing. We believe that the combination of stabilizing coal prices and the modest load recovery is contributing to the upside in prices, particularly off-peak prices. During the second quarter, we continue to execute on our ratable hedging plan. Our portfolio is now 86% to 89% hedged for 2011 and 57% to 60% hedged for 2012. In comparison to the first quarter, the Mid-Atlantic reference price increased by $3 to $5 and Midwest reference prices increased by $2 to $3. And our open gross margin band in 2012 is up $350 million. During the quarter, we sold more in the Mid-Atlantic to capture the higher increase in APC [American Power Act] energy prices compared to the Midwest through various wholesale and retail channels. We are optimistic about further upside in energy prices for many reasons, including the improving market conditions that I just spoke about and the clear signs of recovery John spoke of, including heat rate expansion and the 2013, '14 PJM capacity results. Slide 14 provides a visual of the capacity price results, which were very positive for Exelon given our significant capacity in the eastern zones of PJM. Turning now to regulatory and legislative matters. ComEd filed its electric distribution rate case on June 30. This is the first case filing in almost three years of ComEd. We were able to defer filing rate cases during the recession, largely due to our work to tightly manage cost in conjunction with our work with stakeholders in Illinois, to institute riders like the bad debt rider effective earlier this year. In a separate filing later this summer, ComEd will provide an alternative regulation structure for incremental investments and projects that are outside of the traditional rate proceeding, such as further investments in Smart Grid. We expect the new rates as a result of both of these filings to be effective in June 2011. PECO also continues with its rate cases in preparation for its transition at year's end. During the second quarter, PECO completed its third of four planned procurement events proposed 2010 supply. The next and final procurement event for 2011 electricity needs will occur in September. Let me now turn to recent news regarding the newly passed Financial Reform Bill and its potential impact to the clearing and margin requirements of transactions commonly used in our industry to hedge commercial risk. On that point, we are confident that the hedging transactions we enter into to manage our commercial risk will be exempted from the clearing and margin requirements. And we have measures in place to manage our liquidity now and in the future to support a substantial hedging program. I would like to discuss and address one item that impacted GAAP earnings this quarter but is excluded from our non-GAAP operating earnings. In the second quarter, Exelon recorded a $65 million after-tax charge, reducing GAAP earnings by $0.10 per share associated with the remeasurement of income tax uncertainties related to ComEd's 1999 sale of fossil generating assets previously referred to as the involuntary conversion and the like-kind exchange positions and potential CTCs received by ComEd and PECO from 1999 through 2001. Based on the status of settlement discussions with the IRS this quarter, we've concluded that there is sufficient new information for the involuntary conversion and the CTC positions to require a change in measurement of our reserves in accordance with applicable accounting standards, and the charge to earnings this quarter reflects our view of these settlements of these issues. With respect to the fourth position of the like-kind exchange matter, we continue to believe that we will not be able to reach a settlement on that position, and that the like-kind exchange matter will be fully litigated. Our 10-Q, to be filed later today, provides more information on the financial implications of these tax matters. Moving to Slide 15. You can see our projected sources and uses of cash for the year. We continue to be on track for 2010 with anticipated cash from operations of $4.6 billion.  Turning to Slide 16 for an update on our 2010 full year earnings guidance. We are raising our full year earnings guidance range up to $3.80 to $4.10 per share from $3.70 to $4 per share. We are confident that the favorability we realized in the first half of the year, coupled with our positive outlook for solid financial and operational performance during the remainder of the year support this new guidance. In comparison to the first half of the year, our second half of the year earnings will benefit from fewer planned nuclear refueling outages, increased RPM capacity revenue while maintaining a continued focus on cost control. With respect to the third quarter, we expect our earnings to be in the range of $1 to $1.10 per share, which assumes normal weather. Finally, I want to tell you about the change in when we will announce earnings guidance. We plan to introduce full year earnings guidance in the beginning of each year, and we expect this will be our practice going forward. This timing is better aligned with our planning and budgeting processes and for that end, 2011 earnings guidance will be introduced in early 2011, not at the November EEI Conference. We will continue to update our hedging activity on a quarterly basis, which as you know, drives a significant piece of our earnings. To summarize, we are very encouraged about the financial and operating results this quarter and our outlook for the remainder of the year. The performance I spoke about, combined with the future perspective John shared, illustrates that small changes in market conditions can make a big difference to Exelon's bottom line. This quarter, our earnings benefited from incremental improvements in load, nuclear volumes and market conditions. We are very well positioned to benefit from continued economic recovery and imminent EPA actions. I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Hugh Wynne with Sanford Bernstein.
Hugh Wynne - Bernstein Research: I wanted to ask a question about the estimated impact of the Clean Air Transport Rule that you outlined in your first slide. And I guess my question is this, how do you expect the impact to capacity prices to materialize, particularly in Western PJM, where we see some coal-fired power plants owned by Edison and Ameren and Dynegy to be particularly vulnerable to closure. And the reason I asked is because it seems to me that the scale of potential retirements in Western PJM is sufficiently large that they probably can't be permitted by PJM and maintain desired levels of reliability, and measures will have to be taken therefore to augment capacity. It might include some of the transmission upgrades that you've mentioned, also RMR contracts such as you've mentioned and maybe demand-side management initiatives, as well. And I guess my question is, could you please walk us through how the capacity impact would play out given that some of these measures may not, in and of themselves, actually lead to the withdrawal of this capacity from the auctions?
John Rowe: We see it about like you do. The short answer to your three questions are yes, yes and yes. The way we look at it is, there will be very substantial impacts in the Illinois, Indiana, Missouri area that you described in your comments, that those impacts will be mitigated by combinations of transmission, RMR and demand-management activities. We still see very substantial benefit here for the values of Exelon Generation. And I want to ask both Ken Cornew and Joe Dominguez to supplement my answer because we worked very hard when we developed our Eddystone and Cromby RMR proposals to make certain that we weren't asking for things that were anti-market or anti-green. There are ways to do this that helped in both regards. So let me first ask Joe to comment with his insights on your questions, and then I'll ask Ken to back cleanup here.
Joseph Dominguez: Thanks, John. Hugh, let me break this into pieces. First, talking about the Transport Rule, we don't see the Transport Rule as a driver for retirements, not in its present version. I think what John referenced to in his earlier remarks is that the combination of two provisions in the Transport Rule: One, that it begins in 2012; and two, that it eliminates the value of historical SO2 and NOx allowances in the banks that exist will create a new allowance market in 2012, which, based on pricing we have seen in EPA's power price modeling, we would anticipate will have an effect of $2 to $3 on market prices beginning in 2012. That does not occur as that's in the energy market. That's not capacity market. Turning to the capacity market, we have looked at a number of the analyses of retirements that we'd expect and are not anymore getting worse, as well as pirates and many others that exist. Across the country, if we look at all of the RTOs, there is about 100 gigawatts of excess capacity above and beyond the NERC reliability requirements. So that if we see all of the retirements that are predicted even in some of the more severe scenarios, we would not see a shortage of capacity that would put the system in jeopardy from an overall capacity reserve margin basis. We will see, and John alluded to this, some hotspots where transmission upgrades will have to be made before units are allowed to retire, but the timing is important here. Because the capacity auction looks three years forward, unless the RMR lasts for three years or more, you would not affect the next capacity pricing cycle. So, for example, in the case of our Cromby and Eddystone RMR, we will have to run those units for a half a year and an additional year and a half. But they don't affect capacity prices because we would not bid them into the capacity auction. It wouldn't be available for the capacity auction that would be three years forward. And as a general matter, what we've seen in terms of our RMR agreement with regard to Cromby and Eddystone and our agreement with the environmental authorities, there are two important points to make. One, is that the units -- and there's two precedents for this, there's Potomac River case, and now our case. The environmental authorities typically do not allow you to run the units in the normal dispatch curve. What they expect unit owners to do is run them for reliability purposes only. That means units in RMR status will run fewer hours of the year, and will not have the effect of distorting power price impacts and allow market price signals to reflect the actual need for replacement generation. Secondly, under the PJM rules, units that have not cleared in the capacity auction aren't required to bid into the capacity auction and therefore, they're not treated as price takers. So while you may have a number of units in RMR status at different points in time, they would not be reflected in capacity pricing because they wouldn't be bid into that market under the existing tariff and under the specific agreements that exists in the FERC precedent.
Kenneth Cornew: Hugh, Joe and John I think it address pretty well the retirement situation, also associated with continuing to operate coal plants and those costs ending up in the bidding structure in the capacity market for plants that actually exist. Finally, we also have to consider declining energy benefits from these plants as historical energy benefits decline that results in higher cost to bid in the capacity construct, both driven by gas prices being lower and incremental and variable cost of dispatching these coal plants. So it's not only retirement, it's also the cost structure that defines the cost-base bids for existing capacity that are likely to be pushed higher.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse.
Dan Eggers - Crédit Suisse AG: John, I appreciate the dialogue and I guess if we were to take the conversation a little further when you think about mercury and any other impacts, what it would do to plant closures and necessary rises in capacity revenues, energy revenues, that sort of thing. How do you deal with the regulators by way of managing through the magnitude of rate increases that would presumably come with the sort of earnings transfer you see out the horizon and in particular, as you look at Illinois with the power authority and their ability to contract outside of traditional auction mechanisms. Is there a risk that some of these value transferred never ends up to you because the regulators get in the way?
John Rowe: There is always risk but I would point out that we have a lot of room for upside in '12 and '13 and '14 before power prices get back to the levels in total and in absolute levels or the levels of increases that we were talking about in the 2006 and '07 period. But yes, of course, there is risk and Joe and Darryl Bradford and Bill Von Hoene, Paul Bonney and a whole lot of other people will both be working on managing that risk and also working on ways of handling contractual negotiations so that these increases are feathered in an orderly way. We've been fairly good in finding ways to come up with long-term agreements that soften this volatility on a year-to-year basis, and we'll continue to hunt for those ends.
Dan Eggers - Crédit Suisse AG: And I guess one other question, John. You've had a more outspoken view on where the markets are going to go because of these policy events. Are you seeing any assets out in the market that seem underpriced ahead of what could be a significant recovery as you see the market going?
John Rowe: It's funny, we always see assets overpriced compared to companies. And I don't think we're seeing a lot of underpriced assets out there. We keep looking but the people who have the assets that we think will flourish best in this environment continue to carry pretty good prices for those assets. So we find that chopping is -- still work for parsimonious people.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.
Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG: My question has to do with just trying to reconcile some of the comments you've made about your optimism in terms of seeing signs of recovery in the market and then just how much additional hedging you put on during the quarter? Looked like you added the best part of 10% and when I do the math on what ratable would mean in terms of getting to 90% type range for 2012, you wouldn't have had to add anything like that much. So can you help us to reconcile the amount of hedging you did and your comments on the market outlook, which seemed, in my view, to imply optimism around the near term as well as the longer term?
John Rowe: I will do my best. We have lots of reasons to hedge, and of course, I'll ask Ken to supplement this. One of which is to protect the dividend and the credit ratings in downside scenarios. Another is that the further you go out, the less liquid markets are, and we don't want to be in a position where we have issues over liquid markets. But as I said in my opening comments, we try to soften the effect of the hedging by using -- put options where we can. So we kind of hedge the downside on the basic commodities, but keep a chance to get the spreads that we think will be there. It's a constant conundrum for us and if we ever abandon the basic ratable approach, we'll let you all know. But right now, we think we should, more or less, stick with ratable. We do think the upside is real, and as we become more confident of that, can take it into account when it does. Ken, can you pick that up from there because the tension you described is clear and it's just that we want to have some absolute protection on the downside.
Kenneth Cornew: Sure, Jonathan. John highlighted the reasons we hedged and how we align our hedging with our financial policies, and you've heard that before. And he also highlighted the size of our Merchant Generation portfolio and held us three-year ratable hedging program had tend to allow us to orderly, in an orderly fashion, sell our portfolio in orderly, strategic way. Two or three years out, the portfolio is still had substantial upside from the open position as he has indicated. Another comment we haven't talked about as much in advance is our customers, wanting to buy power in that type of work-time range also. The competitive Retail business is typically a two- to three-year business. Polar options are typically two to five years, but full requirements products being in the two- to three-year range and then Block products going out five years, in which we have an opportunity to get some upside from environmental regulation. And finally, there are plenty of wholesale customers out there that are much interested in having generation in a forward sense than in a spot sense. Don't forget the price uncertainties that still exist in this marketplace. Economic recovery, obviously, spot gas prices still tend to be weaker than forwards and we have to watch that and be sensible about that. And you know the generation supply effect doesn't react that quickly. And John talked a lot about what's going to happen to the generation spot back in the future. But it is slow to react and likely not in this three-year timeframe significantly, and we have weather uncertainty. That being said, we've stayed ratable and we've gotten ahead -- we stayed ahead of ratable with our options as we did last quarter. If you look at that hedge disclosure, we're probably slightly behind the ratable pace in the second quarter in '11, slightly ahead in '12, and we did a lot of hedging in '12 in the Eastern part of our portfolio and very little in the Midwest part of our portfolio. So we try to balance that to keep some upside. So we continue to look at different products and locations and timing, just trying to keep as much upside as we can for you.
John Rowe: I would particularly note Ken's comments that some of his longer-term contracts include some premium for the environmental issues that we see.
Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG: Could I ask a related follow-up? When you look at the forward curve for power out through PJM and NiHub and you see the kind of uptick there is in the 2014 curve, I mean, what do you attribute that to and then to what -- when you're kind of trying to deconstruct the curve, is there -- how much of that is the upside that you're describing and how much of it is just liquidity or whatever else in the curve?
John Rowe: Jonathan, it's obviously challenging to deconstruct, but my opinion is the majority of the movement in heat rates and power prices has been driven by spot prices and what we've actually seen this year relative to last year, we see much improvement in spot prices year-over-year. Congestion is significantly less year-over-year. We see some demand recovery, particularly off peak in industrial sectors in the Midwest. And we've actually gotten some normal weather and a little better weather. So I believe most of what you've seen so far is related to the spot market kind of rationalizing the forward prices.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.
Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Two questions, not necessarily related to each other. First, demand. You're not-weather-adjusted demand trends during the quarter were pretty different, meaning, ComEd pretty strong, PECO, not so strong. Can you just talk about drivers of that and what you expect, not just kind of going forward in near term, but next few years, meaning, what are going to be the biggest drivers of demand differences across the two different regions?
John Rowe: I'll let Denis O'Brien from PECO and Anne Pramaggiore from ComEd pickup in this. But let me say that you accurately described the second quarter. But in the first quarter, PECO had a better pickup and on the whole, we're looking at demand growth between 0% and 1% this year, probably a little better in PECO going into the out years. ComEd, continuing in that vein unless, of course, the Air Quality Enrichment program that's going on around the country leads to consistently higher weather. But we see very soft recovery. We tend to see our very large customers coming back. A little improvement in our residential load, but what we would call the small commercial and industrial sectors remain very depressed. And with that, defers status on that end?
Denis O'Brien: Philadelphia has had rather unique weather here with the first quarter having 70 inches of snow, the snowiest winter in history. A three snowstorms that stormed the region in, interesting enough. And June is the hottest month in Philadelphia in 137 years of record-keeping. So when you try to do your weather correction, you're dealing in some pretty unique space. If you put the first quarter and the second quarter together for us, residential growth is at 0% for us for the first half of the year. We see just a moderate grow from there, about 0.5% growth for the second half of the year. And a small C&I -- the second quarter did not look good when you put the two quarters together. It's about just under negative 3% growth. We saw the small C&I drop last year in the third quarter. So as we profile it from here on out, it's about a negative 0.5% from here. We see small C&I very slow in coming back. I think we're near the bottom there, but it's going to be a long way in terms of coming back. And then in the large C&I, the first half has had 1.4% growth. As Matt said, driven by the manufacturing sector. We've seen steel and petroleum, in particular, are being strong. That's been about rebuilding inventory and some benefit we've seen from consolidation of planned activities and more of those coming in to our region. The load that's coming to the region like consolidation of plants, we see that continuing on. Building of inventory, we do not really see that trailing off unless we see in the economy turn significantly. And when you add them together with some known information we have from the pharmaceutical sector, we see the large C&I pretty flat for the second half of the year in terms of -- comparison to '09. So all-in-all, we stand with our estimates, pretty flat for the rest of the year.
Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Unrelated question -- lots of the PJM assets are either going to incur significantly more cost aka the unscrubbed coal units or shutdown. When you look outside of PJM, meaning the states to your north, to your west, and even some to your south, lots of -- have you looked at how many of those coal plant are actually being scrubbed and whether those coal plants can wheel power into Northern Illinois?
John Rowe: Joe Dominguez will take that.
Joseph Dominguez: Obviously, because of the imports into PJM, we look at retirements not just within PJM, but in MISO and to a lesser extent within SERC. So we have taken all of that into consideration. I think those are the three areas you can put your finger on that you're going to see the greatest impact in terms of coal retirements. This is certainly not a situation that's unique to PJM. I'd say, there are three NERC-reliability regions that are going to be most affected, and that's going to be PJM or RFC has called in NERC space, MISO and SERC are going to see similar numbers of retirements as a result of these new regulations, and we have considered that in our modeling space.
Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: But are you likely to of see a fundamental difference in the number of plants across scaler side that gets scrubbed in the states where, honestly, those plants are under traditional rate-making processes versus those that are in competitive markets. And how would that impact kind of the NiHub market?
Kenneth Cornew: I think there are two view points out there. One is, and I've read one view that regulated states will use this as an opportunity to retire plants and build new plants and the plants that are retired are generally older plants that don't have a lot of rate base value. So they will use this essentially as a tool to reshape the regulatory compact in those states. And obviously, there is another school of thought that don't hold on a little bit longer in the regulated states. The reality is that the cost associated with all of these environmental regulations, and I'm not just talking about air, here but layering on coal combustion waste and potential water regulations. It's going to be difficult for folks to pay for the plants that they want to keep open, the ones aren't really marginally economic or the ones that they really like and would like to retrofit to make them comply with all the environmental regulations. When you add on -- really putting on controls and doing that sort of thing on plants that are economically marginal, I don't think you're going to see behaviors that are radically different in monopoly markets as opposed to competitive markets.
John Rowe: I would just like to add to this and I'll let Ken sure will correct me if they think I'm wrong. But I guess, I see the picture in Wisconsin, Iowa, Missouri, Southern Illinois, the adjacent areas, a little bit more like some of the suppositions in Hugh Wynne's earlier question, the big new units that are most compliant, most valuable, tend to be in turf like Southern Duke, AEP, Dominion and I think if you look at Wisconsin, Iowa, Missouri, Southern Illinois, you tend to see a pretty large percentage of the older and unscrubbed units that would have the largest compliance for scrubbing. I say that based on both things I've seen in anecdotes but, Ken, did I overstate that?
Kenneth Cornew: No, John. You just said it perfectly and one more comment I would add is, regulated states and regulated entities don't typically build or maintain generation to export to other regions, they do it for their customers. So Michael, I would think that, that impact would be minimal from that perspective.
Stacie Frank: Cynthia, I think we have time for one more question, please.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Bank of America.
Steven Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch: I guess with a commentary you made about the positioning on the environmental rules, what does this mean, if anything for how you're looking at kind of M&A, and I guess, maybe, are you still the hyena or are you more of a gentle elephant right now?
John Rowe: Steve, you've known me for much of the last two decades, and you know I'm always careful. We've been calling Hilzinger here at El Toro because of his optimism. But I doubt if anybody is going to start calling me the elephant anytime soon. Well, we remain very value-driven. We always look, we stay oriented towards cleaner fleets, rather then less-clean fleets. But we believe that this is an industry where you need consolidation. But to make it make sense for investors, it has to be earnings accretive in relatively early time periods. And it has to be consistent with our need to maintain investment grade credit ratings. So no, you're not going to hear a lot more trumpeting, trunk-waving or roaring around here. We're constantly looking for how you add real value, and that just didn't get to change as long as I sit here.
Steven Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch: But it also sound like your more focus still is on -- if at all, on value in the generation side as opposed to the regulated side?
John Rowe: Well, I wouldn't say that because we've liked some of the additional diversity that having more regulated business would give us. The problem is that the regulated integrators are, in my view, on an up cycle in their market valuation. And the commodity-driven companies are at the low end of this cycle. So you have to be very careful about using your own paper, which has more upside potential in the future to buy somebody who's more regulated and may already be higher. We'd like to have a little more balance. But it's very difficult to find one that meets our value equation criteria.
Stacie Frank: Cynthia, I'd like to turn the call back to John Rowe for a couple of closing remarks.
John Rowe: Just to wrap up, Exelon, as you all know, is just different from other folks. We're 2/3 to 3/4 of commodity business, and 1/3 to 1/4 of regulated set of T&D companies. And when you think about that, we kept our earnings well over $4 last year in the worst recession in decades. We're beating our expectations this year and if you look at our earnings range, you can see that we think we have a shot at something in the $3.90s or perhaps even over $4 this year. We should do a little better next year. As we've said, '12 is a little tougher. But I think you'd see growth again in '13 and '14. And I just leave you with this, there are very, very few commodity-driven companies that can hold earnings that well and give you the kind of upside that we can give you. And we're committed to making it happen. Thanks, everybody.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Christine; I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Exelon first quarter earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker’s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. I will turn the call over to Ms. Stacie Frank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Stacie Frank: Thank you, Christine. Good morning. Welcome to Exelon's first quarter 2010 earnings review and conference call update. Thank you for joining us today. We issued our earnings release this morning, if you haven’t received it, the release is available on the Exelon website at www.exeloncorp.com. Before we begin today’s discussion, let me remind you that the earnings release and other matters we will discuss in today’s call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties, as well as adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings. Please refer to today’s 8-K or our other filings for discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from management’s projections, forecasts and expectations and for reconciliation of operating to GAAP earnings. Leading the call today are; John Rowe, Exelon's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Matthew Hilzinger, Exelon's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by other members of Exelon's senior management team who will be available to answer your questions. We have scheduled 60 minutes for this call. I will now turn the call over to John Rowe, Exelon's CEO.
John Rowe: Thank you, Stacy. Good morning, everyone. In the first quarter Exelon was able to beat our own expectations. Our results and our confidents in the balance of the year allow us to raise the bottom of our full year earnings guidance. As you all know we’re working very hard to manage everything that is in our control and to keep ourselves positioned for the day when commodity markets improve. As the economy recovers and capacity and energy markets improve Exelon will again increase its value. And it will come as either carbon legislation or pollutant regulations impact the oldest and least efficient generating units among our competitors. The timing may be uncertain, but those forces are escapable. I will begin with a quick overview of the first quarter. As you’ve seen in the press release, we’ve recorded operating earnings of $1 per share above our guidance range of $0.85 to $0.95 per share. We were able to deliver these results through exceptional operating performance and better than expected load at PECO. Our nuclear fleet achieved a capacity factor of 92.3% in to chip, while conducting five refueling outages. Among these outages was a steam generators replacement at Three Mile Island. We recently completed outage to acquire series, resulted in plant upgrades that marked 100 cumulative megawatts in added capacity, since we announced the program last year. The ComEd and PECO continued to improve their performance. ComEd recorded its best ever first quarter results for reliability and frequency of outages. And Denis O'Brien and the team at PECO performed superbly in the face of the series of genuinely extraordinary so far [ph]. As a result of our success in the first quarter, we are revising our full year guidance from the $3.60 to $4 per share range that we had to $3.70 to $4 per share. In addition to this performance this reflects the fact that some of our market conditions at generation are more favorable than our previous forecast. It reflects our continued progress on achieving our OEM targets, and as we told you in January, we now have certainty about out attention expense for the year. Cash from operations is similarly showing improvement. Matt, will walk you through the details, but much of the improvement is associated with the cash benefits of the better than expected earnings and with tax planning items. We are putting cash toward in three different place, we are maintaining our dividend, we are continuing investing in our nuclear upgrades, and we are expect to increase our financial flexibility by making a discretionary contribution to our pension funds this year. This will both improve our funded status and reduce our mandatory cash contribution to 2012 and beyond. The precise amount will be determined by our board some time this year, but we anticipate that the contribution will be in the neighborhood of $500 million. Before Matt gives you more detail on the financials, I want to update you on what we know about developments in Pennsylvania, Illinois and Washington. In Pennsylvania, the headline is obviously PECO’s electric and gas distribution rate filing. This is PECO’s first delivery rate case filing in 21 years and only the second gas rate case over that period of time. It reflects over 2.5 billion in infrastructure investments in the PECO delivery system, while keeping rate increases very moderate. Denis O’Brien has a chart to show how the average PECO residential customer can offset the entire increase by installing a programmable thermostat and five compact fluorescent light box. In addition, PECO has reached an agreement for the $200 million stimulus award from the Department of Energy to support a smart grid and smart meter deployment. Finally, Exelon Power has surged from PJM that there are some localized transmission improvements that are necessary before the full retirement of Eddystone and Cromby station. Two of the four units will retire, have scheduled in mid-2011 and Generation expects to file for a reliability, must run agreement for the other two in the second quarter. It will provide for costs recovery and a return but will be limited in duration and cover only the periods that the units are needed for system reliability. Turning to Illinois, ComEd would continue to improve both its operating and its financing performance. Frame card and the Missouri [ph] are constantly successful in binding new ways to delivered cost control and revenue improvement. Because of efforts like this ComEd is on prep to achieve an ROE of at least 10% this year. ComEd is preparing for a rate case filing in the second quarter. Despite a consistent low gas price environment, impacting power prices, Ken Cornew and his team are constantly looking for opportunities to reduce downside risks through longer term contracts through the use of options and localized near-term transmission upgrade investments that reduce congestion. Power team has seen the basis spread between NI-Hub and AEP Dayton hub come back in line with historical levels as we expected and talk to you about back in November. Exelon Generation is planning to invest several millions of dollars in transmission upgrades near the equipment [ph] station that will lower congestion and improve equipments pricing toward the synergy hub. Our team is working with the PJM processes to identify other investments in our operating footprint that will improve energy flows and reduced the same issues with neighboring RTFs. Now let me a say few words about Washington, I maybe the only person in the country willing to say only a few words about Washington. On the hills of the healthcare debate to prevailing wisdom is that odds for passing climate legislation are slim. I don’t disagree with that, but there is a great deal of work going on. John Kerry, Lindsey Graham, and Joe Lieberman are working very hard on an economy wise, sector-by-sector approach. I anticipate that they will have announcement in this regard next week. It appears that their proposal will continue to regulate carbon emissions in the utility sector on a market based cap-and-trade approach. It also appears that they are doing will improve incentives for low emission sources like nuclear. The outcome remains uncertain, but this looks like it will be a bill that has a much better change chance of locking than the previous measures. Regardless of the outcome of climate legislation EPA is moving along with its regulatory approaches to using established statutory requirements and regulating a variety of air pollutants. We expect the administrator Jackson and her staff will come out with a first in a long line of regulations in the next few weeks. Coal fire generation will face very difficult investment decisions over the years ahead. EPAs effort reinforce for me, what has been a guiding principal for Exelon since its creation. That is with the best generation assets and those that run with the lowest emissions profile. And PJM Exelon 17 nuclear reactors are the best of those low emissions. We take Exelon 2020 very seriously and we look at it as a value added document as an investment guideline not simply as a PR legislative piece. I would be remiss in talking about Washington without mentioning that Betsy Moler has announced that she will be retiring this summer. Betsy has done a great deal to help build the value of your shares. With her work on Congress legislation, with her work on bringing ComEd in to PJM, with her tireless [ph] education getting for competitive markets and with her work at FERC, as she is a very special person and cannot be replaced simply. So, we have two people who I think will fill the whole very nicely David Brown will lead our DC office and he has been part of Betsy’s team there for ever since the merger and for ten years prior to that he was with PECO. Joe Dominguez who was to handle legal and governmental affairs for Exelon Generation will now add the Federal Regulatory Practice to his portfolio. We will continue to have a very good Washington team, but I personally will miss Betsy very much. And with that, let me turn this over to Matt. He will take you through the financials in more detail.
Matthew Hilzinger: Thank you, John, and good morning everyone. I will start on slides 4 and 5 where about – lined our key messages for this morning and detailed of the first quarter results. We have provided a significant amount of detail regarding our results and the earnings release in the new company tables. I will spend most of my time providing additional color on a few select items in the release and updating you on our key highlights for the quarter and our cash flow outlook for the remainder of the year. As John, mentioned Exelon delivered operating earnings of the $1 per share for the first quarter of 2010 compared to $1.20 per share in the first quarter of 2009. The first quarter results came and above our expected range of $0.85 to $0.95 per share largely driven by better than forecast demand at PECO and higher revenue net fuels in plant at Exelon Generations. The higher revenue at fuel generation is principally made up of congestion favorability in Western PJM and lower MISO ancillary cost. I will explain more about what we are seeing with utility well in few minutes, but let me first turn the Exelon generation on slide 6. As expected, we saw a decrease in Exelon generation relative to the first quarter of last quarter to the unfavorable market conditions in all regions and lowered nuclear volumes. The lower nuclear volumes were driven by more refueling outage days than last year, including 23 days in 2010 related to the outage and Three Mile Island to installed steam generators. Our full year guidance for 2010 assumes 10 plants refueling outages, which is in line with 2009. However, the outages this year are more heavily weighted to the first part of the year than in 2009. Five outages were either in process or completed by the end of first quarter this year compared to three in the first quarter of 2009. We also had higher nuclear fuel cost quarter-over-quarter a trend that we expect to see continue as our below market uranium hedges from several years ago are replaced with contracts at levels more representative for our long-term expectations for uranium, which were in the range $40 to $60 per pound. Let me spend a few minutes on slide seven, highlighting what we are seeing in the power markets and hedging activities we completed this quarter. We solely on current forwards market conditions in Exelon Generations portfolio were challenged. Prices at NI-Hub and PJM West hub decreased throughout the quarter driven by the decline in natural gas prices. As we have shown in more detail in the appendix of today’s slides, our open gross margin reflects this downward movement in prices. Our hedges have protected much of that move in the near term as our 2010 hedged gross margin for example is up 50 million since year end. We continue to use put options to remain ahead of our three ratable plant in 2011 and 2012. In 2011 about 10% of the hedges are from put options that we purchased to protect against further declines in natural gas and power prices while preserving participation in upward price movement. As we see power fundamentals improve, we believe that there is still some upside to Midwest power prices from what is reflected in the current forward curve, particularly in on-peak hours. We have seen further compression in the basis differential between NI-Hub and ADHub to levels that are more in line with historical levels and the last PJM financial transmission rights auction. You recalled that mid last year, the spreads between those two trading points implied in the 2012 forwards was about $13 per megawatt hour. As of the end of the first quarter, and even as earlier this week, the spread is down to about $6 per megawatt hour. So even at a declining gas price environment, NI-Hub prices are moving a little better relative to Ad-Hub. We build it out that remained challenges it occur a power prices and developers continue to have difficulty finding counter parties to execute long-term PPAs. In addition, we are expecting to pickup in load relative to last year and all of these factors stayed together should have a positive impact on NI-Hub heat rates. The capacity component is another key source of Exelon Generations margin and the bottom of slide seven, we’ve shown to breakdown of our total eligible installed capacity by region for the upcoming RPM based residual capacity auction. As you can see from the pie chart, 50% of our capacity is in the eastern zone of PJM, which received significantly higher prices than the Midwest in the last RPM auctions. We see five drivers that should lead to upside in the clearing prices for the 2013 and 2014 auction to be held this May. First, we think there will be some changes in the bidding behavior of auction participants as FERC approved the rule change following the last auction that will allow existing demand response resources to bid in above zero. Second, PJM has increased its demand forecast by about 1.7% compared to the demand assumed in the 2012 and 2013 auction. Third, First Energy is joining PJM in mid 2011 as they will bring slightly more load than supply. Fourth, the delay associating with the Susquehanna-Roseland Transmission line in East reduces available import capability in the Eastern MAAC by close to 2000 megawatts. And finally Net CONE which measures the cost of new bill less historical revenues increased by 15% for RTO and 23% for EMAAC. In aggregate these factor should lead their increases in capacity prices relative to the prior auction results. In terms of the timing, initial pricing results are expected to be public on May 14th, which is full market monitor report file where the summer which is similar to last year. Turning to ComEd on slide eight. ComEd improved its earnings quarter-over-quarter, principally due to ComEd's continue cost reduction work. One other driver particular that I would like to highlight is the $0.06 per share of favorability related to uncollectible expense rider, which was reflected in our original 2010 earnings guidance. We were able to work constructively with both the legislators and the ICC to develop this rider, which allows ComEd to recover the bad debt amounts not included in base rates. Our first quarter results included the under collections in 2008 and 2009 and going forward ComEd will reported to true-up on a quarterly basis. As you’ll see on the slide nine, whether normalize alluded ComEd declined 0.8% from the first quarter 2009 to the first quarter 2010, which was in line with our expectations, one positive signs is that March was the first month with positive growth we’ve seen in the ComEd services territory since July of 2008. The residential sector head up – held up especially well as we entered approximately 2500 customers as at the end of the first quarter this year compared to the first quarter of 2009, which is the first time that we’ve seen positive customer growth since December of 2008. We continued to track region unemployment data in Chicago, which is about 10.9% and still higher than the national average and as a result we continue to believe that residential load will show flat to very slight improvement for the year. In ComEd C&I segments whether normal load was down slightly in the quarter, but only by about 200 gigawatt hours over the last year. National data like the large institute for select supply management survey, which had its highest readings since mid 2004 suggest that manufacturing sector continues to expand to survive stronger orders in production. Based on the regional and national trends we’re watching and what we’re hearing from surveys of our large customers, we think the inflation point in the large C&I classic, ComEd is coming around the mid year. And we continue to expect the full year growth and that class about 1.7%. Across all customers classes are ComEd forecast for 2010 is unchanged at 0.8% growth for the year. Moving to slide ten, we’ve outlined ComEd $1 billion revolving credit facility that we closed at the end of March. The transaction shows the bank market of the investment grade credit is strengthening. We have 22 banks committed in the three year facility and the pricing is rolled any other BBB credit priced in the last year. We continue to attract the credit markets, so that we can take advantage of attractive terms and conditions for the refinancing of the credit facilities at our other operating companies, which are due to expire in late 2012. Lastly for ComEd there are coupled of key events planned for the second quarter. The bids for the Illinois Power Agency procurement are due next week, followed by ICC approval in early May and a ComEd expects to file an electric distribution rate case later in the second quarter. On slide 11, we have shown the PECO quarterly earnings drivers. PECO delivered quarterly earnings in line with last year as expected PECOs’s quarterly results included increase revenue – that fuel related to lower energy pricing, the generation under the PPA provisions, which is fully offset at Exelon generation. Keep in mind that because this is the last year before PECO transitions to market. PECO’s price for energy paid the generation under the PPA and the amounts collected for the CTC will vary during the yea, and order for PECO to complete the collections of extended cost. Separately weather in the Philadelphia service territory was challenging in the first quarter. The region is hit with three snow storms leading the total accumulation of 79 inches for the 2009 and 2010 winter season over 300% above normal and despite the related work flow PECO was just one penny per share unfavorable to the quarter on storm cost. On slide 12, you can see that PECO’s load increase slightly for the first quarter compared to the first quarter of 2009 as PECO is seeing signs of improving demand bit earlier than originally expected. The large commercial and industrial classes seeing increased load in the steel manufacturing segment, as well as healthcare and educational services. The residential growth appears to be tied to better economy recovery. Our current forecast for the Philadelphia gross metro product is now 0.6% positive for 2010, as compared to a negative 0.2% at the time we did our original 2010 budget. For the full year PECO now expects positive growth of 0.3% versus our previous forecast of negative 1.5%, primarily driven by recovery in the residential and large C&I classes. That vision reflects PECO’s actual first quarter load and general improvement in the gross metro product forecast in the Philadelphia region. The new forecast also incorporates higher usage per customer than we originally anticipated, because of the PAPUCs approval of energy efficiency programs came a little later than we had originally expected. In turn, the implementation of our energy efficiency programs was delay at PECO, resulting at projected 0.5% increase in total load for the full year. Turning to slide 13, PECO filed an electric and gas distribution rate cases on March 31st, 2010. Highlighting a few items from those filings, both cases are requesting an 11.75% ROE and use 2010 forward test year, which is conventional in Pennsylvania. The electric case as a rate based was just over 3.2 billion and requested increasing revenue requirement of 360 million. On the gas side, PECO’s request is based on 1.1 billion rate base with a revenue requirement increased up 44 million. Rate cases are a nine months process in Pennsylvania, so we anticipate having new rates effective by January 1, 2011. Slide 14 outlines are latest news on sources and uses of cash. Expected cash from operations for the year has improved by a debt about $200 million, as we have increased net income of expected – expectations coming from our first quarter results. And second, we are anticipating some favorable cash from auction sales and spend strategies at Power Team this year. The cash flows that we’ve shown also assuming incremental pension contribution this year as John had mentioned. We expect that contribution to be approximately $500 million, which will be funded through a combination of increased cash from operations of $200 million that I just spoke about, was $170 million from the tax deduction that we get upon making the contribution, and we expect to finance about $150 million with additional debt at ComEd. Making this additional contribution in 2010 is consistent with our goal of preserving financial flexibility by avoiding significant spikes in future acquired contributions of under reachable. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 carries with the requirement to fund the pension within approximately seven years. Even those requirements, which we viewed is being very similar to that service, we see the pension contribution is the best way to meet our financial obligations in our tax effective matter and deliver long-term value. Lastly, I would like to point out that our expected ending cash position has increased from a $175 million that we showed you in January to $500 million now. That increase is simply due to the timing of tax payments for the year about $375 million of which are being differed to 2011. That amount is showing up in 2010 ending cash, but it must be paid in 2011. As we look ahead we expect second quarter operating earnings in the range of $0.80 to $0.90 per share. Our second quarter range reflects lower realized prices that Exelon generation, given market conditions, as well as increase nuclear fuel cost similar to the first quarter. That's being offset to some favorability related to our latest loan growth expectations, continued progress on O&M targets for the year and higher RPM capacity prices, which will become effective on June 1st of this year. We will continue to give specific quarterly guidance one quarter at a time. We are very pleased with how the year shaping up so far and we are pleased to raise the bottom of our guidance range to reflect our first quarter results and our best expectations for how the rest of the year will come in. And with that I will turn the call back to Stacie.
Stacie Frank: Christine, we are now ready to take questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from a line of Daniel Eggers with Credit Suisse.
Daniel Eggers – Credit Suisse: Hey, good morning. First question on the guidance update as it relates to kind of the generation outlook. How much of that is sustainable of that uptake to share I mean, pricing isn’t that fantastic so do you guys think you’re going to retain that extra $0.10 to $0.15 going forward for an operational improvement perspective?
Matthew Hilzinger: Well, I will jump in and this is Matthew Hilzinger, and Ken come in and comment if you like, there is couple of things that really drove our first quarter above our expectations that I had mentioned. One was congestion in the in the Midwest and the second was MISO ancillary costs. And the second was higher load at PECO. PECO is going to get a probably $0.02 from their increasing load for the full year. And I would expect that the translate for somewhere around $0.03 for the generation company and so we factor that in to kind of our full year guidance and that’s really part of the region that we’ve brought our bottom line and then the third thing again you probably recall that at January we’re raised to change our guidance around pension cost. The discount rate came a little higher at year-end than we had originally planned and what we had said in the EEI and so we’re going to see about $0.05 better in pension cost relative to actual to what we have said at EEI so both of – all three of those things I think factored into how we looked at our guidance in our – our O&M is online, I mean we expect to hit targets there so. With that I think we are in pretty good shape as we finish out the year.
Daniel Eggers – Credit Suisse: Okay. And I guess one more question, as we kind to look at the RPM auction coming up obviously, past two auctions Eddystone and Cromby didn’t get better, didn’t clear because the energy value wasn’t high enough with tough forward curve today. Do you have other assets you anticipate, studying that and notably higher standard for market clearing and kind of if you look out into the auction cycle there are 9000 megawatts, it didn’t clear last auction. Do you guys have a thought on how many more units wouldn’t clear given how tough the forwards are today?
Ken Cornew: Yeah, Dan, I think its largely going to be element of what the bidding behavior is of the generation going forward in these auctions. I think clearly what the Market Monitor released saying that a substantial amount of generation didn’t clear in past auctions is likely to continue in future auctions unless prices increased. Now Matt highlighted and you are all looking at what are the price drivers that are going to – or the auction drivers that are going to push prices up and we believe they will. The question really becomes what the bidding behavior of the generators and the demand response will be versus the past. And I would expect to see overtime that these generators are (inaudible) and not clearing are going to have a more challenging time continuing to exist and offer their capacity in the market. I think that will happen probably over the next several years, just not instantaneously this year.
Daniel Eggers – Credit Suisse: Do you guys have other generations' assets that you put in that vulnerable category beyond Eddystone and Cromby?
Ken Cornew: We’ve looked at our generation, obviously we made the decisions around those, we thought were challenged and those are the ones at this point, yeah.
Daniel Eggers – Credit Suisse: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from line of Hugh Wynne with Sanford Bernstein.
Hugh Wynne – Sanford Bernstein: Good morning.
John Rowe: Good morning, Hugh.
Hugh Wynne – Sanford Bernstein: Hi, congratulations on a good quarter. I was going to ask you to elaborate a little bit on your comments, John regarding the EPS regulations away from CO2 to limit emissions of SO2 and mercury. It strikes me that your fleet in northern Illinois might benefit materially from some of the older coal-fired units in that state being forced to go offline rather than incur the cost of mercury and acid gas emissions controls. I was hoping I might get some insight from you as to what your expectations are regarding those regulations, their impact and the potential implications for your revenues?
John Rowe: Well, we think exactly what you do on that subject. I think there are at least three or four units in northern Illinois that are owned by others, for what incremental investment to comply with tighter standards will be a very vexing thing indeed. Now obviously we don’t have – aren’t allowed to have any peculiar insights into what the owners of those units maybe doing. But we intend to be ready when those decisions have to be made. I think you have your finger on it exactly, I don’t think we’re going to see EPA use in CO2 regulatory powers in a draconian fashion. My guess is that they believe that that would create an unsustainable amount of congressional kickbacks, but EPA has rule makings on coal ash to come out soon. It has what is called the CAIR, C-A-I-R regulations on SOx and NOx. It has, as you suggested the hazardous pollutant regulations on mercury, I think somewhere in that chart that people called train wreck, there is also new particular regulation. And it's just hard for me to see how each and every one of these won’t impose a new investment requirement and additional cost requirement on all of the older and smaller coal-fired units, especially some that existed in northern Illinois. As we look at it, something we do know simply from industry discussions, is that a number of utilities have tried to approach EPA about whether there is someway to put all of their plans for their units in a bubble and get credit for shutting down some against the operating requirements for the big and better ones, and I think EPA told them it doesn’t quite work that way because of the lawsuit that they brought themselves. EPA feels that it has to enforce each of these statutory requirements on its own unique terms. And that’s going to place some real burdens on some of these plans. So I wish it had the sort of predictability that good CO2 legislation would have. But I think it’s in some ways even more dramatic in its long-term outcome.
Hugh Wynne – Sanford Bernstein: Did you see the impact entire primarily on the energy prices, John, or do you think that there will be a material impact also on capacity prices overtime?
John Rowe: I would think capacity perhaps even more than energy, but I’d like Ken Cornew to take that one. Ken?
Ken Cornew: Yes. I think it's both. To the extent there is more cap-and-trade in these elements. Those types of cost get into the dispatch of the generators and that will impact the energy market. To the extent its investment obviously in capital that's going to look large in a five year or six year future timeframe that is going to have to make its way into the cost for generators to bid into RPM, so I think it's definitely some of each.
Hugh Wynne – Sanford Bernstein: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from a line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.
John Rowe: Good morning, Jonathan.
Jonathan Arnold – Deutsche Bank: Good morning. I wanted to ask a question about your hedging during the quarter, it seems that while within the broad (inaudible) that ratable plan you did hedge somewhat more than you could have done, and you also made the statement at the beginning to John that you kind of remain optimistic about the future prices. Is it reasonable to assume you just don’t feel that optimistic in the 2012 timeframe? And then I wanted to also, is there an element here that a potential change to hedging around the new regulations in financial reforms et cetera that, is there anything you are doing today, you feel concerned, you might not be able to do in the same way?
John Rowe: I will let Ken answer most of that, but just let me say we know all of you are concerned about 2012 prices so are we. We can't predict just when some mix of tighter capacity, higher gas prices, higher coal prices and some carbon penalty really begins to have an affect. We’re very sure we’ll be there. But whether its 12 or 14 we’ve no better way to know than you do, so our approach to this is fundamentally manage our hedging strategy in accordance with what we see, manage the company so that we take our long-term forecasts and deliver real results that beat those forecasts. And its kind of funny in my now many years, the period from say '05 to '08 is the only time I’ve ever had good long-term five year forecasts and those turned out to be wrong. Most of my experience has been that you have bad long-term forecast, and you work like hell to make the reality better than what the machines does. And often you succeed. So that’s how we deal with this commodity cost. But with that I’d better let Ken answer the greater detail of your question.
Ken Cornew: Yeah, Jonathan. Obviously when we talked about the last quarter, we came into this quarter above ratable and we talked about the use of options, and some of the uncertainties that we are looking at regarding economic recovery and its impact on gas and power demand. We’ve started ahead ratable in the Midwest obviously with that ComEd swap and we’ve remained ahead of it, since the three year plan has been instituted. We did increase our mid-Atlantic activity of underlying sales to essentially catch-up to ratable with the PECO contract rolling off at the end of 2010. We did have some reduction in expected generation, and we did have some higher effectiveness in hedging from our put options. So where we are is, we are at ratable with our underline position and we are ahead of ratable with the put option strategy. We do that because we do think there is upside in the markets, particularly when I look at heat rates, I am still seeing spot heat rates disconnected from forward heat rates. We talked about the APD, NI-Hub spreads and how they’ve come from $13 level in the forwards last summer, all the way back to the $6 level now. John mentioned and we talked about how we are working to improve in areas of the transmission grids to make sure we can deliver our power to the broadest markets. We’ve seen really some good support in NI-Hub of heat prices in the quarter and some good support in the forwards also. Matt mentioned wind build-out, the wind build-out is obviously flowing down in our mind, and it’s tough to get a long-term contract to build the wind facility in this price environment. So we do believe there is upside in NI-Hub heat rates. We believe that a lot of the environmental impacts are going to happen outside this hedging window, and where the uncertainly comes in is around how quickly the economy is going to recover and what that does to gas and power demand. And your second part of your question I think was, are we doing anything differently because of potential CFTC regulation? And the answer to that is simply no. We continue to focus on our hedging program, utilizing all the channels we’ve talked about in the past load filing, standard products at different basis hubs, participating in the retail business competitively and all kinds of structured transaction opportunities that we look at from time to time.
Betsy Moler: This is Betsy Moler; if I could comment on the derivatives legislation, which is also part of the question. We are cautiously optimistic that the ultimate definition of who gets an end-user exemption in the derivatives legislation will provide us the ability to avoid the CFTC clearing requirements. Senate Agriculture Committee approved a version of the Bill earlier this week that provides such an exemption while the language isn’t ideal, we’re certainly making progress there and we’re hoping that will be covered when the bill – when and if the bill finally becomes public law.
Jonathan Arnold – Deutsche Bank: Can I just ask a clarifying – would that allow you to continue to – would that language allow you to continue to kind of hedge, it sounds like you are hedging commodity exposure by trying to keep some of the heat rates upside, which obviously requires use of options and the like, would that also going to fall under such an exemption?
Betsy Moler: We hope that the ultimate definition will, but it’s really a work in progress right now.
Jonathan Arnold – Deutsche Bank: Okay, thanks very much.
John Rowe: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs and Company.
Michael Lapides – Goldman Sachs: Hi. Really two questions, they are separate from each other, one on generation, one on the regulated side of the business. On the generation side, are there any balance sheet reasons why you implement kind of such a long range, meaning a three year prorated hedging program or is it driven largely by something else? I mean, my gut is that a nuclear generator always going to run, always going to be in the money. Why hedge if the fundamental give us that power prices are low for kind of that third year, why not leave a large chuck of that third year open rather than even having 50% of that hedge. That’s the first question? The second question, just curious for insight outlook on state of Illinois utility regulation in terms of kind of going into the ComEd rate case?
John Rowe: Okay. Let me start with the first one and Matt and Ken will help me here. I do not think there is a real balance sheet reason for the ratable three year hedging but Matt and Ken may have a thought that I don’t. Obviously, things like supporting the dividend are a reason to have a hedging policy. We have said back from time-to-time, and said should we do what Exelon does and simply say, our fundamental business is too weak to hedge. But we have – but the three-year policy allowed us to bring some stability to earnings and cash flows that we wouldn’t have otherwise, and as I think you gathered from an earlier question that Ken answered. He kind of thinks that he is able to get some forward fields now in 12 that are just a little better than the spots might be when we get out there. There is an anomaly in electricity, in that forward markets don’t go very far out and long-term contracts by people with load serving responsibility tend to be at higher prices than the some of the intervening spot markets, and I think that also supports what Ken is doing, but now Matt and Ken tell me what I missed.
Matthew Hilzinger: I would add to that, John. The hedging is there to really protect and help reinforce our investment grade rating and provide some stability although, of course, we’d call it 18 months to 36 months in terms of cash flows. So if a plant goes down operational risk that we are covered from that and that is really kind of the key reasons why we hedge is to protect on the operational side, protect our investment grade rating. And then thirdly, it helps in terms of just access to capital. There’s a lot of things that we do from a commercial standpoint that require investment grade ratings that we think are important. So those three things I think are the real fundamental underpinnings of why we hedge in the way that we do.
John Rowe: Could we switch now? Frank, would you pick up this question about Illinois?
Frank Clark: I will start and add, our President can also add some perspective. As we’ve announced, it is our intent to file a rate case for ComEd the backend of the second quarter of this year. That is still our plan. The regulatory plant in Illinois is about the same as it was before. We have a new Chairman of the Congress Commission, Chairman Flores who has not been confirmed by the Illinois (inaudible) and don’t know it will be confirmed before the senate in this session, it is unknown. I think that the regulatory climate is essentially the same as it was before when we had Chairman Box. I think that our expectation will be treated fairly when we file our rate case. The Illinois regulatory climate is directly related to the Illinois political climate, which is, as it has been for the last decade at an interesting state. And Governor Quinn is trailing and opposed to kind of ready, who as the Republican who may actually succeed. If he does we will probably get a different Chairman, would be in that seat, probably would inspect sometime early next year. So there are uncertainties but in overall balance in the regulatory climate in my judgment remains simply sustained. Anne?
Anne Pramaggiore: Yes, Frank, I would add as we understand the regulatory climate in Illinois pretty well, and we work very hard to get ourselves in the best position possible coming into Detroit cases we have work. We have a history now working very constructively with the FAS, in the last rate case. We work constructively with stakeholders on the Smart Grid projects that’s been going on over the last year and a half. We took a lot of cost out of the business last year, that’s going down as a commission, and they also recognize that we work very hard to stay out last year and extend the time for the next rate case, so I think that’s all recognized and should put us in a reasonably even position going into this case.
Michael Lapides – Goldman Sachs: Got it, and can you just tell us what was your lastly the rolling 12 months for 2009 earned ROE at ComEd?
Anne Pramaggiore: It’s fixed.
John Rowe: It was fixed was the answer they gave.
Michael Lapides – Goldman Sachs: Okay, thank you guys, much appreciated.
John Rowe: Thank you.
Stacie Frank: Christine, we have time for one more question before turning the call back to John for closing.
Operator: Thank you, your final question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.
Paul Ridzon – KeyBanc: When we look at your hedge update looking at 12, for instance, you are basically about 50% hedged, how much of that is throughputs, and therefore the upside is still preserved?
Ken Cornew: Yeah. It’s a little more than 5% of that throughput.
Paul Ridzon – KeyBanc: The 5% or the 50%.
Ken Cornew: Yeah.
Paul Ridzon – KeyBanc: About 2.5%?
Ken Cornew: No, 5%, its 5% of a nominal 50% so with underlying it would be something like 45, 43 to 45% hedged than with the puts out it is more like 48 to 51, is that clear?
Paul Ridzon – KeyBanc: Yes. And you started kind of using the put strategy more recently?
Ken Cornew: We actually employed the put strategy in prior quarters for 2012. We started the put strategy earlier on in our ratable hedging program so in ’09 we started doing that.
Paul Ridzon – KeyBanc: Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. I will now turn it over to for closing remarks.
John Rowe: Thank you all very much. Stacie and her team will continued answer you questions. I think she and predecessor Karie Anderson have done a great job trying to improve the quality of the materials; we put out in public so we get to lot of your questions forward meeting. Some will keep working on as much clarity as we can provide. Simply put Exelon is 70% to 75% commodity driven business and 25% to 30% regulatory driven business and the commodity business was a lot of fun 2 years ago and its harder work right now. As a results for the first quarter show we’re able to beat that own model sometimes by hard work and we will continue to try very hard to do that. We will try to give you a really good year this year, and we’ll keep working on the questions you all have about 2012. We have a long time ahead of us before 2012 comes, I am confident we’ll find some good things to do in that intervening period. Thanks a lot for your patience and life at Exelon will be fine again one of these days.
Stacie Frank: Thank you. That concludes our call.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Krystal and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Exelon Corporation fourth quarter earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker’s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Karie Anderson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Karie Anderson: Thank you, Krystal. Good morning. Welcome to Exelon's fourth quarter 2009 earnings review and conference call update. Thank you for joining us today. We issued our earnings release this morning, if you haven’t received it, the release is available on the Exelon website at www.exeloncorp.com. Before we begin today’s discussion, let me remind you that the earnings release and other matters we discuss in today’s call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties, as well as adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings. Please refer to today’s 8-K or other filings for discussions of factors that may cause results to differ from management’s projections, forecasts and expectations and for a reconciliation of operating to GAAP earnings.  Leading the call today are John Rowe, Exelon's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Matthew Hilzinger, Exelon's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by other members of Exelon's senior management team who will be available to answer your questions. We have scheduled 60 minutes for this call. I will now turn the call over to John Rowe, Exelon's CEO.
John Rowe: Thank you, Karie. Good morning everyone and happy new year. As you already saw in our news release, we reported operating earnings of $0.92 per diluted share for the quarter and $4.12 per diluted share for full year 2009. These earnings are well within our original guidance range of $4 to $4.30 per share and they are above our revised 2009 earnings guidance range of $4 to $4.10 per share. We believe the fourth quarter was a very good one, it reflected both, a little better luck on the weather and even better results from our cost management effort than we had expected. We are very pleased with the end of 2009, we believe it bodes well for 2010 and we are very confident that we will be able to deliver earnings in 2010 that are well within the earnings range we have given you. We have a lot of time left in 2010 to keep working on both the resident side and the cost side and we will do so. I know from the behavior of our stock this morning and from some of the calls you have already made to Karie and her IR group that some of you are concerned about implications for the first quarter and what the first quarter means for the whole year. Matt will try to take you through those details. The point I want to make is that we see the fourth quarter as nothing but good news for what we can do for you in 2010 and we are hard at work doing just that.  Our 2009 performance reflects continued success in our generation fleet. Our nuclear performance capacity factor for 2009 was 93.6% and our fossil availability factor was 93.7%. Our hedging program in Exelon generation held on our average margins at $38.20 per megawatt hour, essentially flat to 2008 despite spot power prices that were more than 40% lower year-over-year. Ken Cornew and his team deserve great deal of credit for that. We had best ever KD [ph] and safety performances at ComEd and best ever safety performance at PECO. We had continued strong financial results at PECO and very real improvement in our financial performance at ComEd. ComEd increased its earned ROE from 5.5% in 2008 to approximately 8.5% in '09 and is targeting and has real plans to achieve an ROE of at least 10% in 2010.  We delivered on our cost savings commitments across all of our operating companies. At the start of the year we submitted to hold O&M flat at $4.5 billion from '08 to '09. Thanks to Chris' leadership, we realized an additional $200 million O&M savings in the second half of 2009 driving down our O&M expense to $4.3 billion for the year. These savings reflect a company wide focus on cost net interest and enabled us to absorb unfavorable weather conditions and higher pension and OPEB expense adding up to $0.25 per share and still deliver our $4.12 of operating earnings. We continue to find other ways to deliver in '09.  We generated close to $5.8 billion of cash from operations, an increase of $1 billion over our original budget largely due to tax planning opportunities provided by federal stimulus programs. We completed a corporate restructuring including a reduction of close to 500 positions. We improved our long-term financial flexibility with a $350 million discretionary pension contribution and $1.5 billion of debt refinancing at favorable rate. And of course our total dividend to yield totaled about $1.4 billion in value.  We received license renewal for two of our nuclear units, Oyster Creek and TMI extending the operating lives of those nuclear units by an additional 20 years. We launched a 1,300 to 1,500 megawatt nuclear upgrade program, which represents the equivalent of a new nuclear unit at about half the cost. It is also lower risk than new build as it consists of close to 20 discreet projects and the more expensive ones can be dropped if power prices don't justify them. We brought online 70 megawatts of incremental nuclear capacity at Quad Cities, Dresden and Peach Bottom. There is simply no better nuclear investment than the Exelon upgrade program. PECO was selected as one of only 6 utilities to receive the maximum federal stimulus award of $200 million for its smart grid and smart-meter program. And we acted decisively to propose the permanent retirement of our Cromby station and Eddystone units 1 and 2. Our numbers say that these retirements will create somewhere between 165 million and 200 million of the present value over continuing to operate these units, largely in the form of avoided capital expenditures, but also O&M savings. PJMs preliminary analysis has identified potential reliability impacts if all units were to retire on May 31, 2011, we are working with PJM as it continues to refine its analysis and expect to develop an acceptable plan for the retirement of all four units. Now as you know, from our financial conference in November, our earnings guidance range is $3.60 to $4.00 per share. We are very confident based on the '09 results that we can be comfortably within that range. The fourth quarter makes us feel better not worse about 2010. Our management team is committed to its O&M target of $4.35 billion despite an increase in 2010 pension and OPEB expenses that Matt will detail for you. We have only begun to work on 2010 both on the cost side and on the revenue side. Before Matt goes to the financials, I want to revisit our long term value proposition. It's driven by the factors shown on slide three of today's presentation. As you can see there, we are leveraging our core competencies, including investments in nuclear upgrades, smart grid and transmission. As you all know, our nuclear fleet gives us significant leverage as prices recover over time, either due to rise in commodity prices in natural gas and coal, due to improving power market fundamentals which plays a higher premium on capacity, to an improving economy and we will discuss what’s going on in both Chicago and Philadelphia in this call and to improving power margins. On a purely open basis, the margin in Exelon Generation increased $800 million for every $5 per megawatt hour increase in both PJM West and NiHub electricity prices.  Our low emission nuclear fleet will benefit from increasingly stringent environmental standards. That is true whether a climate bill is passed or not because of EPA regulation of carbon, of SO2, of NOx, of mercury, of coal ash piles and New Source Performance Standards. While we all know that the Climate Bill on which I've worked so long is in serious trouble in the Senate as we speak, the President of the United States remains committed to the bill. I've met with both, more than 20 members of the Senate. The work that Senator Graham is doing with Senator Kerry and Lieberman may still bring action on this bill, and whether or not it happens this spring, the simple fact will remain that the lowest cost way to deal with the climate problem is a cap-and-trade system. Again and again, by this name or some other name, the Congress is going to have to come back to the need to deal with climate problem in a cost effective way. But, even if it doesn't, EPA under the mandate of the United States Supreme Court and the commitments of Administrator Jackson has made it clear that it will act on carbon. And frankly in terms of the ultimate value of the Exelon nuclear fleet, the carbon factor really isn’t much bigger than all of the other environmental factors that weigh upon the nation’s large coal burning fleet. So as we look at the things we have done right and wrong in this company, among the things we are most proud of is making our nuclear fleet bigger and better, separating our generation into a market-based company and selling most of our fossil generations. It has given us an upside that no other utility possesses. We are working very hard on all of these factors. Our actions on Cromby and Eddystone exemplify the real force of all of these market and environmental conditions on the nation’s coal burning fleet. There is opportunity for Exelon. A low carbon, lower emission world is coming. It is coming in fits and starts, but no one doubts that it is coming. Almost any of these fits and starts makes Exelon's fleet more valuable and we will keep doing the things that maximize our capability to take advantage of that. With that I will turn the call over to Matthew Hilzinger.
Matthew Hilzinger: Thank you, John, and good morning everyone. I will start on slides 4 and 5 with an overview of my key messages for this morning and details on the fourth quarter and full year results. As John mentioned, Exelon delivered operating results of $0.92 per share for the fourth quarter and $4.12 per share for the full year of 2009. We are very pleased to have achieved earnings above our revised range for the year, largely a result of digging deep to find cost savings across the business.  We realized O&M savings of about $200 million from 2008 to 2009, which helped us offset year-over-year changes in operating earnings from negative market condition to generation and unfavorable load in weather at our two utilities and in the face of those headwinds we also generated cash from operations in 2009 of close to 5.8 billion, boosted in part by benefits we realized from bonus depreciation on capital investments allowed under the Federal Stimulus Act. While we don’t expect those one-time benefits to cash to continue, we are projecting cash from operations in 2010 of $4.25 billion. Let me turn now to our individual operating company results and financial drivers and then I will spend some more time on our pension and OPEB expense and discuss how our 2009 cost reduction effort has positioned us for continued cost containment in 2010. Exelon Generation's quarterly earnings drivers are shown on slide six. We continue to have strong operational performance across the fleet and completed four refueling outages during the quarter. You’ll see that our refueling outage days for the quarter are higher than last year, which is a result of the refueling outage at Three Mile Island that we started in late October. We used the time when the plant was down for its plant refueling outage to replace some steam generators as part of our long-term capital plan. This additional work extended the length of the outage to 67 days during the fourth quarter of 2009. We also saw higher nuclear fuel cost quarter-over-quarter and that trend will continue as our below market uranium hedges from several years ago are replaced with the contracts at levels more representative of our long-term expectations for market price of uranium of $40 to $60 per pound. Market conditions at Exelon Generation's portfolio remained challenging but our average margins for 2009 have held the levels we experienced in 2008. We are now hedged at over 90% in 2010 and we continue to execute our ratable hedging plan for 2011 and 2012. We updated our hedging disclosures in the appendix of our presentation and have shown the highlights on slide 7. Let me point out a few changes that you’ll see compared to our disclosures in our last quarterly earnings call. First, we announced in early December that we have planned to retire Eddystone 1 and 2 and Cromby Station in May 2011 and our hedging disclosure reflect those units coming out of our expected generation and gross margin results at that time. Retiring units yields approximately $165 million to $200 million of positive NPV versus continued operations, an incremental pre-tax operating earnings of approximately $40 million per year beginning in 2012. In the fourth quarter we took a $56 million pre-tax charge related to the retirement of those units which we have excluded from our operating earnings. Second, we've continued to hedge our 2010, 2011 and 2012 portfolio and you will see that as a result, our gross margin distribution represented by the bars on the right side of slide 7 have compressed both on the upper and lower ends of the range. Third, we have made a slight modification in our hedge disclosure for the south region. Our open gross margin now reflects the capacity revenues we received from counterparties and various long-term capacity sales. Because this component had been previously included in our effective realized energy prices in the south region, this change does not have any impact on the calculation of hedged gross margin in our disclosures. We believe it provides for a more direct comparison of the energy sales in our effective realized energy price to the ERCOT spark spreads we provide in the reference prices. On that note, I'd like to take this opportunity to reiterate our hedging disclosures which present the effective realized energy price for each of the regions in which we operate. The effective realized energy price is not the average sales price. It represents the equivalent around-the-clock price that can be attributed to our physically hedged volumes and will determine the value of our hedges and it includes fossil fuel costs and the market costs to service our sale obligations. Our hedging disclosure volume calculates the mark-to-market of our energy hedges by using the effective realized energy price compared to the stated reference price. We have provided an example of how to calculate our hedge gross margin on page 37 in the appendix of today's slides. Let me turn for a moment to Midwest power and market prices. At EEI, we presented our views on Midwest power markets and in particular our view that the NiHub prices had upside over the September 30th forwards based on gas and coal prices at that time. As we expected, we've seen expansion and market implied heat rates with NiHub prices rising over the last several months despite declines in gas prices. We have also seen a reduction in the NiHub, ADHUB spreads since the fall. The spread is now about $6.50 per megawatt hour for 2011 which is much more in line with the price differentials implied by the most recent PJM financial transmission rights option.  So while we continue on our three year ratable hedging strategy, our power team incorporates its fundamental views on the market to identify opportunities to capture additional value through the specific products we execute.  Let me now turn to a discussion of our results of ComEd. We've shown you our key drivers for the quarter on slide 8. ComEd recognized continued O&M savings during the quarter which offset unfavorable weather and load to maintain quarter-over-quarter earnings of $0.16 per share. As you will see on slide 9, weather normalized load declined 1.6% from the fourth quarter 2008 to the fourth quarter of 2009 at ComEd, primarily driven by large C&I customer class. I'd like to note that in late 2008, the Northern Illinois economy had already been hit quite hard by the recession. So the year-over-year change for the fourth quarter is less severe than we have seen in past quarters. The manufacturing sector was hit particularly hard in 2009, specifically the durable manufacture segment which saw usage down over 20% for the year.  Looking ahead to 2010, we expect loan growth in the commercial and industrial segment of 1.5% for the year starting in the second quarter. Broadly speaking, when evaluating growth for ComEd we look at a number of leading indicators such as the gross metro product and factory orders and see those indicators trending upward in mid-2010 although the pace of growth from here will be moderate. On the residential side we have essentially gotten to the bottom of the cycle but we expect growth to be essentially flat in 2010. The small amount of customer growth that we project on the residential side in 2010 will be offset by reductions in usage per customer as energy efficiency program participation expands. New home prices in Chicago area have been trending up and the pace of unemployment growth in the service territory has slowed both of which give us reason to believe that the economy in Northern Illinois is slowly turning the corner. On slide 10, we have shown you PECO's quarterly results and earnings drivers. PECO delivered quarterly earnings in line with last year as reduced road and weather were offset by favorability and lower bad debt expense and higher gas distribution revenues. PECO's quarterly results also include scheduled increases in the CTC amortization expense, as PECO prepares to transition to market rates at the end of 2010. On slide 11, you can see that PECO's load declined by 1.3% from the fourth quarter 2008 to the fourth quarter 2009, primarily driven by declines in the commercial and industrial classes. While ComEd had already started to see significant declines in late 2008, Philadelphia lagged the recession with the gross metro product dropping 3.6% in 2009, versus 2% growth in the GNP in 2008. Similarly, the turnaround that PECO load will take a little longer than what we are seeing at ComEd, so we expect further declines across all customer classes in 2010, with an overall load decline of 1.5% in 2010. Our current estimate show load in the residential class beginning to grow slightly in the second half of 2010, but that growth will be more than offset by 1.2% reduction in average use per residential customer for 2010, as a result of the energy efficiency programs instituted under Pennsylvania Act 129.  In the commercial and industrial segment, we expect further declines of 2.4% in 2010 before we see signs of a sustained recovery. In addition, we are watching some pending pharmaceutical mergers and health care reform and the impact of those issues may have on regional trends and employment, housing and customer spending.  Before I turn to our outlook for 2010, I want to spend a moment on one of the key drivers of our operating O&M which is pension and OPEB expense which you can see on slide 12. We now have our year-end valuation reflects a $35 million increase in our 2010 pension and OPEB expense over 2009, largely driven by a drop in discount rates. You may recall that we measured a discount rate of December 31 of each year and that rate is used in conjunction with other inputs to develop the following year's pension expense. On the asset return side, the market rebound helped us achieve returns of 21% on the pension plan this year which helps the longer term funding status of the plans. While pension and OPEB expenses are largely influenced by interest rates and market returns and have a significant impact on our operating cost, we remain committed to offsetting these higher cost with savings elsewhere in the business as we achieved in 2009. Slide 13, highlights the tremendous success that we've had in reducing cost across the business during 2009. We covered inflation pressures. We offset pension and OPEB expenses of a $170 million and we took $200 million of additional cost out of the business. Operating O&M for the year totaled $4.3 billion, which is $200 million better than our original plan and a $100 million better than our revised forecast. The savings came from the elimination of 500 positions in the business services company in ComEd, productivity improvements, stringent controls on a supply spending contracting and overtime cost. We are committed to keeping up the cost control focus in 2010, and we are holding the line on our 2010 O&M target of $4.35 billion, despite additional pension and OPEB expenses again this year. This will require a constant focus and we'll need to find additional opportunities to improve productivity within the business to weather these challenging economic times and deliver on our commitments to you. To finish up, let me turn your attention to slide 14. For 2009, we're pleased to have once again delivered earnings that are well within our regional guidance range, in a year when many others struggled to do the same.  For 2010, we are reaffirming our full year guidance $3.60 to $4 per share and anticipate first quarter results of $0.85 to $0.95 per share. I want to add some color to our first quarter 2010 guidance range, as it is lower than consensus end of last year. We forecast the shape of our quarterly earnings profile in 2010 to differ from the profile in 2009. For 2010, the slope of our earnings is expected to be weighted to the second half of the year and we have a plan to deliver on those results.  We will continue to give specific quarterly guidance, one quarter a time and we've included more details on the assumptions behind our full year 2010 guidance on slide 25 in our materials. We clearly see 2010 as another challenging year. We are committed to offsetting higher pension cost with other sales to protecting and realizing value to our hedging program, and to generating higher earned returns from our utilities. I'll now turn the call back over to Karie. 
Karie Anderson: Krystal, we are now ready to take questions.
Operator: (Operator instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.
Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank: I had a quick question on the change in the way you disclose your south region hedging and specifically taking the capacity payments on legacy contracts and out of the hedge disclosures and into gross margin. Can you give us any sense of what the tenure or the life span of those contracts is, it sounds like we weren’t going to see them in the hedges anymore.
John Rowe: Ken Cornew?
Ken Cornew: First of all, as you know in the south, we do have long-term purchase power agreements out of combined cycle and peaking plants and the tenure of those purchase power agreements as you also may know are very long, many of which go through this decade. And in the past couple of years, we have worked to find opportunities to actually sell a similar kind of product that we purchased from those plants to other counterparties, so these contracts look like purchases that have a big capacity payment and then we dispatch the generation essentially at the cost of producing the energy at the time. So what we have done is sold light contracts with the capacity payment to a purchaser and then give the rights to dispatch that energy to those purchasers under long-term agreement. We think that adds good value to our portfolio in the south. With that being said, those capacity payments for what we had bought were always in the open gross margin calculation and for what we sell, we had in the past as Matt indicated put them in the estimated or any effective realized energy price. We made the change to move the sales we make, the capacity element of the sales we make also into the open gross margin to be a) more consistent with the other regions, all of our capacity revenues are in an estimated open gross margin and also to allow you to really compare a shorter-term energy price in the south with our shorter-term hedging activity and make that comparison. That's essentially the change we made. As Matt said no impact on the ultimate calculation of our estimated gross margins, but we think a better way to reflect our hedge disclosure given that we have entered into these kinds of long-term sale.
Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank: But does the majority of the margin associated with those contracts, have about kind of through this decade, life span or is that more the…?
Ken Cornew: Yes, Jonathan, further more the vast majority of the margin we get will be in the capacity payment itself, not in the energy component.
Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank: If I may ask one on a different topic on the cost savings and you talked about holding the line in 2010 and that will involve finding new savings. Is it possible to give us some color on how much you’ll have to be going after new savings and how much will be sustaining some of the $200 million saved in '09 as you look at the components of keeping the number to 4.35?
John Rowe: Chris, can amplify this, but I believe we have about $100 billion new budget challenge to keep our number down to that $4.35 billion and that is because there are some things like the pension and OPEB that we have to cope with it, it’s not just sustaining the old one, but Chris would you like to amplify that?
Chris Crane: No, that’s right. It’s around a $100 million challenge remaining to hold the 4.35 and we are in a process of solidifying the plans to set the target at the business unit levels that we would be able to trend over the year, we anticipate being able to do it, but it’s going to be over a 100 different spending accounts versus one or two.
Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank: So, that means you have to hold the line on the 200 and find another 100, am I reading that right?
Chris Crane: That’s correct.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Hugh Wynne with Sanford Bernstein.
Hugh Wynne - Sanford Bernstein: I had a question regarding an external development earlier this month, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection issued a draft order discharge permit for your Oyster Creek plant, that would require the construction of a cooling tower at the site. You all have said that that would be uneconomic and cause you to close the unit if the requirement were maintained. If I got my numbers right, at 625 megawatt unit, it probably produces $5 million megawatt hours a year and contributes something like $200 million annually to your gross margin. So its loss I estimate would be maybe a $0.15 hit to earnings, something of that order of magnitude. Can you bring us up-to-date on where that stands and why you believe that it will not be necessary to put in cooling towers at this time?
John Rowe:  Yes, Hugh, we will be happy to do that. Bill Von Hoene is ready with that information.
Bill Von Hoene: We do not believe that cooling towers are likely to be required and that's based on a couple of factors. It's an issue that is being considered on past occasions by the New Jersey [DET] when they were reviewing the water discharge permit for Oyster Creek and in each instance that occurred they ultimately concluded the towers were not required. There is no legal or scientific basis in our view for the towers. The draft permit that was issued earlier contemplates a long process by its terms because of the complexity of the issue where there will be ample discourse on this and as I know you are also working on that, Christi [ph] has indicated to initiate a stakeholder process separate apart from the permit review process to review all the impacts on the bay there on a holistic basis. And as those various factors are coalesced over the period of time. We think there are a variety of ways that this could go including a withdrawal of the draft and a deferral of action by postponing the comment period. the conduct of the hearings, but no formal action. But our view is ultimately that if we do not believe, it is likely that permits will be issued which required the cooling towers.  The timetable for action on this would typically be about 12 months on the permit, consideration and the draft permits contemplates a seven year compliance period with the ultimate permit requirements. We think that’s probably going to be extended even without regard to the Christi [ph] stakeholder process.  With regard to the earnings impact, Hugh, in the event that we were required to install cooling towers at the condition of continuing to operate Oyster Creek at the expiration of that timetable I just talked about and obviously the impact depends on the number of years of continued operations but we don’t believe the impact would be significant. It is our smallest nuclear unit with high cost structure relative to our more efficient two unit plants. We would be able to reduce capital maintenance spend in the shorter operating life and we performed a discounted cash flow analysis comparing it at net present value of continued operations with cooling towers to a range of operating life without it and we've concluded that we would be in a better condition financially to shut it down rather than to install the cooling towers.
Hugh Wynne - Sanford Bernstein: Thanks. That’s very thorough. What was the compliance period you said after the permit was issued.
Bill Von Hoene: Seven years after the finalization of the permit, normally it takes about a year to finalize the permit. In this case the draft permit itself contemplates a much more complicated process. So we think all-in-all if this ran its course as I said again without the stakeholder process you'd be looking at 2019 for the ultimate compliance to be required.
Hugh Wynne - Sanford Bernstein: Okay, and just a quickie for Matt. I believe it's correct to say that your estimate of cash flow from operations for 2010 has been reduced slightly from what it was back in November at EEI. I think something like $225 million. Could you perhaps comment on that?
Matthew Hilzinger: I think at EEI what we had shown was that we were going I think 2010 have a starting cash balance of about $700 million and then were going to end the year with about $75 million. We’ve revised that. You'll see that on slide I think it's 16 in the deck that we actually are starting the year with a $1 billion of cash. So the $300 million above what we had at EEI is made up of really two components. About $200 million is just timing, things that we expected to spend in December got pushed to January and so it's just timing. There was about $100 million that we had in lower CapEx spending related to kind of growth CapEx to utilities and you'll see that kind of close down to the bottom line in terms of cash ending balance but our expectations for cash and how we expect to use it aren’t different at all from what we've explained at EEI and since then.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse.
Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse: Just on the O&M cuts, not to dwell on this too long, but if the demand outlook for 2010 is better than you guys expect, how does that O&M number look? Is it one of these things you can avoid the cost if things are slow but as they pick up, the cost ratably return and how much of the savings that the 200 extra in '09 and the next 110, how much of that you think is going to be permanent versus responsive to the market? Chris Crane  The load returning or market prices returning won't have an effect on our planned O&M spend so they are not connected. They may have a potential effect on our capital spend if we saw the requirements for new business to come back in. So that would be the connection on use of cash but we would have to trend that over the year to compare the two. The actual sustainable savings in 2010 we said was about 50% and that is because we took compensation actions in 2010 due to our lower earnings where we reduced our incentive and froze salaries and actions like that throughout the periods. So, we have given in the EI deck the guidance of what we think 11 will inflate off of 10 and that is baked into that number also. 
Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse: That numbers still holds, you know you guys are ahead of plans as far as what overall O&M savings are?
John Rowe:  Right.
Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse: Okay. And John, I guess one other question you said in your comments that you are going you know, you are just getting, you started to work on cost savings and on ways to improve revenues in 2010, make sure I heard you correctly and if so given the heads positions where you see opportunities to improve revenues this year?
John Rowe : Well, we continue to find things in both delivery companies where we are more efficient about catching lost revenues. We do have the open positions that you are all familiar with and somehow it's been my experience that as the course of the year comes on, you keep finding something you can do, some deal you can make, some transaction on both the cost side and the revenue side that don't add tens of millions but add a penny at a time, that's kind of what management is all about both here and every other good company. And so it’s no particular magic, it’s just that the big difference between making a plan and going out and making it work. You all would find some good things to do and I am kind of optimistic that we haven't hit the bottom of the barrel on either side. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Fleischman with Bank of America.  Steve Fleischman - Bank of America Yeah. Hi John, two questions. In the release, your last call talked about evaluating and pursuing appropriate growth opportunities for the long-term, is that just kind of a reference to the nuclear uprates and things like that, just curious kind of what was maybe meant by that?
John Rowe : No Steve. You know in this jungle we are hyenas, I mean we are constantly looking for something dead on the plains, I'm trying to be funny, but people think we have this mad passion to do major merger, and I would think we would have proven long since that that we'd like to grow that way if we can do it, in a way that makes you money. We look at those things, we look at transmission investments, we look at our nuclear uprates, we look at how we can make money on investing in our regulated delivery systems and there is no magic anywhere. It's all a matter of being very, very hard-headed, very opportunistic and constantly looking for something that will deliver additional value to you, and I'm absolutely convinced that if we just maintain the financial discipline that allows us to walk away even if it's a little embarrassing for me or little infuriating for Chris, it was still resentful. As long as we have that discipline in chaotic times like we face, there are going to be some opportunities out there. And I don’t know what they are, I am not trying to hide some secret plan. Its just we are very much oriented to looking for value where it comes and that’s true in analyzing our internal things like nuclear uprates and it's true in Ian's new transmission company. No magic, just hard headed.  Steve Fleischman - Bank of America Yeah. One other question, I think Matt mentioned energy efficiency impacts, for residential, for both ComEd and PECO kind of residential sales, flat to down, when both those utilities look at their peak demand forecast going forward now given energy efficiency, what are they expecting for peak demand growth going forward, is the energy efficiency already kind of embedded in there, when they look at that or?
Matthew Hilzinger: Well, we have tried to embed as best we can, I am going to ask Denis O’Brien to tell you about PECO first and then Anne Pramaggiore to tell you about ComEd. They'll answer your question directly. They'll also tell you a little bit about what we are seeing from industrial customers. So Denis, will you take the first shot?
Denis O’Brien: Yeah, John. In terms of our energy efficiency programs, if you look at the profile that we are looking at for 2010, we are seeing overall a 1.5% decrease in load. When you look behind that at the residential piece of it, we see the year starting up slow and coming back somewhat in the second half of it. If we took energy efficiency out, we'd see load growth in residential probably somewhere just shy of 1%. When we overlay our energy efficiency programs which primarily impacts the residential market, that takes the load growth down to 1.3% negative growth. When we estimate peak, we generally keep it pretty close to what our energy forecast is. So if you think there is a negative 1.3% growth or weather corrected peak, if you have a weather corrected peak, it would probably follow that same thing. Interestingly, our last peak was August of 2006, so we have not had a peak year since then and given these energy decreases, I am not sure we would see a new peak this year.
Anne Pramaggiore: Directly to answer the question, our programs take about 0.5% spread out over all our classes but predominantly in residential for 2010. They ramp up to 2% in the 2013 time frame. It is built into our load projections as they stand today. Our peak situation is similar to Denis', you know we track it in much the same way, we are looking at roughly a flat peak for 2010. Our last peak was in 2006. So, we are looking much the same as PECO. I think in general our load projections as John I think alluded to how we are looking at this. Obviously, we use our forecast in our model for ComEd, we are looking at about a 0.8% increase for 2010, but we try to get behind that a little bit because I think all of the forecast and just that 2010 is a turning point or a transition year, so trying to get behind that little bit, we have been doing a quarterly annual survey of our largest customers somewhere between 80 and 100 customers just to get a handle anecdotally on what’s gong on out there. And I think what we are seeing is tracking fairly closely to what our models are suggesting. Our up tick for 2010 is based on movement in the C&I ranks, not in residential, very little in small C&I, predominantly large C&I and our survey would suggest, if you looked at rough numbers of the 85 large customers, you know half are looking at flat load, 40% are looking at an increase, of what magnitude I think yet to be seen. But we are seeing a little bit of optimism, we have also talked to our trade associations out there and again a glimmer of optimism but I think it is too early to tell. In terms of sectors I think we are seeing auto and transportation stabilizing a bit, seeing the new shifts come on and I think steel and metal works, similarly there is some indication that we may see some increase in load for 2010. So, those are the -- to give you sort of lay of the land at what we are looking out on the load.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.
Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs: Yeah, actually I have two questions. One, this may be a Ken Cornew question. Can you talk about, kind of annually how much wind capacity you expect to come online that can dispatch into NiHub and what are the factors that could make that a bigger or smaller number when you look out over the next three to five years?
John Rowe:  (inaudible) but Ken will give you the answer.
Ken Cornew: Hey, Michael, to the first question, at EEI we talked about by 2012 seeing an incremental 3,000 megawatts approximately of wind coming online. We still think that’s about the right number. It stays ahead of the requirements when you add them up by state and seems to be, what we're seeing in the near term happening. So that, from a near term perspective, that’s what we're looking at. The factors that drive it, I think John probably jumped in there on one of them but obviously the regulatory climate and associated rules by state and if some federal elements come into play, they would be drivers obviously for more or less wind investment if they did come to pass. But really the economics are the key issue. You currently still have power prices and cost structures for development that are disjointed and the wind developers are facing that challenge of trying to find ways to get their plant developed in for someone to take the economic risk of the plants in the marketplace. So, you really have what we see as a relatively slow development process right now getting to about 3,000 megawatts in the next three years and what would change that would be much better economics, higher prices, obviously in the longer-term more robust transmission or a more legislative or regulatory drivers that help the process. Was that what you were looking at?
Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs: Yeah, that’s fine. Thank you very much. Financial question, just looking at the balance sheet, there’s a little bit over $2 billion of goodwill still there. Can you talk about A, where that goodwill, effectively where the most of it is allocated to, and B, the timing and the potential for a goodwill write down given just what's happened asset valuations across the power sector?
Matthew Hilzinger: Michael, this is Matthew Hilzinger. It's all sitting at ComEd, and we've had, historically had a few write-offs although it's probably been three years since we had a write-off. We do take a look at it on a regular basis. We take a look at it and go through a very formal review every November. We did that this time and we passed the test substantially, meaning we passed by somewhere around $700 million. So there is a fair amount of cushion and there is all sorts of factors that go into it which include kind of the valuation of the utilities, what discount rates are, what projected capital spends are going to be and what expected returns are going to be. So we take a look at it all the time. There is no way to really predict when there is going to be a write-off but I would suspect with a recovery in the ComEd that will add value to the two utilities and the two utilities continue to improve and particularly ComEd continuously is improving its return on its earned equity, and I think that will add value and help in terms of our ability to pass the test. So we take a look at it all the time. It's hard to predict but as you realize too, it's non cash. It just won’t have any impact in the balance sheet at all.
Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs: Understood. Last one, what are the kind of the returns on, given where forward prices are in the Midwest, what are the kind of returns on capital you expect from some of the nuclear uprates in that part of your effective area? 
Matthew Hilzinger:  Chris, we have a range, and I am not sure if we publicize the range and the return on capitals of those individual projects, I am looking at Karie to see …yeah, the uprates.
Karie Anderson: On the uprates in our EEI deck, the three categories of projects will be giving you a range of returns, and we'll be happy to walk anyone through those slides.
John Rowe:  Michael, before we turn it over to the next individual, I just thought I might take a moment to have everybody on the phone and just describe a little bit about our first quarter earnings and what’s happening there because I think that that is a point of thought with everybody out in the street. We spend a lot of time in our planning process going through and evaluating what our quarterly earnings ought to be and we tie it directly to the business operations and so, when we did and put together our 2010 plan, we were very specific and deliberate in how we spread our earnings and our guidance for the first quarter clearly reflects that. When you look at last year's earnings, they were, I would say unproportionally high in comparison to how we normally run the business, and 2009 had the first half was probably more front loaded than what've traditionally seen in terms of our earning pattern here at Exelon and so I think 2010 will be kind of a more traditional earnings pattern. And when we look at the first quarter, this year compared to last year, one of the big things is, we have fewer outages in 2008 than we expect to have in 2009 That will impact both the revenue and the O&M line. And then some of the other key drivers that we've outlined at EEI and are in the slides, today we expect -- we also expect to see in terms of kind of lower revenue, higher depreciation, higher CTC, higher nuclear fuel, and these are all things that we know and we calculated. And so the earnings that we put out, the earnings guidance we put out is not new to us. I mean it's what we have been expecting since we put our plan together and we are very, very confident in our ability to meet our earnings guidance for the year. And so the first quarter earnings guidance here should not be considered a red flag. We are very confident, it's what we expect and what we have planned on.
John Rowe: Karie?
Karie Anderson: Krystal, we will now go to closing remarks. John?
John Rowe : Thank you, Karie. And thank you everybody. For anybody who didn’t get their questions in, Karie will be happy to get you the answers. I just want to say at the end that we all know that 2009 has been a tough year and none of us know exactly where the economy is going in 2010. We all have access to the same professional opinions. I just want to provide a little context. In the 26 years I have been doing this, and I have seen a lot of ups and a lot of downs. I can still remember in 2007, early in 2008, when it looked like there was no limit to the amount of money you could make on unregulated generations.  I can remember later in 2008, when it looked like the best thing to be would be to be a fully regulated integrated. Well, the fact of the matter is commodity booms don’t last forever. Commodity buzz don’t last forever and rate cases have their own challenges that you have seen for several very good companies in the last few months.  What we can do during these cycles is manage the basics really, really well. We did that at Exelon during 2009 and I think we can do that again in 2010, and as for long-term value creation, as customer demand recovers, Exelon benefits. As natural gas prices and coal comes back, which in due course they will, Exelon will benefit. As reserve margins tighten and capacity prices rise, Exelon stands to benefit. As the world puts a premium in one way or another on being lower carbon, Exelon stands to benefit. As there is more intense 3P regulation of other companies, Exelon stands to benefit. A lot of companies benefit from one or two of these factors, I respectfully submit that only Exelon benefits from them all, and we will work like hell in the meantime. Thanks a lot. 
Karie Anderson: Thank you. That concludes our call. 
Operator: And this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to the Exelon third quarter earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)  I’d now like to turn the conference over to Karie Anderson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Karie Anderson: Thank you, Beverley. Good morning, welcome to Exelon’s third quarter 2009 earnings review and conference call update. Thank you for joining us today. We issued our earnings release this morning; if you haven’t received that the release is available on the Exelon website at www.exeloncorp.com or you can call Dolores Munguia at 312-394-5222 and she will fax or email the release to you. Before we begin today’s discussion let me remind you that the earnings release and other matters we discuss on today’s call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainty, as well as adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings. Please refer to today’s 8-K or other filings for discussions of factors that may cause results to differ from management’s projections, forecasts and expectations and for a reconciliation of operating to GAAP earnings. Leading the call today are John Rowe, Exelon’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Matthew Hilzinger, Exelon’s Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by other members of Exelon’s Senior Management Team’s who will be available to answer your questions. We have scheduled 60 minutes for this call. I will now turn the call over to John Rowe, Exelon’s CEO.
John Rowe: Thank you, Karie. Good morning everyone. My key messages for today are on slide three of your materials, but first, we are achieving our financial commitments despite difficult weather, difficult economic and difficult marketing conditions. We again delivered excellent generation and utility performance through the summer months. We have increased our financial flexibility by using tools given by the improving capital markets and also by Federal pension legislation. The Illinois legislature passed the bad debt rider for ComEd, which is now awaiting Illinois Commerce Commission implementation. Our utilities unveiled Smart Grid plans totaling $1 million of potential investment and have filed applications for Federal stimulus dollars for part of those funds. In Washington we continue to be very active in the push for climate change legislation. Now let me turn to our financial and operating results for the quarter. We reported operating earnings of $0.96 per share for the quarter. That is in the upper half of our guidance range of $0.90 to $1 per share. We achieved this in spite of $0.07 per share of unfavorable weather conditions at ComEd and PECO during the third quarter as compared to our normal weather assumption. The generation fleet performed well with a capacity factor of 94.7% in the nuclear fleet for the quarter. Our fossil fleet had the highest year-to-date commercial availability factor that it has at 94.1%, this is the highest since we started tracking in 2005. The hedges we entered into in prior years when markets were better again proved effective at Exelon Generation, with average realized energy margins only 1% lower quarter-over-quarter despite, spot prices being 60% and 50% lower at PJM-West hub and Ni-Hub. Our delivery companies continue to execute with ComEd delivering the best year-to-date results in its recorded history for both outage duration and outage frequency. PECO’s separate reliability performance was also the best on record and we delivered on our committed to cost savings across all our operating companies. I am very, very proud of our management for doing everything they could on both the performance and cost side to help us deal with the weather and market conditions that we faced. Turning to the full year, we believe we can achieve 2009 operating earnings within our guidance range, albeit near the lower end of that range. We believe we can do this in spite of the substantial magnitude of the challenge we faced. Unfavorable weather and lower load conditions which reduced our year-to-date reported earnings by $0.18 per share versus our original assumptions. Pension and OPEB costs increased $0.11 per share due to a drop in year end entrance rates after we issued our 2009 earnings guidance last November. Last, but by no means least, we had faced spot power prices during the first nine months that were about 50% lower than our original planning assumptions. We have coped with these challenges through a relentless focus on cost and I’m particularly grateful to our COO, Chris Crane, for leading that effort. He has not only met the assignments we have given him, he has exceeded them. Over the course of the third quarter, we identified approximately $100 million of additional one-time opportunities to reduce 2009 costs. That allows us to stay within our guidance range for the year. At the present time, we believe our operating earnings for 2009 will be within a range of $4 to $4.10 per share. We will, of course, continue to work on a whole lot of other ways to deliver results. During the course of this year, we increased our forecasted cash flows from operations by $850 million over our original assumptions, largely due to changes in the tax laws and tax planning. We have improved our financial flexibility by making a $350 million discretionary pension contribution and refinancing the $1.2 billion of debt at favorable rates. Matt will discuss those shortly. Let me now comment just a bit on energy markets. The results of last Monday’s second auction for PECO’s residential and small C&I load were released on Wednesday. Wholesale prices for PECO’s residential and commercial products were $79.96 per megawatt hour and $85.85 per megawatt hour. The combination of these first two procurements suggest the rate increase from generation of only about 4% for PECO’s residential customers. Again, this shows that competitive markets are working in Pennsylvania. In September, the Illinois Power Agency filed its plan for ComEd’s next procurement with the Commerce Commission. The IPA will continue to procure block energy products for a three year period, which our base load nuclear fleet in the Midwest is ideally suited to serve. We are pleased that FirstEnergy has announced that it is planning to join PJM. This illustrates that PJM remains the premier wholesale market in the Northeast. We believe that First Energy’s joining PJM will create further operating efficiencies within that market. Now we’re working, as always, on strengthening our regulatory and financial position at both ComEd and PECO. PECO is on track to deliver a return on equity in excess of 11% in 2009. We believe ComEd will have recovered its returns to approximately 8% and thanks to Frank Clark, Anne Pramaggiore and Darryl Bradford, we believe ComEd is on track to achieve a return of nearly 10% in 2010. As you all know, that’s a substantial recovery at ComEd. This reflects the benefit of ComEd’s cost reductions and its increased use of riders to meet ROE targets. In the third quarter the Illinois legislature enacted a bad debt rider that will provide ComEd with more timely recovery of its bad debt costs. We expect to receive a commission decision on implementing that rider in the first quarter of 2010. Last week the commission approved ComEd’s request for recovery of ComEd’s Smart Meter Pilot Program. ComEd’s success in both cost reductions and using riders for specific expenditures has allowed it to defer a full rate case filing until 2010. I believe this will ultimately be in ComEd’s benefit and Exelon’s benefit. In the third quarter both ComEd and PECO made filings for Smart Grid investments totaling over $1 billion and they included applications for Federal stimulus dollars totaling $375 million. A very large portion of the utilities in the country have filed stimulus requests and we do not yet know who will be successful or how DOE will implement dealing with these requests. Legislators, commissioners and community groups have all worked with us to support these requests. I believe that the Smart Grid requests not only have a high likelihood of regulatory recovery, but I also believe they help our overall regulatory programs because our commissioners believe these are positive and productive efforts to give customers more control over their own usage. We have one bit of particular good news on the Generation front, and that is that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved the relicensing of our Three Mile Island Nuclear Unit this week. That license will be extended through 2034. I would also urge you to pay attention to one bit of news affecting another company. As you all know, our Q’s and K’s for many years have reported substantial tax issues involving the like kind exchanges that we entered into some years back and up until now there have been I think two court cases, which have affirmed the IRS position on particular facts. Within the last week there as been a case involving consolidated Edison which makes very clear that these are fact based cases and since we believe we have good tracks we believe that helps both our potential litigating position and our negotiating position with the IRS. That said, this remains an area of substantial attention for the company, but it’s a nice to have a little good news on that front. Now I want to close with a few more words on climate legislation. As you all know, Exelon identified the climate challenge as something to pay attention to from both a management point of view and a legislative point of view a long time ago. Climate change was one of the factors we took into account when we sold the ComEd fossil plant a decade ago. Climate change is the reason we put together our Exelon 20:20 plan to neutralize our carbon footprint. I started working with the National Commission on Energy Policy on ways of dealing with climate change at least seven years ago, and we believe that climate change legislation is coming ever closer to passing. Betsy Moler and I work with the Edison Electric Institute with USCAP and others to try to develop a cap and trade system in a format that the Senate will adopt. We are absolutely convinced that cap and trade legislation is the way to deal with climate that offers the best chance of keeping costs down for our customers and creating an earnings opportunity for our shareholders. We worked on getting it through the House when the bill was pending in the House. We are now working with individual senators from both parties. We all are working with other like-minded corporations in various states while the news seems to change almost every week on climate, I think the most recent news is very positive. About 10 to 12 days ago Senators Kerry and Graham, senator Graham being a Republican from South Carolina, senator Kerry being a Democrat from Massachusetts and a co-sponsor of the Boxer-Kerry Bill, indicated their willingness to work together on a bipartisan cap and trade program. I think this suggest that the matter is not quite as polarized in the Senate as some feared it would be. We look forward to working with Chairman Boxer, with senator Kerry, with senator Graham, with our own senators, and with any of the senators who have an interest in finding a cost effective solution to the climate challenge, and I have been personally spending a great deal of time on this and Betsy Moler is probably spending 80% of her time on this. We’re doing everything we can to try to see that it’s set up to pass when the Senate is ready to take up the matter. There’s been a great deal of common effort in this regard and I think we’re seeing some real progress again. In the same time, we’re very proud of what’s going on within Exelon itself on climate. We are one-third of the way along the road to meeting our emission reduction goal; you can see that in Exelon 2020, which is posted on our website. We have used the Exelon 2020 framework to evaluate the cost of different ways of reducing CO2 and other greenhouse gases in terms of dollars per ton of avoided CO2 and we continue to make real progress. Exelon 2020 has gone from being a directional vector for a real plan on how to meet power supply needs within our territories in a low carbon way. For the fourth year in a row, Exelon was named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index and we continue to be a leader in dealing with this problem and especially a leader in dealing with it in a way that’s good for both our customers and our shareholders. I’ll now turn this over to Matt.
Matthew Hilzinger: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. As John mentioned, Exelon produced results consistent with our expectations for the quarter despite historically cool weather at both utilities and the continued impacts of the economy on our business. I’ve highlighted my key messages for this morning on slide four. Moving to slide five, we reported operating earnings of $0.96 per share in the third quarter of 2009 compared to $1.07 in the third quarter of 2008. Our results reflect higher earnings at ComEd offset by reduced earnings at Exelon generation with PECO holding flat. Turning to Exelon Generation on slide six, Generation’s results were $0.16 per share lower quarter-over-quarter driven by portfolio and market conditions as depressed power prices continue to be seen across all regions. We saw a $0.06 per share decline in market conditions with $0.03 per share coming from our South Region portfolio due to declines in natural gas prices and spark spreads. We also saw $0.04 of unfavorability in rate around fuel related to higher nuclear fuel cost and lower nuclear volumes. Yet despite increases in pension and OPEB expenses Generation held O&M flat in the third quarter compared to the prior year and is on track to meet its increased goal for the full year O&M cost savings. As you can see on slide seven, our 2009 hedged amounts of 98% to 100% reflect a fully hedged position for us as we always leave a small amount of operational length to address unplanned outages in the fleet. Our ratable hedging program has an enabled us to realize revenue in our portfolio at significantly higher levels than spot market prices, because we are on a 36 month ratable plan we locked in the large majority of our 2009 sales in 2007 and 2008, which has resulted in our delivering stable cash flows with little expected variance despite declines in power prices since this time last year. Looking forward to 2010, we continue to execute on our ratable plan and are now hedged right around 90%, consistent with our goal of being around 95% hedged as we move into the next delivery year. The 2010 overall expected Generation hedged of 88% to 91% has not changed significantly since the second quarter. In the Midwest region we are a bit ahead of a purely ratable plan as we continue to execute retail and wholesale sales to meet year end hedge. In the Mid-Atlantic region we are seeing slight reductions in load estimates on full requirement products resulting from switching in the commercial and industrial customer classes both in Pennsylvania as some utilities begin to transition to market rates and in New Jersey in the BGS auction. We are also seeing some reduction in demand in the Mid-Atlantic as a result of the recession. These factors were generally offset by incremental sales during the third quarter. In our South region we have seen some reductions in expected Generation because lower market implied heat rates in ERCOT are resulting in lower dispatch levels for our combined cycle units. Our South region portfolio is much smaller than the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic, so relatively small changes tend to have a large impact on the percentage of expected Generation hedged. For 2011 we are now hedged at 63% to 66% on a total portfolio basis with many of the same trends I described in 2010 also coming through in 2011, except in the Midwest region where Generation’s 3000 mega watt financial swap with ComEd keeps it a bit ahead of a purely ratable plan. We continue to employ put options in our portfolio to manage risk on the downside and give us optionality on the upside as commodity prices recover. The bands of expected gross margin outcomes across all years continue to tighten and you’ll see by the calculations that we have provided in our disclosures that our 2009 expected gross margin is within about $5 million of where we stood at the time of our second quarter call. Turning to slide eight, ComEd’s earnings increased $0.02 per share compared to earnings in the prior period last year primarily driven by $0.06 per share from higher electric distribution rates. ComEd continues to meet its cost management goals for the year, delivering O&M savings of $0.03 per share quarter-over-quarter despite higher pension and benefit costs. ComEd was unfavorably impacted by $0.03 per share due to much cooler than normal weather in our traditional peak period this summer. We had the second coldest July in 118 years without a single day above 90 degrees compared to last year cooling degree days were down 34%. On slide nine we provided an update of ComEd load trends, weather normalized load for the third quarter was down 3.8% over the third quarter last year contributing $0.01 per share of unfavorability to ComEd’s quarterly results. Load in the large commercial and industrial class was down 8.6%, but due to demand based rate design for these customers the revenue impact is not dollar-for-dollar and we saw only a 5.2% decline from the large C&I class in quarterly distribution revenues year-over-year excluding the impacts of the rate case. We are modifying ComEd’s load forecast across all customer classes to be down 3.4% for the year versus our previous expectation for 2009 of negative 3.0%. For the fourth quarter, we expect to see a moderation in the rate of decline compared to the same period last year largely due to the fact that the impacts of the economic crisis were already being felt by the end of 2008. Looking ahead, we are currently forecasting that we’ll begin to see some recovery in ComEd’s large C&I load around the middle of 2010 as production begins to rebound and we begin to see some modest growth in the Chicago Gross Metro Product. In the residential and small C&I segments, we see recovery over an extended period for ComEd. We have 20,000 fewer customers on the system now versus a year ago and we are projecting lingering high unemployment and declining use per customer due to energy efficiency programs. As a result, we are currently forecasting load in the residential class to hold essentially flat in 2010. Moving now to PECO on slide 10, cooler than normal weather costs is about $0.01 per share in earnings versus the third quarter last year. PECO is also controlling its cost, achieving a $0.04 per share reduction in bad debt expense through enhancements to its credit and collection processes of accounts receivables and holding the line on all other O&M costs. Load declines continue to impact PECO as well, resulting in a reduction of $0.03 per share versus the third quarter last year. We’ve provided an update of PECO load trends on slide 11. For the full year 2009, we are projecting a decline in load of 2.7% across all customer classes versus our prior projection of negative 1.8%. Residential load has declined 5.5% this quarter, compared to third quarter last year and we are forecasting a decline in residential load for the full year of about 2.5%. These declines are a result of both reductions in usage per customer, as well as a decline in the number of residential customers on the system, about 4,000 less customers than last year. Unemployment in Philadelphia area is better than the national average at 8.5%, but represents the highest unemployment rate we’ve seen in the region since 1982. In the large C&I class, we are seeing the biggest negative impact from the manufacturing, petroleum and pharmaceutical segments and we are not forecasting much growth in the Philadelphia Gross Metro Product through 2010. Looking forward to 2010 for PECO, we expect that PECO will have negative load next year of about 1.3%, principally due to the impacts of energy efficiency programs required by Act 129 in Pennsylvania, which begin next year. There’s no simple or exact answer to the question of when this recession will end. As we mentioned last quarter, the large C&I reductions we’re seeing both at ComEd and PECO are more the result of shift reductions and not wholesale shutdowns of businesses. We see a reasonable possibility of a recovery in our service territories beginning in mid 2010 and our 2010 forecasted load growth reflects that, but we continue to monitor national and regional economic data closely to look for continued signs of stabilization. Despite the continued declines in load, the unusually cool summer, and the continued pressures on power markets, we have generated overall results in our operating earnings consistent with expectations again this quarter, largely as a result of our cost reduction initiative. Moving to slide 12, earlier this year, we announced that we were targeting $150 million in operational O&M savings for 2009. On our second quarter call we’ve reported that we had achieved $68 million of that amount. I’m very pleased to say that we have already met our target for the full year and we expect to achieve even more before the year is out. We are on track to deliver about $100 million of additional onetime O&M reductions above the $150 million, we previously committed to. We’ve been able to achieve these onetime cuts by taking aggressive actions in such areas as contracting supply and controlling overtime spend. As a result of our efforts we have offset a significant portion of unfavorability from weather load and market conditions that we have seen this year and particularly in the third quarter and you will now see that our new 2009 O&M target is $4.4 billion. Along with our cost savings, we are also expecting to deliver increased cash from our operations for the full year of $5.6 billion, an increase of the $850 million over our original 2009 estimates. Increases in cash are driven by our achieved cost savings, changes in PJM billing practices and other one-time items such as bonus depreciation benefits under the economic stimulus plan and cash tax planning strategies. We are deploying that cash in a number of ways. We continue to offer a stable annual dividend of $2.10 per share and we are beginning to invest in growth projects such as our Nuclear uprates, which offer returns in excess of our cost of capital and we have increased our financial flexibility going forward to a voluntary $350 million contribution to our pension plan in September, which I highlighted on slide 13. Our voluntary contribution of $350 million during the third quarter accomplished three goals. First, we reduced our expected Pension Contributions in 2011 by $1 billion. Second, on a present value basis reduced our overall expected required contributions of the next 10 years by over $300 million. Third, we lowered the volatility of future required contributions. We also achieved greater financial flexibility this quarter through our liability management efforts at Exelon Corp and Generation. Last month, we took advantage of strong capital markets by issuing $1.5 billion of Exelon Generation Senior Notes and purchasing approximately $1.5 billion of Corporate and Generation Senior Notes, which included about $300 million of tax exempt debt. The result was a reduction in the cost of debt at Exelon Corp and Generation by approximately $12 million per year and an extension of the duration of a maturity profile by over six and a half years. Today, we expect to close on a $67 million 364 day credit facility with a group of 26 community and minority owned banks. We are very proud to put our commitment to diversity into action by supporting these businesses in our communities. Finally, we are projecting an FFO to debt metric of 41% at Exelon Corp plus Generation for the year, which supports strong investment grade ratings and allows us to maintain flexibility in our liquidity requirements and have continued access to the capital markets. All three agencies now have stable outlooks at Exelon and Generation. During the third quarter S&P, upgraded ComEd’s senior secured debt to a [Myers] and Moody’s upgraded ComEd’s senior secured debt to be AA1. In closing, we remain focused on delivering on the commitments we have made to you. We are also taking advantage of opportunities to improve our financial flexibility and create value as the market recovers. With that we’re ready to take your questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Hugh Wynne - Sanford Bernstein.
Hugh Wynne - Sanford Bernstein: You mentioned that, you expect cash from operations to rise by about $150 million to $5.6 billion, even though you are now contributing $350 million to your pension fund, implying that you’ve been able to increase cash generation of the business by something like $500 million. When I look at your financial coverage ratios, it seems to be having a materially positive impact. Now, based on your cash flow statement, the improvement seems to derive from deferred income taxes, which are $740 million at the end of nine months as compared to about $150 million at the end of six months. My question then is, what have you been able to do on the tax front? Is this a benefit that’s going to reverse next year or can this cash be put in the bank? What should we expect on a going-forward basis?
Matthew Hilzinger: Let me just start with overall where we are with cash, that the $850 million is against our original planning assumptions and guidance that we had given to the Street, so about $400 million of that is coming from the stimulus plan. About $300 million of that is coming from some tax planning that Tom Terry and the tax groups have done around repairs deductions. This quarter we got a methodology change with the IRS around repairs reduction, that’s going to generate about $300 million this year. There’s a piece of that that will flow into next year and the remaining balance is really coming from some of the PJM changes that we get in working capital. So that’s where the $850 million is coming from. You are seeing the deferred taxes change a little bit. It’s primarily around the manufacturer’s deduction that we see and the repairs allowance that we expect to get a benefit from. So the manufacturer’s deduction, I think next year is expected to increase and we may get a little bit of a benefit up and beyond where we are this year and the repairs deduction, as I said, is more onetime and we’ll get a little bit as we go into next year. 
Hugh Wynne - Sanford Bernstein: Matt, can you try to the comment just quickly on the forward hedging program? It seems that your estimated open gross margin in 2011 is now about $400 million lower than you estimated at the end of Q1 and that has occurred despite a slight increase of $0.20 in the price of natural gas and it seems to reflect about a $2.50 reduction in ATC Energy prices at Ni-Hub and PJM West. My question is, do you see that compression and forward spark spreads as persisting? What impact, if any has that forward spark spread compassion had on your hedging? 
John Rowe: Ken Cornew, is much better to answer that than, Matt, for me. Ken. 
Ken Cornew: As you know, we study these prices in the Midwest and across our whole portfolio very carefully. I think your short and quick analysis is right. We’ve seen those estimated open gross margins fall as power prices have fallen. We have been able to take the opportunity to hedge, while that was occurring and add some value with our hedges and you can see and calculate that, when you get to the expected gross margin level. Midwest power prices currently are somewhat depressed and our view is there is some upside in Midwest power prices relative to current forwards. Obviously, the prices are driven by gas and coal, future demand for electricity, new generation build such as wind build out and transmission constraints that we’ve been also following very carefully. When we analyze all those factors holistically, Hugh, we see that prices have upside, several dollars of upside in Midwest power prices. We watch the Ni-Hub spread very carefully and if you looked at 2011 earlier in the year, those spreads were significant and they have contracted and we’ve seen some very recent contraction in those spreads, which is feeding into what I just talked about. I think the power prices are a little low and have some upside to them and we’re starting to see a little bit of that movement right now in these prices. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank. 
Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank: I wanted to ask another question on the open gross margin. Looking specifically at the Q3 disclosure on 2011 you’re showing a number that’s about $200 million lower than you showed at Q2 and in the reference prices that you give us are down less than $1 in terms of power and based on your own sensitivities that would kind of my math suggests explain about $50 million of the move in gross margin. So I’m just wondering what else is going on in that open gross margin number other than power price moves that would be significant?
John Rowe: Ken will follow up on that too, but just let me say we continue to make some sales and that’s part of the answer to the question. Ken, will you pick up?
Ken Cornew: Yes, Jonathan, as you know, the open gross margin is the implied margin of our portfolio completely unhedged, so $1 move in power price is a much larger move. We have 140,000 gigawatt-hours of nuclear power and incremental marginal power. So if you make a $1 move in price, you’re going to see a much bigger move in expected estimated open gross margin that our sensitivities are tailored toward the move in expected gross margin as a result of our hedging and hopefully I think that explains the difference.
Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank: Then just one other thing, you talked about the $100 million of additional O&M savings; I think you characterized as being one-time items. Can you remind us or talk a little about how much of the $150 million of base savings you expect now to be sustainable versus one time?
Chris Crane: The $150 million is sustainable, the additional $100 million that we found in the third quarter, as we said, is not. It’s around areas like, as we said, managing overtime. The utilities have done an excellent job over the summer, the weather has not hampered them to require them significant storm or heat related degradation. The rest of the savings is in a lot of different buckets, it’s materials, contracting, travel, entertainment, it’s significant belt tightening across the business.
Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank: Is it fair to say that that will occur more in Q3 than in Q4 or that it was ratable?
Chris Crane: We managed it more in three and reduced four’s budgets and baked those numbers in already. We’ll continue to look for our carriers and we believe that we’ll find some more, but this is the most substantial part we found thus far.
Operator: Your next question comes from Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse.
Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse: John, you’re talking about climate change legislation and where that’s headed. I was just kind of the knock-on effect of whether we see renewable energy policy along those lines, how you see those policies being married together? Then how you guys would expect renewable policy or greater growth in renewable capacity to affect your power markets?
John Rowe: First, we believe that, like in the House bill, the ultimate Senate package will include both cap and trade and a reasonable renewable package. My latest information supporting that comes from a meeting that U.S. cap folks had with Carol Browner, where she said unequivocally. The administration, does not want an energy only bill it wants an energy and climate bill. I believe that’s where the force is happening. So I’m a little less concerned than I once was that we might get the renewable provision without the cap and trade provision. So I think that’s basically good news. Now obviously, we remain concerned that if renewable portfolio standards go too high the customer hurts, because they pay much too much for the renewables and we hurt because, the renewables depress the market and as far as we’re concerned that it’s not a good situation. I think that both in Illinois and Pennsylvania and at the Federal level, we’re going to keep those to reasonable levels. Anne Pramaggiore is here and she can spell out for you, if you want what the current Illinois standard is. We thought the Waxman-Markey provisions were fairly reasonable on the Federal standard. Frankly, we’ll be just as happy to see a Federal standard, but Anne or Dennis, do want to add anything to that?
Anne Pramaggiore: No, I would just say in Illinois we have a renewable portfolio standard, it came into play in the 2007 legislation. It starts out at 2% in 2008 and increases to 25% in 2025 and the, I think, helpful feature from a customer standpoint is, there is a cap on impact on customer rate and it cannot exceed 2% increase to the total rate. So that’s helpful, I think in terms of managing the customer impact, but also meeting the expectation that we bring some renewables into the portfolio.
Denis O’Brien: In Pennsylvania the renewable legislation was passed in 2004, kicks in the first year that each company comes out of transition. PECO has already done some early compliance with that. We think that legislation makes a lot of sense. There’s another bill in the Legislature in Pennsylvania, House Bill 80, which increases those numbers. The Legislature in Pennsylvania is pretty worn out by the budget proposition and I’m not sure much else happened this session.
Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse: I guess just one other question on the outlook for demand. Can you just run through the underlying economic assumptions behind the flattened or flattish and the negative demand growth trends you’re expecting and potential that you feel that is overly conservative versus a middle of the road set of assumptions for next year?
John Rowe: I think we’re pretty much consistent with nearly everybody else, which suggests that the economy has probably bottomed the recession. To quote Larry Summers and others technically ended, but we don’t see much recovery coming back very rapidly at all. In other words, we start to see some upward movement particularly at ComEd in the second half of next year, but we’re not talking about getting back to the kind of levels we were at in ‘07 and ‘08 for four or five years. Denis, Anne, do you want to add to that?
Denis O’Brien: I’ll just add from a PECO perspective. 2010, we see a negative growth of 1.3%. If you take out the PECO energy efficiency estimates that are on top of that, the growth is about a negative 0.3%. So we’re seeing that our energy efficiency programs will kick in and add about a negative 1% on growth. If you just strip out the energy efficiency affect for a second, the residential starts with some negative growth in the first half and gets better in the second half. The small C&I, follows the same trend and at this point we’re calling the large C&I flat for the year. We then put the negative 1% overlay for the energy efficiency program and that overlay is being put almost wholly on the residential class.
Anne Pramaggiore: I would add just a couple points from the ComEd standpoint. Matt mentioned the structure of our large C&I rate, actually our C&I rates in general, being helpful to mitigate our exposure. We’ve got about 98% of our C&I rates either in the demand charge or a customer charge, so that’s very helpful to us. Frankly, our overall rate structure including residential is about 64% either in demand or a customer charge. So that’s helpful to us going forward. Looking into 2010, I think in 2009 we’ve seen the large C&I class in particular. I think bring the trend line down and we see a little bit of a class shift and 2010, where the large C&I starts to comeback middle of the year and residential is probably taking a little bit more of a hit than we’ve seen in 2009. We actually went out and surveyed our large C&I customers to try to get a sense of whether what we were seeing in the model was consistent with some anecdotal evidence and it seems to be fairly consistent in that some customers are indicating they’re bringing more load back next year. Some information and data sectors as well as some green energy sector. The green energy sector seems to be indicating that they’ll bring a little bit more load back on next year.
John Rowe: I think just a nutshell, what we’ve seen is that the PECO load has dropped less than the ComEd load, because they have less, really every industry, it also comeback a little more slowly. So that’s the best we can do, but what we’re seeing is very much what the general economic commentary you’ll see.

Nathan Judge - Atlantic Equities: I just want to ask a few more questions on that hedging, please. If you look at the percentage of expected generation hedged in the Mid-Atlantic specifically, it hasn’t changed from the second quarter. Just considering that the PECO option happened, could you just comment if there is any change in strategy with regard to hedging in the Mid-Atlantic?
John Rowe: There has not been a basic change in strategy. We have reviewed very carefully our position on whether there should be a change in strategy. We think we can comply with our ratable hedging guidelines and still have plenty of upside left over for the future, but with that let me have Ken answer the more specific part of your question.
Ken Cornew: As you know, we’re modeling our portfolio and expected generation dispatch and expected volumes of sales coming from load following type contracts. In the Mid-Atlantic in particular, we’ve seen a couple things since the last hedge disclosure. We’ve seen higher generation expectations in the region and that would by itself tend to lower the percent hedged calculation. Also we’re looking at load growth or lack of load growth that Denis just talked about, and switching assumptions for the load following type contracts we have in the region and we’ve made adjustments based on best information we have available there. That also will put downward pressure on the hedge percentage. That being said, we have incrementally hedged in the region to negate those and we’re still within a percentage as we disclosed. No change in strategy, we continue to hedge as our strategy has dictated consistently. We did get somewhat ahead of ratable between the first and second disclosure and were afforded with downward price pressure the ability to take a little slower approach in the third quarter, which I think has been a very positive strategy for us, but largely we are staying on plan.
John Rowe: I have one question that Karie Anderson has received from a number of you on the phone over the last several days and just because it’s been asked one at a time I’d like to ask it so I’d like to her to ask it, so I can answer it and have it done. Karie?
Karie Anderson: John, the question I’ve received is, what are you thinking about M&A? There’s been some specific remarks in the press this week.
John Rowe: Well, the remarks in the press this week have been about Calpine. We have great respect for Calpine as a company, we think they have wonderful assets and we’ve looked at them many times in the past. We’ve never been able to put together a plan for a transaction that would make any sense, because it would violate our guidelines about dilution. Our position on M&A is very simple. Our eyes are always open, but we know that most of our shareholders are very reluctant to see us get into another transaction. We deeply believe in our commitments to you that we don’t do them if they’re not going to be value added. We know you don’t want a lot of dilution. We have significant earnings challenges with the lower commodity markets and we’re focusing our attention on what we can do internally, particularly things like our Nuclear uprates starting, Ian’s Transmission Company and that sort of thing. So we’re very much internally focused and you know us well enough to know that our eyes are always open and our pocketbooks are usually closed.
Operator: Your final question comes from Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc.
Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc: John, you just answered my big question, but a follow-up is, the repair expensing versus capitalizing. Is that really all one-time or does that flow into future periods? I know Matt said, some could hit ‘10, but is there just an ongoing impact and what does that imply about rate base?
Tom Terry: Regarding rate base, right now we’ve only claimed a benefit at the Generation Company, that’s the only place, which we’ve had the change in method approved. The biggest bit of the benefit will be in 2009, which is the year of the method change, but there will be an annual incremental benefit as we incur cost that are deductible rather than being capitalized.
Matthew Hilzinger: The thing I would add is that the method change is in connection with the way that we do our taxes, not the way that we do our books. So the policy that we have around capital and expense remains what it’s been.
John Rowe: I wish to make very clear, based on 25 years of hard knocks. We make investments in our delivery customers because our companies need the investments, not because we want to build rate base. I mean rate base gets built easily enough and the issue is trying to manage your investments, so you have a high confidence in getting a return on them and that’s what we’re focused on there.
Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc: Are you looking at potentially doing something on the regulated side along the same tax strategy?
John Rowe: Tom?
Tom Terry: We’re continuing to evaluate that. The IRS is more directly open to considering the method change on the generation side. They’re clearer on the criteria for getting there, but we are continuing to look at the T&D side.
Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc: Then just on the biggest piece hitting ‘09 is that because we’re getting kind of a retroactive restatement of prior year tax positions?
Tom Terry: Yes, it’s the catch up adjustment from the beginning of the Generation business in ‘01 through the end of ‘08.
John Rowe: Just to close. In the third quarter, we had a sick economy and rotten weather and we met our commitments to you. We’re hard at work doing that for the fourth quarter too. I believe we can do it. I’m terribly proud of what nuclear has done in the last quarter. Denis and Frank Clark are continuing to improve PECO and ComEd. They just get better all the time. The way that Ken Cornew and Ian McLean designed the hedging strategy three, four, five years ago has been paying off for you and for us. The commodity cycle is at a low, we all know it’s a low. We’re in a hunkering down period, but we’re doing our best to continue to deliver value to you and we think both the operations and the assets continue to do that. So we will see you all at the November EEI financial conference. By that time, we’ll be able to do our best to give you an estimate on next year’s earnings. As you all know, it’s going to be a little tougher, because we have had less hedged during that period when the times were better, but we’re hard at work on making our cost cuttings work and we’re continuing to look for internal ways to grow your earnings. So we are in the mine hard at work digging coal or uranium, or whatever it is that we dig and we’ll keep making money for you. Thanks a bunch.
Karie Anderson: Thank you, Beverly. That concludes our call.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Jackie and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the second quarter earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker’s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Karie Anderson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma’am.
Karie Anderson: Good morning. Welcome to Exelon second quarter 2009 earnings review and conference call update. Thank you for joining us today. We issued our earnings release this morning, if you haven’t received it, the release is available on the Exelon website at www.exeloncorp.com or you can call Martha Chavez at 312-394-4069 and she will fax or e-mail the release to you. Before we begin today’s discussion, let me remind you that the earnings release and other matters we discuss in today’s call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties, as well as adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings. Please refer to today’s 8-K or our other filings for discussions of factors that may cause results to differ from management’s projections, forecasts and expectations and for a reconciliation of operating to GAAP earnings. Leading the call today are John Rowe, Exelon’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Matthew Hilzinger, Exelon’s Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by other members of Exelon’s senior management team who will be available to answer your questions. We have scheduled 60 minutes for this call. I will now turn the call over to John Rowe, Exelon’s CEO.
John Rowe: Thank you, Karie. Good morning, everyone. Well, as you all know, it has been a turbulent six months between the economy, the weather and the continuation and now termination of our effort to acquire NRG. With all of that, we turned in what we think is a very good quarter. You have seen our earnings in our release this morning. We have kept our commitment to reduce our operating and maintenance spend, we’re being disciplined we’re both our costs and the deployment of our cash and capital. I am very pleased that we released our one-year anniversary progress report on Exelon 2020. It announced that we are more than one-third of the way towards our 2020 goal to reduce, offset or displace our entire 2001 carbon footprint. I really believe this is something no other utility has done and most cannot do and I’m very proud of it and I would refer you to look at it because it tells you an awful lot about what the economic ways are to reduce carbon footprints and what the most expensive ways are to do so. In this quarter, we announced our plans to add between 1300 and 1500 megawatts of nuclear uprates to our existing nuclear platform, the equivalent of a nuclear unit at about half the price. In Washington, we saw continued progress on climate change legislation. Let me begin by addressing the termination of the NRG acquisition effort. We made our case to NRG shareholders through most of a nine month period, they were supportive at the end they did not back our proposals. I still believe this could have been a very good deal with a lot of value for all parties, but we simply couldn’t get it done. When we made our bid for NRG, we thought Exelon was undervalued and NRG even more undervalued. Based on the favorable results we had in the first two tender periods, NRG shareholders agreed with our assessment at that time. Now, NRG shareholders value NRG more highly than they did before and more highly than we do now. Like any transaction, we could have completed this if we had been willing to pay the price, but we are about value. We have promised you that we will stay about value and I am not willing now and will not be willing in the future to sacrifice the value inherent in Exelon’s own prospects. You have asked yourself and we have asked ourselves where does Exelon go from here? When we announced our pursuit of NRG, we indicated that we saw it as a unique opportunity, one that we had evaluated carefully against almost every other M&A partner. At that time and now, no other opportunity appeared as good to us. There are market power issues with most of the other IPPs, price issues with some and regulatory issues at the present time in attempting to merge with most regulated utilities. So, our view is very simple we have no near term acquisition plans. There is no secret teed up and at the present time, we believe investing in our own assets and operations is the best way to spend our money. Now in the second quarter, we kept our focus on our vision. We keep trying to become the best group of electric generation and electric and gas delivery companies in the United States. We are aware that other good utilities are trying to do the same thing, but we believe we are in a very special position as we seek to claim that stature. As you saw in this morning’s release, we reported operating earnings of $1.03 per share for the quarter. Under Chip Pardees leadership, our generation fleet performed exceptionally with a nuclear capacity factor of 93.9% and our fossil team delivered its highest year-to-date availability factor since we began. Both ComEd and PECO also performed well in the quarter. As a result, we were able to deliver solid earnings despite the headwinds of a continued weak economy and lower demand and frankly, despite weather in June that would make a utility executive’s temperament quite moldy. Our performance for the first half of 2009 allows me to reaffirm our operating earnings guidance range of $4 to $4.30 per share for 2009. We’ll keep you advised about that again in our third quarter earnings. Matt will take you through the detailed results for the second quarter in a moment. I want to talk a bit about our standalone value. We see the nuclear operating plan as a very attractive growth opportunity. They allow us to add generation capacity equivalent to a new nuclear unit at about half the cost and with substantially less risk. Unlike building an all new reactor, the nuclear uprates can be done with a phased approach, which gives us the option to delay the more expensive extended power uprates until power prices fully support them. We face substantially lower execution risk than with a new nuclear unit on either a green or a brownfield site. Over the past decade, we have already added the equivalent of a new unit to our existing fleet; we know how to do this. Our recent decision to pursue an early site permit rather than a construction and operating license for Victoria County reflects the greater risk of new build in our current economy. We are committed to our power uprate plan and we are able to finance it. We believe if our base cases hold, we can maintain our current credit ratings and complete the power uprate plan without issuing new equity.  Our next growth opportunity is the expiration of the power purchase agreement between Exelon Generation and PECO at the end of 2010. The results of last month’s auction for PECO’s residential load were an excellent indicator of the continued strong market for generation’s Mid-Atlantic assets with higher margins expected in 2011 and beyond. It is also evidence of a healthy transition to competitive markets in Pennsylvania, one which we believe will continue to benefit consumers, as well as shareholders. Power Team will remain an active participant in the coming procurement auctions throughout the Mid-Atlantic region. Third, in the second quarter, Exelon again showed its ability to reduce expenses. As Matt will outline for you, we are on pace to hold our 2009 O&M spending flat to 2008 levels. As you saw from our release last month, we are working even harder on managing our expenses in 2010. The restructuring we announced last month is nearly complete. This effort, led by Chris Crane, is expected to save $350 million in 2010 from our original planning assumptions, a 3.5% reduction from 2009 levels. While eliminating jobs is always unpleasant, this reorganization is a necessary consequence of the economic and commodity market circumstances we now face. Fourth, with the passage of the Waxman-Markey legislation in the house, we are closer today than ever before to effective climate change legislation. While the near term outlook in the Senate is not clear, the Senate is making progress on considering its own bill.  We appreciate the efforts of the Senate leadership to look for ways to make the bill more attractive to moderate Democrats and additional Republicans. Betsy Moler and I are working hard with EEI, with the USCAP, with other groups to find the kinds of compromised measures that will bring the effort through the Senate. Exelon remains the best positioned company in our industry to deal with a carbon constrained world. Our carbon intensity, measured in tons of CO2 per megawatt hour generated, is the lowest of all the generating companies. We are proud of our progress on Exelon 2020. As we said earlier, we don’t believe anybody else can build a plan like this.  We know what components of the plan, like power uprates and energy efficiency, are the cheapest ways to both create value and create lower carbon energy. Exelon 2020 is very important to me personally, because it allows us to lead on a very important global social issue and at the same time add value to you, our shareholders. Fifth, we are working very hard on developing a business plan for a new transmission company. That effort is being led by Ian McLean, who brings years of experience in power markets and RTOs and Betsy Moler, who as you know, led the FERC’s landmark effort in open access and promoting competitive markets. New transmission projects have the opportunity to reduce congestion, address pending reliability concerns, facilitate the movement of renewable energy from the upper Midwest and Dakotas through the load centers in Chicago and the South and the East, mitigating oversupply and if done completely, help our Midwest nuclear fleet maintain its baseload value. There also maybe opportunities to build in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic to reduce congestion. We will look for opportunities both within and beyond our historic footprint. Investments in transmission will further enhance competitive markets and help stabilize this important aspect of Exelon’s business. By the end of the year, we will be able to discuss with you more particular plans in the transmission area. Finally, Public Policy in Washington in Harrisburg and in Springfield favors the development of so-called smart grid and smart meter infrastructures. Exelon expects that ComEd and PECO will spend up to $1 billion over the next few years, perhaps more down the road, to build its smart meter infrastructures. The amount and timing of these investments will depend both on regulatory orders and upon the success of our application for some stimulus money, but because of the strong policy support for these agendas, these also are ways of getting a secure regulatory return.  With that, I simply want to state that we haven’t been ignoring our business at home while we’ve worked on NRG. We have the pieces in place both to benefit from future improvements in gas markets, from the introduction of carbon markets and from simply building more of the right things in the right places. I believe we will stay situated to give you the kinds of results you have come to expect from us. With that, I will turn this over to Matt.
Matthew Hilzinger: Thank you, John and good morning everyone. As John mentioned, we had a very good quarter. On slide four, I have highlighted my key messages for this morning. I will briefly discuss the key drivers for the quarter and spend the majority of my time providing updates on our hedging strategy and our 2009 outlook, as well as our cost management initiatives. As you can see on slide five, we reported operating earnings of $1.03 per share in the second quarter of 2009 compared with $1.13 in the second quarter of 2008. Our results reflect higher quarter-over-quarter distribution revenues at ComEd and PECO and reductions in O&M achieved through our cost management initiative. As expected, these favorable results were offset by a decline at Exelon Generation primarily due to two one-time operating income items recognized in the second quarter of 2008. Turning to Exelon Generation on slide six, Generation’s results were lower quarter-over-quarter largely driven by $0.11 per share of income recognized in 2008 related to proprietary trading gains and the legal settlement of a uranium supply contract. Exelon Generation also experienced a decline in quarter-over-quarter operating income of $0.04 per share due to higher nuclear fuel costs and unfavorable portfolio and market conditions. Part of the unfavorability and portfolio market conditions relates to decreases in affiliate load served to ComEd and PECO, which I will discuss further in a few moments. Despite the decline in market conditions from last year, our hedging program has minimized the earnings impact to Generation for the quarter. With respect to costs, Exelon Generation held O&M close to flat in the second quarter of 2009 compared to the prior year, largely offsetting increases in pension and OPEB expenses and inflation with savings achieved through our cost management initiative. On slide seven, you will see the key drivers of ComEd’s favorable second quarter results. ComEd realized higher quarter-over-quarter distribution revenues of $0.06 per share resulting from the September 2008 distribution rate case order. With respect to costs, ComEd’s cost management initiative resulted in lower quarter-over-quarter O&M expenses of $0.02 per share. Moving to slide eight, we have outlined the key drivers of PECO’s higher quarter-over-quarter results, including increased distribution revenues of $0.03 per share and lower bad debt expense of $0.05 per share. These increases were partially offset by the scheduled increase in PECO’s CTC amortization, unfavorable weather conditions and declining weather normalized retail deliveries, each of which decreased operating earnings by $0.02 per share. Excluding the benefit from reduced bad debt expense, PECO’s O&M expenses were flat compared to the second quarter of 2008, as a result of our cost management initiatives. Last month, PECO took the first steps towards transitioning to market-based rates by successfully completing the first of its RFPs to secure generation for 2011, residential delivery. The purchases, representing about 21% of the electricity needed for PECO’s residential customers, suggest a 9% price increase for the average residential customer beginning in 2011. PECO’s next residential RFP will take place in September 2009 when it will also begin to secure commercial generation supply. Let me briefly touch on the decline in load at ComEd and PECO. Both service territories have continued to experience the effects of a challenging economy on weather-normalized retail deliveries. On slide nine, ComEd experience a decrease in weather-normalized retail deliveries across all customer classes in the second quarter of 2009 with an average decrease of 4.1%. The large C&I customer class experienced the most significant decline with reduced usage noted across all industries. Turning to slide 10, PECO also experienced a decline in load across all customer classes. PECO’s load declined an average of 2.6% during the quarter. Similar to ComEd, PECO’s large C&I customer class experienced the most significant decline. The decline in load experienced at both ComEd and PECO in the second quarter of 2009 had the effect of decreasing operating earnings by $0.03 per share. ComEd and PECO have revised their load forecast for the remainder of 2009. We now project reduced load for the full year of 3% at ComEd and 1.8% at PECO against our prior forecast of approximately 1.3% for ComEd and 1.2% for PECO. Now that I have highlighted the key operating earnings drivers for the quarter, I would like to review the two non-cash items that increased our GAAP earnings by $0.10 per share this quarter, but that we have excluded from non-GAAP operating earnings. The first issue relates to two tax positions that ComEd took in 1999 related to the disposition of certain assets as a result of the restructuring under Illinois deregulation in 1997. These items, as we have previously disclosed, are referred to as the like-kind exchange and involuntary conversion positions. A year ago, the IRS formally disallowed these positions as we expected, but over the past year, we have been in discussions with IRS appeals about a possible settlement of both issues. Unfortunately, despite our efforts, we determined during the past quarter that an acceptable settlement with the IRS appeals office is unlikely and that we must now litigate in order to resolve these tax matters. While we recognize the complexity and hazards of this litigation, we believe that we have solid facts to support our positions. As a result, we adjusted our tax reserves to reflect our views of litigation and settlement as required under FIN 48 accounting guidance. We recognized $0.05 per share of earnings in the second quarter from the reversal of prior reserves, the majority of which was recorded at ComEd. Our 10-Q, to be filed later today, provides further information on the financial implications in the event that we don’t ultimately prevail in this litigation. The second tax issue relates to a non-cash adjustment to our long term deferred tax liabilities primarily at Exelon Generation. During the second quarter, the PAPUC approved PECO’s electricity procurement plan. Under the procurement plan, Exelon Generation expects to see a higher proportion of total earnings in Pennsylvania and therefore, a lower proportion in Illinois due to the roll-off of the PPA in 2011. The consolidated adjustment of $0.05 per Exelon share this quarter reflects the expected shift in earnings on state income tax rates used to record deferred taxes. Before moving on to our 2009 outlook, I will cover more of the details around our hedging program. Our complete hedging disclosures, which we committed to update you each quarter, are included in the Appendix and you will see a summary on slide 11 that I will talk about now. Generally speaking, we file a 36-month ratable hedging program. The primary objective of which is to protect the value of our assets even under stress scenarios. We are largely hedged in 2009, which gives us a high level of confidence in gross margin we will achieve at Generation for the year. We have continued to layer on hedges for 2010 and 2011 and as a result, our potential range for earnings outcomes has narrowed as we move closer to those delivery years. As the largest merchant generator in the country, we hold a strong view that continued hedging is the financially disciplined way to protect the value of our assets. Our results show that we do it well even in markets where prices are under pressure. Compared to our disclosures in April, the 5% case in our 95% confidence interval shows a flat to increased gross margin for 2010 and 2011 as a result of our continued hedging. Let me direct your attention to 2011 in particular. You will see now that we are hedged at 59% to 62% as compared to the February volumes of 40% to 43% that we shared with you in April. While this is likely ahead of a purely ratable plan, a portion of the additional hedges we layered on since our last update represents power and natural gas put options, which enable us to mitigate downside market risk while maintaining the potential for upside market appreciation as market prices rebound. This protects us from lower commodity markets without introducing significant heat rate risk into our portfolio. The 2011 estimated hedged gross margin that can be calculated using the data we have provided is within 1% of the number you would have calculated as of the end of February. This is in part due to the fact that we have been incrementally hedging in a forward gas environment with market prices around $7 per MMBtu. Our 2011 Mid-Atlantic expected Generation hedge also reflects the supply contracts secured by Exelon Generation at attractive prices in the recent Allegheny and PECO procurement events. These results clearly show the value of are well-positioned, low-cost nuclear fleet. I will now turn to slide 12 for an update on our 2009 financial outlook. We continue to remain on track for the year and are reaffirming our non-GAAP operating earnings guidance of $4 to $4.30 per share. One item to note, as we discussed in our 8-K issued last week, relates to our first quarter Supreme Court ruling where we recognized $0.06 of earnings per share related to investment tax credits income from 2008 and prior. On July 15, the Illinois Supreme Court affirmed their ruling, but their ruling was changed to apply only prospectively, effectively disallowing the portion of ITC credits from 2008 and prior. As a result, we expect to recognize this revised decision by the court and reverse $0.06 of earnings in the upcoming third quarter. We have weathered the weak economy very well so far this year. Our hedging program has protected our earnings and our cash flows in a down market and our cost management initiatives have identified and delivered real savings to help offset higher pension and postretirement costs that we outlined at the beginning of the year. We continue to watch the economy and load reduction carefully and we are mindful that the economy is not yet sustainable in terms of its recovery. Given our view on the balance of the year and our results thus far, we expect to end the year within our guidance range and we expect the third quarter 2009 operating earnings to range from $0.90 to $1 per share, which includes the expected reversal of the Illinois ITC item I just discussed. With the first half of the year behind us, we have made measurable progress on our cost management initiative. As outlined on slide 13, we previously committed to keeping O&M expense flat in 2009 and remain on target to do so. In June, we committed to a $350 million reduction in 2010 O&M expense, nearly a 3.5% decline from 2009, which includes our expected installation. The total amount of the savings will be recognized across Exelon with Exelon Generation realizing approximately 60% of the savings, followed by 30% at ComEd and 5% at both PECO and Exelon Corp. We continue to deliver the strong cash flows that you have come to expect from us. Our latest forecasted cash flow from operations has increased $350 million from our first quarter of 2009 earnings call and $700 million from the original guidance assumptions that we shared with you last fall at EEI. We are now projecting cash from operations of over $5.4 billion this year. This increase is largely due to the benefits received under the recent economic stimulus plan, reduced O&M and our auction sales. Just to recap, this was a very good quarter for Exelon, we delivered solid results and with that, we would be happy to take your questions.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Hugh Wynne - Sanford Bernstein.
Hugh Wynne - Sanford Bernstein: I was just looking at the balance sheet and you seem to have some favorable developments here. Shareholders equity is up by about $1.1 billion or 10%. You seem to have paid off about a $0.25 billion of long term debt and your cash balance is very robust at $1.8 billion, maybe $1.5 billion more than you might need to run the company. You also mentioned you are expecting another $700 million in cash from operations relative to earlier estimates in 2009. So, my question is whether you will consider resuming the value return policy and maybe distribute this excess cash, which is equivalent to about 4% of the market capitalization of Exelon or whether your intention is to accumulate cash or pay down debt in light of a potential reduction in long term earnings power?
John Rowe: I think I find the third answer than either of the formulations you gave us, Hugh. Our plan is to use cash to invest in the system, particularly the nuclear uprate program. Simply put, with earnings that are relatively flat for a couple of years, not a very good time to increase the dividend and with Standard & Poor and the other rating agencies demands for better fund flow from operations to debt coverage to maintain our credit ratings, we need to keep the cash in the business right now. It has been very clear on the part of the rating agencies that, with Exelon’s earnings coming about three quarters from the power markets and about one quarter from the regulated utilities, with those numbers changing a little bit from year-to-year, the rating agencies think we have different risk characteristics than a normal utility and expect that we have a somewhat stronger balance sheet as a result. So, while we are very pleased with the way the cash is building up, it doesn’t really give us the opportunity to go back to the share buyback program. So, our plan is to use the cash in the business and make certain the balance sheet keeps us all happy till we have better power markets or carbon prices.
Hugh Wynne - Sanford Bernstein: If I could, are you still anticipating the 36.7% income tax rate for 2009 that you put out in the March Investor Presentation?
Matthew Hilzinger: Yes, it is about that. I might adjust it slightly because of the ITCs, but that is a good number to use.
Operator: Your next question comes from Greg Gordon - Morgan Stanley.
Greg Gordon - Morgan Stanley: As you guys start focusing on I know you are pretty highly hedged for 2010, in terms of the Generation business, but as you do your business planning for ComEd and PECO, what type of load assumptions are you assuming? What type of load are you assuming you are going to see for the balance of this year and what is your base case for 2010?
John Rowe: Matt, do you want to give the total numbers or shall we go directly
Matthew Hilzinger: I think I noted those in my opening remarks, Greg. I think ComEd is looking for kind of the full year forecast a load deterioration of around 3% and I think PECO was around 1.8% and they can speak to a little bit more about where that is coming. I don’t think we have given formal numbers for 2010, but I think PECO was somewhere around flat and I think ComEd was somewhere around there as well as we kind of looked out to 2010. So, our view of kind of the economic recovery is we would like to see the recovery kind of take hold here in the second half and we are reflecting that in, how we’re looking at 2010. We’ll continue to watch the second half of the year as we figure out what kind of load drop that we’re going to put in for our 2010 numbers.
John Rowe: There are some rate design characteristics that mitigate the impact of this load drop. I would like, since ComEd has the bigger drop. I’d like to have either Frank or Anne update you on, what is going on in ComEd first and then Denis on what’s going on at PECO.
Anne Pramaggiore: As Matt indicated, we are looking at about a 3% drop for the year and we’ve seen a bigger drop in the second quarter, but we do our model suggests that the trend starts to turn the other way a little bit in the third and fourth quarter. We do have a couple mitigating circumstances in ComEd. As John indicated, one of them is that where we’re seeing the largest drop in load in our large customer sector. We also rely primarily on demand and customer charges for our revenue there. So we don’t see the same sort of correlation in revenue that it doesn’t correlate quite as closely to the drop in load. In fact, about 98% of our C&I revenue is either demand or customer charge based. So that helps us on the revenue side. The other mitigating factor is, when we look at our largest customers, we have a pretty diverse group. The top 25 obviously, we’re manufacturing based here in Illinois, but we have a number of other industries represented in there and we don’t see any customer that represents over 1% of the load within that group or over about 2% of the revenue. So it’s pretty evenly spread and we think that that gives us some protection as we move forward as well.
John Rowe: Denis, would you like to comment on PECO?
Denis O’Brien: Yes, I think Matt got the high level numbers just about right there. As you look below our forecast for the year, which is a 1.8% decrease now, it’s primarily in the large C&I. Our estimate for the end of the year for large C&I is a negative 3.5%. That is driven primarily by the petroleum, pharmaceutical, chemical sectors. So we’re watching that closely. I think we have seen a couple of them knock off their third shifts and do some consolidation of some of their facilities. The residential has held up pretty well to this point. Although, the second quarter we saw a little bit of a drop and we’re now watching that a little more closely. The summer has been pretty cool here in Philadelphia in June and July, so it has been well down on weather.  Our weather correction doesn’t handle abnormal weather as much as it handles normal whether. So we’re not sure whether a little bit of a decrease in June and July, is all weather related or if there is a little bit of economy there. My last comment would be, this all started to unfold in terms of the decrease in the fourth quarter of last year. So once you get to the fourth quarter, you are back to this kind of new base level that you are working off of. So at that point, we don’t expect to see as much of a decrease, because we saw it last year. For next year, we’re calling it at this point even, but we are monitoring things closely.
Operator: Your next question comes from Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs.
Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs: Can you give us an update on your view of long term, three to five year out, power market fundamentals in the Midwest, especially Illinois?
John Rowe: Well, we think that we have a recovery. The power markets return to the kinds of levels that they have been several years back. Obviously, this depends on what you think gas prices will be, as well as other factors. Ken Cornew, would you like to amplify that please?
Ken Cornew: Sure, Mike. We just had a discussion on demand and obviously, that’s having an impact on power prices at NiHub. We see NiHub prices in the next three to five years hovering from the low to mid 30s around the clock. I think those prices are largely reflecting the current economic situation, the lower demand, obviously, the gas prices that you can see in the market. So I think if there is a recovery and to the extent that recovery is sooner than later, you’ll see some recovery in NiHub prices. A couple of things I am sure you are thinking about. One is new transmission infrastructure to the extent there is a new transmission infrastructure that comes in place. For example, the backbone transmission lines that PJM is working to put in place that will have upward price pressure on NiHub. I am sure wind and other fundamental new Generation is something you are thinking about. In this economic environment, we don’t see that wind is economic. We don’t see the transmission infrastructure there in the near term to support a significant amount of wind development. We think it will happen at some level. We think it will happen at an appropriate level when the transmission is there and when energy prices allow for the economics to look reasonable for new generation development. I think you’re going to also see some testing of value of old Generation. There is old coal-fired and steam generation in the PJM system and to the extent you see market price pressure that we are seeing now, owners have to really evaluate what the long term value of those assets are given load prices and given environmental pressure. So, I think you are seeing a real reflection of load demand and a poor economic situation in current NiHub prices.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Paul Fremont - Jefferies.
Paul Fremont - Jefferies: The first sort of can you remind us of the dispute with the IRS as to what the dollar amount of the dispute is and whether or not anybody so far has won their case in court on the SILO/LILO cases. The second question is I can understand sort of the negative effect of demand on market heat rates this year. I am not sure I understand why the market heat rates seem to be weaker I guess both in Pennsylvania and in Illinois in the out years. 
John Rowe: I would like Ken Cornew to answer the second question first just because we have been talking about power prices and then Tom Terry and I will take the first question.
Ken Cornew: I think you are seeing lower heat rates sort of for a couple of reasons. First off, the spot market prices are very low and that is driven by low fossil fuel prices, low natural gas prices with much lower demand as you have seen and heard ComEd and PECO talk about. You are seeing what we see as an excess in supply. So, the forward prices are going to continue to reflect that to the extent people think gas prices don’t recover more quickly, demand doesn’t recover more quickly or retirement of generation doesn’t happen quickly. So, we have long seen this phenomenon of spot prices heavily impacting three to five year prices in the power markets and I think that is a lot of what you are seeing now.
John Rowe: As you can see in our K and you’ll see updated in the Q, the total cash involved, if we were to lose all of every issue with the IRS, is on the order of $1 billion or $1.1 billion and that assumes a complete loss. Tom will give you the associated income statement effect, which is much smaller and there is a partially upsetting issue that I think we have already won at the IRS, which he will also give you. Then on your question about the courts, well, there are three or four different issues in this can. One is the like-kind exchange where there have been two bad court decisions on different facts. There is a case involving ComEd pending that has been up for decision almost anytime and it hasn’t come down yet. There are a couple of settlements, which we know about, but don’t know enough details to talk about on more favorable returns, conditions for utilities on several of the other issues. I mean the issues are like-kind exchange, involuntary conversion and the tax treatment of competitive transition charges and the IRS has somewhat different positions on each of the three issues and somewhat different willingness to talk about each of the three issues. Tom, what would you like to add to that?
Tom Terry: Regarding the income statement in fact of this, if we were to lose completely, we would take about a $300 million charge from where we are after the second quarter. Beyond that, one of the things we had to do this quarter, because we can’t settle the issue with the IRS and believe that we are going to have to litigate the issues to conclusion, or at least the like-kind exchange issue We had to make a call as to whether we believed we would win or lose and we came down on the side that we believe we had the better side of the arguments. That should not be taken to mean that it is a sure thing or even particularly close to a sure thing. It’s that the nature of accounting forces us a bit to a binary conclusion there and that is the reason you see the income tick up in the second quarter.
Paul Fremont - Jefferies : Just as a follow up, the two unfavorable court decisions, were those the court decisions involving financial institutions leasing portfolios?
Tom Terry: Yes, one of them was BB&T. The other one was AWG.
Matthew Hilzinger: I want to add one thing. I think John talked about worst-case scenario; it’s a $1.1 billion cash outflow. There is about, I think, $300 million related to a tax issue that we have settled with the IRS that we can’t claim that cash until these tax years and these issues are settled. So, you ought to think about kind of worst-case more around $800 million or $700 million and not the $1.1 billion from a true cash kind of outflow statement.
Operator: Your next question comes from Paul Patterson - Glenrock.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock: As I remember the net income impact on the first quarter 10-Q was $205 million and $196 million, $205 million after tax associated with interest and $196 million I guess associated with penalties and what have you. Could you guys sort of give us an update on that and how much of that would be sort of ongoing with this $300 million that you are mentioning and again, this is obviously a worst-case scenario, but just what that exposure would be on the net income?
Karie Anderson: We would be happy to follow up with you and Tom on that question offline and make sure we get that in the Q filed today.
John Rowe: I think just because it is big and squishy, can we tack down this question so everybody knows what he was asking about because those numbers don’t correlate in my head. So Duane, can you clarify this?
Duane DesParte: Yes, the numbers didn’t ring a bell with me either. Could you go through that one more time?
Paul Patterson - Glenrock: Sure. In the 10-Q from the first quarter, which is all I have right now, it says that it could impact by about $1 billion, the cash and if the deferral was successfully challenged by the… 
John Rowe: You are still talking about the like-kind exchange. Okay.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock: It could negatively impact Exelon ComEd’s results of operations by as much as $205 million after tax related to interest expense. That is on page 70 of the 10-Q. 
Matthew Hilzinger: Let me see if I can take a crack and then Tom can jump in, but I think what we were saying is if we lost all both issues that we would take a P&L hit now of about $300 million. The numbers I think you are referring to, Paul, are those numbers as of the first quarter, assuming some sort of settlement and a different reserve level. So, I think the numbers that we are giving you now are just an update of those numbers that we gave out at the first quarter and then I think you would had asked about kind of an ongoing impact each year and I think you’ll find that, on the like-kind exchange, we aren’t going to adjust the reserves until we are through our sense of where the litigation is. That is probably two or three years out in terms of settlement of that particular litigation effort. With respect to the involuntary conversion showed our position change in terms of our view of settlement, I think that will affect it. But I don’t think you will see any particular drag coming in terms of annualized earnings as a result of these two particular issues.
Tom Terry: Matt, the one thing I would add is, Paul, you had asked about you mentioned a $196 million number, which was the penalty the IRS has asserted. Our worst-case does not assume a payment of the penalty because we believe that we will be able to defeat that penalty assertion.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock: One thing that sort of seems a little interesting was that there was a decrease in customers in ComEd for two quarters in a row and a decrease for just one quarter I guess at PECO, but the decrease in customers, is that a population decrease or it’s a little bit unusual. I mean I’m just wondering is that what that is or is that something else that is going on?
Frank Clark:  This is Frank Clark speaking. We saw about 17,000 customers decrease and it has never happened before. Our records go back to 1953. Not exactly sure where those customers are going, it could reflect the fact that people are still losing their homes, they are moving in with parents, they are moving out of the service territory, but I don’t expect it to be a steady state, but it is the first time we have ever seen it. That the numbers are not overwhelming, but still 17,000 fewer customers is an unusual event.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock: Then just finally on the gas versus the power prices, we did notice from the first quarter presentation higher gas prices by about $0.20, but a decrease again in power prices and just sort of to follow up on Paul Fremont’s question, I mean is there anything specifically is that sort of an anomaly thing, just variation that we should expect one way or the other or is there something that anything specifically, Ken, that you think might be causing that?
Ken Cornew: Paul, in the near term, a lot of it right now is about weather. We have seen a …
Paul Patterson - Glenrock: I was referring to 2011.
Ken Cornew: For 2011. I think what you have in 2011 is a question about demand rebound, economic rebound. You don’t have a lot of buyers still in the out years. You have more in 2011 maybe than in ‘12 and ‘13, but you still have this propensity for buyers to be out in shorter timeframes. When we do see an opportunity like the PECO procurement or Allegany procurement, we seem to see reasonable prices that reflect what we think is fair market value for the products that we are delivering. When you look at some of the trading elements and you see less liquidity in the out years, you will also see a tendency for these heat rates to kind of drop off. Now there are a lot of moving parts. We don’t think the heat rates have actually looked that bad in the East. We are seeing some increase in basis for Eastern load zones in the Midwest. I think you are just absolutely seeing an impact from low demand, lower weather. We know there has been some transmission elements and constraints that have gone on. So, it is a lot of moving parts, Paul, but we would expect that, as we rebound, you will see a rebound in some of these prices.
Karie Anderson: Operator, we will take one more question.
Operator: Your last question comes from Annie Tsao - AllianceBernstein.
Annie Tsao - AllianceBernstein : Can you give us a little bit more detail in terms of your uranium contract? Should we think about $0.04 negative going for the next two quarters and how should we think about that for next year as well?
John Rowe: For which contracts?
Annie Tsao - AllianceBernstein : The uranium contract.
John Rowe: Who wants to pick up on uranium? Matt, Chris?
Matthew Hilzinger: I think it is in the release there, Karie. I don’t have the number in front of me, but we have got we are adjusting our contracts to our market to more of a market base they are rolling out. So, I think they continue is it $0.04, Karie?
Karie Anderson: Yes, it was $0.03 in the quarter, Annie and we continue to project those uranium costs to increase on year-over-year. The last time we disclosed that increase, which is on page 29 of our investor conference materials, Annie, we were forecasting about a little over $100 million increase from ‘09 to ‘10 and we go on from there and we can walk through those numbers.
Matthew Hilzinger : I suspect that’s probably a reasonable run rate to use for going out from there.
John Rowe: Okay. Just to wrap up, lots of things going on around us are not very pretty, but I think we have proven in this quarter that we have the ability to manage the expenses in ways that keep giving you good earnings during these economic conditions and in this case, we even did it against weather too. I think we’ll be able to deliver solid year for you and as you know, we are hard at work on the cost cuts necessary to make next year another good year. By 2011, we expect some recoveries in the power and gas market. We have the benefit of the change in Pennsylvania pricing. I think we will live on cost cuts this year and next year and be back in a place where we can find some more growth for you by ‘11 and that is what we have set out to do and we will keep delivering. So, thanks a lot for your attention and with that, I think we have finished the call Karie.
Karie Anderson: Yes, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2009 Q1  (2009-04-23 23:00:00) =====

Operator: At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Exelon First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions). Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Karie Anderson, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.
Karie Anderson: Welcome to Exelon's first quarter 2009 earnings review and conference call update. Thank you for joining us today. We issued our earnings release this morning. If you haven't received it, the release is available on the Exelon website, at www.exeloncorp.com, or you can call [Deloris Mungia] at 312-394-5222, and she will fax or email the release to you. Before we begin today's discussion, let me remind you that the earnings release and other matters that we discuss in today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risk and uncertainty as well as adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings. Please refer to today's 8-K and our other SEC filings for discussions of factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts, and expectations and for a reconciliation of operating earnings to GAAP earnings. In addition during the call, we will be discussing Exelon's exchange offer to acquire NRG and Exelon's intention to solicit proxies for meetings of NRG and Exelon shareholders. Today's discussion does not constitute an offer to exchange or a solicitation of an offer to exchange NRG shares and it is not a substitute for the exchange offer documents or the proxy statements that we have filed with the SEC. For important additional information regarding the offer in the proxy statement, please refer to the earnings release AND today's 8-K. Leading the call today are John Rowe, Exelon's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Matthew Hilzinger, Exelon's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by other members of Exelon's senior management team who will be available to answer your questions. We have scheduled 60 minutes for this call. I will now turn the call over to John Rowe, Exelon's CEO.
John Rowe: This morning I'll offer my perspective on our first quarter results, briefly comment on our hedging disclosure program, and also on the proposed NRG acquisition. I will close with revisiting Exelon's long-term value proposition. I know you've all heard it before, but it would be easy to forget in these turbulent times. Many of you have heard me describe Exelon's sustainable advantage using the diagram included on slide three of today's presentation. Every day we look at these four areas, finance, operations, energy markets and regulatory structures, and we constantly focus on keeping these four together because that is where performance lies. Today's call is largely focused on finance and I will address all four pieces because that's where our competitive advantage is. As you saw in this morning's release, we reported operating earnings of $1.20 per share, which is at the high end of the guidance range we provided you earlier. This includes $0.06 per share associated with a tax ruling that I mentioned on March 10. It happened to come all in the first quarter, but we think of it as helping us offset higher pension and OPEB expenses throughout the first year. In other words, don't include that $0.06 when you are multiplying by 4. Our first quarter results also reflect three fewer nuclear refueling outages quarter-over-quarter, 13 fewer nuclear non-refueling outage days, best-ever availability of our fossil fleet and an effective hedging program. Our first quarter earnings are a significant accomplishment in this environment. I am very proud of both the management team and our larger group of employees for performing so well in such a distracting and troublesome time. With these earnings, we are on track for the year, which allows me to reaffirm our 2009 operating earnings guidance range of $4.00 to $4.30 a share. Matt Hilzinger will walk you through the specific drivers shortly. Turning to operations, we had a very solid performance in the quarter. Chip Pardee's nuclear team achieved a capacity factor of 96.2% in the quarter. This is really remarkable and I commend all of them for doing it. They completed a refueling outage at LaSalle in 22 days, which is considerably lower than the industry average of nearly 40 days. Doyle Beneby and his team at Exelon Power achieved a commercial availability of 96%, which is the best quarterly performance since we started tracking that indicator in 2005. ComEd, under the direction of Frank Clark and Barry Mitchell, announced a significant reduction in spending programs to align with the diminishing sales. All this was done while ComEd reported its best-ever first quarter of customer outage duration statistics. PECO, under Denis O'Brien and Craig Adams, reported its best performance on record for the frequency of customer service interruptions for the 12 months ended March 31, beating their previous record in 2000. Turning to energy markets, the hedging program at Power Team has again proven effective as natural gas and power prices continued to decline for the majority of the quarter. Exelon, however, thanks to these early hedges, realized margins that were slightly higher quarter-over-quarter. There are some bright spots in the market. Amidst the declining spot energy prices, recent procurement auctions, such as the BGS auction in New Jersey and the PPL auction in Pennsylvania, have reflected attractive prices of $104 per megawatt hour and $87 per megawatt hour respectively. On the regulatory front, there have been several positive developments both at the state and federal levels. On April 16, the Pennsylvania Commission approved the settlement of PECO's procurement plans. The settlement provides for an additional residential procurement starting in June 2009 to serve load beginning in 2011. This approved procurement plan coupled with lower energy prices and PECO's earlier phase-in plan, a plan that was approved by the Pennsylvania Commission earlier in March, will support the transition to competitive markets in Pennsylvania and our ability to obtain market based prices for electricity. At the federal level, the NRC decision to renew the operating license of our Oyster Creek plant was very positive. It paves the way for that plant to continue to provide electricity supply, good jobs and value for our shareholders for many more years. Also, in the first quarter, President Obama appointed Commissioner Wellinghoff as Chairman of FERC. This appointment represents a vote of confidence in competitive markets. Chairman Wellinghoff has been outspoken in his support for competitive markets, declaring in 2007 "competitive markets are the only way to provide consumers with just and reasonable prices and the lowest total bill." Just yesterday we announced plans to build a 10-megawatt solar generating facility in the City of Chicago. When constructed this photovoltaic plant will be the largest solar plant in an urban area in the United States. The program is contingent upon federal loan guarantees. We are excited about this project and optimistic about receiving the guarantees. The project would support our Exelon 2020 goal of bringing more low carbon power to the market. It would also revitalize an unused brownfield area in urban Chicago. We hope that this facility will become an outstanding example of stimulus dollars at work, both to create jobs and to create renewable energy. Let me briefly comment on the information regarding our hedging program that Ian McLean and Ken Cornew discussed on a call last week. We are committed to providing you with both timely and transparent insight into our business. We believe that the disclosure process that Ian and Ken described meets the concern you expressed at our earlier and larger meeting. I've directed them to update you on a quarterly basis going forward within this formatted process. We will do this, both when things are looking happy and when we face challenges. At the same time, I want to give you a caution about running the models too automatically. Given the volatility in the marketplace and the other factors that will impact our earnings and cash flows, we must billion wary of simple extrapolation. The model simply cannot reflect everything that management can do, both on the cost side and the revenue side. That is why we have traditionally given you earnings guidance one year at a time after we've been through a rigorous planning process. This morning, I reaffirmed our earnings guidance for 2009. After we've made our 2010 plan as good as it can be through continued work on our cost structure, completion of our hedging work and other measures, we will release 2010 earnings guidance likely in the fall of this year. Simply put, after we put Exelon together, merging ComEd and PECO, we managed to make money for you for a number of years largely through cost cutting in soft markets. Over the last three years, we mostly had the benefit of rising markets. Now, in falling markets we have to go back and do it on the cost side again, and we will do our very best to do that. We have heard your feedback on what kind of information will help you understand our wholesale business and we hope you agree that what we laid out a few days ago is a good solution. As I said, you can expect to receive an update on it. Now I will turn to our proposed acquisition of NRG. I continue to believe this is a good transaction at a good time for both Exelon and NRG's shareholders. As you've all heard, the combining companies will have a stronger footprint in the most competitive markets and a lower cost profile which will benefit both sets of shareholders. It is also very well positioned when power market fundamentals improve and gas prices recover, and particularly well positioned when carbon legislation becomes effective. We have filed all notices and applications with the US federal and state regulatory authorities, those whose reviewer approval is required. We hope to complete the regulatory approval process sometime during the second half of 2009. We have received support from 51% of NRG shareholders at our last tender offer expiration and are now pursuing shareholder action at NRG's Annual Meeting, which is yet to be scheduled. We have proposed an expansion of the NRG Board from 13 to 19 directors and have nominated nine well qualified independent candidates who will act in the best interest of NRG shareholders. We are seeking NRG shareholder support and will be soliciting proxies for these proposals. We have continued and we will continue to evaluate the NRG transaction with the same levelheaded, cold blooded financial discipline you would expect us to do. I have lived on value for the last 25 years, and these are certainly not the times to change that attitude. If at any future time we determine the transaction no longer creates sustainable value for Exelon shareholders, we will turn our attention to other opportunities, because at this time of turbulence, there are always long-term value opportunities. Let me close by reiterating our sustainable value position. We have built a company based on low emission, low carbon generation. That is of course partly because we inherited it. It is also very much because we appreciated the environmental advantages of these types of generation. Our generating fleet is the lowest emitting fleet in the country when measured by carbon density; that is the metric tons of carbon dioxide produced each year per megawatt hour of generation. We run our plants with an industry leading management model, one we try to improve upon each year. Since 2006, we have been first in the nuclear industry on our two-year capacity factor. We also have a wonderful record on safety reviews. Our management model is designed to maintain that operating performance in the years to come. Not only Chris Crane, our Chief Operating Officer, and Chip Pardee at Nuclear and Doyle Beneby, but the whole team in our nuclear operation has incredible data. We have positioned ourselves to compete in the most attractive competitive market, PJM. PJM fosters both a competitive energy market and also a separate capacity market through RPM, which is designed to assure reliability of the system in years to come. RPM incents to build a new generation in addition to keeping generation online that otherwise might have been retired. The ruling by FERC in late March to more accurately reflect the cost of new entries will send better price signals for 2012/2013 to enhance capacity utilization and continued reliability. We have developed risk management tools to ensure we can meet our near-term commitments when faced with lower commodity prices. They also ensure that we have sufficient liquidity to execute our hedging program. The effectiveness of our hedging program allowed us to deliver to you our first quarter operating earnings of $1.20 per share, the strongest first quarter in Exelon's history despite the declining spot natural gas prices for the majority of the quarter. We have a history of successfully driving costs out of our business. We already have the lowest total generating cost of any nuclear fleet in the country. Our average production cost is 10% lower than the industry average. We focus on sustaining that advantage. Chris and the rest of my management team are committed to keeping our 2009 O&M spending at 2008 levels and we are looking forward in 2010 to finding even more ways to exercise financial discipline. Our sustainable advantage remains. We have achieved success in the elements of the business we can control. We have positioned ourselves to participate in the upside when commodity prices improve again, and we have positioned ourselves to gain from environmental legislation that continues to gain momentum. To put that into simple numbers, a $1 increase in natural gas prices has the effect of increasing Exelon Generation's 2011 margins by more than $400 million. The impact of $10 a ton of carbon dioxide pricing is even more substantial as every $10 raises the ATC cost of power by roughly $7 to $7.50 per megawatt hour. As these things take place, and sooner or later they will, we have the potential to create significant new roads for Exelon shareholders. These are, as you know, very challenging times, but we have given you a good, solid quarter. We are on track to give you a good, solid year. We will work very hard on next year and our position in the marketplace gives you opportunities in the longer run. I will turn this call now over to Matt to take you through the quarterly financials.
Matt Hilzinger: As highlighted, my key messages this morning are on slide four, so I would like to start there. We provided a significant amount of detail regarding our results in our earnings release and the accompanying tables. Therefore, I'll spend my time this morning discussing our results for the quarter and updating our 2009 outlook. Beginning with our current quarter results on slide five, we recorded operating earnings of $1.20 per share in the first quarter of 2009 as compared to $0.93 per share in the first quarter of 2008. Our first quarter results were largely driven by higher earnings at Exelon Generation and ComEd and a slight increase in earnings at PECO. I will start by mentioning one item that affects quarter-over-quarter results at both Exelon Generation and ComEd. In February, the Illinois Supreme Court ruled that for purposes of the Illinois Replacement Tax, both ComEd and Exelon Generation were eligible for an investment tax credit related to investments in Illinois property. As a result of this ruling, Exelon recognized the benefit of $0.06 per share in the first quarter of 2009. The majority of this benefit of $0.05 was recognized at ComEd and the remaining benefit at Exelon Generation. Even without this tax item, our quarterly results are very solid, driven by our strong nuclear performance and higher distribution revenues at ComEd. Turning to slide six, you will see the key drivers for Exelon Generation's quarter-over-quarter increase in operating earnings. First, our nuclear group continued their exceptional operational performance this quarter with higher nuclear volumes driven by less refueling outage days, benefiting quarter-over-quarter results by $0.07 per share. Additionally, excluding its owned output from the Salem Generating Station, Exelon Nuclear achieved a capacity factor of 96.2% in the first quarter of 2009, which is much higher than the 89% achieved in the first quarter of 2008. Second, portfolio and market conditions were $0.04 per share favorable in the first quarter of 2009 compared to the first quarter of 2008. These favorable results were partially offset by higher nuclear fuel costs of a penny per share. Average margins realized by Exelon Generation were $39.25 per megawatt hour in the first quarter of 2009 as compared to $38.70 in the first quarter of 2008. These results clearly illustrate the effectiveness of Power Team's hedging program as around the clock market prices were roughly 28% lower at PJM Western Hub and 36% lower at NI-Hub in the first quarter of 2009 as compared to the first quarter of 2008. Third, O&M expense at Exelon Generation was favorable due to the decrease in refueling outage days, which reduced quarter-over-quarter O&M expense by $0.06 per share. This decrease was partially offset by expected increases in inflation and pension and OPEB expense of $0.03 per share that we talked about on our fourth quarter 2008 earnings call. Last, we regularly review our generating assets for potential impairments as required by current accounting standards. This quarter we determined that the fair values of the Mountain Creek and Handley plants in Dallas and Fort Worth, Texas were less than their carrying values and we recorded an impairment charge of $0.20 per share to reflect the decline in the estimated fair value of the plants. The impairment was based on management's valuation of the plants and was driven by lower gas and power prices in the ERCOT region. The recognition of this impairment is a non-cash charge and we have excluded it from operating earnings. Turning to slide seven, you will see that the key drivers of ComEd's higher quarter-over-quarter results with the most significant drivers being higher electric distribution revenues of $0.06 per share reflective of the September 2008 distribution order and the benefit resulting from the Illinois tax ruling of $0.05 per share. As anticipated, O&M was slightly unfavorable compared to the first quarter of 2008 as a result of the higher pension and OPEB expense. However, the increase was almost entirely offset by O&M savings achieved through various cost efficiency programs, such as the results of paying from ComEd's sustainable solutions team and their engineering and operational excellence initiatives that were instituted as a part of our overall cost and capital management initiative. Turning to PECO on slide eight, you will see the key drivers of PECO quarter-over-quarter increase in operating earnings, including increased gas revenues of $0.03 per share and unfavorable weather conditions in 2008 of $0.02 per share, partially offset by the scheduled increase in PECO's CTC amortization of $0.02 per share. PECO also experienced an increase of $0.01 per share in O&M expense, resulting from increased pension and OPEB and bad debt expense. Turning to load on slide nine, ComEd experienced a decrease in weather-normalized retail deliveries across all customer classes in the first quarter of 2009 with an average decrease of 3.6% or 2.5% if adjusted for the 2008 leap year impact. The decline was unfavorable to our first quarter 2009 forecast of a negative 2.9% with the large C&I customer class experiencing the most significant decline. Turning to slide 10, PECO also experienced a decrease in weather-normalized retail deliveries across all customer classes. We had forecasted a decline in quarter-over-quarter load of 1.7% in the first quarter of 2009. PECO's actual load was slightly lower than we had forecasted with an average decrease of 2.2% or 1.1% if adjusted for the 2008 leap year impact. The large C&I customer class experienced the most significant decline, whereas load in the small C&I and residential customer classes were flat to slightly positive quarter-over-quarter when adjusted for leap year impact and weather. While first quarter 2009 load at both ComEd and PECO was lower than we had forecasted, primarily in March we are going to continue to monitor loads through the second quarter before revising our load forecast for the remainder of 2009. We have reflected the impact of the first quarter actual load in the 2009 load estimates of negative 1.3% at ComEd and negative 1.2% at PECO as shown on today's slides as compared to our beginning of the year forecast of negative 1.1% at both ComEd and PECO. The decline in load experienced at both ComEd and PECO in the first quarter of 2009 had the effect of decreasing operating earnings by $0.01 per share at each of the utilities. To provide some sensitivity around the load deterioration on our earnings, a decline in annualized load of 50 basis points on average across all customer classes of ComEd and at PECO would decrease each of ComEd and PECO's operating earnings by $0.01 per Exelon share. We will continue to monitor deliveries of both ComEd and PECO service territories and update you on our second quarter earnings call as to where we see those. On slide 11, we have provided information around accounts receivable at the utilities. Through the first quarter of 2009, we've seen some small deterioration in aging of accounts receivable at ComEd and a slight improvement in the aging at PECO as compared to the first quarter of 2008. At ComEd, the first quarter of 2009 accounts receivable greater than 60 days has increased approximately $25 million as compared to the first quarter of 2008 with just under half of this increase driven by increases in rates over the last year. With respect to PECO, in the first quarter of 2009 PECO experienced a slight improvement, about $12 million decrease in accounts receivable greater than 60 days when compared to the first quarter of 2008. We believe that the improvement in the aging of PECO's accounts receivable is driven by the enhanced credit and collection procedures implemented at PECO in 2008. On an annual basis, we are currently forecasting ComEd's 2009 bad debt expense to approximate 2008 levels of around $70 million and are estimating PECO's bad debt expense to approximate $95 million, which is roughly $65 million lower than it was in 2008. These forecasts have not changed from the forecasts that we gave you at the beginning of the year. As you would anticipate, our expectations are subject to changing economic conditions. Therefore, we are closely monitoring the aging of the receivables, the effectiveness of our collection efforts and the overall risks associated with our customer's ability to pay. We will continue to keep a keen watch on accounts receivable balances and the related expense at both utilities. Now, I will turn to slide 12 for an update on our 2009 financial outlook. We are very pleased with our strong first quarter results, including the discrete tax benefit we realized this quarter and our continuing commitment to our cost and capital management initiative, and we are reaffirming Exelon's 2009 non-GAAP operating earnings guidance range of $4.00 to $4.30 per share. We expect the second quarter of 2009 operating earnings to range from $0.95 to $1.05 per share compared to the second quarter of 2008 operating earnings of $1.13 per share. As you may recall, during the second quarter of 2008, we recognized $0.11 per share of income associated with the uranium settlement and option gains at Exelon generation. We remain committed to keeping O&M expense flat from 2008 to 2009 at roughly $4.5 billion. In order to do that, we are committed to achieving $150 million of sustainable cost savings across the business, which reflects the incremental $50 million of 2009 cost savings that ComEd committed to in February. Through the first quarter of 2009, we have realized or specifically identified 80% or $120 million of our $150 million 2009 commitment. Our O&M savings are expected to be back-loaded into 2009 with the majority of forecasted savings expected to come in the second half of the year. In addition to sustainable cost savings, we are looking at other discrete opportunities across the business to offset higher pension and OPEB expense this year. The tax benefit that I discussed earlier is an example of the type of opportunities that we are pursuing. Please remember that higher pension and OPEB expense will be recognized throughout the year while this tax benefit was recognized in the first quarter of 2009. From a pension funding perspective, the US Treasury Department issued guidance in the first quarter that provides some flexibility for the discount rate used to determine required cash funding of pension plans. This guidance specifically referenced 2009, but also indicated that guidance will be forthcoming to address future years. The relief had the impact of reducing our 2009 minimum pension funding requirements by nearly $90 million on a pre-tax basis, which is reflected in the slides included in today's appendix. Please note that the new treasury guidelines only impact cash contributions and not costs for 2009. Under GAAP, our 2009 expenses were locked in at the beginning of the year. Turning to slide 13, I continue to view Exelon as well positioned from a liquidity perspective in these recessionary times. We are expecting to generate around $5.1 billion of cash flows from operations this year. This is roughly $350 million higher than our regional planning assumptions primarily due to the accelerated tax depreciation benefits that we are pursuing under the new federal stimulus plan, the additional reduction in O&M spending at ComEd, and lower expected contributions to our pension plans. From a capital markets perspective, PECO issued $250 million five-year first mortgage bonds at a coupon rate of 5% during the course of the first quarter, and Exelon has debt maturities of only $29 million in 2009. Last, we continue to have access to sufficient liquidity with approximately $6.9 billion in available credits for our credit facilities as of April 17 of this year. Longer term, we continue to focus on creating economic value for our shareholders, such as the tolling agreement we announced earlier this week related to our Green County PPA in Oklahoma. While the agreement won't have a cash or earnings impact until 2012, it should result in a more favorable credit metric today from S&P's perspective by reducing the amount of imputed debt associated with the purchase power agreements that S&P applies to our credit metrics. To recap, our strong first quarter results provide us with a very good foundation for what we see to be a continuing challenging year. Through our top-tier operations, prudent cash flow management, effective hedging program and our partners to-date on realizing and identifying sustainable cost savings and other opportunities across the business, we remain on track to meet our financial target for 2009.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Citi.
Greg Gordon - Citi: I had two questions. The first is you inferred that you have the baseline assumptions in your guidance relative to load, which you did put in your presentation and you gave us sensitivities that would result from changes off that baseline. What do you think the bias is right now as we go into second and third quarter, because when we look at the data here we saw that, in particular, March was a particularly big drop-off in demand in almost every region of the country on an economic basis? I'm wondering as we look at what's happened so far in April whether we are seeing a continuing deceleration of demand or whether things have stabilized?
Matt Hilzinger: We see exactly what you see and we would call the bias exactly the way you call it. I think our view of the downside at ComEd and PECO is something like a penny a share each. As you know, the ricochet effect on Genco is larger at ComEd than it is at PECO because the Genco-PECO contract is still below market. So you get a bit of recovery in Genco and PECO that you don't get on ComEd.
Greg Gordon - Citi: That's because you get to resell the power in the market at a rate that's actually pretty good relative to your obligation at the retail level, right? 
Matt Hilzinger: Yes. Given where power prices are right now, that's fairly de minimis in terms of the impact. It does work that way, Greg.
Greg Gordon - Citi: My second question is with regard to the procurement auctions that are coming up, and it sort of goes to the market dynamics right now. We're hearing that all the commodity markets, not just power, are trading extremely thin. Do you see these procurement auctions as sort of pretty critical liquidity events for the company? Do you think the bias will be to prices sort of rising to a more economically rational level as these liquidity events happen, or do you think they might actually put downward pressure on the market as excess generation goes to try to find load?
John Rowe: I'm going to give you a short answer, and then defer to Ken and Ian to give you a better answer. My view is we are pleased at how well the auctions have sustained themselves so far. Our bias, like your question implies, is that the next ones are likely to be a bit lower, and we're glad we're hedged as much as we are for the rest of this year and through 2010. Ian, do you want to pick that up or Ken?
Ian McLean: I think you said it just about right. I would expect that they are good liquidity events for us. I think that they are competitively priced. I do believe that there is a slight sort of risk premium people are adding to their prices now because of the difficulties in obtaining funding. So, overall, I think they fairly reflect the marketplace and we do look at them as a good liquidity opportunity for us and we look forward to participating in them.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Hugh Wynne with Sanford Bernstein.
Hugh Wynne - Sanford Bernstein: I had a question regarding the impact of wind on the value of base load generation assets in Texas, such as the NRG assets that you plan to acquire, and also the impact on base load generation assets in the Midwest, like Exelon's Illinois fleet. I understand that wind capacity in Texas has gotten up in excess of 7 gigawatts, which is almost equivalent to a third of the night time demand, and that the power prices in West Texas as a result have been driven down to zero and in some cases even below zero during the night time hours. I guess, the first part of my question goes to what will be the impact of that wind power once it's connected to load centers in the East through the ERCOT transmission expansion on the off-peak earnings power of the NRG fleet. I guess, parallel to that, we've seen a tremendous increase in 2008 in wind capacity in Iowa. My question was what impact have you seen or do you expect to see on all fleet power prices in Illinois?
John Rowe: In both cases we see the impact of wind as negative for off-peak power prices. Question is always whether we have modeled enough. I think our base case on the NRG acquisition, I think we are looking at 12,000 megawatts. The more transmission that gets built to move the wind, it has kind of a perverse effect because the wind tends to cost the customer more, but at the same time it hurts our power prices. Ian or Chris or Ken, would one of you pick up on this and expand please? Ken?
Ken Cornew: Hugh, John is absolutely correct. It's a good question and John hit it right on the head. We are modeling increases in wind generation in the Midwest and in Texas. John was right. We are modeling 12,000 and other sensitivities to wind and looking at transmission investment that would get it into the marketplace. Obviously, the wind is one component, the other components being what demand growth does when we come out of this economy and what other generation supply response you see, either retirement or new constructing. Clearly, as you know, it's not as simple as just wind and transmission. Its wind transmission, demand and other generation assets that make the system work. We are very confident that we've modeled those scenarios in both markets.
Hugh Wynne - Sanford Bernstein: Can you comment on the Midwest? Have you seen an impact on power prices in the Midwest?
Ken Cornew: Yes. We have seen some lower spot prices in the Midwest, Hugh. Some of that you could attribute to some new wind coming from the West into Western PJM. There have been some congestion issues that are more short term in nature given transmission and unit outages that have also impacted demand, short term demand as an impact and short-term prices, spot prices for the commodities that drive electricity price are all impacting. I think the transmission grid can handle a good amount of wind and allow it to move East. I think if we saw a very large amount of wind, we probably need to expand the transmission grid to appropriately move that energy East from where it is now in the Midwest.
John Rowe: Hugh, Bob Dylan was an aspiring singer and not much of a utility executive, but he wasn't far off when he said the answer is "Blowing in the Wind." Our Exelon 2020 work says that the cost of adding all of this wind to society is between $50 and $80 per ton of avoided carbon dioxide. This is not as cheap a way for our customers to deal with the CO2 problem as everybody wants to believe it is. Nonetheless, it is very clear that the politics are with building wind. We're going to keep seeing more of it and we're trying very hard to stay on top of its effects. We're certainly trying to model it in the NRG acquisition. I might say as a snide aside, it seems to concern us more than it concerns NRG, but that's not a helpful comment.
Hugh Wynne - Sanford Bernstein: Matt, could you comment quickly on how close we are to impairment levels on the ComEd goodwill given the further decline and utility valuations in the first quarter?
Matt Hilzinger: We do take a look at it on a regular basis. In fact, we took a look at it this particular quarter. We obviously didn't have an impairment or we would have reported it, but you are right that the values of T&D companies have come down from where they are before. I think when we look at the profitability of ComEd in terms of the revenue increase and the cost reductions that they are going through, it does provide a healthy level of cash flows that supports that goodwill. We'll continue to take a look at it. We do have kind of a formal time that we have to take a look at it in the fourth quarter. We have taken a look at it in the past and we'll take a look at it again in the fourth quarter.
John Rowe: Matt, just to expand on that, and you are the one to do this rather than me, but as I remembered there were positives as well as negatives. Will you expand a little bit, were there more positives or more negatives this time?
Matt Hilzinger: I would say that the level of value that we evaluate the goodwill on has come down year-over-year. I do think when we get down to do the specific analysis, it's really the cost cutting initiatives that provided a big positive to why we didn't impair it. So, I think when we do the analysis that was a big consideration in terms of how we do the valuation.
John Rowe: Brother Clark and his team have new religion. It's fun watching Frank become a cost cutter, amazing what a good man can do when he has to.
Hugh Wynne - Sanford Bernstein: That's very good to hear.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Merrill Lynch.
Jonathan Arnold - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: I had a detail question on the costs within ComEd in the quarter. You showed us higher pay on slide seven, higher pension and OPEB expense offset by cost saving initiatives. It was negative a penny overall. Can you break that apart a little for us, give us a sense of how much cost savings was achieved? I think you also said we'd start to see cost savings accelerate like into the back part of the year. So is it possible those numbers start swinging positive later in the year?
Frank Clark: The short answer is yes. That number should get positive as we move to the backend of the year. Bob, can you give them a more detailed breakdown?
Bob McDonald: Compared to the first quarter of last year, excluding the impacts, the increase in tension and OPEB costs, we were about $3 million better after-tax in O&M compared to the first quarter of last year. You are absolutely right. We are transitioning into our various cost cutting initiatives, expected to see some of the benefit of those initiatives in March and did see that in March. We expect to see more of that as we proceed through April and through the remainder of the year. We have cost cutting initiatives that should get us to over $70 million in the reduction on O&M compared to where we were last year at this point. While we are still executing all those initiatives, we think we're on track.
Jonathan Arnold - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: If I may just ask a broader question on this, John, I think in the intro you talked about having been in a cost cutting mode for several years when the market was last weak, and then having had a following wind, I think you were suggesting more of a cost cutting focus going forward and we've seen a lot at ComEd so far. Are you looking and how broadly are you looking across the rest of the company and what are the possibilities of similar scale to activities in other businesses?
John Rowe: Chris has developed programs in Genco that in Nuclear go as far as I think we dare go, and he is now in conjunction with Ruth Ann and Ian taking a very hard look at the holding company and its costs. Chris, would you like to expand on that?
Chris Crane: Yes. We're not at the point of giving a number, but we've got a roadmap laid out to look at our governance and oversight structure versus what the future on the commodity market is. We would expect in the third quarter to be able to roll out our plan. We would desire to do most of our structural adjustments in the third quarter that would start to reflect in fourth quarter accelerated savings, and they will be sustainable into next year.
Jonathan Arnold - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Should we be seeing this as what you originally talked about in the year as an offset, the weakness elsewhere in the business, or is this a business in itself?
John Rowe: No. You should see it just the way you said it. What we're looking at is that portion of 10 which wasn't covered by prior hedges is likely to be in a softer commodity market, and we're going to do our very best to offset that with further cost reductions.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.
Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs: Let's just kind of assume current pension rules, can you talk a little bit about your A), cash investment and pension; and B), your outlook for your balance sheet and uses of your balance sheet over the next couple of years?
Matt Hilzinger: I think I would start with kind of the overall way that we're looking at the balance sheet. When we look at kind of our credit metrics, so you start with FFO to debt, we're projecting at yearend to be at about 34%. That is clearly within the range of what S&P considers to be strong investment grade. When we look at all of the scenarios out there and we've provided a number at EEI, and then I think we updated it again at the March 10 conference, we take a look at the stress scenarios there. We've talked to S&P in detail about this that we're still well within strong credit metrics. So the first thing is I just want to make sure that people understand that we're watching it, we're looking at it, we're going to fund it because we need to fund it, but we don't see a detrimental impact either in the short term or the long term in terms of our ability to stay investment grade. With that being said, we continue to watch the market. We are about 60% funded right now on the big pension plan. The first quarter we saw the assets come down substantially, probably around 10% to 11%. They recovered a little bit in April. We're going to continue to watch it as it goes through the rest of the year like everybody else is, and we're committed to make the contributions that we need to make. Right now what we've tried to do is give you and the shareholders and the bondholders a way to go through, at least, get a sense of the magnitude of what we need to contribute over the next few years. I think the treasury rules that I referred to in my opening remarks are a positive thing. They're going to reduce our current funding this year by 90. Everything we can tell there's going to be forthcoming regulations that should provide some additional relief as we get to '10. Even without that relief again, our balance sheet is in good shape. We'll just watch and continue to make the funding that we need to make. Does that answer your question, Mike?
John Rowe: Let me just expand a little, Michael. Matt, correct me if I'm misremembering this number, I think as of March 31 the unfunded requirement was about $4.3 billion. That is what I have on my notes. The question obviously is, one, how fast do we have to refund it? The federal government is going to have to be rethinking that issue for a whole lot of folks and that may give us some additional options. The second question is, how fast do we want to refund it, because on the one hand if you have confidence in market recovery you might like to have a little more money in there earlier, on the other hand we have lots of other uses for the cash too. I asked somebody for a sensitivity, 1000-point improvement in the Dow, whenever you think that might happen, would reduce that total funding requirement by $0.5 billion. So we, like a whole lot of other people, are going to be looking at both what we need to do and what we choose to do. Right now, our basic position is to fund it as we have to, but if we change that course of action because we think it might be beneficial to do more sooner, we'll let you know.
Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs: That helps a ton. What I was trying to think about was excluding the NRG acquisition, whether what's happening with pension and what's happened with forward power prices would have an impact on your ability. It obviously has to, but does it put you in a situation where you are not contemplating share buybacks in the longer term given your existing asset base and pension requirements, or is that really so tied up in terms of what Uncle Sam does that it's hard to make that call?
John Rowe: First, it is tied up in what Uncle Sam does. Second, it's tied up on what S&P thinks. They've been fairly stern with us that they let us do more than we think we should. Given the NRG acquisition and their view that we have to either sell a bunch of stuff or raise some equity to make the NRG acquisition work, pretty clear that our view of shareholder value add right now does not include additional buybacks in the foreseeable future.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kit Konolige with Soleil.
Kit Konolige - Soleil: Two unrelated questions. I think, John, you were talking about the good outcomes from a shareholder's viewpoint of the auctions at public service and PPL. What did you think of the Allegheny auction?
Ken Cornew: I think its par for the course. The difference in pricing is largely driven by things like the product definitions that each of these companies is looking to procure. Also, there is a big implication on basis or congestion in the prices. Again, as Ian and John iterated, we like when buyers are in the market as well as sellers. The opportunities seem to be fairly priced and much of the pressure on price is because of base load energy and other components of the load following products. Prices are either holding up pretty well or actually going up. So, we haven't seen anything inconsistent from that in these auctions recently in Pennsylvania.
Kit Konolige - Soleil: Actually this is a tad different from what I might have implied, but that's okay. You guys can handle anything anyway. When I look at NYMEX forwards for power and gas and so on, gas can be a fairly robust market. Power, I think, in a lot of the hubs, people have a lot of questions. I think it was mentioned somewhere either by you guys or one of the questioners that these are pretty thin markets. That said, if you were to believe them, by '11 and '12 gas and power are going to be a lot higher than they are now without anybody actually knowing. Obviously, those things could change. We have a pretty steep curve going on there. Given that there is CO2 coming around the bend and so on, are those forward prices somewhat believable even though nobody really trades at them?
John Rowe: The short answer is so clear. Yes, the market projections and forwards are somewhat believable. I can meet that standard with grave confidence. We try to spend a lot of time looking at gas prices. We are doing a major presentation with our Board on it shortly. It's obviously very important to our hopes that gas prices get back in the $6 to $7 range. Ken, do you want to just expand on what you think is the most credible outlook on gas?
Ken Cornew: Yes, John, I think the forwards are believable, as you said. When you look at the cost of new gas, there are a lot of moving parts to it, but it could be somewhere in that $6 to $8 range for gas overtime. A lot of pricing in the '11, '12, '13 time period is obviously dependent on that gas price, and it's also dependent on what happens with the economy and some of the other fundamentals on the demand side in particular as well as supply. The way we look at the market right now, we think that prices are believable. Some of the power products are traded relatively thinly and are implying a bit of spot price in them actually from my perspective. So, short answer from me is yes, they are at least believable.
Kit Konolige - Soleil: It occurs to me that if we're going to have CO2 burdens on coal plants, then people are going to be using more gas for electricity. Is it likely in your thinking by '11, '12, '13, is there likely to be enough more gas being used for electricity that that alone is going to affect the price of gas?
John Rowe: The short answer to that is yes. We are seeing first stress in the short run on gas price downward that comes from a weaker economy and the development of the new shale-squeezing operations which seem to have a lower cost than people would have thought a few years back. In the long run, you have a dance that goes back and forth between how costly are new shale fields and how many of them will environmental pressures allowed to be opened driving gas prices down? Obviously, driving gas prices up, the fact that that's the only popular form of new reliable capacity and you need more gas to backup all of that wind. In the longer run, we like your questions imply, tend to be relatively bullish on gas. That said, it's a trade-off. Let me just try to wrap this up. There is a joke that goes a fellow calls his friend and says how are things, as Kit asked. The answer was, well, not so good, not so bad. Exelon's prospects are not so good as they looked a year ago when all was rosy and gas was at $13. Exelon's prospects are a lot better than most other folks in this economy. We're terribly proud of the first quarter. We're quite confident in our ability to sustain our earnings range for the year. We're working very hard on trying to make next year another good year. That's about all we can say at the moment, but that's not so bad.
Karie Anderson: Thank you, operator. That concludes our call.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Chaka Patterson:  Welcome to Exelon’s fourth quarter 2008 earning's review and conference call update. Thank you for joining us today. We issued our earning's release this morning. If you haven’t received it, the release is available on the Exelon Website at www.exeloncorp.com or you can call [Delores Mugia] at 312-394-5222 and she will fax or email the release to you.  Before we begin today’s discussion, let me remind you that the earning's release and other matters we discuss on today’s call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties as well as adjusted non-GAAP operated earnings.  Please refer to today's 8-K and our other SEC filings for discussions of factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts, and expectations and for a reconciliation of operating earnings to GAAP earnings. In addition during the call we will be discussing Exelon’s exchange offer to acquire NRG Energy Inc. and Exelon’s intention to solicit proxies for meetings of NRG and Exelon shareholders. Today’s discussion does not constitute an offer to exchange or a solicitation of an offer to exchange NRG’s shares and it is not a substitute for the exchange offer documents we have filed with the SEC or the proxy statements that we intend to file with the SEC.  For important additional information regarding the offer and the proxy statements, please refer to the earnings release in today’s 8-K. Leading the call today are John Rowe, Exelon’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Matthew Hilzinger, Exelon’s Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by other members of the Exelon’s senior management team who will be available to answer your questions.  We have scheduled 60 minutes for this call. I will now turn the call over to John Rowe, Exelon’s CEO. 
John W. Rowe:  Good morning, everyone and happy New Year, 2008 was another good year for Exelon and we met our expectations in spite of all of the turbulence of the fourth quarter. I want to provide you a little more perspective on 2008 and then I will try to provide you a little more perspective on our purposed transaction with NRG and I will end, as I almost always do, by talking about Exelon’s long term value proposition.  I think, given what’s going on around us, the Exelon value proposition as shown by its 2008 results is as good as it gets and the team around me is committed to continuing to produce doing these difficult times.  In the fall we have witnessed that as all of you are painfully aware tumult in the market places, the like of which most of us have never seen. Exelon did not go unharmed, but neither were we severely damaged. We delivered a strong fourth quarter and an especially strong one in light of the severely deteriorating economic conditions.  This morning we reported operating earnings of a $1.07 per share for the quarter and operating earnings of $4.20 per share for the full year. These results are well within our original guidance range of $4.00 to $4.40 per share.  Indeed, we hit it dead in the middle and they are very well within the guidance range of $4.15 to $4.30 per share that we announced at the beginning of September when everybody felt better about the world than they do today. Matt will walk you through the specific drivers shortly.  Suffice it today to say that I view these results as both a tribute to the value platform that Exelon is and a huge accomplishment for all of our operating groups. Exelon generation, especially nuclear power team, ComEd and PECO, everybody pulled in to make this a good year and I don’t think I've ever been as proud of my management team as I am as we sit here today.  We did what we promised you we would do, deliver sustainable value. We did it through good operations. We did it by protecting the value of our generation. We did it by continuing to work on the value of our delivery companies and we set the industry standard for low carbon energy generation.  And as the NRG transaction represents, we are constantly looking for good ways to grow in the future but we do it in a way that is hard-headed, indeed cold-blooded. Now let me begin by talking about operations.  Everything we do depends upon the quality of our operations and upon our commitment to continuous improvement in those operations and in the last year we have had the best performance across the board that I have seen. Chip Pardee and his nuclear team had a stellar year achieving a capacity factor of 93.9%, their sixth consecutive year above 93% and one of the fleet's best ever and they did it with more refueling outages than they had the year before.  Mark Shiavoni, [Dwyle Benedy] and their team at Exelon Power also enjoyed a successful year with their highest summer commercial availability.  ComEd’s 2008 customer outage frequency of 1.13 was its second best performance in over a decade. PECO had its best ever performance in reliability for non-storm days reducing the number of outage customers experienced by more than 12%. Now we of course have challenges. We need to keep working on the duration of outages. We need to keep working on getting more out of less dollars. We’ll talk about some of those challenges, but these are very fine results and they’re reflected in our net income.  When it comes to protecting the value of our generation, Power Team led by Ken Cornew this year, delivered another distinguished performance. Power Team was able to increase margins in 2008 by roughly 9% from $35.16 per mega watt hour to $38.48, and it benefited from higher forward power prices this summer by locking in a portion of our sales for the next few years.  When things looked all roses in the spring our hedging policies were questioned and I must say we even questioned them ourselves when natural gas hit $14.00. And as I have said before and will say again, we hedge to protect the value of our generation across the business sector. What we are currently seeing, something like $5.00 natural gas is one of the things our hedging program protects us against.  And I think [Ian McClain] and Ken Cornew and [Jill Glace] and the rest of their team deserve a great deal of credit for sticking to their plans and they are clearly going to benefit us in 2009 as they did in the fourth quarter. Indeed another $1.00 drop in gas prices would have very little effect on Exelon's near-term earnings precisely because of [Ian's] hedging program.  Now going to our delivery companies, both ComEd and PECO had constructive rate cases in 2008. In ComEd it was their delivery service tariffs and in PECO it was a gas rate case. The ICC granted ComEd an annual revenue increase over $270 million and the Pennsylvania Commission approved PECO's recent gas rate settlement resulting in an annual revenue increase of over $75 million. The result in these cases will help us in 2009.  I think Anne Pramaggiore, John Hooker, Bob McDonald, Darryl Bradford and others deserve a lot of credit for a very hard won case in Illinois and likewise in Pennsylvania, Dennis and his great team did and absolutely phenomenal job with the gas rate case.  We believe that ComEd will have an ROE of somewhere between 7 and 9% in 2009 and Anne is hard at work preparing a forward test year based rate case for filling sometime during the year and the increase PECO gas rate revenues will be very helpful there.  Turning to our low carbon position, as you all know the President is committed to carbon regulation, climate regulation. I assume you are equally aware that that goes for the Chairman of the Senate Committee and the new Chairman of the House to Commerce Committee, Henry Waxman.  In 2008, we reinforced our commitment to setting the industry standard for low carbon energy generation with Exelon 2020. It represents the industry's only comprehensive credible plan to reduce, offset or displace its carbon foot print by 2020. We, of course, can do this because of our nuclear waste.  We have made progress this year during that goal and during 2008 we will partly surpass our voluntary goal of an 8% reduction under the EPA climate leaders programs. According to our latest figures we are about half way toward achieving our goal of a 25% reduction in energy consumption across our portfolio agreements. And we continue to offer more low carbon energy to the market place, this year adding a total of close to 210 megawatts of solar, bio mass and wind power purchase agreements to our portfolio. Betsy Muller has kept us an active part of U.S. cap, which made a major policy statement last week in terms of getting industry and environmental agreement to both the President's long-term goals and also to an allocation formula, which would give 40% of any free allowances to the electricity sector.  This is another step forward in achieving a consensus on how to deal with climate. We are evaluating several kinds of growth opportunities. Let me start with the most straight-forward. We are pursuing 350 megawatts of upgrades at our nuclear plants by 2014 and we are evaluating an additional 1100 megawatts of potential upgrades.  We continue to evaluate the feasibility of a nuclear plant in Victoria County, Texas but we expect to be in the second phase in DOE's loan guarantee considerations for that project. We had filed a combined construction permit and operating license applications with the NRC but we continue to follow this project very closely both in terms of alternative designs and in terms of its economics in the present merchant environment.  Now let me turn to the transaction that interests us most at the moment, probably you. On January 7th we announced very positive progress in our NRG acquisition. NRG share holders tendered approximately 106 million shares or 45.6% of the outstanding shares.  We consider this a major accomplishment for a first round. As we announced publicly, per requirements, earlier this week I met with David Crane to discuss the transaction in hopes of initiating due diligence.  NRG is unwilling to do so based on our current bid. We believe their refusal to allow due diligence is another sign of entrenchment on the part of the NRG board and management, and we believe that they must, at some point, begin to pay attention to the very large contingent of share holders that have already tendered, based on our exchange offering.  Our will is equally strong and I believe the numbers are with us. My meeting with David Crane did absolutely nothing to weaken our commitment to seeing this transaction through to completion. I believe our prospects for success continue to improve.  I strongly urge NRG shareholders to tender their shares on or before the new expiration date of February 25th in order to make possible a real negotiation based on due diligence. We will shortly announce and propose a slate of well qualified, independent candidates for the NRG Board of Directors.  We are absolutely committed to pursuing and closing this deal. We are committed to working with the rating agencies to try to find a way to do it and maintain investment grade for both Exelon and all of its subsidiaries and we will continue to engage in dialogue with all three rating agencies to achieve that result.  To you as Exelon share holders, I want to make clear that this is about value. Exelon is built on the relentless pursuit of real value. We are doing this not out of ego, but because the numbers say we can obtain somewhere between $1 and $3 billion of value by accomplishing it.  To NRG's bond holders, I say that you have seen your bonds trade up since we announced the deal and trade up even more as the markets have improved. We have achieved substantial value for you already. Our projections and I believe yours show more value flowing your way when the deal closes.  To those on this call who are also NRG share holders, I say that the 37% premium to the October 17th closing price results in $2 billion of near term value to you and also the opportunity to participate in the $1.5 to $3 billion of synergies created by the combined company, and also in the benefits of owning a piece of the nation's largest nuclear fleet. 
 : If you want to get this done, please help us put it together. The deal simply cannot get done if everyone wants to get all of the value. I believe it can be done. I think the results that we got in early January say that it will be done, but it requires a lot of hard work to get there.  I ask the support of the Exelon shareholders. We seek the support of others to make this transaction work. If we can work it not only creates value for all stakeholders, it creates the kind of generation company that the market needs with the kind of national presence that the market needs and the kind of balance sheets that the market needs. We believe this works.  Now turning to Exelon’s long-term value at the EEI Financial Conference last November, we announced that our 2009 earning's range would be within our general earning's range for 2008. Needless to say we are not ecstatic with flat earnings for another year, but the growth will be there over time and in this economy that’s a very attractive earning's range.  We continue to have the things that produce value. Our 17 nuclear plants are the best advantage platform in the industry. They provide a low-cost, low-carbon generation source. This advantage increases as the care rules on air pollution have been reinstated and make their way into [inaudible]. They will increase more as Washington regulates carbon conditions.  We have the advantage of selling the output from these nuclear plants in the most attractive competitive markets. We reinforce these advantages with an investment grade balance sheet, BBB minus, consolidated basis, BBB at the generation company, strong credit metrics, substantial cash flows, indeed over $4.5 billion likely in 2009 and ample access to liquidity, over $7 billion of aggregate bank commitments to 2012.  We protect these advantages to our hedging program including the slot contract between ComEd and [inaudible] and through our risk management practices. Our approach to our balance sheet worked through the great Enron and Dynergy crisis a few years ago. It is working well through this financial turmoil in 2008 and 2009 and I believe they will continue to work as we all work very hard to weather the recession.  We are committed to further efforts on cost control and capital expenditure management and we will share the results of those efforts with you as we have them. We believe we are uniquely positioned to accomplished NRG transaction and that will create further value.  I believe that Exelon continues to offer the opportunities to give you a very, very special value and I am absolutely committed to doing that. But more than that, so are my colleagues around this table, as we talk to you. I know everybody wants everything to be upbeat and you all have known me for a very long time and know that painting things in rosy colors is not my greatest strength. But these are the times that call for what I have to give. These are the times that call for what Exelon has to give and these are the times that call for what this management team has shown you it can give. I think our 2008 results are pretty special, all things considered and I hope you do, too. I'll now turn the call over to Matt.
Matthew F. Hilzinger: Starting with slide three, I've highlighted my key messages for this morning. We have provided a significant amount of detail regarding our results in our earnings release and the accompanying tables, therefore, I'll spend my time this morning discussing our results for the quarter and the full year, our 2009 outlook, our excellent liquidity position and strong balance sheet metrics. Starting with our current quarter results on slide four, we reported operating earnings of $1.07 per share in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to $1.02 per share in the fourth quarter of 2007. Our fourth quarter results were strong despite difficult economic conditions, reflecting higher earnings at Exelon Generation and ComEd, while PECO reported lower earnings than the prior year as expected. For the year, Exelon's 2008 operating earnings were $4.20 per share, down from $4.32 per share in 2007. I'll start by mentioning two events that affect quarter-over-quarter results that will not be covered in my discussions of the operating company results. First, Exelon Corp. made a $50 million pre-tax contribution to the Exelon Foundation in the fourth quarter of 2007.  Second, Exelon, at the consolidated level, recognized a benefit from a tax settlement related to the capitalization of indirect overhead cost of $0.06 per share in the fourth quarter of 2007, and $0.02 per share in the fourth quarter of 2008.  The settlement contributed positively to the fourth quarter earnings of ComEd and PECO in both 2008 and 2007, while having a negative impact on the earnings of Generation in the fourth quarter of 2007.  Turning to slide five, you will see the key drivers for Exelon Generation's quarter-over-quarter higher operating earnings.  First, portfolio market conditions were $0.02 per share favorable in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to the fourth quarter of 2007, largely due to higher margins, offset by higher cost and several discreet income items from 2007. The average margins realized by Exelon Generation were $2.58 per megawatt hour, higher on average in the fourth quarter of 2008 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2007, reflecting higher average realized hedge and capacity prices during the quarter, and lower purchase power costs, offset by lower spot prices and higher uranium fuel costs. These results continue to illustrate the effectiveness of PowerTeam's hedging program, as around-the-clock market prices were roughly 10% lower at PGM West Hub and 17% lower at Ni-Hub in the fourth quarter of 2008 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2007. Second, our nuclear group continued their exceptional operational performance this quarter with higher nuclear volumes benefiting quarter-over-quarter results by $0.02 per share. Exelon Nuclear achieved a capacity factor of 93.7% in the fourth quarter of 2008, which is higher than the 91% achieved in the fourth quarter of 2007. In terms of planned refueling outage days, Exelon Nuclear had 80 refueling days in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to 91 days in the fourth quarter of 2007. With respect to non-fueling outage days, Exelon Nuclear had five fewer days quarter-over-quarter with 22 in the fourth quarter of this year as compared to 27 in the fourth quarter of last year. O&M costs at Exelon Generation were unfavorable in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to 2007, driven by impacts of inflation, hire labor and related expenses and increased costs associated with nuclear refueling outages.  This was partially offset by lower O&M related to a possible new nuclear plant in Texas, due to an expense that we recognized in the fourth quarter of 2007 associated with [Longweed] equipment.  Last, Exelon Generation's fourth quarter 2007 results reflect a gain of 0.06 per share realized due to a rebalancing of investments in the Nuclear Decommissioning Trust. For the full year 2008, Exelon Generation contributed $3.46 of operating earnings per Exelon share compared to a contribution of $3.45 per share in 2007. These results were achieved despite two additional refueling outages at Exelon-operated plants and one additional outage at Salem in 2008 as compared to 2007. They also reflect higher wholesale margins realized year-over-year. Turning to ComEd on slide six, you'll see the key drivers of ComEd's higher quarter-over-quarter results with the most significant driver being higher distribution revenues reflective of the September 2008 distribution order, partially offset by the discreet impacts of a tax method change that had a more favorable impact on earnings in the fourth quarter of 2007 as compared to 2008. For the year 2008, ComEd contributed $0.33 of operating earning per Exelon share, an increase over 2007 operating earnings of $0.30 per share. The increase is largely due to higher distribution and transmission revenues. Turning to slide seven, ComEd experienced a decrease in weather-normalized retail deliveries across all customer classes in the fourth quarter of 2008, with an average decrease of 1.6%. The small and large C&I customer classes experienced the most significant decline quarter-over-quarter.  At the time of the EEI Conference in November, ComEd had forecasted an average decline in 2009 weather-normalized deliveries across all customer classes of 0.1%. As a result of the decline in the fourth quarter of electric deliveries, along with deteriorating economic outlooks, ComEd has decreased its 2009 local forecast to a negative 1.1%, with a negative 0.6% forecasted for the residential class, as shown on this slide. Turning now to PECO on slide 8, you will see the key drivers of PECO's quarter-over-quarter decline in operating earnings including the scheduled increase in PECO's CTC amortization of $0.02 per share. As we discussed on our third-quarter earnings call, PECO reported higher than normal levels of bad debt expense through the first nine months of 2008.  PECO has implemented multiple measures to mitigate the deterioration of accounts receivable aging and to mitigate increased uncollectible customer accounts including being more active on the customer collection front. I'm pleased to report that PECO's bad debt expense came in as expected in the fourth quarter of 2008 at $24 million pre-tax, which is 1 cent per share favorable to the fourth quarter of 2007. We believe the effects of not terminating customers during the implementation of the new PECO billing system are now behind us.  We have honed our credit and collection processes leaving us in a good position to manage uncollectible customer accounts and bad debt expense going forward, obviously subject to weakening economic conditions. For the full year of 2008, PECO contributed $0.49 of operating earnings per Exelon share, a decrease from 2007 operating earnings of $0.75 per share. The year-over-year decrease at PECO is largely driven by higher bad debt expense of $0.09 per share, and higher CTC amortization of $0.08 per share. Turning to slide nine, PECO experienced a decrease in weather-normalized retail deliveries across most customer classes in the fourth quarter of 2008, with an average decrease of 1.1%. The large C&I customer class experienced the most significant decline quarter-over-quarter.  At the time of the EEI Conference in November, PECO had forecasted an average increase in 2009 weather-normalized electric deliveries across all customer classes of 0.2%. Similar to ComEd, and as shown on this slide, PECO's forecast has now turned to a negative 1.1%, with a negative 0.5% forecasted for the residential class. Turning to slide ten, we are reaffirming Exelon's 2009 nine-gap operating earnings guidance range of $4.00 to $4.30 per share, and we are expecting our first quarter 2009 operating earnings to be in the range from $1.10 to $1.20 per share. We anticipate that 2009 will be a very challenging year given the implications of lower commodity prices and the continued slow economy reflected in the negative low growth that I discussed earlier and continued pressure on customer collections accounted in PECO.  Since issuing our 2009 guidance in November we are now facing an incremental increase in our pension and OPEB expense of roughly $115 million in 2009 after discount rates dropped roughly 180 basis points during the last two months of the year, putting additional pressure on a year that already has its share of challenges. In addition to our 2009 earnings guidance it already contemplates over $100 million of O&M savings due to our cost management initiatives. While we’ve now reaching these challenges we remain committed to meeting our 2009 earnings guidance range, we have identified several items throughout the business including opportunities presented through tax planning and the reinstatement of the Clean Air Interstate Rule that we are pursuing in order to offset these challenges. In addition we are over 90% financially hedged in 2009, largely mitigating the potential earnings impact of lower commodity prices.  Turning to slide 11, we are estimating that pension and OPEB will increase by $115 million and $65 million respectively or $180 million in total on a pre-tax basis from 2008 to 2009. As I mentioned earlier, this increase is largely due to lower than expected asset returns and a decline in the discount rate. In 2008 we have assumed that the assets held in our pension and OPEB trust fund would return 8.75% on an annual basis. Actual returns on those investments in 2008 were close to a negative 26%. This lower than expected return in 2008 will be recognized through higher pension and OPEB expense in future periods starting in 2009. In addition we have lowered our long range return expectation for investments in our pension and OPEB trust from 8.75%, 8.5% starting in 2009, which will further increase future expense. Moving to discount rates, our 2009 pension and OPEB expense is calculated using the relevant discount rate at December 31, 2008. This year-end discount rate was determined to be 6.09%, which is slightly lower than the prior discount rate of 6.20% and is roughly 180 basis points lower than the discount rates observable when we issued our 2009 earnings guidance in November of 2008. From a cash perspective we expect cash contributions for pension and OPEB increase by $87 million year-over-year from $243 million in 2008 to $330 million in 2009. Turning to slide 12, we are focused on capturing cost reduction opportunities through sustainable efficiency and productivity improvements. We are forecasting our 2009 operating expense to be relatively flat to 2008. As I briefly mentioned, we are facing about $180 million year-over-year increase in pension and OPEB expense in addition to inflationary pressures both of which are driving up O&M expense year-over-year. These increases in O&M are largely offset by expected lower bad debt expense of PECO in addition to our commitment to reduce 2009 O&M cost by over $100 million. We contemplated these cost reductions in our 2009 operating earnings guidance that we provided to you in November and are reaffirming today. This $100 million in cost savings will be realized through sustainable productivity improvements across all operating companies using a multi pronged approach.  First we are evaluating our governance model and corporate and shared service functions to ensure the structures are optimally designed to support the operating companies and that their cost structures are appropriate.  Second, each operating company’s leading productivity initiatives specific to opportunities within its business. Third, we will implement more rigorous planning and performance measurement tools that allows us to better identify areas for productivity improvement and measure progress against our plan. Lastly, we are committed to sustainable productivity and cost reductions that benefit us over the long term. This is not a onetime cost cutting initiative.  Given the significant increase in pension and OPEB costs coupled with the slowing low growth of potential slowdown in customer collections and power prices at levels lower than a year ago, meeting our 2009 earnings guidance will require continued excellence in operations, a razor sharp focus on costs and successfully realizing opportunities through tax planning and otherwise. We are committed to executing on that and delivering earnings within our guidance range. Moving now to slide 13, I’ll conclude by reminding you that Exelon balance sheet liquidity position are one of the strongest in the industry and we employ rigorous risk management practices including diligently executing on our hedging program.  We are over 90% financially hedged in 2009 and close to 90% financially hedged in 2010. We have and are committed to investment grade credit ratings at Exelon and all of our operating companies can maintain strong balance sheet metrics. We’re forecasting and FFO to debt ratio of 23% in 2009 and continued improvement in 2010. We have $7.3 billion of aggregate bank commitments with a diverse group of 23 banks with no one bank having more than 10% of the aggregate outstanding commitments at Exelon. As of January 16, Exelon had $6.9 billion available under these facilities with sufficient liquidity to address the challenges of 2009. Finally, across Exelon and all of its subsidiaries we have only $29 million total debt maturities in 2009 excluding securitization debt. With the momentum of a strong fourth quarter behind us we are focused on continuing to deliver top tier operations, managing our costs and meeting our financial targets in 2009 and with that I’ll turn the call back over to Chaka Patterson.
Chaka Patterson:  Operator we are ready for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of John Kiani – Deutsche Bank Securities.
John Kiani – Deutsche Bank Securities:  Can you talk about how the negotiations with the NRG bond holders on the potential for a waiver of change of control are progressing and then also in conjunction with that, are you still interested as you’ve stated in your recent investor presentations, are you still interested in pursuing an alternative structure that is more of a [Topco] merger to avoid triggering change of control if the negotiations are not successful?
John W. Rowe:  Yes I can comment, but any comments have to be taken with a little care because this is one of those things that you don’t have soup till it’s cooked. We’ve had some very constructive discussions with the NRG bond holders. As of this week, we seem to be too far apart and that appears to make it necessary for us to plan on trying to implement the [Topco] methodology, but this is all about money and discussions about money have a way of getting reopened.  We think the NRG bond holders have benefited greatly from our proposal being in play. They’ve obviously benefited yet again from improvements in the bond marketplace and the discussion at the moment involves issues like are those improvements in the marketplace stable.  And at the moment we simply don’t have a deal, but this all about money. We’ve had very cordial discussions with them. We’re quite certain they want this deal to happen as their financial interest makes clear that it should. But indeed if you look at current bond prices you know refinancing those is not out of the realm of possibility, so this is a discussion that will continue but meanwhile we’re looking at the [Topco] plan.
John Kiani – Deutsche Bank Securities: I have just one other question as well. Can you provide some color on just high level on Lieutenant Governor Pat Quinn's view about the market in Illinois and you know where he kind of shakes out? Are his views consistent with the Attorney General what you’re thinking about that?
John W. Rowe: Well Lieutenant Governor Quinn will have a plate full when he takes over and I think we’re in a place where we can work with him, because in the current markets ComEd is not likely to have very significant increases in its power purchase costs. So I think his natural reaction is to favor more regulatory structures. But after going through a lot of again with the Attorney General a year or two ago I think we’re now in a place where the market results are going to be more favorable for consumer orientated political figures that are the fully integrated regulated results, so I think we’ll be able to work with the Lieutenant Governor if and when he becomes governor.  I mean it’s very clear that Lieutenant Governor Quinn is most interested in things like energy efficiency were we have a wonderful record, in renewable were our record is better than most, and in things like smart grid that Anne Pramaggiore and Frank and Rob McDonald are already working on along with Barry.  So I think we’ll be able to find a way to work with Lieutenant Governor Quinn on all of his major objectives, but he’s very much a pro regulation kind of political figure. Anne Pramaggiore you want to add anything to that? Frank is not on the call today so.
Anne Pramaggiore:  I think you captured it, John.
John Kiani – Deutsche Bank Securities:  So your basic point is that because power and gas prices are so low at this point there doesn’t seem to be a big, obviously rate increase issue from that stand point.
John W. Rowe:  That’s my basic point, yes. Next question Operator.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Jonathan Arnold.
Jonathan Arnold – Merrill Lynch: I have a question on, Matt talked a couple of times about things that you’re doing or opportunities to offset some of the pressures that you had from Pension and commodities since you originally gave the guidance.  I think I heard him mention something related to Care, the clean air rule and also tax planning. Could you be a bit more specific about what you mean by those and the scope of and size of potentially some of those offsets?
Matt Hilzinger:  Yes. John, I’ll take this is Matt Hilzinger. First I just want to re-emphasize our commitment to the cost management initiative that we've got. I mean that is the real tool that we have to drive value for the shareholders. We're absolutely committed to that. We do need to offset part of this pension increase of about $150 million and we are looking at some very specific tax planning opportunities, which, I’m just not at a liberty to get into here on – in kind of a public disclosure because they're just – they are tax planning initiatives and they're generally held confidential. Care, we do expect some opportunities through Care. They will help offset it. It will not come all at once. It may come over time but we do see some very specific opportunities there. See if Enid had anything or Ken that they wanted to add there.
Kenneth W. Cornew:  Yes. I just had obviously if the nocks and socks market is recovered pretty dramatically as a result of the reinstatement, then that’s where the upside is that wasn’t there and you know December 31st when OPEC did it.
Jonathan Arnold – Merrill Lynch:  To be clear there is no – you talked about the cost saving opportunities. You’re not targeting any additional cost savings beyond the $100 million at this point than you originally had in the plan, is that correct?
Matthew F. Hilzinger: You know we’ve got a commitment to get the hundred. Obviously if we can more than that we’re not going to set our sight at just 100, we're going to pursue more than that. Now whether we get more in 2009, that’s an open question but we’re going to continue to push hard to get as much as we can, but clearly the guidance that we’ve given you we’ve talked about a $100 million John.
John W. Rowe:  Let me just add one particular area. Frank Clark and Barry and Anne have indicated to me that the ComEd will develop a plan for re-accessing its capital requirements. I mean if you look at these numbers we want to be very careful at ComEd to continue to spend the money that’s necessary both to continue to strengthen the system and maintain and commitment to the smart grid initiative. But ComEd's capital expenditures are out of order compared to PECO’s. We’ve been doing that for a number of years because quite frankly ComEd’s spent too little for a long time and the system continues to be hungry for capital. But on the other hand, if we’re seeing flat to 1% negative load growth, it’s just hard to believe the system needs a whole billion dollars and Frank and Barry and Bob and Anne and others are committed to taking that down a peg. And we take that capital down it also reduces operating expenses a little bit along with it as long as we do it in the right way.
Jonathan Arnold – Merrill Lynch:  Could I just ask one follow up on that pension question? You gave this illustrative scenario analysis in the EEI presentation and based on the 2009 numbers look like they came in a little worse than you know I guess the worse scenario in that analysis, which also included you know contributions of $800 million, a little over $800 in 2010 an a billion four in 2011. Can you give us any indication of how those numbers might have all given the scenario you’re currently looking at?
Matthew F. Hilzinger:  I’ll do that, John, and this is Matt again. Let me just spend a little bit of time on what happened this year again then I’ll talk a little bit about 2010. But the actual asset return if and I think with Jonathan for everybody on the phone he’s referring to page 33 in the EEI deck that’s on our Website.  But there’s a scenario there. It’s scenario four. And we did a little better on the asset performance, I say a little better by a point or a point and a half and actually that’s fairly large when you’re talking about $10 billion. We did a little worse on the discount rate, but it’s generally in the area of what Jonathan is referring to as scenario four, which causes a cash contribution this year of about 330.  In that scenario it suggest that if we have a continued decline in our assets of 15% so an additional 15% decline in 2009, that we would be looking at a contribution in 2010 for pension of $825 million, which is significantly over where we are now. And we put these out so everybody can see them.  You can’t run from them. You can’t hide from them. We're obviously like everybody is very disappointed with asset returns, but I think that we’re prepared and we have the liquidity to deal with that in 2010 if we need to. I would add this though Jonathan, there is the Pension Relief Act, which was recently enacted provides a mechanism, should you elect it, to smooth your contributions, and it can dramatically change the amount of contribution that you would potentially have to make in 2010 by hundreds of millions of dollars. That election is not required until September 15th and so we’re looking at that. Obviously we want to take care of everybody’s that covered by the pension and hope that will make the required contributions that we need to make, but we also see some opportunities out there to reduce the amount of cash that we may need to put into that plan in 2010 and 2011. And then one last item is where still waiting to see if there is anything that comes out of Washington that provides any additional relief. Don’t know of anything right now but clearly we’re going to watch and in some cases pursue that. So does that answer your question, Jonathan?
Jonathan Arnold – Merrill Lynch: It does. Thank you.  
John W. Rowe: Okay. Next question please. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Hugh Wynne – Sanford Bernstein. 
Hugh Wynne – Sanford Bernstein: I also had a question about your estimates of O&M expense and CapEx for 2009. I see that your expectation for O&M is it will be flat next year. Your expectation for CapEx is that it will go up by $200 million.  I guess my question is in light of some of the things that have been mentioned the flat load growth, a decline in most of the major commodity indices of 30% in the fourth quarter, it would seem to me that the need for CapEx and the cost of CapEx and O&M in so far is your spending less on steel and cement and copper and aluminum should allow some major savings opportunities.  But what we’re seeing here is just a flat O&M and an increase in CapEx. I wonder if you could shed some light on that. Is there room to drive these numbers down in 2009 or are you facing structural increases in pension expense, wage expense that I am not familiar with that are preventing that kind of cost savings from being realized?
John W. Rowe: Hugh, first you are familiar with the structural increases in wage expenses and pension expenses so there’s no secret there. We’ve tried to be very clear about both. But beyond that we kind of share your view. We just haven’t been able to put our hands on them to re-budgeted all of them.  Now one of the reasons you see the capital in Exelon Generation comes from our chance to do some more very economical power operates at these plants. But I think Chris is the one who should expand on this answer. My answer is we see the same variables you do and we’re hunting to make them real.  Chris, would you pick up on that?
Chris Pardee:  Yes. Hugh, there’s a couple of things going on. Primarily the capital increase is driven by steam patch replacements, transformer replacements and power upgrades on extending the plant life for the nuclear assets.  Those will continue over the next three years as we bring the plants from their 40 year planned life into their 60 year planned life, and a good side benefit of that is 300 plus mega watts of increased generation, so they have a good return. One of our focus areas in our cost reduction program is our leveraged procurement activities. As commodity prices decrease we will be picking up those savings into these projects. Engineered components lagged the reduction in the commodity price by a little bit.  In a year or two we will continue to try to, in transformer procurements and some of the other things we need, try to drive those down. But that’s the primary increase and even with the deteriorating market they’re required to maintain the material condition in the high availability of the nuclear units that we have.  The flat O&M is looking at eating through our cost saving's initiative and some adjustments and outages, but it’s primarily eating the inflation that you’re seeing year over year. That’s the area that John said that we’ll continue to focus on to find those opportunities through leverage procurement, contractor renegotiation, reduction in contract utilization and improvement in productivity, which is the point that Matt made on the three pronged approach.  The utilities are validating their low growth requirements and we’ll be analyzing those for their capital reduction in the next quarter. There will be more information coming on that. But as the situation as you know is fluid, they’ll be adjusting the plans to meet their reliability requirements. 
John W. Rowe:  Hugh, this is John. Let me just add one thing. We think we’ve done a pretty good job on the O&M side in looking at the budget as we go through this year. We’re going to keep working on both that and the capital side where I don’t think we may have made all the adjustments that we can.  We’re very committed to finding any of the changes you referred to. We see the commodity price thing too and it is an opportunity. On the other hand, we’re also committed not to just yo-yoing expenditure in the delivery companies. We suffered from a long history of that and credibility with both the streets and the troops and the regulators is important here, so we want to do this right and not just yank things around because it would make us feel good for a day but I think we’ll find some more opportunities here. 
Hugh Wynne – Sanford Bernstein: I am curious about your perspective on one commodity price decline in particular, which is the decline in the prices of gas relative to coal and the implication that may have for the future costs of CO2. It seemed to me that the cost of reducing CO2 in the power sector is very, very low right now because of the ease of which gas fired generation can be substituted or coal fire generation.  Is that something that you guys have a view on or thought through with implications on your CO2 upside and NRG’s CO2 downside? 
John W. Rowe: Oh, yes. That’s one of the things that goes into our models all the time. It’s one of the reasons why we can’t just write a blank check to do NRG. It’s one of the reasons we've been hard headed on the view that this is an attractive transaction\ but like all transactions not attractive at any price.  We run new gas price scenarios through all of our models in terms of that transaction, but let me go to a larger part of what you are talking about. While we talk about no nuclear to deal with carbon and while we talk about various forms of renewables all of which are both politically popular and expensive, what we’re really going to see in this pricing environment is what is called the dash to gas.  Most new capacity needs will really be met by natural gas. We suspect that begins to push gas back up as you go out, but we have done our very best to model into both our long term planning and in to our NRG transaction values exactly the phenomena you just described. 
John W. Rowe:  Last question operator?
Operator:  Your final question comes from Paul Patterson.
Paul Patterson – Glenrock Associates :  Really briefly you said there was a 7.9% ROE at ComEd and that Ann was looking…
John W. Rowe:  Seven to nine is what I said, a range of somewhere of between seven and nine. Anne or Bob do you want to expand?
Robert K. McDonald:  Yes. That is the estimate. It is predicated on rate case filing that we’re planning to make this year.
Paul Patterson – Glenrock Associates:  Okay. 
Robert K. McDonald:  Seven to nine, 409 is based on the result from last year, quite further..
John W. Rowe:  The new rates won't have much effects in ’09. 
Robert K. McDonald:  Further progress from that is predicated on the next trip. 
Paul Patterson – Glenrock Associates:  Okay and then the tax planning, which you guys don’t want to elaborate on is that something that’s going to have a longer term impact or is that more of a 2009 impact that we’re talking about and do we have any idea about what the quantification of that or the potential impact of that might be just anything more you can…
John W. Rowe:  We have a Tax Vice President with a shaved head and he ought to be given a chance to talk. 
Unidentified Corporate Participant:  The tax benefit that we’re referring to is long term. We’re really not at liberty at this point to quantify it. We haven’t configured the quantifications. We should know where that stands later in the first quarter. 
Paul Patterson – Glenrock Associates:  Okay and then open EBITDA any thoughts there? You guys gave us some numbers at EEI based on July, obviously some things have been moving around?
John W. Rowe:  You think gas prices might have fallen since July? Matt, Ian, who wants to pick up on that?
Matthew F. Hilzinger:  My caveat would be – I think that’s why we like and are so supportive of our hedging program to deal with these types of changes in gas prices, so as we said we’re over 90% financially hedged in 2009? We’re I think close to the top of the range which is near 80% financially hedged in 2010.  So I think those continue to service well and I don’t, Ian I don’t know if you or Ken had anything in particular you wanted to elaborate on. 
John W. Rowe:  I think while they're thinking, we modeled our potential cash flows under various gas price scenarios and gas prices are the first driver effecting longer term power prices outside the hedge range. We’ve tried to do it with constant $6.00 gas, which is one group's feeling of a conservative stress case, more conservative than we think it will be and we’ve looked at how these things effect our cash flows.  Obviously the total amount of cash we can generate in five years is a couple billion dollars lower than if you assume gas that’s closer to $6.00 than $7.50, but you can do the scenarios analysis as well as we can. I don’t know what we have to add to that. 
Chaka Patterson:  Yes. Paul, this is Chaka, we gave you what the open EBITDA is. The assumptions and the sensitivities, so you can mark the open EBITDA. You can mark it and if you want to walk through that give me a call after and we can walk through it. 
Paul Patterson – Glenrock Associates:  Sure that’s what I was thinking about, 2011’s seems to be, I mean you guys are now hedging out 2011 and 2011 seems to be something that you guys were sort of focusing on in terms of the uplift that was there and I was just wondering since you guys have hedged more it looks like in the business and update in the hedging and what have you, what are your expectations? I mean have they changed at all or do you guys want to, I mean if you don’t want to revisit it on the call that’s cool I just sort of – I was just wondering if there is any more sort of thoughts that was associated with that in terms of what our expectations should be since there’s this hedged amount that you guys have in 2011 and of course prices have changed and we don’t know exactly where you hedged it at. 
Chaka Patterson:  Yes I think what I offered there Paul is that at EEI we gave a range of kind of $5.00 to $6.00 of what we expected in 2011 and I know it’s kind of a wide range but it’s to cover these types of things when you see these types of prices falling in such a short time and so I think that range is something that we still believe in and we’ll be somewhere within that. I was just talking with Ian briefly and the financially hedged in 2010; is it 2010? It’s closer to 92% so we’re fairly well locked in but I think the guidance range of $5.00 to $6.00 is something that you guys ought to put a lot of stock in. 
John W. Rowe:  Okay thank you operator. That concludes our call.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Tanya, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Third Quarter 2008 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please limit to your questions to one and one follow-up. Thank you. Mr. Chaka Patterson,. you may begin.
Chaka Patterson - Investor Relations: Thank you, operator. Good morning. Welcome to Exelon's third quarter 2008 earnings review and conference call update. Thank you for joining us today. We issued our earnings release this morning. If you haven't receive it, the release is available on the Exelon website at www.exeloncorp.com or you can call Dolores Munguia at 312-394-5222 and she will fax or email the release to you. Before we begin today's discussion, let me remind you that the earnings release and other matters we discussed in today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties, as well as adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings. Please refer to today's 8-K and our other SEC filings for discussions of factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts and expectations, and for reconciliation of operating earnings to GAAP earnings. Leading the call today are John Rowe, Exelon's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Matthew Hilzinger, Exelon's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by other members of Exelon's Senior Management team, who will be available to answer your questions. We have scheduled one hour minutes for this call. I will now turn the call over to John Rowe, Exelon's Chief Executive Officer
John W. Rowe - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Chaka. We talked with many of you earlier in the week regarding our proposal to acquire NRG. We are diligent, we're pursuing this because we believe that can create substantial value for both Exelon and NRG shareholders. At the same time we remain as focused as ever on running this business and delivering results to you. Today we reported our third quarter report... results. I will limit my prepared remarks this morning to Exelon's third quarter earnings and some parts about navigating through these turbulent times. As you saw from our press release this morning, GAAP earnings were $1.06 a share and operating earnings were $1.07 a share. Our third quarter earnings was reduced by several items relating to the nation's financial terms and the weakening economy reduced our third quarter earnings. We now expect our full year 2008 operating earnings to be well within our original range of $4 to $4.40 per share, but very close to the bottom of our more recent guidance of $4.15 to $4.30 per share that we announced at the beginning of September. While the changing times are not pleasant and September and early October have been very unpleasant for us all, our operations continue to improve across the board, our nuclear fleet continues to excel, our balance sheet remains strong, our liquidity is unimpaired and our cash flows are running substantially as anticipated. You will see on slide 3, of the slide accompanies today's earnings call, how we're going to dividend overtime. Today we announced an increase in our annual dividend by 5%, from $2 to $2.10 per share. This reflects a 12% annual growth rate in our cash dividend since 2001. When you run utilities for 25 years as I have, you are given the opportunity as they call it to manage through a variety of challenging times. In my experience to successfully deal with these challenges one must do four things. Operate well, maintain access to sufficient liquidity, manage risk as best you can, and manage the regulatory and political environment. Exelon is succeeding at all four of these things. First, our operations are very strong. We continue to operate our nuclear fleet at genuinely world class levels. In the third quarter Chris Crane and Chip Hardy [ph] and their team achieved a 97.2% capacity factor in the nuclear fleet. This brings their year-to-date capacity factor to 94%. Looking specifically at the critical summer months our nuclear fleet completed the summer with no outages for the first time in Exelon's history. Ladies and gentlemen, it just does not get much better than that. Not only can we legitimately claim to be the best operators of nuclear power plants in the country, a stature that we have fought to attain and know we must work unceasingly to maintain. Nuclear power enjoys the lowest operating and maintenance cost in the electric industry, and averaged about $0.02 per kilowatt hour again that's O&M not all-in cost compared to $0.025 for coal and closer to $0.07 for gas based on 2007 data. Among major nuclear fleet operators Exelon is consistently the lowest cost producers of electricity in the nation. Turning to our delivery utilities, ComEd's outage performance in terms of frequency continues to be strong. Year-to-date overall and non-storm safety numbers for ComEd are the third best since 1998, and we believe represent first quartile performance. I also want to commend Frank Clark, Barry Mitchell and the ComEd team for their response to the August 4th storm that impacted approximately 520,000 customers in Northern Illinois, the fourth worst storm, since 1998 in terms of customers affected. In spite of the severity of this storm 87% of the customers were restored within 24 hours. Turning to PECO year-to-date non-storm safety [ph] is the best on record surpassing the previous record set in 2006. I congratulate Denis O'Brien, and Craig Adams and their team on a job well done. We continue to generate substantial cash from operations; $4 billion of cash in each of the last two years and we expect to generate roughly $5 billion this year as shown on slide 3. We also have accessed to sufficient liquidity, in excess of $7 billion from 24 banks with limited exposure to any one bank. That is the result of lot of work, not only by our finance people under Matt Hilzinger, but by Ian McLean, Ken Cornew, Joe [indiscernible], our whole trading and risk management team. Third, we manage this business conservatively to assure that we are good stewards of your money. While our risk management policies come in many forms, I would like to highlight three. First, our hedging strategy. Given how tight we are at the hip to movements in power prices, natural gas, coal and even oil prices, we hedge against short-term volatility in these and other commodities. We are over 95% financially hedged in the remainder of 2008 and over 90% financially hedged in 2009. Our hedging program limits our exposure to movements in power prices driven by volatile commodities and provides the level of assurance around our cash flow. Our hedging program is critical to how we manage risk, how we protect the value of your assets and how we ensure we can navigate through troubled waters without jeopardizing our competitive position. Second, I want to highlight the fact that we keep a very tight rein on proprietary trading activities. They in turn [ph] all that their jobs are to money for you by maximizing the value of our Generation output, not by risking millions of your investment dollars on speculative trading. Finally, I want to highlight that the Generation Company transacts with a diverse group of high quality counter parties most of whom remain investment grade. Our risk managers monitor our exposure and the financial condition of these counter parties on a daily basis. I continue to empower our risk managers to take appropriate steps to limit our risks in this area. Fourth, we are successfully coping with our regulatory and political environment. Both ComEd and PECO reached constructive results in their DST and gas cases respectively. The ICC granted ComEd, an annual revenue increase of over $270 billion and we believe has positioned ComEd to pursue future test rules [ph] in its next rate cases. Just yesterday, the Pennsylvania Commission approved the settlement that PECO had reached related to its recent gas rate case, an annual revenue increase of over $75 million. PECO also filed a plan with the Pennsylvania Commission for competitive procurement of power, the phase end of market based rates and energy efficiency programs. The three parts of this plan if approved by the commission would help PECO's customer transition to market-based rates in 2011, as well as assist those customers in better managing their energy consumption. This regulatory filing matches the view of the legislation, recently enacted by the Pennsylvania General Assembly and signed by Governor Rendell. The legislation addresses many of the components found in PECO's filing, including competitive procurement demand side management and energy efficiency programs. Pennsylvania through both regulation and now legislation continues to make competitive electricity markets work for consumers. While we applied this legislation, we expect that the issue of rate mitigation will still need to be addressed. We will continue to work with the General Assembly and Governor Rendell, to address the best way to assist customers with the transition from cap to market base rates. In my 25 years as the CEO, I've seen a lot of cycles. A lot of up, a lot of downs. Because of our superior operation, our liquidity, our conservative risk management policies and our skills at dealing with the regulatory and political world around us, I believe that Exelon is very well positioned to continue to meet challenges and also to take advantages of the opportunities that lie ahead. I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Matt Hilzinger.
Matthew F. Hilzinger - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Chief Financial Officer, Generation: Thank you, John. Good morning everyone. Starting with slide 4, I've highlighted my key messages for this morning. We've compiled a significant amount of detail regarding our results and our earnings release in the accompanying tables. Therefore I've spend my time this morning discussing our results for the quarter, our full year outlook and Exelon's strong liquidity position. Starting with our current quarter results on slide 5, we reported operating earnings of $1.07 per share in the third quarter of 2008 compared to $1.21 per share in the third quarter of 2007. Our third quarter results reflect strong operations at the Generation company, while both ComEd and PECO reported lower earnings than the prior year. Turning to slide 6, you will see the key drivers for Exelon Generation's quarter-over-quarter higher operating earnings. First, portfolio and market conditions were $0.08 per share favorable in the third quarter of 2008 compared to the third quarter of 2007. The average margins realized by Exelon Generation were approximately $4 per megawatt hour higher on average in the third quarter of 2008 as compared to the third quarter of 2007, reflecting higher average realized hedge and market prices during the quarter. These were partially offset by higher fuel cost. Second, our Nuclear group continued their exceptional operating performance this quarter with higher nuclear volumes benefiting quarter-over-quarter results by $0.02 per share. Exelon operated plants achieved a capacity factor of 97.2% in the third quarter of 2008, which is slightly higher than the 97% achieved in the third quarter of 2007. In terms of plant refueling outage days, Exelon Generation had 17 refueling days in the third quarter of 2008, compared to nine in the third quarter of 2007. With respect to non-refueling outage days, Exelon Generation had five fewer days quarter-over-quarter with eight in the third quarter of this year as compared to 13 in the third quarter of last year. O&M cost at Exelon Generation were unfavorable in the third quarter of this year compared to 2007. This was largely driven by inflationary pressures on labor and contracting, and materials, which reduced earnings by $0.02 per share quarter-over-quarter. In addition, we experienced increased cost associated with other O&M expenses of $0.03 per share, which includes expenditures on the new nuclear plan, we're exploring in Texas and higher O&M costs associated with an increased number of planned fueling days. Lastly Exelon Generation established reserve of $0.02 per share associated with its net next exposure to Lehman Brothers triggered by Lehman's bankruptcy filing in September. Turning to slide 7, this slide summarize the credit exposure from Exelon Generation's power marketing activities as of September 30. The first key point that I would like to make is that Exelon Generation's net credit exposure from power market activities was limited to approximately $683 million as of September 30th and 85% of this net exposure was with investment grade counterparties. The non-investment grade counterparties are limited to coal suppliers from whom we purchase coal for our own use. Also note that the majority of this net exposure has a maturity of two years or less. This level of net counterparty exposure increased by approximately $180 million from June 30 through September 30. Let me now walk you through why that is the case. From June 30th to September 30th power prices decreased. Accordingly transaction's the power team previously entered into as hedges of our forward generation move in Exelon Generation favor. As the mark-to-market on these contracts moved in our favor, our net counterparty exposure increased, because the risk of counterparty default increased. At the same time the decline in power prices, since the end of the second quarter reduced Generation's net collateral position with counterparties. As of September 30th, generation had only a $162 million of net collateral posted to counterparties reflecting both cash and the letters of credit. The second key point is that Exelon generation's net exposures diversified. As of September 30, no single counterparty represented over 10% individually of Exelon Generation's net exposure from power marketing activities. That's exclusive of ComEd and PECO. This is by design. We diligently manage our counterparty risk to ensure that we do not have significant exposure to any single counter party. As of September 30, financial institutions represented 45% of Exelon Generation's net exposure and investor owned utilities. Marketers and power producers represented 38% and coal suppliers represented 13%. Relative to the end of the second quarter, the proportion of counterparty exposure related to financial institutions has increased. This increase partly reflects the changes in market prices for various product coupled with seasonal affects such as summer hedges rolling off. Turing to ComEd on slide 8, you will see the key drivers of ComEd's lower quarter-over-quarter results with the three most significant drivers being unfavorable weather of $0.03 per share. A one time write-off associated with the final rate order and ComEd's distribution rate case and slightly higher uncollectible accounts expense. As John mentioned the Illinois Congress Commission issued its final order in ComEd's distribution rate case on September 10. That will provide for an annual increase in distribution revenues of approximately $74 million effective September 16. We've included the slide in the appendix of today's earnings call package that provides additional information regarding that final order. ComEd's third quarter results reflect a net one time write-off of a $0.02 per share associated with the receipt of that final order, which is composed of two pieces. The first piece is a one time write-off of rate base primarily associated with the treatment of underground wires and the final order and the proposed resolution of the original cost audit. Together these write-offs reduced our third quarter earnings by $0.04 per share. The second piece is the allowed recovery of certain costs previously incurred which increased third quarter income by $0.02 per share. Together these two items net to $0.02 per share write-off that we reported in our results today. ComEd also experienced higher levels of bad debt expense quarter-over-quarter contributing $0.02 per share to ComEd's quarter-over-quarter decline in earnings. ComEd has experienced increased customer account net charge-offs following a suspension of residential customer disconnects from October of 2006 to August 2007, which has driven up bad debt expense. A contributing factor to this increase in net charge-offs is that ComEd is recovering roughly 10% less of overdue customer receivables following customer disconnections as compared to historical periods. Current economic conditions maybe driving this customer behavior in which case we may see some continued levels of higher bad debt expense in the fourth quarter. Turning now to PECO, on Slide 9, you will see the four key drivers of PECO's quarter-over-quarter decline in operating earnings, including higher bad debt expense, a one time favorable property tax adjustment in the third quarter of 2007 at $0.03 per share that did not occur this year, unfavorable weather of $0.02 per share, at the schedule increase PECO's CTC amortization of $0.02 per share. As we reported on our second quarter earnings call, PECO continues to experience higher levels of bad debt expense. PECO's third quarter 2008 bad debt expense is $0.04 higher per share than last year. The expense is in part to result of previously... of our previously temporary suspension of certain collection processes during the billing system convergent project in 2006 and 2007. Overtime, PECO has experienced an increase in the size of the total receivables, the aging of the receivables, and the average balance per terminated customer. We have found one of the most effective ways to address these issues, is through increased customer terminations and accordingly PECO has increased efforts in that area. In the third quarter PECO updated its reserves to reflect higher anticipated charge-offs associated with the recent and upcoming increases and terminations, as well as projected deterioration of PECO's higher risk customer accounts. The new billing system has given us a better understanding of the customer payment behaviors, and the underlying risk factors that have supported our updated reserve levels. We also believe that for overall negative economic conditions are contributing to the increase in bad debt expense in the current period, which may negatively affect future bad debt expense relative to historical levels. Let me now spend a few minutes discussing our view of the remainder of the year. Several items have arisen during the second half of this year, which I discussed previously, that have put pressure on our full year results coming partly from discreet items that we recorded in today's results including the write-offs associated with the Lehman bankruptcy, ComEd's final distribution rate order, higher bad debt expense of both ComEd and PECO, and unfavorable weather. In addition, we are beginning to see the impacts of the slowing economy on our earnings. I talked about our receivable collections, but we were also beginning to see lower than forecasted low growth at both utilities that is likely to continue into the fourth quarter. As John mentioned earlier, we are still expecting our 2008 operating earnings to come in very close to the bottom at the $4.15 to $4.30 per share range that we have announced at the beginning of September. Moving now to Slide 10, I'll take a moment to discuss Exelon's strong financial position. I briefly highlighted two points on this slide, right, I'll briefly highlight two points on this slide, starting with our hedging program. Exelon's Generation hedging program mitigates its exposure to movements in commodity prices and provides a level assurance around its near-term cash flows. We view our hedging program as critical to how we manage risk, protect the value of our assets and navigate through tough times, without jeopardizing our competitive position. Our hedging program considers stress scenarios and positions us well for times like this. The hedging program gives us 18 to 24 months in which to thoughtfully respond. During this period, we can continue to operate the business and invest in our Generation assets without negatively affecting our operational performance for ability to finance the business. We are over 90% financially hedged in the 2009 and over 80% financially hedged in 2010. In addition, we have a tight risk management policy around Exelon Generation's power marketing activities. Generation's proprietary trading activities are minimal. Exelon Generation's daily value-at-risk average less than 350,000 over the past 18 months, which is less than 1% of the total gross margin of our generation business. Turning to slide 11, we are distinctive in our ability to generate substantial cash flows. We have forecasted to generate approximately $5 billion in cash flows from our operations this year which is up roughly $500 million from our original planning assumptions. You will also see on this slide, that we have completed our 2008 financing plan. ComEd retired more debt than we had originally planned primarily in order to either refinance or retire over $340 million of option rate debt securities that had been outstanding at the begin of the year. And at the beginning October PECO completed its financing plan for the year with the $300 million five year first mortgage bond issuance with a coupon of 5.60%. Earlier this week S&P issued a downgrade for Exelon, Exelon Generation and PECO upon the announcement of our offer to acquire NRG. We are committed that this transaction will not cause Exelon or its subsidiaries to go below investment grade for our senior unsecured debt. The offer for NRG is the culmination of a long-term strategic review process by Exelon and we believe the combination will create superior long-term value for our stakeholders. We are fully committed to utilize excess cash flow to reduce debt following the closing of the transaction and return to the ratings that we had prior to the S&P downgrade earlier this week. We will continue to work closely with S&P and other rating agencies to make sure they understand Exelon's plan for paying down the debt Exelon Generation will take on to its balance sheet at the completion of the proposed acquisition of NRG, including the pay down schedule, expected synergies, the overall plan to integrate and manage NRG's assets. We intend to demonstrate to all the credit rating agencies as well as our stakeholders, why we believe that the credit metrics associated with our proposed transaction with NRG and just as importantly our operating and financial strategies fully support investment grade ratings. Turning to slide 12, I've highlighted our liquidity position as of October 20. We have $7.3 billion of aggregate bank commitments with a diverse group of 24 banks with no one bank having more than 10% of the aggregate outstanding commitments at Exelon and they largely extend through 2012. I've included a list of those banks in the appendix today's presentation. As of October 20th, 2008 Exelon had only a $160 million drawn under these facilities and letters of credit outstanding of $347 million leaving an aggregate of $6.8 billion of the total $7.3 billion of capacity available to us. This liquidity allows us to execute our hedging strategies, invest in our generation fleet, and our transmission and distribution systems, and to meet our dividend commitments without disruption. Turning to slide 13, we will see the scheduled debt maturities that are forecasted to occur during the remainder of the fourth quarter of 2008, and the full year of 2009. Excluding securitized debt which is repaid through customer collected revenues, Exelon and its subsidiaries have only $29 million of debt in total maturing through September 30th 2008 to December 31st 2009. I'll conclude by reiterating that Exelon's financial health is very strong. We manage the business for the long-term by appropriately managing risks, and position the company to successfully navigate through times like these. We continue to operate the business well. We employ rigorous risk management practices including diligently executing our hedging program, and actively managing counterparty exposure. We are committed to investment grade ratings and strong balance sheet metrics. We are distinctive in our ability to generate significant cash flows from our operations. We have $7.3 billion in aggregate bank commitments under a credit line that extend largely through 2012 and we face no new debt maturities through the end of next year. When taking all of these factors into account, I view Exelon's financial health as extremely strong. And with that I'll turn the call back over to Chaka.
Chaka Patterson - Investor Relations: Thank you Matt. Operator we are ready for questions. Question And Answer
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Also I would like to remind everyone to please limit questions to one and one follow-up. Your first question comes from the Jonathan Arnold with Merrill Lynch.
Jonathan Arnold - Merrill Lynch: Good morning.
John W. Rowe - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning Jonathan.
Jonathan Arnold - Merrill Lynch: I would like to ask question on pensions and on decommissioning funds and specifically, if you have any kind of early sense of whether you might trigger funding requirements in 2009? And may be just some kind of reminder of how that works on the decommissioning side. I notice the balance sheet number, looks like it was... it's down by about just under a $1 billion since the beginning of the year on asset side. So, just if we could get some clarity around that would be very helpful. Thank you.
Matthew F. Hilzinger - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Chief Financial Officer, Generation: Jonathan, this is Mathew on the line. I'll take a crack at that. As you know, we have done a lot of work on this. We have talked to our investors about this earlier in the year. Our assets are down... significantly... were down in the pension plan by about 30%, which is just a little bit over $3 billion. When we look at the unfunded position of the pension plan at yearend 2007, it was about $750 million. Our best estimate right now and this is a bit rough because obviously we need to get through the fourth quarter but we are looking at an unfunded pension liability of somewhere around $2.5 billion. And as far as it will depend on happens with the rest of... what happens in the market through the rest of fourth quarter at hand with discount rates all through we did apply [ph]. I want to remind you as well that about 40% of that is attributable to the two utilities at about 60% is attributable to the Generation company. When looking at 2009, we expect the cash contribution to be somewhere around $225 million which is roughly what our contribution was in 2008. Obviously we can't predict what's going to happen in 2010 and 2011. We need to go through and see what happens ultimately with the market and that 2010, 2011 may be what we predicted about by that. So, overall I think we are... can't resist what happens but there is not a big impact from a cash flow basis for 2009. I have talked in the past about the cost side of the expense side and we've said in the past that we've contemplated an increase in the expense as GAAP requires and that's reflected in our flat earnings from 2008 to 2009. However, it kind of puts pressure if there is continued market declines like you have seen today. Let me take a minute just to talk a little bit about the Decommission trust. They are fully funded on a GAAP basis. So, if you take a look at the decommissioning liability on our balance sheet compared to the assets that we have...in our view energy they are fully funded on a GAAP basis. And we don't see a big risk for 2009 of having the assets go below the liability which would cause us to recognize expense on the legacy ComEd and PECO plants. So, little bit different for AmerGen, which I can get into, if you would like. The assets are down about $800 million from where they were at year-end. As you may know the NRC regulations require that we provide reasonable assurance for a minimum funding level to be available when we ultimately decommission the plants. They go through by annual reports the next report is in March. Based on kind of our review, we believe that there are some reasonable remedies that we can take before we're going to be required to put cash in. One remedy is just taking with the NRC and explaining our view in position but that there is also remedies around providing letters of creditor or parental [ph] guarantees. So there is a number of things that we can look at. And we'll look at and forward with the four, we look at putting cash into those particular plants.
Jonathan Arnold - Merrill Lynch: Can I just, are you at a point where you would need to put cash or come up with some other arrangement... and where those maybe kind of evaluate on the non-accounting basis with contributions now or are you not there.
Matthew F. Hilzinger - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Chief Financial Officer, Generation: In terms of the NRC?
Jonathan Arnold - Merrill Lynch: Yes.
Matthew F. Hilzinger - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Chief Financial Officer, Generation: I don't think we are there yet I think there is still... we have not gone through that dialogue with the NRC, and we need to go to that dialogue. But as I said, I think there are reasonable remedies for us to go through before we put in cash.
Jonathan Arnold - Merrill Lynch: Right, okay. Thanks for all detailed analysis. It's very helpful.
Chaka Patterson - Investor Relations: Okay. The next question operator.
Operator: Your next question is from John Kiani with Deutsche Bank Securities.
John W. Rowe - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Hi John.
John Kiani - Deutsche Bank Securities: Hello, can you hear me?
John W. Rowe - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes John.
John Kiani - Deutsche Bank Securities: Can you provide an update on the backstop financing for the proposed NRG acquisition and where that stands?
John W. Rowe - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well, we continue to do as we suggested, we would do on our Monday call and that is to pursue bank financing. We make very serious progress with these three major financial institutions. It is not yet at the commitment letter stage, but I think we're getting there. Obviously the chaos in the world financial market is slowing isn't making anyone happier, but I think we're getting there. We also intend to response to this suggestions that one of the bond holders made on the Monday call that we talked to the bond holders. So I think we will have two or three possible ways to deal with that issue.
John Kiani - Deutsche Bank Securities: Okay and then as far as the credit rating down rate that Matt Hilzinger brought up in his prepared remarks. It sounds like S&P down rated you all sort of right out of the box one notch that perhaps that may have been sooner than you all had anticipated and understanding that you only have one more notch at Exelon Generation from BBB flat to BBB minus with a credit watch negative on your outlook on the company right now from SNP. I mean what you're level of comfort that you'll be able to remain investment grade at Exelon Generation, which to me seems like it's a critical sort of a binary point and whether you could even pursue this transaction or not?
John W. Rowe - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: We agree it's a critical point. We'll have full scale presentations for S&P in the other rating agencies next week. We're confident that the numbers show that we should remain investment grade and as Matt said in several different ways that perhaps I can get thing accent on the goal [ph] even stronger. We are absolutely committed to remaining investment grade. You described the scenario exactly. We anticipated these results that only upon closing we had not been led to anticipate them at this time. And I think this just suggests how the general turmoil in the market and the criticism, the rating agencies have received over the financial institutions are breathing again a new wave of conservatism and hurried to act. But we will cope with that by making our cases strongly as we can and I believe it will succeed.
John Kiani - Deutsche Bank Securities: And then one last question on that same line, do you have a sense for what natural gas price the rating agencies may want to assume or you want to assume in running those scenarios for them and that obviously would make a big difference in what the credit metrics look like versus a standalone and combined companies?
John W. Rowe - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I mean I believe at least one of them is planning to put out its assumptions in the near future, but we haven't seen those assumptions yet. So I don't know what they're going to assume. We have... we are preparing for part of the analysis we intend to take on the road show, some sort of bounding assumptions that illustrates how this transaction adds value under a fairly wide degree of natural gas price assumptions.
John Kiani - Deutsche Bank Securities: Okay thanks, John.
John W. Rowe - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Good to be able to see you. Thank you.
Chaka Patterson - Investor Relations: Next question please.
Operator: Your next question is from Hugh Wynne with Sanford Bernstein.
Hugh Wynne - Sanford Bernstein: Good morning and a regarding the disclosure on page 13 of your release, the one that tiled Exelon generation statistics. You ...you make the... you disclosed there that the average purchase power and fuel cost per megawatt hour apparently rose by about almost $7 from the average in the second quarter. And looking at your fuel cost for the third quarter, it appears that it's up by about 40% from the like quarter of last year, and especially up about 100% from the second quarter. So, I was wondering if you could maybe explain to me the variation in fuel cost over this relatively short period of time.
John W. Rowe - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Ken Cornew has the response to that. Ken, are you on?
Kenneth W. Cornew - Senior Vice President, Exelon Corporation; President, Exelon Power Team: Yes, I am John, thanks. And thanks for the question. Let me first say that Exelon Generation is very comfortable with our margin performance in the third quarter. As you probably know, the two components, the revenue line and the cross line act very differently for Exelon Generation. On the revenue line, our revenues are very heavily influenced by annual sales, and that have consistent prices across the year. An example being our contractors to supply energy to PECO, another example would be block product sales we make on a calendar basis. So our revenue line remains more constant across the year because of our sale of power across the year at fixed prices. When we get to the cost line, the story is a little different. The cost line is much more driven by seasonal generation operation and seasonal purchased power to optimize the cost of the portfolio and optimize the cost of the products we sell. So in the summer, we are running higher price generation. You know fuel prices ran up pretty aggressively in the second quarter and that the cost of generation essentially ran up at the same time. We're serving load following products so we need to run higher price generation, so that cost line from that perspective is going to move up seasonally with how demand responds. We also are more likely to buy monthly power and buy monthly purchase power to again optimize the cost of the product. It may very well be that, it's cheaper to buy monthly power products than actually run higher cost generation to serve low volume products. So, this margin change between the second and third quarter, the cost change and the revenue line are very expected for us and make sense given our sales line is influenced by calendar sales, our cost line is much more influenced by seasonal purchased power, and seasonal generation operations.
Hugh Wynne - Sanford Bernstein: All right.Thank you. Just a quick follow on question then on your other income line, under other net, you're showing a negative number of $256 million for the first nine months of 2008, other net in the first nine months of 2007 was $224 million positive. So you got a swing there of something like I guess 480 million, what are the key drivers of that?
John W. Rowe - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I think you are referring to the decommissioning for AmerGen, Hugh and there are...it's basically the unrealized losses that we have for the AmerGen. As you recall we carved out from our operating earnings, unrealized gains and unrealized losses. The AmerGen trust and the AmerGen plans we bear there all the funding requirements should be there all of the downside risk and we also get all the upside risk in the market. What we have done is we've just reflected the fair value of the assets related to those trucks for AmerGen and so we have carved about $200 million unrealized losses to the extent over time through the normal churn, those unrealized losses become realized because they sell the securities. Those would find their way to our operating earnings. But there is also the opportunity that those will recover overtime and we won't bear those costs through our operating earnings.
Hugh Wynne - Sanford Bernstein: Great. Thank you very much.
John W. Rowe - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Next question please.
Operator: Your next question is from Greg Gordon with Citi.
John W. Rowe - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning Greg.
Greg Gordon - Citigroup: While we have some more clarity in Pennsylvania vis-à-vis the legislation that was passed, but the issue of rate mitigation is still out there. Was there an opportunity to resolve that in this legislative session? What were the impediments that have been... in hindsight to that getting resolved and what's your best guess as to when we'll finally get closer on those uncertainties in Pennsylvania?
John W. Rowe - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I am not able to make an educated guess as to when that will be. Governor Randall made a very statesman like effort to pull all this together at the end of the session. I...since the major impediments to do it were partially party politics in the legislature and partially that different utilities had different perspectives as to what their interest required. My own sense is that this issue will continue to come up in every session of the legislature until some solution has been made. And again, while I don't know where all of the elements of the solution will be. My best guess continues to be a statewide cost...something on the level of the statewide cost in Illinois. But that is a guess and it's not a commitment on the part of anyone.
Hugh Wynne - Sanford Bernstein: Thank you John.
John W. Rowe - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Next question is from Paul Peterson with Glenrock associates.
John W. Rowe - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, Paul.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates: Good morning. I wanted to follow-up on the stock buyback. Has any of these stock buyback been done at all?
John W. Rowe - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: It has not.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates: Okay. And from listening to the Monday's call and from reading the release, its sounds me like the buyback, what has happened even if the NRG VO didn't take place and...
John W. Rowe - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: The main I think is that the suspension of the buyback would have happened anyway. Correct, Matt.
Matthew F. Hilzinger - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Chief Financial Officer, Generation: I believe that is true, Paul.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates: Okay, what I was sort of wondering is since the NRG deal seems to be credit negative more than stock buyback is if the NRG deal was to go away, why wouldn't the buyback particularly if stock prices were at that, not take place?
John W. Rowe - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well, the answer is the one we gave officially on Monday because of the general state of the credit markets, because of the general state of the economy, so on and so forth. I mean the distinction here is the distinction between financial engineering and the acquisition of real assets. We think our proposal for NRG brings more real assets into Exelon at a price that allows us to achieve both some short terms earnings accretion and substantial long term value add. It's the difference between what we think is only a short term earnings improvement and what we think is a long term fundamental improvement in the value of the corporation.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates: Okay, Thanks for the color.
John W. Rowe - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Chaka Patterson - Investor Relations: Next question please.
Operator: Your next question is from Leslie Rich from Columbia Management.
John W. Rowe - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning Leslie.
Leslie Rich - Columbia Management: Good morning. As you look at your bad debt expense at both PECO and ComEd, do you have any regulatory mechanisms to recover that either in sort of some sort of true up mechanism or can you lump it into next rate case or is that money that's just non-recoverable?
John W. Rowe - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I think basically non-recoverable but let me ask first Denis O'Brien from PECO and then Bob McDonald from ComEd to give you a detailed answer to that.
Denis P. O'Brien - Executive Vice President, Exelon Corporation; President and CEO, PECO Energy: This is Denis O'Brien. In Pennsylvania the only way to recover it is through a filed rate case and so until that time we are eating the expense.
Robert K. McDonald - Subsidiary Senior Vice President/Chief Financial Officer, Subsidiary/Other Executive Officer: The same answer would be to true in ComEd in that we have to file a rate case. You'd have to see the bad debt expense in the future period.
Leslie Rich - Columbia Management: Okay.
John W. Rowe - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Not a happy answer but a clear one.
Leslie Rich - Columbia Management: Thank you.
John W. Rowe - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Next question please.
Operator: Your next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.
John W. Rowe - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Hi Michael.
Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs: Good morning. Question on your hedging really two fold, one wasn't on the major change in your hedging for kind of 2010 or anything beyond. How do you think about your hedging strategy given a little bit of the uncertainty in Pennsylvania because you usually rolled forward hedges kind of every three years and like how do plan on doing that over the next six to nine months and do you have any in Pennsylvania?
John W. Rowe - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Ken Cornew?.
Kenneth W. Cornew - Senior Vice President, Exelon Corporation; President, Exelon Power Team: Yes, sure. Thanks Mike for the question. Yes as you are aware we roll our hedging program, we continue to hedge in forward months primarily focusing on getting to 90% or better figure in the upcoming year. Our target has been 50% to 70% in the year following and getting to 50% level in the year following that... I am sorry, 70% to 90% a year following and 50% to 70% in the year following that. So, we continue with that program. Obviously when we look at PECO's contract rolling off, that makes the amount of activity that we are interested in looking at for hedging larger in 2011, we are still sitting in 2008 and have a good amount of time to get to where we want to be on our planning and we are very comfortable again with the position we are in from a hedging perspective in 2009, 10 and 11. Not a real change in how we are thinking about it, the change really is the volume and the amount of hedging we will have to do here in the east, as Pennsylvania develops its plans for procurement and PECO does the same.
Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs: Okay. And just kind of real follow up... real quick follow up. How does the kind of the timeline of the NRG potential transaction impact the timeline for when you might implement hedging?
Kenneth W. Cornew - Senior Vice President, Exelon Corporation; President, Exelon Power Team: Right now Michael, it's not an impact. We were looking at our hedging program based on Exelon assets and should something more significant happen on the NRG side, we'll consider it.
Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs: Got it, thank you guys, much appreciated.
John W. Rowe - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you. Next question.
Operator: Your next question is from Paul Fremont with Jefferies.
Paul Fremont - Jefferies & Co: Thanks, I guess I heard Matt that, you sort of reiterated the expectations for a flat earnings profile next year. And I guess I'm wondering, you've already indicated the loss of the share repurchase program, which is roughly I guess in the range of a dime. You are looking at the potential for lower usage on the part of utility customers, a fairly weak commodity pricing environment. Can you give us some of the... and those have seemed to be more recent in terms of the third quarter call, what are some of the positive that would offset that?
John W. Rowe - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I assumeall of the risk factors that you named are relevant and bring with... Matt calls pressure and I call stress. But Chris is putting together our budget efforts as we speak. I think by the time you see us at the EEI Financial Conference, we'll have a real numerical range to give you. I continue to believe that by squeezing in a number of places on cost, both on the capital and the O&M side that we will find a way to keep these earnings flat. But we'll give you a better numerical range as soon as we can. This is why we announced a few weeks ago that we have asked Chris and Matt to lead a new cost reduction effort. We have been absolutely committed in these companies to putting the best money into our nuclear fleet we can, rebuilding the reliability of both deliveries systems. And I think those efforts have to leave us with some room for further cost reductions when customer demand growth is slumping and so we're out hunting and I think we can finally not to at least offset some of the risk factors you've mentioned. At the same time I would say that the hedging program is obviously terribly important here. Ken has a significant portion of Genco's revenues for next year relatively fixed. Putting all this into a slightly different language, we know there is more pressure than opportunity in '09 in the kind of the economy we are looking at. I leave it to you to decide we are resilient to deal with that pressure is, but I think its here.
Paul Fremont - Jefferies & Co: So if I heard you correctly the company plans on giving '09 guidance at the EEI conference.
John W. Rowe - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: That's it, that's correct. You heard that correctly.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you.
John W. Rowe - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Next question please.
Operator: Your next question is from Annie Saul [ph] with Alliance Bernstein.
John W. Rowe - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Unidentified Analyst: Good morning everyone. My question is the follow-up after Leslie. Bad debt expense question is, you did indicate that you see in the fourth quarter that the expense should be ... would be higher. If both PECO and ComEd. And if we go through the recession for next year what kind of trend then we should be forecasting in our model then for the bad debt?
Matthew F. Hilzinger - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Chief Financial Officer, Generation: This is Matt Hilzinger. In the fourth quarter we're looking at somewhere around I would say $0.02 to $0.04 in terms of kind of bad debt, which is really kind of in line with our expectation that we had in the third quarter for what we thought would happen in the fourth quarter. Clearly there is some pressure that we're seeing from the economy and as John alluded to we're looking at a relation to our guidance and I think I'll let you guys take a stab at least initially in terms of what you think may happen in terms of bad debt. But clearly I think its going to be a bit higher than it has been on a historical level, albeit you have to normalize PECO, because I think PECO's had a normally high bad debt expense in relation to some of the issue from their cut-offs. And, their systems conversion.
John W. Rowe - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Denis do you want to add anything to what Matt just said.
Denis P. O'Brien - Executive Vice President, Exelon Corporation; President and CEO, PECO Energy: The only thing I would add is, I think we've got a good program here in terms of both guarding the front door... the new system allows us a much more capability than our old system. We think we have the reserve in about the right place and we don't see our uncollectible expenses are very much different in the fourth quarter of this year from the fourth quarter of last year.
John W. Rowe - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you Denis.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you.
Chaka Patterson - Investor Relations: Last question operator.
Operator: Your last question comes from the line of Rick Hayden [ph] with Deutsche Assets.
Unidentified Analyst: Yes, thank you.
John W. Rowe - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, Dick.
Unidentified Analyst: Good morning, well, John, thank you very much for highlighting the strength of the company and also the dividend. That always kind of reinsures the strength of the company. Have you heard from NRG at all on their response?
John W. Rowe - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: We have not.
Unidentified Analyst: Oh I see. And this question about bad debt, when you said it is unrecoverable, did you say that you're not going to try to recover it in the next rate case or you just forego it or you will still have a--?
John W. Rowe - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Let me state what I believe the right answer is Rick. Anne Pramaggiore or Bob McDonald who are watching over me here can correct me if I misstate, but I think I have data. There is no revolving procedure for this bad debt expense of either retail company. So, all you can do is basically put it in a test year in a future rate case and try to get it going forward. But that's not the same as recovering what you lost this year. Did I state that correctly Anne?
Anne R. Pramaggiore - Executive VP, Divisional: Yes, I think. What Leslie was probably alluding to is do we have a rider that allows us to capture some of these cost between rate cases and we do not. So, what that means is we go in for the next rate case and we lay out our bad debt and our senses will gravitate towards a future rate case the next time around what our estimates will be on bad debt and put that in front of the Commission.
Unidentified Analyst: So does mean that this not like a fuel cost recovery that you recover later on you have still have to make a case for it.
Anne R. Pramaggiore - Executive VP, Divisional: That's right.
John W. Rowe - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: You've exactly right Rick.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, thank you.
John W. Rowe - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Rick, Thank you.
John W. Rowe - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: All right. Thank you, operator. That concludes our call.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect. .

Operator: Good morning. My name is Shauvana, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Exelon Corporation Second Quarter 2008 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Chaka Patterson. Sir you may begin your conference.
Chaka Patterson - Vice President, Investor Relations: Thank you. Good morning. Welcome to Exelon second quarter 2008 earnings review and conference call update. Thank you for joining us today. We issued our earnings release this morning. If you haven't receive it, the release is available on the Exelon website at www.exeloncorp.com or you can call Dolores Munguia at 312-394-5222 and she will fax or email the release to you. Before we begin today's discussion, let me remind you that the earnings release and other matters we discussed in today's call contains forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties, as well as adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings. Please refer to today's 8-K and our other SEC filings for discussions of factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts and expectations, and for reconciliation of operating earnings to GAAP earnings. Leading the call today are John Rowe, Exelon's Chairman, President and CEO, and Matthew Hilzinger, Exelon's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by other members of Exelon's Senior Management team, who will be available to answer your questions. We have scheduled 50 minutes for this call. Please limit yourself to one question. With that, I will now turn the call over to John Rowe, Exelon's CEO.
John W. Rowe - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Chaka. As you saw from our earnings release this morning, we had a very strong second quarter with both operating and GAAP earnings at $1.13 a share, compared to $1.03 for the second quarter of 2007. Our earnings in the second quarter make up, for the higher level of planned and unplanned nuclear outage days that we experienced in the first quarter, and we discussed those outages at that time. The second quarter puts us squarely on track with respect to our earnings for the year. We are comfortably reaffirming our operating earnings guidance for 2008 of $4 to $4.40 a share, and our GAAP earnings guidance range of $3.70 to $4.10 a share. Second quarter makes us very confident of where we are in that range. Turning to Slide 3 on your deck. We achieved these second quarter results precisely because we are sticking on plan and implementing our, protect and growth strategy. This is not a strategy for a quarter or even for a year. It's what we were doing last year and it's what we will be doing next year. We are aimed at long-term value, as we have been since our formation. Starting on the left hand side of this page, the first and foremost thing that we do is to deliver superior operating performance. In the second quarter, Chris Crane and his team achieved a nuclear capacity factor out 95.8% and that performance drives the profits we have delivered to you. We achieved a commercial availability of 92.8% at our fossil fleet and nuclear availability factor of 94.4%, at our hydro fleet. We kept the lights on under difficult conditions. With seven storms June 2008, marks the busiest storm month in a decade. Frank Clark, Barry Mitchell and the ComEd team, should be very proud of the speed with which ComEd cruise completed restoration efforts in June. I remember right they had something like 700,000 customers out in different storms over the period of the month. ComEd also completed its West Loop Project, a more than $300 million project which converted a large part of the city's electric transmission system from a “hub and spoke” to a network model, and thereby substantially reduces the likelihood of significant losses of power downtown and in Chicago neighborhoods. PECO did not have as many storms, but it had one very violent storm last month that caused damage and affected about 200,000 PECO customers. PECO crews restored service to more than half of the customers within the first 10 hours. PECO also completed its critical infrastructure projects to insure meet select PECO electric demand during the summer and PECO has been handling very high temperatures in Philadelphia over the last week and doing it very well indeed. As you all know the value of Exelon depends on our ability to protect competitive markets and to make those markets worth. By competitive markets we mean markets in which generators like Exelon Generation receives market prices for electricity, markets which come to plays an economy value on carbon emissions to ensure a reduction in greenhouse gases. Markets where all power suppliers receive equal and fair treatment and markets, where electric generators are able to recover the investments they make to meet future energy needs. Our competitive markets allow us to deliver substantial value now and will allow us to increase that value in 2011 and subsequent years, when PECO goes to market as well. Let me remind you of our earnings profile between now and then. We are a commodity price driven company and we are a company that tries to hedge on a period several years forward. As you recall, we had a significant increase in earnings from 2006 to 2007 as our Midwest fleet transition to market prices and we enjoyed an extraordinary nuclear performance. In 2008 and 2009, we are almost fully hedged. There is both good news and bad news in that. The good news of course is that the recent fall off in prices does not affect our earnings very much in this two year period. The bad news is of course that we didn't benefit as much in the very short-term from the rise in prices in the few months to proceed that. That's what a good hedging policy does. As a result, you can expect our near-term earnings to be relatively flat. We are expecting to benefit from rising power prices, both energy and capacity in 2010, where we are less hedged and in 211, where we are largely unhedged. As a result, we expect a significant earnings increase in 2011, driven by higher market prices for our generation, the transition to market in Pennsylvania and continued progress in achieving a fair return at ComEd. We remain committed to building healthy self sustaining delivery companies. As you know PECO has been doing well. ComEd has had inadequate earnings. We started the process of fixing that a year ago. ComEd filed the ST case last fall; on July 10 the ALJ issued a proposed order. This proposed order represents suggested findings for the commission. We do not know what, to what extent the commission may adopt the original stipulation, we reached with the commissions staff or to what extent it will defer to the ALJ order. The proposed order recommended a revenue requirement increase of $218 million compared to ComEd's revised request of $345 million and a return on equity of 10.3%. The proposed orders supported ComEd's original filing to include pro forma capital additions in rate case. The inclusion of pro forma capital additions and rate base is important for managing regulatory lag and for continuing to lay the groundwork for future testier. In addition, the ALJs were supportive of the capital structure proposed by ComEd and did not propose large write-offs rate base. We are however still of the belief that a number of more like the stipulated amount with the staff better reflects the record and the ComEd team continues to pursue that result. In reaching the proposed order, the ALJs evaluated the individual positions of ComEd's case as opposed to broadly accepting this stipulation. ComEd has the opportunity to share its views on the ALJ's proposed order and is briefed some exceptions, which it will file tomorrow. We expect to receive the ICC's final order by September 15th. The result in this case should represent progress to our deal in ComEd we still do not know how much progress it will be. Turning to Pennsylvania, PECO has been engaged in discussions with the other utilities, the General Assembly and the Rendell administration, about Pennsylvania's energy policy and the transition to market based wholesale rates. We continue to look forward to these discussions when the General Assembly returns in September and we will be working with the Governor's office and with legislative leaders. In the interim, PECO expects to file its energy procurement program. Moving to the growth side of the map, we have reinforced our commitment to setting the industry standard for low-carbon energy generation and delivery with our recently announced low-carbon energy plant, Exelon 2020: A Low-Carbon Roadmap. I am very proud of this document because it shows the most efficient ways to meet carbon requirements. It lays out a set of guidelines for Exelon to take cost efficient steps to do this, and I believe it will create additional earnings opportunities for the company. Exelon 2020 represents what I believe to be the first comprehensive plant in the utility industry to reduce, offset or displace more than 15 million metrics tons of greenhouse gas emissions by 2020. That is more than our total annual carbon footprint and is equivalent to taking nearly 3 million cars off the highway. We will reach this goal in three ways; reducing or offsetting our own carbon footprints, helping our customers and the communities we serve reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, and offering more low-carbon electricity in the marketplace. I would like to be very clear, as we said in the press release. It is very important that Exelon not be simply a price taker on its nuclear fleet. It's very important to you, our shareholders that we'll be out there helping to solve up problems of our community and this is the plan to do just like that. We currently estimate that the total cost to implement the potential greenhouse gas abatement initiative described in this plan, live over the 12 years in something in excess of $10 billion. About 80% to 85% of that cost would be initiatives such as nuclear power upgrades, natural gas plants and renewable generation. The remaining 15% to 20% is largely associated with measures to offset emissions and to help our customers, things like the ComEd energy efficiency programs. These estimates do not include the cost associated with the new nuclear plant if we decided to go on. Actual expenditures will depend on both quality development and our project-by-project economic decisions. We are keeping the rigor we'll try to develop for a long time as we look at these projects. Our cash for discretionary investments continue to include the IRR Analysis, you all come to expect and an evaluation of alternative uses of capital including share buybacks. I would like to be very clear, our value return policy remains fully in force. This plan does not change the commitment we made to you about value return. Our Protect and Grow strategy has served the company and our investors, very well. I'm absolutely certain it will continue to do so. Whereas, we look at the quarter we have just finished, it is very strong quarter and positions us very nicely for the whole year. I have to say that we watch as anyone would, what happens in the market this morning. It's obvious, that something here is worrying you and if you will ask questions about it, we'll do our best to answer them because we see this is as a very good quarter and a very good first half. And we see 2008 as being another very good year for Exelon. I'll now turn the call over to Matt Hilzinger.
Matthew F. Hilzinger - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thank you, John. Good morning everyone. We have provided a significant amount of detail regarding our results in our earnings release in the accompanying tables. Therefore, I'll spend my time this morning discussing the results for the quarter, in addition to providing updates on power markets, our hedging strategy and Exelon's financial strength. Starting with our current quarter results on Slide 4, we reported operating earnings of a $1.13 per share in the second quarter of 2008, compared to $1.03 in the second quarter of 2007. The quarter-over-quarter increase reflects in increase in earnings at Exelon Generation partially offset by decrease in PECO earnings. ComEd results were also down slightly quarter-over-quarter. Let me cover these in more detail. Turning to Slide 5, you'll see that the key drivers for Exelon Generation's quarter-over-quarter higher operating earnings. As John mentioned, Generation had a greater, had a great quarter from an operational perspective. In terms of plant refueling outage days, Generation had 40 days in the second quarter of 2008 as compared to 55 days in the second quarter of 2007. Non-refueling outages days were down by 15 days quarter-over-quarter, as we had only three in the second quarter of this year as compared to 18 in the second quarter of last year. In addition, the average margins realized by our Generation output were close to $5 per megawatt hour higher on average in the second quarter of 2008, as compared to the second quarter of 2007. Generation's second quarter 2008 also reflects income from proprietary trading activities of $0.07 per share compared to $0.03 last year. These trading results were driven by certain long option positions within our trading portfolio that were acquired years ago. During the quarter we realized income from some of these options as current market conditions allowed us to capitalize on our position. From a risk management standpoint, these option positions have limited downside risk and extend for several more years. Future income from these options is solely dependent on future market conditions. Given the volatility in the marketplace, future income around these option positions is highly uncertain. And let me remind you that our proprietary trading activities have not and should not be a significant earnings driver for Generation on an annual basis. We have very tight risk management policy and practices around these activities. Generation's results also reflect income of about $0.04 per share associated with the legal settlement of uranium supply contract in default heading back to 2006. In terms of securing a reliable supply of uranium for a nuclear fleet, this particular contract was small relative to Generation's overall uranium supply mix. We do not anticipate additional defaults of uranium supply contracts going forward. In general, the number of buyers and sellers of uranium is limited, making the relationships between large buyers and sellers very strategic partnerships. We are not aware of any other uranium supplier defaults since 2006. The risk of future default of other uranium supply contracts is also mitigated by recent declines in the spot price of uranium, which is currently at about $63 per pound compared to the peak levels of $130 per pound in 2007. Turning now to Slide 6. I will discuss two items that have been the subject of much interest likely: heat rates and our risk management and hedging practices. As you can see from the graphs on slide 6 and 7, which are current through July 18, 2008 for heat rate to decline from their recent highs in December of 2007. With sharp increases in gas prices through the end of June and power prices rising at a slower rate, market-implied heat rates were driven lower during the first half of the year. In July, heat rates have been relatively flat, while natural gas prices have declined. First, we are seeing a tightening of liquidity in the power markets. This could be caused by couple of factors: the fall-off from the recent tightening of capital markets has caused financial institutions to reduce their participation and power trading. And the lack of defined procurement structures for distribution companies in some states has reduced the amount of power trading in the other years. Second, implied for heat rates are being influenced by what is happening in the spot market. In 2007, when the spot heat rates increased over prior years, forward heat rates followed suit. In 2008, spot heat rates have fallen and forward heat rates have followed the downward trend. It is important to remember, however, that our large nuclear generation portfolio is more leveraged the power prices than heat rates. Looking at Slide 6, forward power prices at PJM West Hub are higher on a year-to-date basis for both 2009 and 2010. 2009 forward power prices at Ni-Hub are slightly higher than the beginning of year levels, whereas 2010 forward prices have retreated below beginning of year levels, which can be attributed to many of the reasons I discussed that are driving the market implied heat rates lower year-to-date. In addition, two weeks ago the U.S. DC Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the Bush administration's Clean Air Interstate Rule, which I will refer to as the CAIR rule. Following the Court's ruling, activity in NOx and SO2 trading markets diminished dramatically and forward off-peak prices in Ni-Hub have recently been pressed lower. Uncertainty around regulating emissions will persist until avenues for rehearing of the Court's opinion and perhaps a petition with the U.S. Supreme Court are pursued and exhausted. In the near term, the uncertainty will be reflected in off-peak power prices. In our view the longer-term reality is that some from of NOx and SO2 regulation will no doubt occur either through an EPA regulatory proceeding and/or Congressional action. Power prices should eventually move to reflect the cost to compliance. In the short term, our hedging program protects us against these downward movements in prices. Based upon current market prices, we do not expect the Circuit Court's decision to vacate the CAIR rule to have a material impact to our earnings in 2008 or 2009. Let me take a little bit of time and expand on our hedging practices. As I have described before, our financial hedging targets are derived from an integrated planning process that allows us to have secured cash flows in order to meet our operating needs, capital investment needs, debt service and dividend commitments for a period of time on its market volatility. Our hedging program is integrated within our operations and it is how we manage the business. For 2008, we around 96% financially hedged. For 2009, our target is to be between 70% and 90% financially hedged, and we are at very top end of that range. Given that we are at 96% hedged in 2008 and at the top end of our hedging range for 2009, we do not expect the benefit substantially from higher power prices or to suffer from lower power prices in the near-term. We would expect to benefit from higher power prices in 2010 and to a much greater extent 2011 because our portfolio is largely un-hedged in that year. Turning to ComEd, you've already heard from John, on the status of ComEd's distribution rate case. So I'll briefly touch on ComEd's results for the second quarter. On Slide 8, you will see the key drivers of ComEd's quarter-over-quarter results, with the most significant drivers being increased transmission revenues partially offset by higher storm costs. Turning now to PECO, on Slide 9, you will see the key drivers of PECO's quarter-over-quarter decline in operating earnings, including the scheduled increase in PECO's CTC amortization. PECO's results were also driven lower quarter-over-quarter, due to higher levels of expense for uncollectible accounts, principally related to residential customers. The additional expense reflects an increasing risk of uncollectible accounts evidence by changes in the aging of PECO's accounts receivable book balances and customer account charge-offs. In part, this is a result of a suspension of collection activities during our billing system conversion project. We have also seen a growth in low-income customer assistance programs which results in the eventual forgiveness of certain outstanding account balances. We are not pleased with the increased levels of write-offs associated with the agency and also we are taking the issue very seriously. PECO management has initiated several actions to address this increasing level of its uncollectible accounts. Given the economic challenges faced by our customers, it is hard to predict future expense with precision. However, we are forecasting bad debt expense for the second quarter of 2008 to be comparable to the second half of 2007, which is approximately $50 million. Moving to Slide 10, I'd like to provide my perspective on our financial position as we move into the second half of 2008. In short, our financial position is in terrific shape. First, our operations, market fundamentals, and competitive position remained very strong. Our second quarter results to the $1.13 per share were $0.10 higher than last year, largely driven by strong nuclear operations and improving market fundamentals, and in part by some discrete items. Like the US economy, the economies in and around Chicago and Philadelphia are weaker this year. We have seen some degree of slower than forecasted low growth at ComEd and PECO, especially during the last two months. We do not expect at this point that the slowing economy in the US will have the significant impact on Exelon's 2008 earnings. However, we will continue to closely monitor the potential effects of a slowing economy on our operations. Second, we are keeping a careful watch on our O&M cost and capital spending. Year-to-date, our own O&M costs and capital have tracked closely with our expectations. But we are beginning to see inflationary pressures grow across all of our operating companies. Last fall, we told you that we expected to see a 2% to 3% compounded annual growth rate in operating O&M cost from 2008 to 2012. We are now expecting to see our O&M costs grow at a compounded annual growth rate of around 4% during this time period, this reflects inflationary pressures on costs that we and others in the industry are seeing. Third, we have an increasingly strong cash flow profile. We are expecting to generate about $5 billion of cash flows from operations this year. This is about $500 million higher than our original planning assumptions. It is primarily due to the tax planning opportunities that I mentioned on our first quarter earnings call. Lastly, I'll briefly mention the strength of our balance sheet liquidity. We are committed to maintaining strong investment-grade ratings supported by strong product countries. We continue to have ample liquidity and sufficient access to short and long term capital at reasonable terms, given the credit ratings for our respective issuers. We also have credit facilities in place aggregating over $7 billion largely extending through 2012. During the second quarter, Fitch provides the ratings outlook for Exelon Generation from stable to positive and affirms the outstanding ratings of Exelon, ComEd and PECO. Fitch's positive ratings outlooks reflects the leverage, interest coverage and profitability measures that are strong for the rating and compare favorably to the peer group. When considering all of these financial metrics, I view our financial condition to be very strong and we are well positioned to withstand a weakening economy. Turning to guidance, and as John mentioned earlier, we are reaffirming Exelon's non-GAAP operating earnings guidance range for 2008 at $4 to $4.40 per share and Exelon's GAAP guidance range for 2008 at $3.70 to $4.10 per share. At the start of 2007 we explained to you that the, profile Exelon's quarterly earnings to change and that the distribution of earnings would be less due to the summer months for our third quarter, this helped through for 2007 and continues to hold through for 2008. On a fourth quarter earnings call in January, I indicated that our third quarter earnings would likely represent 26% to 29% of our full year 2008 operating, and we iterating that range today. And with that I'll turn the call back to you John.
John W. Rowe - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Matt. Operator we're ready for questions. QUESTION AND ANSWER
Operator: At this time the floor is now opened for questions. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is coming from John Kiani with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
John Kiani - Deutsche Bank Securities: Good morning.
John W. Rowe - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, John.
John Kiani - Deutsche Bank Securities: I'm trying to understand a little bit more about the value return policy and the timing of it. I appreciate the fact that you obviously give that a very diligent and thorough review on an annual basis…I'm kind of wondering with the stock down here where it is effectively lower than it was 7 or 8 months ago, but with natural gas prices even despite the recent pullback still up 20% to 25% from that timeframe and coal prices up still a 100% from that timeframe. Why the company wouldn't think about being more opportunistic especially with the balance sheet that Exelon has and looking at a buyback today based on…the advantages of the current market conditions affords that?
John W. Rowe - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, I think when look but the adjustment in price you talked about is something it's about a week old. And one doesn't want to change one plan too dramatically just because of what a nervous stock market does in a week, but we are already in the second half and we will keep looking both at when and how much. I mean there is the buyback issue which you all know is in our plans. There is a dividend increase issue and we want to do those in an orderly way being opportunistic is a good thing, but moving billions…billion dollars or moreover, overnight is something you take a little carefully. So, I think we added 0.5 billion last year I think that proves we are prepared to be flexible and obviously we are paying attention to what happened to the market. We are not very happy with this, basically $10 shift at all and it has our attention.
John Kiani - Deutsche Bank Securities: Okay. Thanks, John.
Chaka Patterson - Vice President, Investor Relations: Next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Greg Gordon with Citi. Please go ahead.
Greg Gordon - Citigroup: Thanks. Good morning. First…
John W. Rowe - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Greg.
Greg Gordon - Citigroup: You guys said your 96% financially hedge for '08 and 90% for '09. You said largely un-hedged in '11, but I didn't hear a number for 2010. Did you give a range for 2010?
John W. Rowe - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: We've given a range in the past, I think its 50 to 70% and we are working our way through that, Greg.
Greg Gordon - Citigroup: Okay. So, it would be fair to presume that you are moving towards the high end of the range and as you…
John W. Rowe - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, I think that's very fair. We're moving towards the high end of the range. We have already stated that we are above that range of 50 to 70. I think we have actually told you that several times.
Greg Gordon - Citigroup: Right because of the PECO contract being in place.
John W. Rowe - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: That's right. And also because of the swap we did with Commonwealth Edison.
Greg Gordon - Citigroup: Right. So, in some of your analyst presentations over the course of the year, you have given a rough projection of where you thought the PECO load serving contract would price, just given a read through of where some of the other entities in the market had been pricing their hedges. I think, EPL the one that you have referenced. Obviously prices are down about 5 or $6 per megawatt hour in my measure since you gave that presentation. So, it begs the question, do you guys have a point of view on where these markets are to trade, is this a technical phenomenon that we are seeing as you see, sort of an unwind of a broader commodity trade in the financial markets, or do you think these pull-backs we have seen represents some fundamental shift in outlook.
John W. Rowe - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: I would like Ian, mostly to answer that. We think the fundamentals particularly in PJM East are still largely in the upward direction. That said I doubt we think there is great long-term virtue in any one particular number either today's number or a $5 higher number couple of months ago, but Ian, why don't you do your best to help with that.
Ian P. McLean - Executive Vice President, Finance and Markets: Yeah, I think I answered it John. I think the market, the global markets are extremely nervous and everyone is looking always now for negative information and with the economy being weak, people are nervous about load growth and it all feeds in to this sort of sensing you hear news be at correct or not correct. There is going to be more gas than people thought available. Today's price is as good as last week's price, as far as I am concerned I don't have a strong view on it, I just don't. It will be what it will be. We will hedge, than we think within two years it's going to settle down and get back to business as normal and everything will move on from there.
Greg Gordon - Citigroup: Thank you, Ian.
Chaka Patterson - Vice President, Investor Relations: Next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Hugh Wynne with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.
John W. Rowe - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Morning, Hugh.
Hugh Wynne - Sanford Bernstein: Good morning and congratulations on a good quarter. Just wanted to ask about the direction of revenues over the 2008 2010 timeframe? You guys have I think emphasized on several of your comments that this is a period where you're hedged, where earnings are likely to be relatively flat, and that the major impact of higher market prices will not be felt until perhaps 2011. Nonetheless in this quarter, you all realized average revenue per megawatt hour of about $62 on your marketed retail sales, which is up by approximately $7 per megawatt hour from similar calculation last year which was 54 bucks per megawatt hour. So the fact that your hedge is not precluding you from realizing higher revenues on your market sales of power and I was wondering if you could help me to understand how that works, what's driving that? Is this simply the gradual roll off of existing hedges and the impact of higher wholesale prices flowing through gradually to your top line overtime? And if so, should we expect more of that in subsequent quarters through 2010 or should I be thinking about this in a totally different way?
John W. Rowe - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: I'll take a shot at that, Hugh. I mean I think there's two things; one is just nuclear output is always a factor. So you have to take the volume piece into that. And secondly is, I think when you look at the power prices its…we aren't a 100% hedge. We are at the high-90s. So there is always some amount that we leave open and power prices go up, we can take advantage of that. So I think there is always a little bit that provides some opportunity for us.
Matthew F. Hilzinger - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: It seems to me you a piece of this is that 95.8% figure that Chris delivered in the second quarter. We can't budget in poverty and can't plan on having it quite that good. So when Chris delivered it, Ian can sell it.
Hugh Wynne - Sanford Bernstein: I don't see how with respect… I don't see how movements and output can affect your realized revenue per megawatt hour, and I certainly don't see how the 4% un-hedged position in 2008 could produce a $7 increase in realized revenues per megawatt hours. So there must be something else, no?
Matthew F. Hilzinger - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: We've got a breakdown, let's give it you.
Kenneth Cornew - Senior Vice President; President, Power Team: Hugh, Ken Cornew. Couple of things first you're right, as our hedging program old hedges roll out, and new hedges roll in and prices are increasing. We are going to see an increase on the revenue line. But I think the important thing for you to focus on is the margin line. And to the extent we keep our costs from our nuclear fleet particularly as stable level and the revenue line increases, we're going to see some increase in margin. We also have a fossil fleet and to the extent our fossil units have higher fuel cost. Now they are going to make their way into the cost line. We're going to see a higher revenue line and at somewhat muted marginal line. So I think one thing, one thing to take away from this discussion from your perspective would be look at the margin line. The revenue line is important. Spot prices have gone up substantially year-over-year. Fuel costs have gone up substantially year-over-year. Older hedges that were at lower prices have rolled off year-over-year. All those will contribute to probably some increase in margin, but not quite to the extent you're looking at it from a revenue line perspective.
Hugh Wynne - Sanford Bernstein: Great. Thank you very much.
Chaka Patterson - Vice President, Investor Relations: Next question, please?
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jonathan Arnold with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
John W. Rowe - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Jonathan.
Jonathan Arnold - Merrill Lynch: Good morning guys. I wanted to ask about Texas and just how you... how the fleet did in the very sort of volatile markets we have there in the second quarter. And also as Ian, you've said in the past that you've given the uncertainty around things like wind generation coming into that market that is not some way you'd be looking to deploy capital. But now we will have a decision at least from the commission on where they are headed with wind transmission. Does that change anything in terms of your outlook of going forward there?
John W. Rowe - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Ian, why don't you answer that right on the details?
Ian P. McLean - Executive Vice President, Finance and Markets: Jonathan, first on the quarter in the spot markets, we have machines in Texas that are dispatchable machines, intermediate and peaking kind of equipment. And we've seen some volatility down there in the quarter. And we've gotten some good dispatch and good results from the spot market with our position in Texas.
Matthew F. Hilzinger - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: So, you are clearly recognizing that on Wind Generation, it is a big difference to think about whether it's 10,000 megawatts of Wind Generation or 18,000 megawatts of Wind Generation and it looks like a very different generation stack and supply model and we have to consider that in any investment we are looking at or contemplating making in the future down there regarding generation. So, clearly it is an issue, clearly it's something we need to look at. We think 18,000 is a big number and may have some real impacts on the type of generation stack it's going to make an economic and reliable operation exist.
Jonathan Arnold - Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thank you. Could I go to the quick follow-up on related subject, please?
John W. Rowe - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Go ahead, John.
Jonathan Arnold - Merrill Lynch: You are talking about for the year, the strong Generation performance you're offsetting some of the load issues, an uncollectibles of the utilities. To what extent is that statement reliant on the two one-time type items you had in the second quarter, and to what extent is it reliant on sustained above average performance through the second half of the year? I guess I am kind of curious as to whether that's where you are now; do you have to continue doing well at Generation to make that statement?
John W. Rowe - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: John, I'll take a crack at that. I think based on that the plan that we have for the nuclear plants in terms of output, if they meet their plan that's what… that's we are expecting for the second half of the year. Obviously we need to get through the summer. That will have a big impact. But if you look back at really the first half of the year, we've had a very, very strong operationally sound year. I mean in terms of what's happened in the market fundamentals and then in terms of the operations to the plants and the outputs. So, when we look at the year, we really do look at it as a very strong and solid operational year. That the one timers, you can, when we sit back we kind of look at him whether it's on a quarterly basis or a six-month basis. And for the most part, they really do wash out. When you look at a range between 400, 440 at the end of year you end up with a few pennies here and there on kind of a net basis on the dispute items. It really is not impactful in terms of how we look at the business. And so, stepping back our profitability is really driven by the nuclear assets and their performance to market pressures. So, does that answer your question, Jonathan?
Jonathan Arnold - Merrill Lynch: Yes, it does. I just have one other. You have this…
John W. Rowe - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Hey, Jonathon we got to move on. So, give us a call later on and we'll get you an answer to your question, okay?
Jonathan Arnold - Merrill Lynch: Thank you, guys.
Chaka Patterson - Vice President, Investor Relations: Next caller, please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse: Hi, good morning.
John W. Rowe - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse: On the Exelon 20-20 plan, can you just give a little more insight into kind of the timing of when you expect to start making more meaningful capital expenditures as part of that $12 billion program? How much of that plan is already in CapEx that you guys were looking for; and then maybe other insights as far as what kind of return you expect to earn on that capital at what this going into, or it should pretty attractive hard assets?
John W. Rowe - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Let me take a shot at it and Matt will help me here. Much of this plan was in our capital plans already. We look at the nuclear operates we divide them in to branches. First one I think is around 250-300 megawatts that sound right Matt?
Matthew F. Hilzinger - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes.
John W. Rowe - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: And that is in the next several years and there's a high degree of certainty around are doing that and big payback on doing that. Then there is another chunk, it's down there few years further out that there is a much larger band of uncertainty around is to, whether we could actually do it, make it pay and I'll let Chris to amplify that if you want. Now, one of the biggest pieces of this is whether we do gas combined cycle plants in either PJM East or in Texas. And I think sometime yes this year, we will probably make a firm decision on the PJM East plant. The Texas situation is a little more confusing because of things that have already been discussed in this call. These are the biggest single chunks. As you know, we've only authorized $100 million for the nuclear project in Texas. We think that will cover us well into '09 and we are genuinely open minded as to whether we go forward with that project or not. We really mean the conditions we put at it. Matt, can you…better Chris can you flush this out a little more beyond what I said.
Christopher M. Crane - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: We're going to be as we always our capital investments very disciplined in how we look at whether we're going to make those in terms of deferral rates and IIRs and that this program I don't think it's going to be any different. We're going to look at things and that's particularly around the capital investments around nuclear operates or natural gas plants or renewals that we're going to look at. So, we're going to be very disciplined. We've always been that way and I think we're going to continue that down the path. There is a portion of this that we're going to look at in terms of offsetting our own greenhouse gases and those of our customers. And we work for look for if when it's appropriate, appropriate recovery at the utilities if it's associated with that. So, we're going to be very, very disciplined about how we go forward on this. In terms of what's been built into our capital plans. We have not given to the Street capital investments plans for the next four or five years. But we're going to continue to take a look it at again, if it makes sense, we'll adjust our value return policy that way. But I think John's reiterated these have to make economic sense for us to do it.
John W. Rowe - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, just to backup this, Chris Crane just to backup what Matt said, the first and John…the first group of projects that are underway that fall under not only our new 2020 program, but there are already plans in place to be during retrofits on steam paths…on the steam turbans. What we're doing is taking the advantage of replacing just because of degradation in age. It's just a normal asset management plan of doing a retrofit with larger and more efficient units that are going to gain us stationary to motoring units that are going to gain us this greater amount of the 350 megawatts we're going after first. So it's been in our plan, our long-term asset management plan, we get to take advantage of new technology and advancement to gain the efficiencies that will increase the megawatts. But first, two blocks of upgrades fall in that type of area that has been planed. The third is as John said we'll continue to evaluate.
Matthew F. Hilzinger - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I'll add also that some of these things are fairly small and we took a look just yesterday at the first slice of our building improvement plan. We've already got something like a 9% reduction in building energy consumption from work we've already done. We took a look at another 4% chunk yesterday. The total amount of money involved is between $5 and $10 million, and it has…the returns vary all the way from close to zero to up at 15% or 20%. But the average is over our cost of capital and it's not a small amount of money. So, it's a good way to make a point and to do it fairly cheaply. The next slice of buildings we look at, probably will involve a little more money, and raise questions like, are we in a building or two we shouldn't be in at all. And so, we're looking at those now, but the returns were pretty good on this first slice.
Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse: Great. Thank you very much.
Chaka Patterson - Vice President, Investor Relations: Next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Anthony Cordell [ph] with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Anthony Cordell - Jefferies: Just a quick follow-up from Jonathan's question about in…Texas. Have you guys been able to quantify the benefit that you guys have received from your plants in Texas?
John W. Rowe - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Ian and Ken.
Ian P. McLean - Executive Vice President, Finance and Markets: I don't understand the question, the benefit of the...
Anthony Cordell - Jefferies: How has the contribution from those plans this quarter versus the previous quarter?
Ian P. McLean - Executive Vice President, Finance and Markets: Yeah, we don't disclose...
John W. Rowe - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Regional.
Ian P. McLean - Executive Vice President, Finance and Markets: Regional, this is one of the things we said at the trade-off. So obviously, it's been positive because the volatility is been there.
Anthony Cordell - Jefferies: Okay, thank you.
Chaka Patterson - Vice President, Investor Relations: Last question, operator.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question is from Zack Shriver with Ducan Capital [ph]. Please go ahead.
John W. Rowe - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Zack.
Zack Shriver - Ducan Capital: Hey, John. Hi everyone, congratulations on a very good quarter. Just a couple of questions in terms of first NOx.
Matthew F. Hilzinger - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: No, just one question, Zack.
Zack Shriver - Ducan Capital: Is that Matt, okay, then we'll do it on offline. Just on NOx and CAIR, just what you think the timetable is in order for the annual NOx to be reinstated, whether its going to be reinstated administratively through an EPA process or if its going to be reinstated through a legislative process with a remand to congress. My understanding of it, it has been remanded or will be shortly remanded back to congress or back to the EPA, where they will start working on it. But will that process be effectively intercepted by a congressional legislative process and. And when we look at your hedge position in the near-term, we look at the time it will take to reinstate that value in the curve, will that value get reinstated by the time your hedge is well off get with the nice and open in 2011 and under different kinds of administrations that value higher, equal or lower than where it was under a Bush CAIR? Thank you.
John W. Rowe - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: I'm sure that question proves you know, as much solid than we do. Zack this is not a great shot. Let me go back to 11 and 10 for a minute.
Zack Shriver - Ducan Capital: Yes, sir.
John W. Rowe - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: I think Ian's view, Ken's view, my view is that the pressures are upward in that period for reasons of capacity constrains, regardless of whether the care rules reinstated. Ian, you agree with that?
Ian P. McLean - Executive Vice President, Finance and Markets: Yes, I think that's right, John. I don't see when you get out until that, those sort of years, what… there isn't a simple solution to the problems you facing…we get at the point in our way; you can't built stuff quickly enough to do anything about it. So, I think there will be upward pressure comes back on the market when the market settles down, but it's going to volatile for a while.
John W. Rowe - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: And Bill if you…either you or Betsy want to add anything on what your guesses as to what will happen, I mean.
Elizabeth Anne Moler - Executive Vice President, Government and Environmental Affairs and Public Policy: Yeah, let me take a short at it. The EPA administrator has said that he intends to announce by the end of the month, whether he is going to go back to the court and ask the entire D.C. Circuit, so called on bond proceeding to reconsider the panel's decision. He has not made it clear what he intends to do. EPA is apparently shocked that their rule is over churned. If that does not work I'm sure that someone will try and take the case up to the Supreme Court. I don't have anyway of knowing whether they take the case, but it probably doesn't look good for them to do that. But in the meantime here is uncertainty because of what's going to happen with the pre-existing state implementation plans and everything. So, there is just a period of uncertainty here that's inevitable, but it doesn't really remove the price pressures that the John was talking about.
Zack Shriver - Ducan Capital: But from a proceeding perspective?
John W. Rowe - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Is that correct, I want to follow with that later on.
Zack Shriver - Ducan Capital: I look forward to that. Thanks so much, guys.
John W. Rowe - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: You're welcome. Thank you, operator, and we'll conclude our call.
Chaka Patterson - Vice President, Investor Relations: Operator?
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's Exelon Corporation conference call. You may all disconnect and have a great day.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Ray and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Exelon Corporation First Quarter 2008 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Chaka Patterson. Sir, you may begin your process.
Chaka Patterson - Investor Relations: Thank you. Good morning. Welcome to Exelon's first quarter 2008 earnings review and conference call update. Thank you for joining us today. We issued our earnings release this morning, if you haven't received it, the release is available on the Exelon website at www.exeloncorp.com. Or you can call Dolaras Modia [ph] at 312-394-5222 as she will fax or email the release to you. Before we begin today's discussion, let me remind you that the earnings release and other matters we discuss in today's call contains forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties, as well as adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings. Please refer to today's 8-K and our other SEC filings for discussions of factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections forecast and expectations and for a reconciliation of operating earnings to GAAP earnings. Leading the call today are John Rowe, Exelon's Chairman, President and CEO; and Matt Hilzinger, Exelon's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by other members of Exelon's senior management team, who will be available to answer your questions. We have scheduled 50 minutes for this call and will reserve 30 minutes for Q&A. Please limit yourself to one question. I will now turn the call over to John Rowe Exelon CEO.
John W. Rowe - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you Chaka, good morning everyone. This morning I will do a quick review of the first quarter, comment on our earnings expectations for the remainder of 2008 and give you an update on our views on merger and acquisitions activity in the context of our current value proposition. We have received comments from a number of you that detail in the earnings release and press statements that we put out is more useful than a long parade of adjectives in this call. So Matt Hilzinger and I are shortening our presentation a bit compared to the norm. We circulated some slides with the press release and Matt and I will be referring to them during our comments. As we told you to expect our first quarter operating earnings of $0.93 per share were down from the first quarter of 2007. Matt Hilzinger will provide details on some of the year-over-year differences. I want to focus on the most important one. Decreased nuclear power plant output due to a larger number of plant refueling outages. This is something that we've had in the works for something and we signaled that months ago to you. In the first quarter we started five refueling outages and completed four as planned that compares to starting two and completing one in the first quarter of last year. These numbers exclude sale and want to emphasize three points. First we told you to expect them in December and we reflected them in our earnings per share guidance for the first quarter and for all of 2008. Second we maintained our industry leading performance by completing the outages on average in 24 days compared to the industry average of 41 days. Chris Crane, Chip Pardee and their team continue to do an absolutely extraordinary job with our nuclear. Third we expect to complete our remaining refueling outages just to safely and just as efficiently. In short we are on plan for the year and committed to keeping ourselves on plan for the, we expect to deliver operating earnings within our previously announced guidance range our $4 to $4.40 per diluted share. Now let me address mergers and acquisitions. As you all know I always look. Many of you have asked us to be very rigorous about any large merger. Because you believe the strength of our existing value proposition would more likely be diluted and enhanced. After looking very carefully at the most attractive large opportunities we agree. Slide 3, in the package states our base case or the fundamental value proposition we offer. Over the next three to five years Exelon is uniquely positioned to deliver sustainable value to its shareholder. We have the largest low cost, low emission nuclear fleet in the nation and all seventeen of those units operate in competitive market. As gas, coal and capacity prices increase and reserved margins decline the value of our nuclear fleet increases. We expect that value to increase even further in a carbon constraint world. While we don't know just when will all three presidential candidates pledge to carbon legislation and even President Bush now advocating action. We believe that legislation will be inactive in 2009 or 2010 with a likely effective date sometime in 2012 or 2013. In other words we believe Exelon is uniquely positioned to deliver increasing value in long term earnings growth. At our regulated entity level ComEd continue to execute on its regulatory recovery plan. The rate case is progressing well. Many of you saw that the ICC staff and its rebuttal testimony recommended a revenue requirement of $269 million in increases, approximately 75% of ComEd original request of $361 million. That took a great deal of work by Anne Pramaggiore, Bob McDonald, Darryl Bradford and the ComEd team, but I think it shows not only healing numbers, but a healing set of relationships, I'm very proud of that work. Both PECO and ExGen continue to work constructively with the Rendell administration. And the Pennsylvania general assembly and other stake holders in an effort to manage the transition to competitive markets in that state. While Pennsylvania reflects the fact that there are four major utilities that are due and it reflects the fact that it is a more bipartisan state and Illinois. So that it is difficult to forecast when matters come to a head. I remain cautiously optimistic that the Pennsylvania situation will be acceptably resolved in 2008. So, with all of that going on here at Exelon, we have earnings expectations consistent with what we have told you. We have an increasingly strong cash flow profile, cash flow expectations have improved compared to three months ago. We have one of the strongest balance sheets around. We are able to pursue growth opportunities when we see them and committed to value return policy of dividend growth and share buyback when we don't have something better to give you. This strong indeed in our industry unique base case allows us to be very disciplined and very patient when it comes to pursuing M&A opportunities. In terms of large combinations we believe we have now looked at all of the obvious possibilities. A combination of economic social and political issues make it very difficult to find one that adds substantial value to our base case and can be executed in a predictable and confident way. As a result it is our plan to focus on growing our base case through smaller asset acquisitions, asset swaps or potentially adding newer generation to our fleet. As you all know generation development also requires a great deal of financial vigor and as we have previously discussed in connection with our proposed nuclear station in Texas we are being very hard headed and rigorous about that as well. So the upshot of what I want to give you today is that 2008 is on message and on track the Exelon value proposition is exactly what you've been buying and we are committed to be hard headed even big headed about continuing to presume value in that context. And we will not let other temptations get us off that sustainable value message. With that I will ask Matt Hilzinger to give you a more detailed look at the first quarter results.
Matthew F. Hilzinger - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thank you John, good morning everyone. As john said, we have provided a significant amount of detail regarding our results in the earnings release and the accompanying tables. Therefore I'll spend my time this morning providing some additional color around a few selected items included in the release and then discuss our view for the remainder of 2008 and Exelon's overall financial condition. Starting with slide 4, Exelon's first quarter of 2008 results are within the suggested earnings guidance range we provided for the first quarter and reflect the decrease in earnings at Exelon's Generation and PECO partially offset by an increase in ComEd's earnings. Turning to slide 5, you will see the key drivers for generations expected quarter-over-quarter slower operating earnings. As John mentioned we had more planned, nuclear outages in the first quarter of 2008 as compared to the first quarter of 2007. I'll remind you that our full year 2008 earnings guidance contemplates 12 planned refueling outages as compared to 9 in 2007. Four of those outages planned for 2008 were completed by the end of the first quarter. In addition to the planned outages, generation had 25 more unplanned outage days in the first quarter of 2008 as compared to 2007. The first quarter of 2007 was fully exceptional reflecting Exelon's best nuclear production in any quarter. Our first quarter this year however was challenged due to increased force and maintenance outages at our nuclear plants. Yet despite that we are still on target for the full year. Nuclear plant outages whether planned or unplanned impact generation's results through lower rev net fuel due to reduced nuclear volumes and higher operating and maintenance cost associated with the outage forecast [ph]. Lower energy margins due to reduced nuclear volumes by itself resulted in $0.11 per share decrease in quarter-over-quarter earnings. Higher O&M cost due to planned outages of the Exelon operated units further lower quarter-over-quarter earnings by $0.06 per share. Generation's first quarter 2008 results also reflect a realize investment loss of $0.03 per share in connection with the implementation of a favorable tax law change. In order to realize in accelerated income tax deduction under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 we liquidated certain investments in our non-tax qualified decommissioning trust funds to immediately reinvest the proceeds in tax qualified decommissioning trust funds. Although this transaction triggered realized loss for accounting purposes it will generate approximately $270 million of net incremental cash tax benefits at the Generation company up and beyond our planning assumptions. Turning now to ComEd on slide 6. You will see the key drivers of ComEd's quarter-over-quarter increase in operating earnings with increased transmission of revenues being the most significant driver at $0.03 per share. Turning to slide 7. I'll give you an update regarding ComEd's current distribution rate case including the rebuttal testimony filed by the ICC staff on April 10th and the surrebuttal testimony filed by ComEd on April 21st. Both the staff's rebuttal testimony and ComEd's surrebuttal testimony are reflective on a agreement reached between ComEd and Staff are very clement on the rate case on the resolution of an original cost audit of ComEd's distribution assets. This agreement was reflected in the stipulation filed as part of the Staff's rebuttal testimony. ComEd surrebuttal testimony concurred with the stipulation and while the stipulation ultimately requires ICC approval its encouraging progress. I'll briefly highlight three areas on which ComEd and ICC Staff have reached agreement. The first relates to pro forma capital addition. The Staff in ComEd have agreed to include capital additions to the second quarter of 2008 in rate base. The third quarter 2008 capital additions have been disallowed from the current case but ComEd will plan to include this additions in it's next rate case. The Staff's agreement to include pro forma Cap adds in rate bases another step to allow ComEd to recover the cost its cost on a more timely basis. The secondary relates to accumulated depreciation whereby ComEd and Staff agreed to the position that ComEd had taken in its original rate filing. Finally ComEd and the Staff reached resolution on a original cost audit of ComEd's distribution assets that resulted from April 2006 into more stipulation is ultimately approved by ICC. ComEd will be required to record a write off of approximately $0.02 per share associated with disallowances in rate base. We would expect to record the charge in the third quarter of 2008 in conjunction with the ICC's final order. Staying on slide 7, in the far left column of this slide are the key components that support the revenue increase of $314 million that ComEd files for informational purposes as part of its surrebuttal testimony. We call this requested increase revenue requirement as informational, because it reflects the impacts of the stipulation, and it also reflects certain other adjustments that have been agreed to. However if the ICC does not ultimately uphold the stipulation in its final order. ComEd's requested increase in revenue requirement would become $345 million. The middle column includes the key components that support the ICC Staff's recommended revenue increase requirement of $269 million, up from its initial recommendation of $112 million. The far right column shows the remaining difference of $45 million between the annual revenue requirement increase of 314 suggested by ComEd earlier this week and $269 million as recommended by the Staff. About half of the remaining difference relates to ComEd's requested return on equity of 10.75%, exceeding the 10.3% recommended by the staff. Turning now to PECO on slide 8. You will see the key drivers of PECO's quarter-over-quarter decline in operating earnings reflects the scheduled increase in PECO's CTC amortization which reduced earnings by about $0.02 per share, and higher expense for uncollectible accounts which also reduced earnings by about $0.02 per share. PECO's higher expense due to uncollectible accounts is less the result of the slowing economy and more reflective of events in 2007 around our transition to a new billing system. I'll briefly mention two other first quarter items not covered in my discussion of operating company results. First Exelon recorded income of $0.03 per share associated with anticipated settlements of certain state income tax positions. The majority of this benefit is recorded at the corporate level and composed of two pieces. A reduction of $16 million of tax expense and a reduction of $4 million of after tax interest expense. Second our highlighted new item included in the reconciliation of operating earnings to GAAP earnings. As of January 1st of this year we made a voluntary accounting election under FAS 159 to reflect Generation's investment in decommissioning trust funds at fair value each period. With changes in fair value being recorded to the GAAP income statement. Previously our treatment was not symmetrical. Meaning we recorded realized gains and losses and unrealized losses and these investments in our GAAP income statements. Where as unrealized gains were recorded to other comprehensive income in the equity section of the balance sheet. We believe making these selections for these investment provides for a more fair and balanced presentation of our GAAP earning as both unrealized gains and unrealized losses are now reflected in our GAAP income statement. As we report operating earnings going forward only realized and unrealized losses will be included as all unrealized gains and unrealized losses will be excluded from operating earnings similar to our energy and mark-to-market presentation. I know I said a lot of realized and unrealized in that but I hope I provide you some clarities to how we are going to present this in the future. For additional information regarding our first quarter results please refer to the tables of the company's earnings release which include a complete reconciliation of our operating earnings to GAAP earnings. Turning now to slide 9. Given our solid first quarter 2008 results and our views for the remainder of 2008 we are reaffirming Exelon's non-GAAP operating earnings range for 2008 $4.00 to $4.40 per share and Exelon's GAAP guidance range for 2008 $3.70 to $4.10 per share. We expect the second quarter of 2008 operating earnings to represent approximately 22% to 25% of Exelon's total 2008 operating earnings. Let me just say we are keenly watching like most everyone the impacts of the tightening credit markets and the weakening economy. Our operations, market fundamentals in competitive positions remain strong and to-date we have not felt any substantial effects of the economic slowdown on our businesses. I'll wrap up this morning by enumerating a few thoughts on Exelon's overall financial conditions which I view to be stronger than ever. First, we are keeping a careful watch on our O&M cost and capital spending. When looking at our results for the first quarter and the trends for the remainder year our O&M cost and capital investments are aligned with our expectations and the guidance that we previously provided. Second, we conduct business with our diverse group of high credit quality counter parties and the energy markets and are closely monitoring and managing our financial counter exposure. Third, we have an increasingly strong cash flow profile and expecting to generate around $5 billion of cash flows from operations this year. Four, we continue maintain a very strong investment grade balance sheet. Fifth we continue to have ample liquidity and sufficient access to short and long term capital at reasonable terms given the credit ratings for the respect of work. Obviously it's tougher for ComEd given their credit rating where ComEd and PECO were able to accelerate their bond issuances this year to minimize credit market risk going forward. And in total we've issued $1.8 billion of debt financing this quarter lastly we have in place credit facilities aggregating over $7 billion and in 2007 we extended the term on those facilities to 2012. These facilities are with large and diverse bank groups and there is no one bank representing more than 6% of the commitment. We are taking all of this into account I believe Exelon is extraordinarily well positioned even in this uncertain market and economic environment. We continue to have a very compelling base case that supports continued long term earnings growth at value correction. With that I will turn it back to Chaka.
Chaka Patterson - Investor Relations: Thank you Matt. Operator we are ready to open for Q&A now. Question And Answer
Operator: Thank you as a reminder if you like to post a question [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Jonathan Arnold of Merrill Lynch, please go ahead.
Jonathan Arnold - Merrill Lynch: Good morning guys.
Matthew F. Hilzinger - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Good morning.
Jonathan Arnold - Merrill Lynch: My question relates to tax and when I look at the face of the operating income statement it seems like the effective rate for the quarter was around 31% normally seems to be kind of more like 37. And any was that effectively baked into guidance for the year or could you just I know you called out $0.03 of tax differential, I think that difference in the rate would put the number more like $0.08, any color on that would be helpful.
Matthew F. Hilzinger - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: John, I'll answer that. It's a very good question. It's really driven by two things, the recently effective tax rate down is in part due to the state tax settlements that we are in discussion with and that's bringing it down, and the second there is the walk that we took on the realized disposition of the assets in the New Jersey Commissioning Trust. That $0.03 actually gets juiced up a little bit more. You get a little bit more tax deduction for that, and those two things really brought the effective tax rate from about 37.5% down to 31%. So, was it based in the guidance? I think when you look at the quarter, if you are kind of nibbling on quality of earnings, if you look at kind of the tax benefit we got, compared to loss on the decommissioning trust and PPO from last year, I think they pretty much wash out. So I think from a quality of earnings standpoint, I think we feel pretty good about, in fact we feel very good about where the quarter is ending. So, we can get into it later on after this call if you want to get into a little bit more of how the decommissioning loss works from a tax basis, we can do that. I think Tom and Terry our tax guys will be happy to walk you through that. Is there any other question Jonathan?
Jonathan Arnold - Merrill Lynch: Yeah, can I slide in one other?
Matthew F. Hilzinger - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Sure, go ahead Jon.
Jonathan Arnold - Merrill Lynch: How much of the delta that you were baking into your annual guidance on nuclear refueling costs, effectively showed up in Q1 and how much of it is still to come in like in and out of the fourth quarter. It looked like a big portion of the annual guidance was in this quarter?
John W. Rowe - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, there was no surprises here. Our expectations were that there was going to be a lowering of earnings. We did... in the annual guidance there is 12 unplanned outages compared to 9 last year so a delta of three, we did four in the first quarter this year compared to one affectively last year. So there were three additional ones in the first quarter that was expected and we aren't seeing anything affecting plan. I think I shared in my opening remarks, we expect to be on target in terms of capacity factor for the year and so we don't expect anything unusual in the back half of the year.
Jonathan Arnold - Merrill Lynch: So the outage comes from much more similar for the rest of the year effectively?
John W. Rowe - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: That's absolutely right.
Jonathan Arnold - Merrill Lynch: Thank you.
John W. Rowe - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you Jonathan. Next question please.
Operator: Thank you, our next question comes from Hugh Wynne of Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.
John W. Rowe - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning Hugh.
Hugh Wynne - Sanford Bernstein: Good morning. I have a question regarding the improvement and average margin looking at page 12 of your release. The average margin on power sales was about $39 per megawatt hour in the first quarter, up about 9% from $36 per megawatt hour in the fourth quarter of last year. My question then is whether you might provide us with some color on that. specifically for example around the fact that your purchase power cost have gone down significantly despite the outages, your fuel costs have gone down which perhaps is more consistent with the outages, and also it would appear some of the around the clock prices have improved. So, I am trying to get a feel for as what's kind of the long term earnings power of the generation fleet whether that has changed in any material way as a result of these lower costs and higher prices?
John W. Rowe - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Ben Cardouz [ph] will you pickup on that please.
Unidentified Company Representative: Sure Hugh, average margins are up this year primarily given. Obviously market conditions are improved, market prices higher, so our market sales have gone up. Our peak load contract did increase also which helped our average margins and should continue to help our average margins year-over-year. Purchase power actually is a dynamic that's occurred in the market regarding purchase power is market conditions have dictated that we are running some of our purchase power plants less than we did year-over-year, and that's a combination of all kinds of market conditions whether heat rates, unit availability, things of that nature and that's also true with regard to our own fossil generation. We would expect to see margins increase with market fundamentals that we are looking at and the commodity prices that we are looking at overtime, and this trend should continue.
Hugh Wynne - Sanford Bernstein: Great, thanks a lot.
John W. Rowe - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you. Next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs: Hey guys, Michael Lapides here. A real quick question, John, it sounds like you've done a lot of looking at various companies and various assets around the U.S. Can you talk about your views on valuations that you see in the markets for natural gas power plants, which regions you might find more attractive versus less attractive and versus kind of general pricing of assets that might be on the markets in this region?
John W. Rowe - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Sure, I will start this and I will ask Ian McLean to pick up a little bit in addition. But we have looked at most of the major integrated and I have answered how we feel about those moments in my opening comments. We have also looked at gas wins, others things, first thing is we are green and we want to stay green. We think part of our value proposition to you is the positioning we have in what we perceive to be carving constraint world and we don't intend to yield that position. Second, most of what we see suggested existing gas capacity is fairly fully priced. I mean if we saw a big opportunity in gas in any region we will be announcing a transaction instead of just continuing to look in our red eyed way. Obviously we would like to expand preferably in other market competitive areas but we are also willing to do it in areas where you get PPAs. The problem we see is with the current prices any transaction would likely be earnings dilutive even if it seem to make sense in the long term value basis and I haven't been able to find the way yet to skin a cat that brings you one that wouldn't be significantly earnings dilutive. So, that's why we go very slow on all of this. We have an earnings proposition for you that we value a great deal and we are not of the view at the moment that we have something where the value add is sufficiently large to justify the concomitant earnings dilution, Ian would you like to pick up on that?
Ian McLean - Vice President of Finance and Markets: I think obviously it is going to be difficult for us to build in the regions where we were pushing as market power issues now. So, the Midwest and PGM East and West would be tough for us although not impossible. I think that if you look in Texas it has attractions but before I would really give you, that's a good area to get involved with more safer example of gas which I think is what you asked about generation. I want to understand more about what is happening with wind and transmission down there and get a really clearer picture on that before I could honestly say yes, that's a real opportunity for our corporation. Really the area that's probably is most interesting to me the area is probably California. I mean it is high growth, very committed, but as John said they are just are, there is nothing that jumps off the plate because probably that's a really great asset to go buy at these values. So it is a tough one for us. Our view is that recessions are really good times to have money and if we don't let ourselves get impatient in these economic times there are going to be some good deals. And we are just -- I used the phrase pig headed before, I think that's what we intend to be. We want whenever we announced that we are buying something we want you to be pleased when you hear it not all nervous and worried and so we are being very careful. We are looking as Ian suggested whether a gas plant in Texas makes sense. We are also looking at some additional gas capacity in PJM. Given the RPM pricing that has been put into effect there, there are capacity needs in PJM East and if we can we are certain we can do it without raising market power issues, I think we might get both decent returns and help show the FERC in the state of Pennsylvania that PJMs/RPM regime really is getting capacity belt. And we noticed some other suppliers having that attitude also.
Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs: Okay, thank you. I appreciate the response to my question.
John W. Rowe - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Next question please. Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John Kiani of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
John Kiani - Deutsche Bank: Good morning.
John W. Rowe - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, John.
John Kiani - Deutsche Bank: Can you talk a little bit about your outlook and expectations for Pennsylvania from a political and regulatory perspective and how it relates to the exploration of the Polar contract and PECO?
John W. Rowe - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Sure.
John Kiani - Deutsche Bank: Just relative thoughts would be great.
John W. Rowe - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: I probably won't say anything very different than I have said before. But each of the utilities in Pennsylvania goes off its existing contracts at a different time and each of them can be anticipated to have a very different level of rate increase. I think in each case given the current market conditions the increases are likely to be significant, but in the case of several of the utilities that were historically lower cost than PECO, the increases are likely to be large indeed and that causes us to say there is going to have to be some pain incurred as one works out these transitions. And we believe that if we can cause to come together an agreement between the Rendell [ph] Administration and particularly the republic and senate leadership, before that pain hits people, we can come to a more reasonable accommodation, then if it has to be done afterwards. So, we are constantly saying, look if the other utilities will bear their proportion and share, we will help to get something done here, so that this is all a reasonable and smooth transition. I'm not very sure as we sit here whether that will happen sometime in the quarter ahead or not. If it doesn't happen in the next quarter, it's likely not to happen I think for more than a year. So, our view is, be patient, be cooperative, do what's necessary to protect our fundamental value, but try to be part of the solution. And I think given what's happened in a variety of other states, and not just Illinois, but Maryland and most recently Ohio, that's the attitude that pays off for shareholders. So I'm reasonably confident we will find the window when it is open.
John Kiani - Deutsche Bank: Okay. Thanks John, that's helpful.
John W. Rowe - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you. Next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Ridzon of KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Good morning. You mentioned, you were talking about EPAC [ph] and rejiggering your NDT. It sounds like it was a wash this quarter, you saw $0.03 tax benefit offset by $0.03 of investment losses, is that correct and when does this $270 million of cash start flowing, over what period does it come in as earnings and how does it, in fact you are thinking about the August or are they about announcement of incremental share repurchase?
Matthew F. Hilzinger - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: This is Matthew, let me take crack at that. Your thought about how it flows through the P&L is right. It's in essence a loss, we don't view it as a big issue with respect to our quality of earnings. The 270 is just cash, it has no future of P&L impact in the short-term here and other than you get some interest on when you get the cash, it's going to come in '08 and '09 and in terms of how we are going to look at that -- in fact let me just add to that, we are also looking at our cash position with respect to the impact to the economic stimulus package as well and we would expect somewhere between $250 million and may be $350 million of incremental cash come in this year as well. So between the economic stimulus package and the pull over as we call it for the decommissioning trust we are looking at somewhere probably around a net $600 million plus or minus and we are going to take a look at that in terms of as we always do with our value return policy. We always look at growth opportunities, we look at our balance sheet, we are going to assess where we are in terms of the weakening economy, and what's going on out there. And as part of our kind of planning process we always go through this and I think we are going to be prepared to talk to the Street or we expect to talk to the Street in the third quarter about what we are going to in terms of value return, share repurchase, but it will certainly be considered.
Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Were these two the stimulus package and the NDT, was it kind of in your thinking when you talked to us in December?
Matthew F. Hilzinger - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: No, they were not.
Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets: I guess I have seen the stimulus package. Thank you very much.
Matthew F. Hilzinger - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Welcome.
John W. Rowe - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: I would just repeat though what Matt said is cash rather than earning and cash is nice though.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.
John W. Rowe - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning Paul.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates: Good morning, can you hear me?
John W. Rowe - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates: Just a quick question on the heat rates you guys have on flight 11 what's causing the fall offs on those just, what's driving them?
John W. Rowe - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Ken?
Kenneth W. Cornew - Senior Vice President and President of Exelon Power Team: Yes Paul, I will take that. Yes, we have been talking to you guys about heat rate for a long time now and specifically we started focusing on it in early '07. We thought back then that heat rates weren't reflective of what we thought the fundamentals in the market were. They did rise substantially in '07 two points where we thought they were more reasonable when we look at the fundamentals in the markets we are in and the heat rates at that time they look much more reasonable than they had earlier on. Again those heat rates very recently in the last couple of months have fallen. We think the problems in the financial markets have a role in that. Banks and hedge funds have liquidated longer term energy positions and there aren't a lot of buyers out there right now for power specifically either users or some trading counter parties. Spot market heat rates also probably have a role in that and we have seen spot market heat rates this first quarter down because of those typical short-term whether and unit availability and fuel price and generation stack issues that we typically see in the stock markets. So we have seen these heat rates come down. We again likely in early '07 think that there is some upside in these heat rates again and we will continue to analyze the fundamentals and reassure ourselves of that but we think given the things I said and the sharp increasing gas which helps to typically drive this phenomena too, we think there is some upside now.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates: Okay. When you talk about the credit crunch maybe having a substantial role in this, what else should we think about, because it seems that the credit crunch seems to shop in strange places at strange time? What other... do you have any other additional causes to what we might want to think about in terms of the credit crunch, in terms of trading and marketing, or the power markets, just any further thoughts on that?
John W. Rowe - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: We always think about liquidity Paul and we haven't really had any issues from Exelon's perspective.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates: What about from other people's perspective?
John W. Rowe - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: We haven't seen many problems with the trading categories we are dealing with. We just don't see a lot of activity in the long run rate now and I think a lot of the longer dated heat rate elements have been supported through longer-term position taking from a financial prospective. I think in the short run we are really talking about what spot heat rates are doing and what that means from a market perspective in the next two or three years with heat rates. So, other then that I think we are in good shape from the financial crisis situation that we seem to be having.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates: Thanks a lot.
Kenneth W. Cornew - Senior Vice President and President of Exelon Power Team: Let me try to pick up on that, I mean Ian and Matt and I keep asking where... what haven't we thought about. The one place that occurs to me that has hit us so far is that both ComEd and PECO had some variable rate auction debt where the auction benchmark dried up and we had to refinance and we've done the PECO and expect no problem with the ComEd but that Mike Moskow [ph] would you like to add to that.
Unidentified Company Representative: Well I think that's been the most tangible impact and it affects $500 million of our $13 billion debt and of course this was an industry widening because a lot of -- is taking advantage of that [indiscernible]. As John said we refinanced the PECO and in fact at the pre-sale we fixed it out 4% and we are looking at refinancing in ComEd and having it done in this quarter. In the other demands we have accelerated some debt financing as mentioned in the release and Matt mentioned just to take advantage of availability. We have really seen no lack of interest in the cash fund markets for our paper. I mean there's been Sunday is better than others but we've taken advantage of that by accelerating it. On a liquidity position, as Matt mentioned with over 7 billion credit lines its very strong and extended out through 2012, and our turnout party situation is monitored as we talk about and we don't have too concentration in any one counter party or any one set of category. So all in all we are watching it very closely, we realize there is a stiff wind out there and you don't want to stand too close to the cliff but we feel very good about our financial position. Operator we have time for one more question.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question comes from David Frank [ph] of Catapult. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Yes, hi, good morning.
John W. Rowe - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, David.
Unidentified Analyst: Just a quick question John, on Illinois, I know that you've been making a lot of headway there with the power authority, when could we expect to, what is the next phase in Illinois as far as the current power for the utilities, when will we have an update on that?
John W. Rowe - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Let me ask Ann Marjorie [ph] who is here and give you that update right now.
Unidentified Company Representative: Sure. The governor's office just to point it, a power authority administrator, Mark Pruitt is his name. He comes from the University of Illinois, Energy Resource Center, he has been there about 15 years and has actually procured power for many a state agencies and several municipalities. So he has a very strong background in the markets and understands procurement. The next step would be he would bringing outside experts to help him pull together a plan, a procurement plan that would be filed by August 15th with the Illinois Commerce Commission, parties would then comment on that plan and the Commerce Commission would issue an order approving that plan with whatever modifications it shows and a procurement would be run early in 2009, those are the basic steps.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. And do we know what, I guess its too early to judge what methods might be used for procuring whether it's an option or negotiations or?
Unidentified Company Representative: The legislation that was passed last summer actually provides a fair amount of detail around the type of procurement and it will track the procurement that ComEd ran this year which is basically a fielded RFP process purchasing blocked products with ComEd sort of filling around the edges of the portfolio.
Unidentified Analyst: I saw that those... the results of that RFP was rather favorable, have there been any comments or ruffling of any feathers in Illinois, is everyone happy?
Unidentified Company Representative: No, I think that the increase that customers will see on their bill come June is about 2.5% this year. I think that the things have been pretty quiet around that. We have seen some attention around it but nothing significant so I think people are pretty comfortable with the direction that things are heading in right now.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you very much.
John W. Rowe - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: And that concludes our call operator.
Operator: Thank you. This closes today's Exelon Corporation first quarter 2008 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect and have a great day.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Sharon, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Excelon Fourth Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor to your host, Mr. Chaka Patterson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin your conference.
Chaka Patterson - Vice President, Investor Relations: Thank you. Good morning. Welcome to Excelon's fourth quarter and year-end 2007 earnings review and conference call update. Thank you for joining us today. We issued our earnings release this morning. If you haven't received it, the release is available on the Excelon website at www.exceloncorp.com, or you can call Dolores Nivea [ph] at 312-394-5222 and she will fax or e-mail the release to you. This call is being recorded, and will be available through February 6th by dialing 800-642-1687. The international call-in number is 706-645-9291. The confirmation code is 29883087. In addition, the call will be archived on the Excelon website. Before we begin today's discussion, let me remind you that the earnings release and other matters we discussed in today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for discussions of factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts, and expectations. In our press release and during this call, we will discuss adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings that exclude the earnings impact of certain charges and credits. These charges and credits are identified within our reconciliations of GAAP to adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings from pages seven and eight of the earnings release tables posted to our website and filed on Form 8-K with the SEC this morning. We believe these adjusted operating earnings are representative of the underlying operational results of the company. With me today are John Rowe, Excelon's Chairman, President and CEO; Ian McLean, Excelon Executive Vice President and President of Power Team; Matthew Hilzinger, Excelon's Senior Vice President and Corporate Controller; and other members of Exelon's senior management team and members of the senior management teams of the Generation company, ComEd, and PECO, who'll be available to answer your questions. We have scheduled one hour for this call. We will spend about 40 minutes on prepared remarks, focus on fourth quarter and full-year 2007 financial operating results, our outlook for 2008 financial results, an update on markets, and Exelon's commitment to sustainable value. We'll use the remaining time for Q&A. In order to effectively manage this call, we would appreciate it if you would limit yourself to only one question. I will not turn the call over to Matt Hilzinger, Exelon's Corporate Controller, who will discuss our 2007 financial results.
Matthew F. Hilzinger - Senior Vice President and Corporate Controller: Thank you, Chaka. Good morning, everyone. As part of or earnings release package that we issued this morning, we included slides that I will refer to during my remarks. I will first cover Exelon's fourth quarter and full-year 2007 results before moving to the operating results of Exelon Generation, ComEd and PECO. I'll conclude with our financial outlook for 2008, which was covered in detail at our investor conference in December. Starting with slide three and as highlighted in the materials we released this morning, Exelon achieved strong fourth quarter and full-year 2007 operating and financial results. Exelon announced fourth quarter 2007 adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings of $677 million or $1.02 per share, a 42% increase from fourth quarter 2006 operating earnings of $487 million or $0.72 per diluted share. Consistent with the first three quarters of the year, Exelon's strong performance in the fourth quarter was driven primarily by increased earnings at Exelon Generation, which were partially offset by the expected decrease in ComEd's earnings. PECO's earnings for the… during the quarter were also down slightly when compared to last year. Moving to full-year results, Exelon's 2007 operating earnings were $4.32 per diluted share, a 34% increase over 2006 operating earnings of $3.22 per share and just above the high end of our 2007 operating earnings range of $4.15 to $4.30 per share. Exelon reported consolidated GAAP earnings of $562 million or $0.84 per share for the fourth quarter of 2007, and GAAP earnings of approximately $2.7 billion or $4.05 per share for the full-year 2007. For a complete reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP operating earnings, please refer to the tables that accompany the earnings release. I will now turn to the results of each of the operating companies, starting with Exelon Generation. As seen on slide four, Exelon Generation contributed $0.78 of operating earnings for Exelon's share for the fourth quarter of 2007 compared to 38% for the same period in 2006. The major driver of Generation's operating earnings during the quarter was higher wholesale margins as a result of favorable portfolio and market conditions, including higher realized market prices, the end of the below-market PPA with ComEd and the contractual price increase associated with the PECO PPA. Generation's fourth quarter results also reflect the gains realized due to a rebalancing of the investments in its nuclear decommissioning price. These benefits were partially offset by inflationary pressures and nuclear plant development costs associated with generations, construction, and operating license application for a possible new nuclear plant in Texas. In the fourth quarter, Generation made a reservation for a long lead large forgings and component fabrication for two next-generation nuclear reactors. This reservation’s was to preserve the option to build a new nuclear plant should we decide to do so in the future. For the full-year 2007, Exelon Generation contributed $3.45 of operating earnings per Exelon share, an 84% increase over its 2006 contribution of $1.88 per share. The increase in Generation's year-over-year earnings is largely driven by wholesale… higher wholesale margins with the significant drivers that I mentioned for the quarter telling the story for the year as well. Turning now to ComEd on slide five, in the fourth quarter of 2007 ComEd contributed $0.13 of operating earnings per Exelon share compared to $0.17 during the same period of 2006. ComEd's decrease in earnings was expected and was due primarily to the impact of the end of the regulatory transition period in Illinois. ComEd also reported higher operating and maintenance costs, including an increase in reserves for uncollectible accounts due to the impacts of increased customer rates in 2007 and ComEd's suspension of disconnecting customers during a portion of the year. Also, ComEd experienced higher labor costs, primarily due to inflation. On the upside, ComEd benefited from an increase in revenues associated with its distribution rate case that was concluded in December 2006, an increase in revenues associated with the company's 2007 transmission rate case, and favorable weather during the quarters compared to 2006. For the full-year 2007, ComEd contributed $0.30 of operating earnings per Exelon share. A 62% decrease over 2006 operating earnings of $0.78 per share. The decrease in year-over-year earnings is largely due to the impact at higher cost of pure power, partially offset by higher transmission revenues. Turning now to PECO on slide six, PECO's contribution to operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2007 was $0.17 per Exelon share compared to $0.18 during the same period of 2006. PECO's fourth quarter earnings were lower due to the scheduled increase in PECO's CTC amortization and higher operating and maintenance expenses, including higher expense for uncollectible accounts partially offset by favorable weather and low growth during the quarters compared to 2006. PECO's fourth quarter 2006 results had reflected a tax benefit from the settlement of a research and development tax credit fund. For the full year of 2007, PECO contributed $0.75 of operating earnings per Exelon share, a 12% increase over 2006 operating earnings of $0.67 per share. The year-over-year increase at PECO was largely driven by higher electric delivery volume due to favorable weather and core growth partially offset by higher CTC amortization as expected. I will briefly mention two other fourth quarter highlights not covered in my discussion of the operating company results. First, we established the Exelon Foundation with an endowment of $50 million. The Exelon Foundation will focus primarily on environmental and educational grants. You will learn more about the foundation and its mission later in the first quarter. Second, in the fourth quarter Exelon and the Internal Revenue Service agreed to apply industry-wide guidelines as the basis for settling a potential dispute regarding the amount of indirect overhead cost required to be capitalized for tax purposes. The agreement, which is expected to be finalized in 2008, was favorable to Exelon's consolidated fourth quarter results. As you will see in the tables included within today's earnings release, the settlement contributed positively to the fourth quarter earnings [inaudible], while having a negative impact on the earnings of Generation. Please refer to the tables that accompany the earnings release for additional detail regarding our fourth quarter and full-year 2007 results including a full reconciliation of our fourth quarter and full-year reported GAAP earnings and adjusted non-GAAP operating items. Now, I will briefly recap our 2008 outlook for the consolidated company. Turning to slide seven, we are reaffirming Exelon’s non-GAAP operating earnings guidance for 2008 at $4 to $4.40 per share and Exelon's GAAP guidance range for 2008 at $3.70 to $4.10 per share. Both Exelon's operating earnings and GAAP earnings guidance are based on the assumption of normal weather for 2008 and a full $361 million revenue increase related to ComEd’s current distribution rate case effective October 1, 2008. We expect first quarter 2008 operating earnings to represent 21% to 24% of Exelon's total 2008 operating earnings. You can find additional information including a bridge from 2007 results to expected contributions to 2008 earnings for Exelon Generation, ComEd, and PECO in slides eight, nine, and ten of our earnings call materials. In our earnings release, we have provided much more detail regarding our financial and operational results. And with that, I will turn the call over to Ian McLean.
Ian P. McLean - President, Exelon Power Team and Executive Vice President, Exelon Corporation: Thanks, and good morning, everybody. Fortunately, the story I'll tell you makes a lot better reading than my stock portfolio right now, and I hope it is... hope yours is doing better than mine too. I'll make some comments about the fourth quarter market performance and provide my observations about what is currently happening in the market. If you note... please note on slides 11 and 12 that were issued as part of earnings release package, we did include a market snapshot showing commodity price movements for calendar 2008 and 2009 and the corresponding changes in implied market heat rates. The story is following years of steady upward price growth, gas prices have found a more stable range this past year. In PJM, we saw a forward heat rate expand in the second half of the year, which is a sign of the market experiencing tighter supply demand fundamentals as well as changes in the relationship between oil and gas. In ERCOT, the forward market heat rates declined throughout last year, but began to rise again in December. We believe this is due in part to the market anticipating a refinement in the ERCOT ancillary service procurement process, which took effect on January the 1st, 2008 for responsive reserves, and that is resulting in market prices, more reflective of the generation that is actually being dispatched. So far this year, we’re continuing to see stable prices in the forward gas in our markets and we anticipate further heat rate expansion. The composition of our portfolio should allow us to see the positive benefit of any further heat rate expansion in our unhedged position in the further out-years. Now turning to RPM, I'd like to make a brief comment about the upcoming auction. In the second and third quarter earnings calls, we provided you with the RPM clearing prices and commentary on our position relative to these clearing prices. 2010, 2011 auction just began on January the 21st and the clearing prices have not yet been posted. So I won't offer any more comments on that. But looking forward to the 2011 and 2012 auctions that will incur in May, we're hopeful that PJM will make a filing with FERC to increase the cost of new entry [inaudible] know as CON [ph]. There has been a lot of dialog in the PJM stakeholder process regarding the appropriate level of CON, but as of this moment, there is currently no certainty about what CON value will be in place for the May auction. As I said in the December investor conference, what has been under discussion in the stakeholder process of PJM was a CON value of approximately 290 megawatts a day. We believe that this is… $290 per megawatt day. We believe that this is important to have a CON values set at an appropriate level to achieve the desired result of attracting new build in the region, and the value of approximately $290 may not be sufficient to incent new peaking units, but it may support other unit types and is certainly a movement in the right direction. In terms of our hedge position, I'd just like to give you some date around that. Our financial hedge ranges through 2010 are; for 2008, 90% to 98%; target for 2009 is 70% to 90%; and 50% to 70% for 2010. But I told you in December that we ended the year at the mid point of our target range of the rate, the upper end of the target financial range for 2009, and above the range for 2010. The ComEd financial swap is the main factor of our being above the range in 2010. Generally speaking, however, these hedge ranges are designed to align with Excelon's cash flow requirements while allowing us to participate in the upside of favorable market conditions. I’d just like to end with a reminder that Excelon is in a unique position to benefit from improved power market fundamentals driven by rising capacity values and higher heat rates, and that's due to our large low cost, low emission, and exceptionally well run nuclear fleet. And now, I'd like hand the floor back to Mr. Rowe.
John W. Rowe - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you Ian. Good morning, everyone. I have a cold, so if I am croaking it is not depression over the state of the financial market, it’s just what’s in my chest and I apologize. I will of course add my own gloss on the fourth quarter results and '07 performance. I want to say a few words about the current economic environment, and I want to begin by commenting on John Young's departure to become Chief Executive Officer of Energy Future Holdings. As you all know, John was a significant contributor here at Exelon and we will miss him. We wish him best. Frankly, I also take pride in the fact that an aggressive outfit like that wants one of our people to run it. But what I really want to comment on is… was stimulated by a couple of articles around succession issues here at Excelon. We don't have and aren't' haunted by a succession issue. First, I plan to be here at least several more years. Second, we have a deep bench. You will see that as we announce the succession to John in this position. If I were for some reason hit by the proverbial bus, beer truck, or some other kind of truck, which is what's always used for the emergency discussion in Board meetings, we have several people who could step in on a temporary and perhaps on a permanent basis. Third, as we go through the course of this year and early next, if my Board decides to look outside for a successor, there will be no shortage of highly qualified applicants. I simply have the very best job in the electricity business and you would be surprised how many people have found excuses to jingle my phone since John's renouncement. So the real point I want to make is that Board and I regularly discuss succession, pardon me. Those discussions will be accelerated sometime this year and next. We don't need to do some kind of M&A transaction to solve a succession issue. There is only one criterion around here for transactions, that is value creation for our shareholders and our customers. As to replacing John, I have made my recommendations to our Governance Committee. It will meet on the next Monday, and I expect that at Tuesday's Board meeting we will announce how we are restaffing and restructuring our finance department. But let me say that between Matt Hilzinger and Michael Metzner, we have a great deal of quality in our finance department. You've gotten to know some of these people already and you will get to know more of them in the near future. Turning to the results, it is hard for me to display the proper air of jubilation in the kind of stock market we are in, but even a basset hound has to howl once in a while and we had the kind of year that we should be truly ecstatic about. For the seventh consecutive year, we improved both our operating earnings and our operating performance. Over the past seven years, our operating earnings have increased on average of about $0.12 per year and our dividend has increased on average of about 13% per year. If you want to look at our GAAP earnings, we turned in total earnings of $2.7 billion compared to about $1.6 billion in the prior year. I believe we not only had our best year ever, but probably one of the best in the entire history of the electricity industry and I'm terribly proud of what our team has done and what our unique set of assets are positioned to do. Consistent with our value return policy, we both raised the dividend form $1.76 to $2 per share in December and last year we announced two separate share repurchases, one for $1.25 billion in September and another one for $500 million in December. We anticipate completing the $1.25 billion repurchase in February and we'll execute the $500 million share repurchase shortly thereafter. I've asked Mr. Metzner why he isn't doing it today, but he says we can't while we are finishing the $1.25 billion. And so you haven't given us this wonderful opportunity. As we indicated at our Investor Conference in December, we expect to have cash available this year for additional buybacks beyond what we have already approved, and of course any additional share repurchase requires Board approval. Exelon's financial success rests upon three things, all are essential, its operating performance, its financial discipline, and its package of legal and regulatory skills. We watch all three of these drivers all of the time, and 2007 showed how well we can do that. Starting with our nuclear performance, in 2007 Chris Crane and his nuclear team achieved an average capacity factor of 94.5%, an all-time record for this company and our fifth consecutive year above 93%. It's only three years ago we were telling you all that Chris would be a fine successor to Oliver Kingsley in the nuclear program. I think in those three years Chris has become almost the senior statesmen of the nuclear industry and we're very proud of what he has done. The industry average capacity factor for last year was approximately 90% compared to our 94.5% with the previous fleet. Exelon's generating units produced 955,000-megawatt hours more than the previous record established in 2006. Safety and environmental performance at Exelon nuclear also improved, with the plants reporting their lowest industrial exited rate and lowest number of unplanned automatic shutdowns ever. But our success is not just a matter of good leadership, although Chris has given that. It's not just a matter of hard work, although lots of people in nuclear give that. It's also a matter of continued investment. We’ve put over $400 million a year in non-fuel investment into our nuclear fleet since the year 2000. We have upgraded our fleet by more than 1100 megawatts, with approximately 200 megawatts more in the works over the next few years. We are working hard to complete the license renewal of Oyster Creek. We have also begun work on a combined construction and operating license application for a potential nuclear plant in Victoria County, Texas. Of course, our decision to actually build that facility is still ways off and depends on many things, including very largely federal funding of the loan guarantees included in the 2005 Energy Policy Act. Mark Schiavoni and his team continued to operate our fossil plant's economic [inaudible] safety. Mark's team also operates our Conowingo Hydroelectric Station in Maryland and the Fairless Hills Station in Pennsylvania. In the last 20... in the last two years, we brought an additional 24 megawatts online at Conowingo bringing its total capacity to 572 megawatts. Fairless Hills in turn is the second largest landfill gas energy generation facility in the country. Fairless captures methane and uses it to generate electricity. In the last five years, capacity at Fairless Hills has increased more than 40%. Of course, with landfill methane that is not a huge number of megawatts. Our best-in-class nuclear fleet and our growing portfolio of renewable energy has made Exelon one of the largest low carbon electricity generators in the United States. Our power team lead by Ian McLean, whom you have already heard some, delivered another distinguished performance in turning our operations into commercial success. They also successfully managed our participation in the PJM RPM auction and will continue to do so in 2008. Ian, Gen Kornwoo [ph] and Joe Dominguez [ph] negotiated the finals swap... financial swap contract with ComEd as part of the settlement agreement in the State of Illinois. This contract protects the value of the generation by allowing ExGen to continue to sell its output into a competitive marketplace. Because the financial swap only provides base load energy, it gives us a great energy hedge while leaving the capacity available to bid into the RPM auctions. As you recall, the settlement agreement also went into Generation tax and reduce the uncertainty around the conditions for ICC approval for transaction such as reorganizations and mergers. ComEd's reliability performance for the year, both for duration and frequency outage, was at or right around target due to an unusually high number of storms for the year. ComEd's handling of a major storm in August [inaudible] got over 600,000 customers was genuinely exceptional. In all, ComEd returned service to approximately 634,000 customers within five days, bringing back 75% of those affected in one day and 90% within 48 hours. Said ICC Chairman [inaudible], I think they did a wonderful job. As you know, we don't hear those words in Illinois a lot. ComEd successfully weathered one of the most severe regulatory and legislative storms that I have seen in my 24 years running electric utilities. And after over two years of conflict last quarter ComEd reached a comprehensive rate lease settlement with the State of Illinois. While it was costly, the settlement at last resolved many of the issues arising from a hint of the transition period in Illinois, while protecting the vital interests of the company, its shareholders, and our customers. ComEd filed a distribution rate case with the ICC in October, made an energy efficiency filing in November, and reached a very favorable transmission rate settlement with the FERC. ComEd is engaged on all fronts and is beginning down its road to financial recovery. Frank Clark, Anne Pramaggiore, and John Castello all deserve enormous credit for what has been accomplished at ComEd. In Pennsylvania, Dennis O'Brien, Lisa Crutchfield, and their colleagues are delivering good returns, improving their delivery performance and coping with a new set of challenges in that jurisdiction. PECO's year-end reliability numbers were better than target and its outage frequency results in the City of Philadelphia reaching at all time best. PECO successfully managed a very warm summer, including an extreme heat wave in August. It also experienced nine of its top 15 peak days this summer without significant incidents. Earlier this year, Governor Rendell announced the far-reaching Energy Independence Initiative to address the impact of rate transitions in Pennsylvania on customers and to establish Pennsylvania as a leader in the use of low-carbon energy technologies. The Governor's initiative made little progress during the regular legislative session. So in September, he called a special session to take up the matter again. Now, more than 60 bills have been introduced. Many of these would advance conservation and total load management, which we support subject to economic limitations. Others will impose unacceptable rate caps for taxes on our Generation business. It now appears that the legislature will have to take up these issues again in the session that started last week. I remain confident that Dennis and Lisa will find a workable resolution, one that provides transitional relief for customers, but preserves competition and continues to move Pennsylvania forward on a low-carbon agenda. Now, after one swallow of water I want to address the recent decline in our share price. As you all know even better than we do, stocks are down sharply across the board. The Dow Industrials are down about 10% so far this year. Exelon with a number of our peers was strong early in January, but has surely not been spared the pain in the last week. Our shares are now also down about 10% year-to-date. Of course, no company and no stock is 100% safe in a market where there are increasing concerns about a deep economic slowdown. But Exelon's financials, its operation, its market fundamentals, and its competitive positions are stronger than they have ever been. As Ian discussed, our generation is nearly completely hedged this year and partly hedged in 2009 and 2010. Forward natural gas prices, upon which so much of the electricity market rests, out through 2011 have only increased since we last spoke with you in December. Forward markets’ implied heat rates as Ian discussed and capacity prices in PJM are up as well, reflecting continuing tightening in reserve margins. Carbon remains a front and center issue both in Washington and on the campaign trail, and at least some of our presidential candidates are competing as to how far they can go. Our operations, both in generation and T&D are in the best shape they've ever been. The delivery companies are the most reliable, they have been in a long time, and our nuclear fleet continues to set records for productivity. As the most cost advantaged energy source available, our nuclear fleet is passable under almost every conceivable set of market conditions. Finally, our financing condition is stronger that it has ever been. We have ample liquidity and ample access to short and long-term capital at reasonable prices to both maintain and to grow this business. In short, I believe that Excelon is extraordinary well positioned even in this uncertain market and economic environment. We will now take your questions. Question and Answer
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is coming from John Kiani from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
John Kiani - Deutsche Bank: John, I know you already made some comments on M&A with respect to succession planning in your opening remarks, but in the past I think you have highlighted certain regions that you may want more exposure to. Can you give us your latest thoughts on this please?
John W. Rowe - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Sure, but they don't changed much. I mean... I think we learned our lesson in PJM East where [inaudible] being there as we can afford to be, that's also true in the Illinois area. There may be some attractive opportunities in PJM West, but that remains to be seen. Obviously, we're interested in parts of the areas to the south of PJM and interested in areas to the west. You all got your speculations as to who we're talking to. I’ve sat around at an EEI meeting not long ago and it was hard to identify anybody I haven't talked to at one time or the other. A key thing from our point of view is we're always interested, we're always careful, and it's always about value. We just... we look at our model and we don't see anybody equally well positioned. So a deal really has to make sense on a whole lot of factors or we're just not going to do one and we're not going to identify… the surest way to make certain we couldn't do something would be to identify a preferred alternative in a call like this. There are lots of companies out there that makes sense under certain price conditions. There is no company that makes sense under any price condition, and so we will just go forward in our usual hard-boiled way. But I have never flinched on the proposition that this industry needs to consolidate. You take our estimated numbers for a two-unit nuclear project in Texas, they're about the same size as the total equity on our balance sheet. When you look at other companies, the challenge of building projects like that is even larger. So the need to have real scale to deal with the decisions of the future remains obvious. It's also something that one can only get in very careful negotiations. If it turns out that there is nothing available in the next several years, then what might work will be is either pick one of my colleagues from inside or do a search outside and find a successor to me when the time is right. It's not one of our... our constant attention is what can we do and will it bring real value to Exelon. I at my 24th anniversary on January 9 running utilities, I was about valuing year one and I am still about valuing year 25, and pretty soon I hope you believe me.
John Kiani - Deutsche Bank: Thanks for the comments, John.
Chaka Patterson - Vice President, Investor Relations: Next question please.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Hugh Wynne from Sanford Bernstein.
John W. Rowe - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Hugh.
Hugh Wynne - Sanford Bernstein: Hi. I have a question for Ian. I was wondering whether in your view the FERC's approval of Duquesne’s withdraw from PJM could have a material impact on capacity prices going forward, and also whether that might trigger further withdrawals by distribution companies? I know even the ICC and Illinois has expressed some doubt about the value of the PJM capacity market to its customers.
Ian P. McLean - President, Exelon Power Team and Executive Vice President, Exelon Corporation: I think that FERC handled it in the right way, which was that Duquesne legally can't leave the PJM footprint and join another RTO if they so desire, but they have to step up to any obligations they currently have on their capacity pricing. We were happy with that outcome because we think it preserves the integrity of the market that people can't walk away from obligations. I don't foresee any particular change in the pricing as a result of that. And in terms of probably the last thing from a regulatory standpoint, there is a tension because there are people who feel RPM is an unnecessary payment and you can pick which side of that fence you want to be on. But the fact is, if you listen to [inaudible], which I know you did, the heat rates are starting to rise and new generation meets to get built and that signal needs to be there in one form or another whether you call it a high energy price or energy plus RPM, however you do it. We happen to think RPM works well, but it's an ongoing debate and probably always will be an ongoing debate, but I think the integrity of the market is intact as a result of FERC's decision.
Hugh Wynne - Sanford Bernstein: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Daniele Seitz from Dahlman Rose. Please go ahead.
Daniele Seitz - Dahlman Rose: Okay. Share repurchases for this year, this is not included in your guidance I am assuming?
John W. Rowe - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: We couldn't here the beginning of you comment, Daniele.
Daniele Seitz - Dahlman Rose: So sorry, share repurchases, you mentioned that you will have sufficient cash to really consider another repurchase of shares, and I was wondering if this was included in your guidance or not included or possibly partially included?
John W. Rowe - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: I think the answer is it was not, isn't it Mike. Additional repurchases?
Michael R. Metzner - Vice President, Investor Relations and Shareholder Services: Well, the range between 400 to 440 has the impact of the 1.25 billion that we're in process of executing, the $500 billion announced and some impact for an estimate of what we don't have approval for yet, but we have a placeholder in for '08 any additional buybacks. But just to note, that these aren't big cents per share numbers because it has to be offset by the financing cost. So we're talking about a few pennies, Daniele.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Jonathan Arnold from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
John W. Rowe - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Jonathan.
Jonathan Arnold - Merrill Lynch: Good morning. I just wanted ask a question about the item you had for the gains in the nuclear decommissioning funds. Last quarter we had… I guess it was a change in the liability that was called as a special item and this was related I think to changing the investment strategy specifically on AmerGen. So does it... is that... are all your funds now aligned on the same strategy or are there other gains or losses that might be caused by the other funds outside of the AmerGen funds? How should we just think about that item in the context of your guidance for this year and going forward?
Matthew F. Hilzinger - Senior Vice President and Corporate Controller: You're right on the third quarter, the ARO, which is the decommissioning obligation connected with the plant. That was the income in the third quarter, and we traditionally go through that annually and so you'll see that… each year we kind of go through and do that decommissioning study from a liability standpoint. Michael Metzner and his team goes through… each year he takes a look at the asset liability study, and given the probability of the license extensions and the excess funds that we have, we felt that it was appropriate to go through and rebalance those funds from less equity to more fixed income, and that's what we did. We'll continue to do that on a periodic basis, and that was actually done in December. And I think we did something similar to that a few years ago. But Mike, I don't know if you wanted to add anything to that.
Michael R. Metzner - Vice President, Investor Relations and Shareholder Services: No, I think... that 's exactly right. This is a pretty big reallocation from equity and fixed in the decommissioning trust as we reassess the economic life and regulatory life of those plans. And the trusts are in pretty good shape, so it may tend to begin allocate more of that to safer investments, actually it looked like pretty good timing. So that is what that is about.
Jonathan Arnold - Merrill Lynch: But that was specific to AmerGen I think.
Michael R. Metzner - Vice President, Investor Relations and Shareholder Services: Yes. That's right. The AmerGen is a carpet that gets bubbled up to the consolidated numbers. That's right.
Jonathan Arnold - Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thank you.
Chaka Patterson - Vice President, Investor Relations: Next question please.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Rudy Tolentino from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
John W. Rowe - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Rudy Tolentino - Morgan Stanley: Expedited review of any reorganization or transaction relation to ComEd, since you brought that up what is your plan for pursuing that and what milestones should we be looking for?
John W. Rowe - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: We think about it all the time. I think the answer you'll get is the same you got in December. Obviously, one factor that is very important to us is that whether ComEd is treated in our view fairly in the forthcoming rate case decision, that's probably the biggest single milestone. But the real point is we watch things like Entergy’s spin-off of its nuclear plants in other jurisdictions. We talked to investor banker... investment bankers about the potential value of separation. If we continue not to find a convincing case to separate, we continue to think that there is value in having these companies together. If we get to the point where there is unequivocal reasons to believe that the retail companies can't be treated fairly under that umbrella, then of course we will have to make the other decision, but we do not see that at the present time.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question is coming from Paul Patterson from Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.
John W. Rowe - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, Paul.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates: Good morning, guys. With the... just a follow-up on Jonathan's question, and just sort of a further on some of these items. With respect to the unrealized gains and losses on nuclear decommissioning trust funds, it looks like you guys are going to be excluding that going forward from operating earnings and it looks to me like it was included in operating this quarter, just sort of get a feel for how we should going forward look at that? And also, in terms of the favorable income tax benefit from a change in I think the method of capitalizing overhead costs, could you just explain what that is and how that might impact earnings going forward, how we should model that instead of shadow contributions? What we should sort of expecting with respect to that going forward?
Matthew F. Hilzinger - Senior Vice President and Corporate Controller: Yes, let me start on the decommissioning funds. We have... right now we do include unrealized losses in our income statement. Unrealized gains are not allowed under GAAP. However, with the adoption of 159 in January we are going to be able to… in fact we are going to elect to include both unrealized gains and unrealized losses in our income statement, but we go to treat it like a mark-to-market because it's really timing and any realized gains or losses or what will include in operating earnings. So we're going to just put everything below the line that’s unrealized and let that float much like the mark-to-market that you see in the energy side. So with respect to--.
John W. Rowe - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: In other words both sides will be in GAAP.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates: Both sides will be in GAAP?
John W. Rowe - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: And both sides will be on unrealized, both sides will be out of operating… unrealized, both sides will be in operating, and unrealized will be in GAAP.
Matthew F. Hilzinger - Senior Vice President and Corporate Controller: That's correct. I'd be happy to walk through that with anybody after this call. With respect to the overhead cost, it’s really a one-time event based on some years… I think it was 2001 through 2005, it’s a one-time event with the settlement. So the $0.06 is really something that you ought to just think about as a one-time item. There will be a little bit of a P&L in the out-years, but it really shouldn't be much and there will be up a moderate amount of our cash that we would expect to receive as part of this, but it is probably about $130 million and that will come in over the next year or two. Paul, does that answer your question?
Unidentified Company Representative: The treatment foundation--.
Matthew F. Hilzinger - Senior Vice President and Corporate Controller: The treatment of the foundation, we did treat foundations as operating earnings because that is very consistent with how we treat all contributions. So we treat all contributions through operating and so we treated this as operating as well. It's hard to say whether in the future we will have another contribution or endowment to the foundation, but we thought it was best and most consistent to include this in operating earnings.
John W. Rowe - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Let me just make one comment to put this in context, Paul. If you recall, back in December at the conference we said… we reaffirmed our guidance of 415 to 430. We said we’d come in at the high end of that, maybe even through that by a couple of pennies. It really related to some timing of items out of '08 and into '07, and the biggest of those was this change in methodology around overhead and that tax item. So that shifted, I don't know $0.05 or $0.06 from ’08 to '07, which is partly why we came… which is why we came through that high end of the guidance. The foundation, negative $0.05, and they realized gains from the rebalancing in AmerGen essentially offset each other. They are both in operating, but they essentially offset each other. So the story really here is that we were helped by the timing of this item, but we are also reaffirming '08 numbers because of... it's very, very early in the year to do anything there and we're comfortable with the range that we put out there. Next question.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Dan Eggers. Please go ahead.
Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse: Good morning. Just with some of the concerns about the economic slowdown and Washington's focus on steamless packages and that sort of thing, John I wonder you could share what you’re hearing and kind of your thoughts on what the distraction could mean by way of getting money for loan guarantees on the nuclear development side of the business and also if that may slow any sort of momentum for carbon policy?
John W. Rowe - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: I think those are two very different answers. As you know, in the [inaudible], additional funds were authorized for the loan guarantee program, some people called it the Senate’s thank you gift to Senator Domenici for years of service. So it has been one shot that I think is now pretty solid. But it has to be thought that how much funding there will be for this loan program is very much up in the air as we look forward not only because of the stimulus package in the economy but because of the pending presidential elections. So I don't really think we're going to have any thing we can take to the bank, that's a funny phrase in this economy, on that until sometime in mid-2009. Now here is the way we have coped with that at Exelon. Our Board is authorized a $100 billion to be spent on our nuclear project through sometime in mid-to-late 2009. We did that so we could work on the licenses. We did that so we could get a place in line on forgings in Japan and that sort of thing. So we're writing nearly all of those expenditures off as we don’t… in other words we're trying to take the very conservative approach that we just don't know until we get into 2009. Now I'm am also Chairman of the Nuclear Energy Institute this year and I can assure you that NEI has at the very top of its agenda getting those loan guaranteed program funded, but frankly your guess is as good as mine in the current political environment. Now carbon I think is an altogether different matter. I think the potential for carbon legislation only increases. Whether it’s 2009 or 2010, I can't say. I just said 2009… Betsy Moler who knows better says that nothing much happens in the first year of a new administration. She has been there, I haven't, but there is so much evidence and so much passion around this topic that to me is inconceivable there won’t be legislation. The real question in my mind is not whether there will be legislation, it's what they do in the early year. There is almost sure to be legislation with some very dramatic 30-years goal and 50-year goal. The issue is, will they enact the legislation in a way that creates orderly markets in carbon abatement allowance prices starting as soon as possible. We at Exelon favor for all sorts of reasons that the new program should start as early as possible, that it should start with some kind of cost containment mechanism so that prices don't go whackers in the early years, but that it should start with a definitive track because we think the ultimate cost of a change here is going to be somewhere between $50 and $100 a ton and we don't think cost at that level should be imposed by the economy in the early years, but we think you have two have an orderly progression that gets fuel cost on that as well. Now I heard Roger Altman [ph] who was in the Bill Clinton Treasury Department speak at EEI the other day. He said, either major democratic candidate will likely impose… propose a legislation that is more severe than Levermann Warner [ph] and not less. So I don't think you're going to see Congress backing away from the need for carbon legislation. The issue is how soon the legislation takes effect and how orderly is the market it creates on the road to dealing with this very expensive problem.
Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse: Thank you.
John W. Rowe - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: So you got a very different answer out of two questions.
Chaka Patterson - Vice President, Investor Relations: Next question please.
Operator: Our final question is coming from Paul Ridzon from Keybanc. Please go ahead.
John W. Rowe - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Paul.
Paul Ridzon - Keybanc Capital Markets: Most of my questions are just... I think I heard you say that the CFO position is now a two-horse race, is that of two internal candidates, is that fair?
John W. Rowe - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: That's not fair. I... you heard me say I've made my recommendations to the Governance Committee. I expect it to act on them on Monday, and on Tuesday I expect the Board to make its selection from the proposals I've made. And I anticipate that they will agree with my recommendations. Incident… the two people you call horses in a race are both keepers, this is not a claiming stage. Matt and Mike are very, very important people in our long-term future and as long as I am around here they will both have roses to wear around their neck, I’m not sure they look good in roses. Now, just to go back, I don't see how we could have had a better 2007. Whether it's the operating front, or financial front, or the legal and political front, honest to god I don't think any utility ever had a better year. Now, we've told you in December that our expectations for 2008 are relatively flat, that's the reality. I've looked at some forecast integrated with 15% growth expectation in the recession with annual rate cases, let’s not kid ourselves. I just don't believe there is a utility out there whose fundamentals are better than ours for 2008 based on the reasons we’ve put earlier in the statement. And we are working very hard on every way we know how to get your the best possible results in 2008. That's really what we do about here, and we haven't stopped being committed to it. Thank you so much.
Chaka Patterson - Vice President, Investor Relations: Thank you, operator.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Chaka Patterson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin your conference.
Chaka Patterson - Vice President, Investor Relations: Thank you, it's sir but that's okay. Good morning, and welcome to Exelon third quarter 2007 earnings review and conference call update. Thank you for joining us today. We issued our earnings release this morning. The release also contains a slide presentation that will accompany John Young's remarks. The slides can be found at the end of the earnings release package. If you haven't receive it, the release is available on the Exelon website, at www.exeloncorp.com, or you can all Dolaras Modia [ph] at 312-394-5222, and she will fax or email the release to you. This call is being recorded and will be available through November 9th by dialing 877-519-4471. International call in number is 973-341-3080. The confirmation code is 9302966. In addition, the call will be archived on the Exelon website. Before we begin today's discussion, let me remind you that the earnings release and other matters we discuss in today's call contains forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for discussions of factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecast and expectations. In our press release and during this call, we will discuss adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings that exclude the earnings impact of mark-to-market adjustments from economic hedging activities. Significant impairments of intangible assets, including goodwill, significant changes in decommissioning obligation estimates, investments in synthetic fuel producing facilities, cost associated with the Illinois Electric Rate settlement including ComEd's previously announced customer rate relief, certain costs associated with the terminated merger with PSEG for 2006 only, severance charges for 2006 only, gain or losses on the State Line and Tenaska transactions, and other unusual items including significant future changes to GAAP. We believe these adjusted operating earnings are representative of the underlying operational results of the company. In today's earnings release, we provided a reconciliation between reported GAAP earnings and adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings. With me today are John Rowe, Exelon's Chairman, President, and CEO; John Young, Exelon's Executive Vice President, Finance and Markets and Chief Financial Officer; other member of Exelon Senior Management Team; members of the Generation Company's Senior Management Team; ComEd's Senior Management Team; and PECO Senior Management Team: who will be available to answer your question. Because we will see many of you at Edison Electric Institute Financial Conference, the first week in November, today's call will focus primarily on third quarter 2007 financial and operational results. At EEI we will expand on our outlook for the remainder of 2007, discuss operational and financial drivers for 2008 and the next five years and provide a more detailed view of the key issues facing the Company. We have scheduled an hour for this call, we will spend about 30 minutes on prepared remarks and use the remaining time for Q&A. In order to effectively manage this call, we would appreciate if you would limit yourself to only one question. I will now turn the call over to John Young who will discuss our financial results for the quarter.
John F. Young - Executive Vice President, Finance and Markets, and Chief Financial Officer: Thank you, Chaka. Good morning, everyone. As part of our earnings release package, we include slides that I will refer to during my remarks. These slides highlight, both, the earnings for the quarter and year-to-date. My remarks, as they usually do, will focus on the quarter and our outlook for the balance of the year. Beginning with slide 3, Exelon announced third quarter 2007 adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings of $823 million or $1.21 per diluted share, an increase from third quarter 2006 operating earnings of $690 million or $1.02 per diluted share. On a GAAP basis, Exelon reported consolidated earnings of $780 million or $1.15 per share for the third quarter of 2007. One of the main differences between GAAP and non-GAAP operating earnings during the quarter was the $0.12 charge related to the cost associated with the Illinois settlement. As I mentioned on the second quarter call, we believe these costs reflect a one-time event associated with Illinois' transition to a competitive market, and we plan to exclude these cost for future operating earning. These costs would be expensed as credits are issued to customers over time. For a complete reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP earnings, please refer to the tables that accompanied the earnings release. Consistent with the first half of the year, Exelon strong performance for the third quarter was driven primarily by increased earnings in Exelon Generation which were partially offset by the extent of decrease in ComEd's earnings. PECO's earnings during the quarter were also up compared to the last year. Turning the slide 4, Exelon Generation contributed $0.90 of operating earning per diluted Exelon share in the third quarter of 2007 compared to $0.51 for the same period in 2006. The major driver of Generation operating earnings growth during the quarter was higher wholesale margins as a result of tree items: the end of the below market PPA with ComEd, a contractual price increase associated with the PECO PPA, and favorable portfolio and market conditions, including higher realized market prices and capacity revenues. As I indicated in the second quarter earnings call, the benefit associated with capacity revenues were partially offset by the negative impact of marginal loss pricing by PJM. We estimate that marginal loss pricing add about $10 million to $15 million pretax impact per month on Generation revenues. This is about a $0.01 to $0.015 per share each month. I'll remind you that marginal loss pricing was implemented by PJM on June 1, 2007; therefore, Generation was not impacted by marginal losses during the first five months of the year. During the third quarter Generation also benefited from one less nuclear refueling outage compared to the same period last year. This positive impact can be seen, both, in higher margins, as a result of higher nuclear volumes, and in lower outage cost during the quarter. These benefits were partially offset by lower hydro generation due to the limited rainfall in Mid-Atlantic... The affects of labor-related inflation and nuclear plant development cost associated with our construction and operating license application in Texas. While it did not yet impact third quarter earnings, I will spend a movement on the termination of the State Line purchase power agreement that we announced last week. Under the terms of the PPA, Exelon Generation purchased the output from State Line, a 515 megawatt coal-fired facility located near Hammond, Indiana through 2012. Upon close of the termination agreement, Exelon Generation will receive $233 million in cash and will no longer receive the output associated with State Line, which is roughly 3 million to 3.5 million megawatt hours a year, depending on operational performance. The PPA is a non-strategic asset in Generation's portfolio and termination will provide us with immediate cash flow. We expect to record an after-tax gain of around $130 million during the fourth quarter of this year. This gain will be excluded from our operating earnings. Although, we have not provided earnings guidance beyond 2007, we expect a negative after-tax earnings impact of about $30 million to $35 million beginning in 2008 extending through the end of the original contract term of 2012. That's roughly $0.05 per year. Turning now to ComEd on slide 5; in the third quarter of 2007, ComEd contributed $0.10 per Exelon share compared to $0.33 during the same period of 2006. ComEd's decrease in earnings was expected and was due primarily to the impact of the end of the regulatory transition period in Illinois. The company also experienced higher storm costs during the quarter, as a result of devastating thunderstorms that hit the ComEd service territory late in August. These storms were some of the worst on record for the company. John Rowe will talk more about ComEd's response and restoration efforts in a moment. On the positive side, ComEd benefited from warmer weather during quarter, an increase revenues associated with ComEd's delivery service rate case that was concluded in December of '06 and an increase in revenues associated with the Company's 2007 transmission rate case. Weather, during the third quarter of 2007, was $0.01 favorable to ComEd's earnings compared to the third quarter of 2006 but about $0.02 favorable to normal level. On slide 6 and 7, we provide a summary of ComEd's transmission case settlement agreement that was filed with FERC earlier this month. FERC's approval of a formula-based transmission rate would establish a reasonable framework for timely recovery of transmission investment on an annual basis, in the step one of ComEd's regulatory recovery plan. And second, and even more important, step of this plan is ComEd's recent distribution rate filing with the older recoveries commission. In this rate filing, ComEd requested an increase of $361 million in its annual revenue requirement to allow for continued expansion upgrades to its distribution system to meet the growing demand for electricity in the ComEd service territory. Additional details on ComEd's distribution rate filing and tentative schedule are provided on slide 8 and 9. ComEd's ability to deliver reliable service is dependent on being able to recover its cost through fair and reasonable rating. ComEd's 2007 earned return on equity is projected to be between 3.5% and 4.5%, which is substantially below the allowed ROE by the ITC, or ComEd's distribution business and the FERC... or ComEd's transmission business. Primary reason for the difference in the earned versus allowed return is regulatory lag or the availability to recover current year costs. ComEd's operating costs and rate base have increased substantially over 2004 cost which was the test year for... and pro forma capital adjustments through 2005 that was used in the last rate case. ComEd's current rate case before the ITC is based on the 2006 test year plus planned capital investment through the third quarter of 2008. In addition, ComEd is seeking approval of riders that will allow for faster recovery of certain expenditures. A combination of these should be a step in the right direction towards minimizing regulatory lag and improving ComEd's financial condition. We will talk more about ComEd's regulatory recovery plan and ETR. Now turning to PECO on slide no 10, PECO's contribution to operating earnings for the third quarter of 2007 was $0.25 per Exelon share compared to $0.21 during the same period of 2006. During the quarter PECO benefited from slow growth, a reduction in reserves for PURTA property taxes and the absence of storm costs as compared to last year. Recall that numerous storms hit PECO's service territory last summer, including the worst summer storm in PECO's history mid-July... during mid-July of 2006. At the corporate level, ComEd storm costs for this quarter were more than offset by the absence of the 2006 PECO storm costs. Impact of PECO's favorable earnings drivers was offset primarily by scheduled increase in PECO's CTC amortization and the absence of a 2006 favorable tax settlement. The impacts of weather at PECO during the third quarter of 2007 were flat when compared to the same period of 2006, and were about $0.01 favorable to normal weather. Please refer to the tables that accompany the earnings release for additional detail regarding our third quarter results. Coming to slide 11 and our outlook for 2007, with three quarter of strong financial and operating performance behind us, we are reaffirming Exelon's non-GAAP operating earnings guidance ranges for 2007 at $4.15 to $4.30 per share, which represents the top half of the range of our original 2007 guidance. We are also reaffirming operating earnings guidance for each of the operating purposes. The ranges are provided on the slide. We are revising our GAAP earnings guidance to $3.90 to $4.20 per share from $3.70 to $4 per share, primarily to reflect the gain from State Line. Both Exelon's operating earnings and GAAP earnings guidance are based on the assumption of normal weather for the balance of the year. Moving to slide 12, where we summarize the results of the third RPM auction. Our 9500 megawatts of capacity in Eastern MAAC are committed to serve our load obligations including the PECO load obligation and will not benefit from these capacity prices. However, our uncommitted paid capacity in the Midwest where we see primarily the rest of market capacity price for the auction beginning on June 1,, 2009. The majority of our Midwest capacity in uncommitted, only a limited portion of our Midwest capacity was committed through the underlying load auction through the end of May 2006. Given our large low cost, low emissions and exceptionally well run nuclear fleet, Exelon is in a unique position to benefit from improving power market fundamentals, driven by rising capacity values and higher usage. We plan to talk more about this at EEI when we update our 2008 un-hedged or open EBITDA position. Before I turn the call over to John Rowe, I will remind you that our annual investor conference will be on December 19th in New York at the [indiscernible]. Additional details on this issue will be coming out from Investor Relations soon. At this meeting, we plan to provide overall 2008 earnings guidance by operating company, 2008 sources and uses of cash, regulatory and operational updates as well as our strategic outlook. With that I will turn the call over to John Rowe; I look forward to seeing many of you at EEI in Orlando.
John W. Rowe - Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, everyone, and thank you, John. As Chuck has told you we intend to talk about the future at EEI in very short time, so I am going to confine most of what I say to the third quarter in this year. At EEI we will try to give you the best picture we can as to next year and the longer term. We had a very strong quarter with year-over-year operating earnings up from $1.02 to $1.21 per share. As John said, we are reaffirming our operating earnings guidance $1.30 [ph] per share and we are delighted to be able to revise the GAAP guidance upward to $3.90 - $4.20 per share. We are very pleased that all of the characteristics that made up this operating performance. Personally, however, I am even more pleased that this has been a quarter when we have been able to commit to complete a wide variety of commitments too. We told you at the end of the second quarter that we expected our Illinois transaction to be confirmed in legislation. It was. Thanks to the hard work of Frank Clark, Darryl Bradford and the majority in their team. We told you at the end of the second quarter that the financial swap that we had entered into was a fairly valued transaction. I know many of you were concerned that that might not be so. Well, [Indiscernible] and their team work this contract out very favorably and we now have the numbers to illustrate that. We promised you that we were going to implement our value return policy and in August the Board approved it and we have executed that policy as is set forth in the press release. So, to me, the third quarter is not only a superb quarter operating wise, it's a superb quarter in the larger context of protecting the value which you all [indiscernible]. We are very proud of the work that Chris Crane, Chip Pardee and the Nuclear Group did. They achieved a capacity factor of 97% during the quarter. I don't think there is too many more percent left that you can get out of Chris. Mark Schiavoni and his Power Group excelled in operating our Fossil and Hydro Group: a commercial availability of 91.6% for fossil and an equivalent availability of 19.2% for hydro. And as usual, the Ian McLean, Jim [indiscernible] their whole team capitalized on our operating capabilities with their careful and sound behavior, in our mind. They also successfully managed our participation. At the Distribution company level, I can genuinely say that this is one of the best performances for ComEd that we have ever seen. Greg, Barry Mitchell and their operating team performed spectacularly in the face of one of the worst performance ComEd has experienced. ComEd reestablish service through approximately 634,000 customers, within five days bringing back 75% of those affected in the first day and 90% within 48 hours. This was a brief demonstration of ComEd's commitment to its customers, a brief demonstration of the improving capabilities of the ComEd operating management team. All of that work, we've been doing the last five years is starting to show at ComEd. Thousands of employees from throughout the company were engaged in this firm recovery, working 16 hours shifts to deploy service. I want to thank all of them for what they did. They also were helped by crews from utilities in six states: Missouri, Michigan, Texas, Tennessee, Kentucky, Pennsylvania. We appreciate the help, but in terms of management, I think, Barry Mitchell and John Costello did in recognizing the size of the problem quickly and calling for help quickly, really saved a day or two for our customers. John has already described ComEd, a settlement with the State of Illinois on July 24, 2007 which General Assembly approved on July 26, 2007 and the Government signed on August 28, 2007. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, ComEd has started nailing bills irregularly credit to customers. ComEd pushed to have energy efficiency standards and investments in the renewable energy part of the Illinois settlement. And we feel that these things have to be done, to the policies stated by the Governor as well as the larger needs of the state, and we wanted to make certain, we had proper cost recovery provisions in the legislation when it passed. Greenfield is a place where we have to go fairly often, but we don't choose to go all that long, pursuant to the settlement agreement ComEd will file its energy efficiency plan. During the third quarter ComEd launched its One Million Compact Fluorescent Lights Discount Program. To-date customers have already purchased about half of that supply. This discount CFL program is part of the ComEd care initiative. And it is the largest privately funded energy efficient lighting program. ComEd made a filing with the ICC seeking to have customers with demand of 100 kilowatts to 400 kilowatts, very competitive. This follow a statutory declaration that customers above 400 kilowatts were competitive as part of the Illinois settlement. The ICC recently approved the ComEd filing, what that means is that all customers whose demand is above 100 kilowatts are now declared competitive. A large portion Ian, I am sure, can give you the exact number of our customers now shopped regularly. This is a major action for us. Finally with the Illinois settlement and the ComEd was the first step for regulatory approval. As John described, ComEd reached a proposed settlement of its transmission rate case at the FERC and filed its Distribution case with Illinois Commerce Commission. We're pleased with the proposed FERC settlement and are optimistic about a positive outcome. Of course, I cannot overemphasize the importance of fair regulatory for ComEd. Over the years of the rate case and even now, we have invested an enormous amount of money in ComEd's distribution. We continue to do so, in order to handle the increased demand from customers and ensure reliable... an adverse regulatory decision will significantly impact additional investment... Turning to PECO, PECO's management has been engaged on all fronts. They have worked extraordinarily hard to manage extreme on this, PECO saw its electric demand peak at 6,525 megawatts, which is all time high. It experience 9 of its top 15 all time peak days this past summer. With extreme weather and the amazing response by both ComEd [indiscernible] proven as an example of why we have to make and continue to make substantial... PECO has currently been busy trying to manage the political situation as well. Earlier this year, Governor Edward Rendell announced an energy independence strategy that include proposed legislation to address potential rate increases and a variety of environmental agenda items. On September 17th the Pennsylvania State Legislature through a special session to consider elements of Governor Rendell's energy package. Special session run concurrently with the regular legislative session which is scheduled to be assessed in December. Last month PECO announced programs that it is prepared to implement and support Governor Rendell's and the General Assembly's commission addressing critical energy. This includes energy efficiency and price management, local resource development. The company is supporting a variety of steps to ease the transition to comparative markets and at the same time post positive energy policy. PECO supports the development of a legislative package to help customer manage rising energy prices and increasing environmentally friendly alternative power sources. Negotiation with the Rendell administration... are ongoing. I would like to point out that part of what is going on here is that the efforts of Exelon company to protect the value that we have created require us to be at active and public policy oriented course including changing energy needs of our state. We can't simply sit on what we have. We have to help, to solve the problem. That is what caused us to improve the efficiency program in the Illinois package, that is what motivates Dennis O'Brien, Rick Scottsville [ph] and their team to be working so closely with the [indiscernible]. In summary the generation and distribution companies have performed very well as... I believe, if you look at the whole array of what we have done in the past three months. We have delivered on a whole lot of things. And with that, we will continue to do so, in the forthcoming quarter. We'll now take questions. Question And Answer
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from John Kiani of Deutsche Bank.
John Kiani - Deutsche Bank: Good morning. We've heard the company talk about M&A recently and I'm trying to better understand the value proposition, do you think Exelon has the currency to do a larger deal when the stock isn't placing in the '11 uplift or carbon at this point? Can you talk through how you see that value proposition working?
John W. Rowe - Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer: Sure, John. We can't give a value proposition unless and until we have a proposal, you are not going to do something that we think distract from the value we created here. We understand as keenly as you do the value that we can add in 2011 and 2012. Protecting and getting something for it is at the heart at what we do around here. And so, obviously, you just don't stay... we'll see the currency is pretty good let's spend it, we are not made that way. On the other hand, we continue to believe that this industry is slowly and painfully consolidating. We think there are possibilities that will increase the robustness of our value and we keep looking at them. But we are not going to just give away that value that you just described. So, I can't tell you our transaction when I don't have a transaction to describe to you, I mean, I... I'm not good enough to sell something that I don't have to give you at the moment. Now, you know our basic policy on anything specific when we are looking at lest all the lawyers in the room rise up and strangle me is that we don't talk about it until and unless we have something specific to tell you about, and then we will respond to your questions about the value proposition. John we are simply not going to do something that we don't think capitalizes on that value in 2011 and 2012. I mean, I've been... I've lived for value now for damn near 24 years running utility, so I not see now, I didn't throw it away in some kind of old man's ego.
John Kiani - Deutsche Bank: Thanks, John.
Chaka Patterson - Vice President, Investor Relations: Next question, please.
Operator: Your next question comes from Paul Ridzon of Keybanc.
Paul Ridzon - Keybanc: Given your view that forwards aren't adequately reflecting rising heat rates and capacity values, are there any steps you could... in the financial engineering or contract renegotiations that you could implement to try to capture some of that value you see relative to your... what would be below market contracts?
John W. Rowe - Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer: While the answer is, of course, sure, the issue is all those other financial engineering is a wise thing to do. I mean the financial engineering in my view is largely an up to date term for what we call leverage in our use. And we are well aware that we have the capability to increase the leverage on our balance sheet. The issue is whether it's a good idea and increases your real value to do that sort of thing and we keep looking at different ways that might make worth while to do so. But remember there is a swirl of things going on here, there is, of course, rising heat rates, we just given a presentation on that to our Board. There is the issue of what natural gas prices are going to do in the next several years, and strangely we tend to be a little more bullish on that than some of the public forecast. But nonetheless it isn't real until it happens. We have given you our value return policy, we mean it. We will be looking at when and what the next increments of that policy should be between now and the end of the year, you can of course expect there is more roll up in the dividend as it normally does this time of year. We will have to look at what the right share buyback kinds of decisions for next year are as we get there, if we can't we'll give you a little better insights into that down EEI but these tend to be decisions that you get... you must have a grasp if the Board [ph] makes specific one. Philosophically, I look at this as increasingly a commodity price driven company. And I spend a fair amount of time studying how companies in the commodity business behave, and the ones who survive and do well for their investors in the long run tend not to be people who leverage themselves to the help every time the commodity looses grip. And in our case, you have not only the different factors affecting the commodity prices, you have constant need to deal with the political and regulatory issues that affect your value. So, that's why I used words like resilience and robust, I want this to be a company that you can count on.
Chaka Patterson - Vice President, Investor Relations: Next question please.
Operator: Your next question comes from Hugh Wynne of Sanford Bernstein.
Hugh Wynne - Sanford Bernstein: Hi, I wanted to ask a question or kind of a treasury sort. I was looking at the cash flow statement for the nine months --
Chaka Patterson - Vice President, Investor Relations: People I advise that we are not on video, how far your treasury source... on treasury resource?
Hugh Wynne - Sanford Bernstein: Good. The question is this, the cash from operations, excluding changes in working capital has increased enormously this year as a result of the growth in revenues in Illinois by about $850 million. Cash flow from operating activities is actually down a tad, because of the accumulation of investment or working capital, primarily related to collateral assets and liabilities and then also accounts receivable. And I was wondering if I could just get a little bit a light about what those very large cash movements mean, and when they will be reversed as I assume these collateral assets are associated with hedges?
John W. Rowe - Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, and Hugh I don't know if I can give you all the details, I might have to look at that and get back to you, but I think in general you're right that basic cash from operations is much stronger and higher than last year driven by... the same things that are driving earnings higher, meaning on the Generation side as result of the higher revenues from Generation margins and the expiration of the ComEd EPA. As far as the overall cash position it can also swing around a lot due to margining of cash in and out, and when we had hedges on the books and prices go up we're being margin, and that can move us $400 million, $500 million in either direction because we have quite a bit of volumes that we sell into the wholesale market bilaterally. So my presumption and we can go check that if that's the result of cash, margin cash out of the company, as a result the agreements with counterparties.
Hugh Wynne - Sanford Bernstein: Okay. As a result of that we would expect these cash flows to revert to positive as it begin to benefit from those higher prices on your sales, is that right?
John W. Rowe - Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes.
Hugh Wynne - Sanford Bernstein: Okay, thank you.
Chaka Patterson - Vice President, Investor Relations: Next question please.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jonathan Arnold of Merrill Lynch.
Jonathan Arnold - Merrill Lynch: Good morning.
John W. Rowe - Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, Jon.
Jonathan Arnold - Merrill Lynch: Can, I ask you guys to just comment a little on the specifics of the Carbon Bill that was recently put before congress and what in that you find to be acceptable and I know you have generally been in support of a lot of the proposed legislation but how could that be improved to be a better bill in your opinion?
John W. Rowe - Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer: Well there are pieces of that Bill that we like and pieces that we... I am troubled. And we would like... the fact is one more step towards comprehensively dealing with the problem because we think comprehensive gap and trade carbon legislation, we will deal with this problem more effectively and at less cost than simply throwing money at every new renewable is some obvious like. We do not think ethanol is the only scandal with [Indiscernible] in this book. So, we strongly like the gap in trade approach. We like the fact that the, people in Water Bill doesn't just give all the allocations away for free. We had no wish to place unnecessary burdens on states or companies that are more coal dependent than we are, but at the same time our investors and our customers have learned the burdens of a relatively clean fleet for a great many years and we don't think somebody else is entitled to permanently lower prices because they put more stuff up in the air. So, we like the way that we've been learning our dealing with partners. Our biggest questions on this bill involve this sort of new Federal Reserve Bank NOI that they put in place of the kind of safety valve that the Bigham Inspector [ph] Bill has. We are strong supporters of the safety bill concept. We do not think the nation's economy can afford, we do not think the utility industry can afford, to have a bill where the price impacts in the early years are just utterly unknown. So, I don't suppose given the dynamics of the Senate at the moment that the Bigham Inspector safety bill provision will just get added into the Liberman-Warner, I think there will be some complicated set of guidelines. But this sort of Federal Reserve Bank concept won't work unless the legislation contains some guidelines on how this new entity should use floors of ceilings to make certain that carbon is priced into the market in an orderly way and not in a chaotic way. That maybe more than you wanted to know about Liberman-Warner, the bill is of course very long very complicated in that and that there is infinite number of things about it that I don't understand yet. But that's my view as of the moment.
Jonathan Arnold - Merrill Lynch: Thank you, John.
Operator: Your next question comes from Rudy Tolentino from Morgan Stanley. Sorry about that.
Rudy Tolentino - Morgan Stanley: Hi. In your press release, higher labor costs were account for Nickel determent to earnings, can you comment on whether or not it's from your existing employee base or just a reflection of higher contract labor costs and if it is due to higher craft labor, can you give me an idea of how that's trending.
John F. Young - Executive Vice President, Finance and Markets, and Chief Financial Officer: John Young, I think the answer I yes, yes and yes. But John --
John W. Rowe - Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer: And I think and I'll have go back to look at the table that you are referring to but yes to all of the questions but last year we had an offset in ONM expenses related to some one-time recoveries as of DST case that we attributed to last year. So you have a... an increase that looks bigger than the otherwise would look, but yes we are seeing normal kind of inflation related labor cost increases year-over-year, that are in the 3 percentage point ranges.
Rudy Tolentino - Morgan Stanley: It's just more on your, for your... the employee end or just more on the craft labor end, for outages?
John W. Rowe - Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer: It's actually booked. Obviously we have that built into our labor contracts and then... and maybe Chris Crane, might want to talk to the outage cost of labor specifically.
Christopher M. Crane - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: The outage labor costs are standard or average escalation is 3.5% to 4% a year. Our material cost has been a little bit higher, they've been averaging about 7% a year. But year-over-year we have adjustment in work scopes based off of cycles that the reactors are in. If we are on a ten-year cycle like we are, a PWRs right now we are doing more extensive inspections that will drive our costs and they'll balance out over the period.
Rudy Tolentino - Morgan Stanley: Okay, so the higher outage costs for this year is looked to the ten year reactor inspections do you think?
Christopher M. Crane - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer: That's partially is with escalations coming in on inflation as it's grown to.
Rudy Tolentino - Morgan Stanley: Okay. Thanks very much.
John W. Rowe - Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer: As you look at cost of almost everything in facility does... then it is true for oil refineries and anybody else building these complex things. All of the input for amateurs: labor, concrete, steel, engineering, forging are all up, that's why every time you look at a cost estimate for a new power plant anywhere, it tends to be higher than the estimate was six months ago and we just reviewed with our board the way those numbers have changed for different kinds of facilities. This is going to create a lot of pressure on our entire industry because in the rate regulated situations our delivery companies, the entire company in the case of Integrated... when you have rising costs it's harder and harder to get with our normally fair returns.
Chaka Patterson - Vice President, Investor Relations: Next question please.
Operator: Your next question comes from Paul Paterson of Glenrock Associates.
John W. Rowe - Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, Paul.
Paul Paterson - Glenrock Associates: Good morning, guys. I want to touch, based with you on the announcement that public service made with respect to, I think, it]s about 400 megawatts that they think that they are likely, I guess, to announce building because of the higher RPM prices. And just in general, I mean, you are looking at robust market and everything that you just mentioned, what are your thoughts on that and the potential for you guys to make maybe a similar announcement or something like that, just what are your thoughts about the new entrants with respect to the RPM price difference and what have you?
John W. Rowe - Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, I'll invite John in the end to chip in, after I finish my opening here, but first we think the BSEG announcement is a constructive thing. New Jersey is just playing short on capacity and on something redundant in that space. Second, we are fortunately better off in Pennsylvania and Illinois but we keep looking at those same factors, that's partly why I said we just can't camp on what we have. We have to keep looking at what needs to be done. Now, my basic point of view and this is actually quite consistent with these actions is that the current prices are high enough to support peaking in some commitments that are not high enough to support new base-load. Maybe, Ian, would say that most of PJM is still not high enough to support seeking commitments too. But the ones have to stay on, have to make the market broader, and PECO will to have the kind of stake in these markets that we do, after we do that as well. I think this is what Governor Rendell is most concerned about, Pennsylvania, we want to make certain that the state is going to enough... to have it in a greener way, and to do it without prices just skyrocketing, and Dennis O'Brien and our Genco [ph] people haven't stayed with that too, but we don't have any big surprise announcement for you. We are looking very diligently at our possible two nuclear units in Texas. We think that the particularly attractive markets for base-load proposal, we ardently commented the Bush administration on what it's done to implement the Energy Act several years ago and putting out a Loan Guarantee Program that really works because without that, I don think, even we consider merchant nuclear plants at the present time, but with it, it just might work. So, we are looking at those very hard, that's our principal project. But I think, you will see us constantly trying to lead with our energy efficiency program, do the renewals, where they are required by public policy, and they will peak as...where that's needed to keep the lights on. Fortunately, we have a little more time than they do in New Jersey.
Paul Paterson - Glenrock Associates: How much more time?
John W. Rowe - Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, I don't think, we need them in Illinois a lot, 12 or 13, John, and Pennsylvania perhaps a little sooner. Ian, do you want to tell me, when you think Pennsylvania just has to have more capacity.
Ian P. McLean - President, Exelon Power Team; Executive Vice President, Exelon Corporation: Yes, I think, early part after 2010, 2011. And what I would just add to what you said is that. Right now, what's happening is, we've got the prices to the point where people are reinvesting in the older plants and keeping them going. We have done that ourselves, I think that the prices aren't quite yet where we would go and build some new PECO's. But we certainly would like to send the price signal, at what cost, we do that. And I think that right now PJM is looking at CONE. The cost of new entrant and then they may even be announcing it today, to raise that. And I think once you get that confidence, and I really do think you start to get some new iron in the ground.
Paul Paterson - Glenrock Associates: Okay thanks.
Chaka Patterson - Vice President, Investor Relations: Next question please.
Operator: Your next question comes from Paul Fremont of Jefferies.
Paul Fremont - Jefferies & Co: Thank you, I guess you mentioned in the presentation that the State Line transaction is expected to result in a $0.05 dilution going forward. Can you elaborate on what you see as the benefits of that buyout? And can you also discuss Kinkade and whether you would consider a buyout of that contract?
John W. Rowe - Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, there are several benefits here. First, we are getting a nice lot of cash and based on our valuation model we are getting, at least a fair price for the buyout of the contract. Second, State Line is a plant where Dominion needs to make a lot of decisions about how it's going to run the plant and how much it's going to invest in the plant. We don't think they would make those decisions on, as plane and rational basis, if they are confined by the contract with us, as they will, when they have, both the expenditure and the output side. So, State Line is a little different then Kinkade, where it's both bigger and our team has more interest in its loan following capability. But that said, we are interested in value and we can afford to deal with a little volatility in earnings if we get more value and it wouldn't shock me, if we would end up looking at Kinkade. But I don't have something to tell you about it, at the moment. But it is, for us it's pure value and with this volatility we need to keep the lights on, Ian do you want to supplement that.
Ian P. McLean - President, Exelon Power Team; Executive Vice President, Exelon Corporation: Yes, I think simply put it was a transaction where we got more in cash than we valued the plant at, I mean it was that simple, and that's why we did the transaction.
Chaka Patterson - Vice President, Investor Relations: Next question please.
Operator: Your final question comes from Nathan Judge of Atlantic Equities.
Nathan Judge - Atlantic Equities: Good morning, I wanted to follow up on the question on Carbon Bill. If prices were to rise significantly, following on some type of carbon legislation on the Federal level. What repercussions... could states do anything to change, what impact it has on their customers in the states and would there be any risk of repercussions to utilities and generators in the state.
John W. Rowe - Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer: I would like to say not with my lawyers. But even with the best lawyers around. After what you have seen in Illinois and Pennsylvania, the answer to that is pretty obviously, yes, repercussions abound. I mean let's put it very simple, we believe that with what's going on in natural gas markets over the next decade, where most new capacity will still be gas. Because it's what's you can build, we believe that with what's going on in carbon. We believe that with what's going on in capacity shortfall, we are absolutely and uniquely well positioned to benefit. But if those prices go up too much, we will have more than our share of problems. I just finished at our Directors retreat, showing our Board, a three nice photograph of commodore orders Gunboats [ph] going under the guns in Pittsburg, and I said, it must seem to you that somebody is always shooting at us. And the answer is that they are, and they will continue to do so as long as has we have the most valuable platform in the business. And I intend that we shall continue to have the most valuable platform in the business. But that's one of the reasons we support a safety valve on the carbon legislation. The old axiom, bulls make money, bears make money and pigs get slaughtered probably applies to Exelon carbon, we need to make certain move that when carbon legislation come, it's both efficacious and practical. And practical means not shocking this economy with huge cost, all at once, that's why we push the bill. We also defend the safety valve which ought to be of more interest to our core marine brethren. I believe that carbon legislation will create, very major long term value for Exelon shareholders. But it only does that, if we make certain, that it doesn't hurt our customers unnecessarily, and that's what we're setting out to do. We need to show that Exelon is at the forefront of viewing this environmental issue, because this one is real and this one is bigger than any of the others. There is no cheap, one way out of the carbon problem, as the old Star Trek movie says, we are carbon-based organisms and we live in a carbon-based society, and it's going to be very expensive and very long term to deal with this problem. We are well positioned to benefit from it, if we aren't sinking... but if you have huge pricing increases all at once, then you just have to assume, we will have to share more than we might want to share. So, we are looking at how we can help the public most with the environmental problem, and at the same time keep the most we can of our value for all of you.
Nathan Judge - Atlantic Equities: Thank you very much.
Operator: I will now turn the floor over to John Rowe for any finishing remarks.
John W. Rowe - Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer: I just made them. This is going to be a really tough business in the next decade. And Exelon has better opportunities and more armor on its boat than anybody else. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. That concludes today's Exelon conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Pam and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Exelon Second quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer period. (Operator Instructions). We request that each participant limit themselves to one question per person. Thank you.  It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Chaka Patterson, Vice-President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin your conference. 
Chaka Patterson: Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Exelon's second quarter 2007 earnings review and conference call update. Thank you for joining us today. We issued our earnings release this morning. If you haven't received it, the release is available on the Exelon website at www.exeloncorp.com. Or you can call Diane Sullivan at 312-394-5738 and she will fax or e-mail the release to you.  This call is being recorded and will be available through August 8, by dialing 877-519-4471. The international call-in number is 973-341-3080. The confirmation code is 8962952. In addition, the call will be archived on the Exelon website.  Before we begin today's discussion, let me remind you that the earnings release and other matters we discuss in today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for discussions of factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecast and expectations.  In our release and during this call, we will discuss adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings that excludes the earnings impact of the following; mark-to-market adjustments from economic hedging activities; investments in synthetic fuel producing facilities; certain costs associated with the terminated merger with PSEG for 2006 only; significant impairments of intangible assets including goodwill; significant changes in decommissioning obligation estimates; severance and severance related charges for 2006 only. Cost associated with Illinois electric rate settlement including ComEd's previously announced customer, rate relief and assistance initiative and other unusual items including any future changes to GAAP.  We believe these adjusted operating earnings are representative of the underlying operational results of the company. In today's earnings release we provided a reconciliation between reported GAAP earnings and adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings.  With me today are John Rowe, Exelon Chairman, President and CEO; John Young, Exelon's Executive Vice President Finance and Markets and Chief Financial Officer; Frank Clark ComEd Chairman and CEO and other members of Exelon's and ComEd's senior management team who will be available to answer your questions.  Today's call will focus on the Illinois Electric Rate Settlement, which was announced yesterday and again this morning, second quarter 2007 financial and operating results, our outlook on the remainder of 2007 and an update on other key issues facing the company. We have scheduled 90 minutes for this call. We will spend about 40 minutes on prepared remarks and use the remaining time for Q&A. In order to effectively manage this call, we'd appreciate it if you limit yourself to one question.  I will now turn the call over to John Rowe, who will begin his discussion with an overview of the Illinois Settlement. 
John Rowe: Thank you, Chaka. Good morning everyone. I am going to begin by discussing the settlement agreement in Illinois and Frank Clark and [Betsy Moler] the man from Missouri will chip in if need her when we get to your questions. Then John going to do his usual quote on the quarterly earnings and I will comment briefly on that and on some recent statutory and regulatory development, that's me.  But of course the big news today is that we believe we have reached an agreement with the Illinois prices. It comes after two years of defending Exelon and ComEd before the Illinois Commerce Commission, the FERC, in the courts and the legislation. It is gainfully costly but it protects all the vital interests of the company, its shareholders and its customers. Under the agreement Illinois residential electric consumers, will receive significant rate relief , ComEd will avoid bankruptcy, have the opportunity to return to financial health.  And Exelon Generation will continue to sell its output into competitive market at market based prices. Before getting to the details of the agreement let me give you a little context. We have passed long and hard for over two years already tens of millions of dollars and tens of thousands of hours into defending both ComEd and Exelon Generation.  To date we have one in every forum, but each succeeding victory has required more resources and has driven our opponents to find ever more creative and dangerous ways to harm Exelon including a generation tax.  We have been walking a dangerous stalemate one that increasingly prevented us from pursuing our other business objectives. As a result, we needed a deal its an affordable one as we obtain. Now that deal is a mix of oral agreements, written agreements and pending legislations.  And we will be there to add some comments on things not being over till August. Nonetheless, I believe that between yesterday's 8-K and the additional details we will be providing today. We have accurately described the state of things to the best of our knowledge. It is very important that you follow the details. One of you said in a call this week, the devil is always in the detail. In this case, the protections, you receive as well as the cost you incur. And this we have removed and the ones we have not are all in the detail. So, let me get to a key term.  The agreement provides money for rate release for Illinois residential consumers. Renewed with still competitive procurement process, renew environmental procurement quality and strategic flexibility for Exelon and its companies. It also protects ComEd an Exelon Generation from rate freeze and generation tax legislation for at least the next four years and terminate the litigation filed by the Illinois Attorney General.  The agreement will become fully effective when the Governor signs the proposed legislation. We expect both houses to take up the legislation this week with the Governor likely to sign it later this week or early next week. That is our expectation but the matter has dragged week-to-week and its Springfield is a very complicated place these days.  Now as to the money, which was the prime motivator for those with whom we were negotiating. Illinois electric utility and electric generators will contribute $1 billion to a four year rate relief package for Illinois residential electric consumer. The Exelon companies will contribute $800 million with these rate relief programs. Exelon Generation will contribute $747 million of which $435 million will go to ComEd customers, $307.5 million to the customers of the Ameren utilities and $4.5 million to the Illinois Power Agency Trust Fund. ComEd will contribute $53 million to the rate relief for its own customers in addition to the $11 million it has already set on that effort.  The utilities have worked with legislated leaders and the Illinois Attorney General to design rate relief programs for customers lead the transition to rates that reflect the energy costs resulting from competitive wholesale markets. Programs have been designed to provide benefit to residential customers as well as targeted programs for certain other customers.  While ComEd to release its base on rate credit and preserve exiting rates and rate structures as well as the right to file new rate cases for both delivery charges and future power purchases. Money is contributed to the Illinois Power Agency Trust Fund are intended to generate investment income to fund the IPA operation after 2009.  Procurement as you know the Illinois Attorney General and some other parties have been insistent with the vertical quite option which the commission approved, we continue to believe was a highly efficient way of procuring power with some other mechanism. The new procurement policy both [of plant] and preserve competitive wholesale markets. First the deal honors Exelon auction contracts. Both contracts run for three years and will provide two-thirds of the power needed to meet customer demands in 2008 and one-third in 2009.  As these contracts terminate they will be replaced by a process managed by the Illinois Power Agency, the creation of which I will address shortly. This will be a horizontal block procurement process. In addition Exelon generation has entered into a five year market based, base load financial swap arrangement. The contract begins on June 1, 2008 and ends on May 31, 2013, it covers energy only not capacity or ancillary services. This market based swap provides benefits for customers and investors. And I would urge you to listen closely here.  For customers it provides a significant measure of price stability over the five year period of the contract which is basically six years normally. For investors it removes most of the incentive for interfering with an ordinary wholesale market, from now until at least 2013. The swap ultimately covers about 60% of the base load power required by residential and small commercial customers. In other words it is my opinion that the swap changes the fundamental incentive for many of those who have intervened in these proceedings from having an incentive to muck up the market in order to get Exelon in changing it to an incentive to make the market really work because it now has an agreement on bulk of residential power to be supplied by us.  Competitive market received additional protection because customers 400 kilowatt hours and above, which is about 43% of ComED flows will be declared competitive by the General Assembly. This will allow and require both customers to procure power for themselves directly from suppliers at market based prices. While customers from 100 kilowatts and up to 400 kilowatts another 12% of ComEd flows and expedited review processes established for the deferring those customers incentives. In other words more than half of ComEd customers will be shopping directly in the marketplace. A market price has been adopted for a large part of the remaining load through the spot.  To oversee the future procurement process the deal also provides for the creation of the Illinois Power Agency, with a Director to be nominated by the Governor and approved by the Senate. The agency will now have a procurement bureau and a resource development bureau. Procurement bureau will manage the procurement of power with ICC oversights, while Ameren's and ComED's Residential and small commercial customers through our agreement.  This sort of response will keep it and the lowest prices will be chosen. On ICC approval of the contracts, contracts are equaled in the totally equally directed timeframe. The Resource Development Bureau will assess power generation needs for municipalities and rural electric power and determine the feasibility of constructing new generation facilities to meet those needs.  We will have the authority to build new non-nuclear power plants and use indigenous all renewable resources, but cannot use tax payer money to use that. The output from generation facilities contracted by the IPA may be supplied at cost to municipal electric systems and rural electric properties. Utilities are not required to purchase power form these generation facilities.  Turning to environmental policy. The agreement calls for aggressive renewable energy and energy efficiency standards. Fuel needs must be cost effective, energy efficiency resources to meet incremental annual programs savings to all and are required to procure cost effective renewable energy resources from Illinois or adjoining states.  Utilities will have procurement responsibility for renewables in the first year and will have shared responsibility for meeting energy efficiency targets in all years. After the first year the IPA will manage procurement of renewable energy for the utilities. The agreement calls for the purchase of [wind] to the extent that it is available to meet 75% of the renewable resources requirement.  The utilities will be allowed to recover the cost associated with the energy efficiency program and the procurement of renewable resources. There is a safety doubt that allows utilities to reduce the use of energy efficiency of renewable energy resources if the costs either one requires rate increases to customers more than 0.5% for the first year increasing 0.5% each year until it reaches a maximum cap of about 2% in 2011.  The long term goal is a cost effective renewable energy resources be available to supply, 25% of the total electricity that utilities supply to their retail customers by June 01, 2025. It was important for us to see that the demand or the energy efficiency renewable resources was met in this comprehensive package so we did not have -- on that front [Technical Difficulty].  We must revise, submissions of the '97 restructuring act that allows Exelon to forsee strategic transactions and informal [firing at the ICP]. The deal does not require separation of ComEd from Exelon. I want to address this next point clearly because I know that many of you have different opinions on it. We intend to keep the Exelon companies together.  The ICC has demonstrated that it is a fair and courageous regulatory authority. We expect that ComEd will be treated fairly. Of course if ComEd cannot receive fair treatment as part of the Exelon family, then we will need to reconsider separating ComEd from the rest of the companies.  That option along with other value added M&A transactions or restructuring transactions will be regularly reviewed by the senior management in the Board. As I mentioned earlier this agreement protects ComEd and Exelon Generation from rate freeze and generation tax legislations for at least the next four years. It terminates all pending litigations related to the reverse-auction including the complaints filed at FERC initiated by the Illinois AG. The agreement gives the Exelon companies a right to terminate the rate relief monies if the General Assembly virtually enacts rate freeze or generation tax legislation.  While political and regulatory risks are facts of life in the utility business, we believe the long-term aspects of this deal will turn those risks to a more normal level. ComEd will have the right to stay in an RTO or ISO for at least the next 15 years. The Exelon companies are protected from rate freeze and generation tax legislation for at least four years. The five year market based financial swaps ends into 2013, and Exelon gets strategic flexibility for at least four years. Most aspects of this deal will be product by legislation and are proved by court or government agency  I want to take a moment to publicly thanks the ComEd negotiating team, Frank Clark and from Missouri, Bob McDonald, John [Skolds], Brad (Inaudible). And the Exelon Generation negotiating team led by [Joe Domino]. Each of these teams has worked independently and in far too much time in Springfield. I am deeply grateful for the commitment and sacrifices they and their families have made.  I must also thanks Senate President Emil Jones and our other legislative supporters, especially including the Black and Hispanic caucuses for their very consistent support as we attempted to resolve this very complex issue. We've received early support from House Republican leader John Cross. I must also say Illinois Commerce Commission for its continued commitments to report to the law. And finally, I must recognize that while they have been a very good at commerce.  In the end I will speak to Michael Madigan and Attorney General Lisa Madigan, we are willing to compromise and reach a practical conclusion and always find the can go ahead. We appreciate the expressions and support of the Governor indicating that he will sign the legislation. Now people have called Marybeth Flater, JaCee and Chako over the last week saying, is John smiling, is John laughing, is John frowning, is Exelon celebrating, is Exelon fine? Ladies and gentlemen this is about money and keeping the lights on and not about emotion.  Working on this problem it has been two years of absolutely misery but this is a result, as end work. It preserves the competitive marketplace, which means so much to us and to you and I believe it will work and we shall make it preserve.  Now I will turn it over to John Young and I will come back at the very end to pick up on [legislation]. 
John Young: Thank you, John. Good morning everyone. Exelon announced second quarter 2007 adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings of $700 million or $1.03 per diluted share an increase from second quarter 2006 operating earnings around $577 million or $0.85 per diluted shares. Historically, our operating earnings have excluded significant items that are not directly related to the ongoing operations of the business or are one-time in nature.  And keeping with this philosophy second quarter operating earnings exclude an after tax charge of $14 million or $0.02 per diluted share for the cost of comments rate relief and a systems initiative that were incurred during the second quarter. Likewise, we plan to exclude the financial impact associated with the Illinois settlement from future operating earnings.  We believe these cost reflect a one-time event associated with ComEd's transition to a competitive market. These costs will be expensed as credits are issued overtime. Please refer to exhibit in the 8-K, which illustrates the sources and recipients of funds overtime.  Consistent with prior treatment are second quarter adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings also excluded mark-to-market losses from Exelon Generation’s economic hedging activities and earnings from investments in synthetic fuel-producing facilities.  On a GAAP basis Exelon reported consolidated earnings of $702 million or $1.03 per share for the second quarter of 2007. For a comprehensive reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP earnings please see the tables that accompany the earnings release. I will turn now to earning drivers for the quarter.  Exelon's strong performance for the quarter was driven by increased earnings at Exelon Generation, slightly offset by an expected decrease in ComED. PECO earnings during the quarter were flat when compared to the prior year. Exelon Generation contributed $0.87 of operating earnings per diluted Exelon share for the second quarter of 2007 compared to $0.55 for the same period of 2006.  The major driver of Generation’s operating earnings growth during the quarter was higher wholesale margins as a result of favorable market conditions and portfolio position. The end of the below market PPA with ComED and a contractual price associated with the PECO PPA. These benefits were partially offset by the impact of an additional nuclear refueling outage later related inflation and increased nuclear security cost and our receipt fees. These costs including the inflation in labor costs were anticipated and included in the guidance we provided earlier this year.  Turning now to ComEd. In the second quarter of 2007, ComEd contributed $0.6 per Exelon share compared to $0.19 during the same period of 2006. ComEd's decrease in earnings was expected and was primarily due to the impact of the end of the nearly 10 year regulatory transition period in Illinois. ComEd's earnings during the quarter also reflects increased communications cost related to the end of ComEd's rate freeze, increased bad debt expense due to voluntary suspension of customer disconnects.  These unfavorable drivers at ComEd were partially offset by favorable weather, an increase in revenues associated with ComEd's distribution case, and an increase in revenues associated with ComEd's transmission case, which was approved by the FERC and was effective May 1st, 2007.  Details on the transmission case are provided in our earnings release. As expected ComEd's earnings for the quarter were week due to continued regulatory lag or the inability to recover current year costs. ComEd's financial viability and its ability to deliver reliable service continue to be dependant on being able to recover its cost from fair and reasonable rate making.  FERC's approvals of ComEd's transmission rates was a first step in ComEd's regulatory recovery plan. At the next step in this process ComEd plans to file another distribution rate case with the ICC during the third quarter. Weather during the second quarter of 2007 was $0.02 favorable per share to ComEd's earnings compared to the second quarter of 2006, and a little over $0.01 favorable to normal weather.  I'll now wrap up the discussion of quarterly earnings with drivers with PECO. PECO's contribution to operating earnings for the second quarter of 2007 was $0.14 per share or flat when compared with second quarter of 2006. During the quarter PECO benefited from favorable weather and load growth as compared to last year. This favorability was offset primarily by the schedule increase in PECO CTC amortization, higher gross taxes and the impacts of a favorable tax settlement.  Weather was $0.02 per share favorable to PECO's earnings in the second quarter of 2007 compared to the second quarter of 2006 and about $0.01 favorable to normal weather. Please refer to the tables that accompany the earnings release for additional detail regarding our second quarter results.  Turning now to our outlook for 2007, we are reaffirming Exelon's non-GAAP operating earnings guidance ranges for 2007 of $4.00 to $4.30 per share or a downwardly revising Exelon's GAAP guidance range to $3.70 to $4 per share from $4.10 to $4.40 per share primarily reflecting full year impact of the Illinois settlement. Both Exelon's operating earnings and GAAP earnings guidance are based on the assumption of normal weather for the balance of the year.  Our major drivers of operating earnings for the balance of 2007 for Exelon Generation, ComEd and PECO are essentially the same as we outlined in the beginning of the year. I would like to draw your attention to a few items that will impact earnings and each of the operating costs.  Starting with generation, earnings growth for the remainder of the year at Exelon Generation while continue to be driven by favorable portfolio position as compared to last year. The exploration of the below market ComEd PPA and the contractual price increase in the PECO PPA. However, subsequent to issuing our original guidance PJM held its first RPM auction for the period June 2007 through May of 2008.  As we discussed in the first quarter call, the RPM auction will have a favorable impact on Generation's earnings for 2007 as a result of rest of market prices being higher than originally expected, benefits are uncommitted capacity in the Midwest. Exelon Generation is also benefiting from capacity transfer rights which partially offset the cost of capacity that will be use to serve the PECO load, load obligation in Eastern MAAC.  Similar offsetting the favorable earnings impact of RPM for the balance of the year is the implementation of marginal-loss dispatch by PJM. On June 1, 2007 PJM revised his methodology for considering transmission line losses in generation dispatch and the calculation of locational marginal prices.  Prior to implementation of marginal-loss dispatch PJM was using average line losses in dispatch and calculation of LMPs. Alternatively marginal-loss dispatch recognizes the varying delivering costs of transmitting electricity from individual generator locations to the places where customers consume the energy.  PJM believe that this approach is more efficient because the cost of energy that is lost in the transmission line is reduced compared with the formal average loss methodology. We are continuing to evaluate the impact of that marginal-loss pricing we have on our operations. We do expect it to be unfavorable compared to original guidance due to the location of our Midwest generation fleet relative to the load service.  Another potential offset to be upside from the RPM auction is the recent decline in power prices driven by a dropping gas prices. Although, we are 95% financially hedged for the balance of the year due to the size of our generation portfolio, movements in market prices still impact our earnings. Taking into account these three items the upside expected from RPM, the RPM auction and the potential downside related to marginal-losses set by PJM and the recent decline in power prices. We are reaffirming the operating earnings guidance we gave you for Exelon Generation at $3.40 to $3.60 per share.  We are also reaffirming operating earnings guidance for ComEd at $0.10 to $0.20 per share and PECO at $0.60 to $0.65 per share. Even with the favorable impacts of weather during the first half of the year FERC's approval of ComEd transmission case and strong load growth at PECO. We feel it's too early in the year to revise guidance.  Turning now to the markets and then update on our financial hedge position. Similar to last year, we are providing you with additional information about the commodity markets. As part of earnings release package, we included a market snapshot showing commodity price movements for the calendar year 2008 corresponding changes in market implied heat rates. We have extended this slide to include the spreads between on-peak and off-peak forward prices in PJM West and Ni-Hub along with market data for ERCOT. This slide also highlights the results from the latest PJM, RPM auction, which I will discuss in a moment. Feel free to ask questions about the recent commodity prices performance during our Q&A session following our prepared comments.  In May, using our target financial hedge ratios through 2010 which were 90% to 98% for 2008, 70% to 90% for 2009, 50% to 70% for 2010. We are currently at the lower end of our target financial hedge range for 2008 and at the upper end for the target financial hedge ranges for 2009 and 2010.  For now, let's discuss the RPM auction results. Earlier this month PJM conducted the second auction under the new capacity market design called Reliability Pricing Model. We believe RPM provides a valuable transparent price signals to the market and will compensate generators and demand response providers for investment in long-term reliability in PJM, which benefits our customers. This new capacity design provides a better signal to the market of where and when capacity is needed and better enables resource owners to plan on a forward-looking basis.  In addition to incentivizing new generation, RPM is designed to retain existing generation if needed for reliability purposes. The second auction for the period June 1, 2008 to May 31, 2009 results from the second RPM auction are included in our earnings release.  As mentioned during the first quarter earnings call most but not all of our 9500 megawatt of capacity Eastern MAAC is committed to serve the PECO load, and will not benefit this year from this capacity prices. However, our earning committed capacity in the Midwest will receive rest of market capacity prices for this auction beginning June 1, 2008.  While the earnings impact for this auction for 2008 is somewhat limited even Generation's current contracts and forward sales commitments, the positive earnings impact will increase as these contracts roll off. At the end of Pennsylvania transition period in 2011 Exelon generation will receive full benefit associated with market value of capacity. We will provide you a view of our open or unhedged EBITDA during the fall.  Given our large low cost, low emissions and exceptionally well-run nuclear fleet, Exelon is in a unique, competitive position to benefit from improving power market fundamentals driven by capacity value and higher rebates.  Next I wanted to preview our Investor Relation's calendar for the rest of year. Before wrap up with an annual investor conference in New York on December 19th, go ahead and save that date December 19 in New York. Details will be coming out soon from Investor Relations. Between now and then we will be participating in a number of investor conferences holding our third quarter's earnings call and attending the Fall EEI Financial Conference. Similar to what we did last year, we plan to use these meetings to emphasize our key earnings drivers for 2008 through 2012 by operating company and provide you with key assumptions and sensitivities for 2008 through 2012 by operating company and provide you with key assumptions and sensitivities for 2008 including generation supply and sales expectations, revenue net fuel projections and our open EBITDA for Exelon Generation. We are also planning to provide you with additional information about O&M and CapEx trends by operating company over the next five years. Our intend is to lay the foundation of our earnings and cash flow profile in 2008 in advance of giving you guidance at our December 19 Investor Conference.  Before I turn the call back to John Rowe, I will touch based on our value return plan for 2007. We are evaluating the timing in the exact amount of the 2000 end share repurchase inline of this Illinois settlement, and still plan to update you on our specific action sometime during the third quarter. I'll remind you that any share repurchase program has subject to approval by the Exelon Board of Directors. I look forward to see many of you in our coming months. I'll now turn the call back to John Rowe. 
John Rowe: Thank you, John. I wanted to make my review for the second quarter results a little briefer than what I am just because I know you have questions.  Let me say we had a very fine second quarter, year-over-year operating earnings were up from 28.5 in the second quarter up 2006 to $1.03 in the second quarter this year. We earned $2.10 for the first six months of the year up from $1.48. The cost of the Illinois settlement will be recognized in GAAP earnings over the next three years but it purely from operating earnings.  At least we are firm on operating earnings guidance of $4 to $4.30 this year for the full year. We are revising our 2007 GAAP earnings estimate reflecting Illinois settlement it was for $1.10 to $4.40 per share it is now $3.74. Our nuclear unit achieved a 93.6% capacity factor for the quarter and reduced the number of non-refueling outage dates from 24 to 18 this quarter. Our Barcelona Hydro Plant achieved a 93.3% commercial availability factor and a 91% equivalent availability factor reflected.  Our team continues to hedge and optimize our portfolio. Congratulations to Chris Crane and Mark Schiavoni in the claim and each of their excellencies. The generation company results reflect both the state of the conservative marketplace, very good operation and a very practical hedging policy by our unit.  Our delivery company having showing strong operating performance. In ComEd we have had improved outage management and faster service recovery and PECO has done very well in spite of high records. Efforts from Brian, John Costello, Barry Mitchell in their key continued to be improving our operating performance.  Before I touch on Pennsylvania I want to acknowledge two of my colleague have announced their retirement; Jack Skolds, the Executive Vice President of Exelon and President of EED and Exelon Generation has announced his retirement effective September 7. Jack has played enormous positive role during his years with Exelon we are a much stronger and more efficient group of companies as a result of Jack’s tireless effort. Gary Snodgrass, EVP & Chief Human Resources Operator has helped us with one of the largest national recruiting program in industry and a great many other things we will almost Gary formed out. I thank them both for everything that they have done.  Now let me quickly update you on Pennsylvania. As we’ve all seen in Illinois and other states when transition periods end and rate caps is higher there is strong pressure for state regulatory in clinical processes to act to reduce the impact of price increases. While PECOs regulatory transition period does not expires until December 31, 2010, transition period has already ended for some other Pennsylvania Electric Bill Commission. Pennsylvania Governor, Ed Rendell issued an energy independent strategy early this year that included a package to propose legislation. Provisions of that legislation were among other things required to both of higher that of PECO, to procure their electricity for to bolster with customers through a niche cost portfolio approach with preferences for conservation and renewal of policy.  The legislation would also require redoing technology to enable time of new states provide for a phase in of any concrete generation rate after exploration of rate cap. Permit distribution companies to enter into long-term contract with large industrial customers and create a fee and electricity consumption that the state would direct for the conservation and renewable technology.  Approximately two weeks ago, Governor Rendell announced that he has signed an agreement on the state level only certain elements of the proposed package would move forward at this time. Specifically the Governor signed into law out still trouble readjustment to service.  Level 3 have managed the alternative energy portfolio standards by increasing the amount of solar energy required to be purchased by electric distribution and supply companies, and expanding the ability for customers to help generate and sell excess supply back to distribution costs.  House Bill 1530 allows distribution and supply companies to negotiate long term contracts for certain retail customers also due [fix rates] in 15 megawatts. The Bill also allows distribution companies to construct or contract for supply from generation facilities to bill one third contract requirements. This provision is not effect able to PECO. The deal prohibits distribution companies from placing those costs in rate base and cost subsidizing the entire cost. We expect the other energy related issues to be addressed in the special legislative session planned on September 17, 2007.  On the regulatory fund in Pennsylvania that's the Public Utility Commission issued final regulations that provide guidance and distribution companies such as PECO on acceptable methods of procurement when rate caps expire. The commission's approval of final default service regulation or a provider of last resort or polar regulation provides the framework for utilities to purchase energy for customers who did not seem to receive electric supply from an independent marketer. These regulations will help in the customer's transition to market base pricing in 2011.  The regulations allow distribution companies to purchase energy on behalf of customers in ways that fit each individual service territory, for example securing energy through daggered purchases and competitive auctions with full cost recovery and no hindsight prudent fees. The regulations also provide options for customers to differ some portion of a rate increase it can achieve 25%. Allow recovery of procurements supplied and funded say by consumer education.  The Pennsylvania Independent Regulatory Review Commission approved the regulations last week. The Pennsylvania Attorney General also has given approval to regulation. PECO's current electricity supply rates will remain the same until January 1, 2011. PECO's expects to fire this electricity procurement plan for the 12 service customers during the [2008].  Unlike Illinois where we were beginning to fix for how things would proceed in Pennsylvania several such companies are ahead of us. Pennsylvania has approved six interim default service plans since the end of restructuring including those for that came and powered UGI. Also two days ago PPL held its first post transition auction. We look forward to seeing you at that.  Now just to conclude and even I am entitled to put some emotions since it’s the end. Exelon today has a market capitalization in excess of $50 billion. The next largest utilities have a capitalization of around $30 billion. That is because, first, we owned about 17000 megawatts of nuclear generation and about 8600 megawatts of non-nuclear average operating in competitive markets.  Second, our operating managers have an unparalleled commitment to regulate the processes and continue improving. Third, we have established our corporate structure and mobilized our legal and political team prospect those market based regulations.  Fourth, our marketing people are suspicious of FAS and hard headed about lifts evolve for markets. Fifth, our plans will become more valuable in a future economy that is constrained both by carbon regulation and after the limitations. Sixth, we are absolutely committed to the value of your investments both with our passion and with financial discipline, and our own vertical commitment to this company.  These reasons are powerful, indeed I think they are all revolving and expect that for the last day and half, so have you. It should come as no surprise, however that this sort of success reach both in and the desire to hide the real cost of energy trying to effect the finance line. We have defended our value, your value successfully from a incentive tax in Illinois particular the eminent and the participants. I expect we shall see new attacks in the future, not in Illinois for the next few years but collaterally in Washington or perhaps in Pennsylvania.  We shall be as jealous in defending our market value in the future when such a tax occurs as we have been in the past. We shall also try to reach practical resolutions to protect our interests and public requirements. I have led utilities now for more than 23 years. I worked through the end of rate base generation regulation in New England through the integrated resource planning years and the onset of retail competition in New England.  And now I am defending competitive market value and political forces seeking comprises among regulatory fits. These transitions have never been easy, they will never be easy. But the settlement we have reached in Illinois preserves the principals for what we fought in most of the value that we set out to protect. I am confident that we will continue to see succeeded Exelon by both fighting and by adapting. There is no better collection of assets, no better legal and regulatory platform and no better team than ours in the utility business. I believe we can continue to achieve and meet your expectations and we are now open to questions. 
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Just as a reminder, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question per person. Thank you. Your first question is coming from John Kiani with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. 
John Kiani - Deutsche Bank: Good morning. 
John Rowe: Good morning. 
John Kiani - Deutsche Bank: Can you please walk us through the rationale to keep the company together for now when ComED is realizing really only a 3.5% ROE. Is it more timing where it is just too soon to do anything or do you not believe that there is an issue with having ComEd attached to Exelon Generation? 
John Rowe: No, we know there are issues that ComEd being attached to Exelon Generation. We also know there are some shrink attached ComEd being attached to Exelon Generation. We think that with the creation of the Illinois Power Agency, they have resolved the issue that most concern it by having more independent power procurements.  We believe that these issues were in value change from year-to-year and there has to be a pretty overwhelming case or you take something apart that has sensitive. We are always open to it, its kind of just nearly is about value, but when I look at the events the past two years, I see as well as anyone millions of ways in which people try to use ComEd as waiver to get an Exelon Generation. I also see that the relationship that Exelon has because ComEd is part of the corporate family, made a great deal down in the legislation. And I at least want to be very careful before I stay apart those relationships, so we are watching as all of you what happens with [KKRTHU] we are looking as you with no we would at whether our future expansion opportunities are better, we have integrated companies or perhaps a standalone generation play and we are literally open to each and every one of this fact.  But let me say it is, when it comes down to it, among the factors did affect my judgment are, that we are still able to achieve some distinct cost synergy from having the companies together. Our estimate was on the order of $250 million a year, I suspect that ComEd and PECO after stand more on their own for regulatory purposes those numbers will shrink somewhat but they have not dollars to grow away likely. We also have integrated pensions and while the funding task work where we integrate these companies it maybe if you have your separate companies there might be when we done partial analysis by a cash payment that would be required for ComEd. The point I am making is we get the argument that pure play generation has a particular value in today's market or at least due to the day before yesterday's market. But you don't think the case has to be very clear and overwhelming and we would get and gotten a better deal in their package by separating ComEd. If turns out going forward that's the only way ComEd that gets fair check we won't do it. If it turns out going forward then we see very clearly the value of generation is greater in other hands we will deal with that too. But the key attacks on generation the things that motivated hedge in large generation participate Asian in the settlement. We are not apposing the same through the ComEd rate increase but the other threat amounted cycle hedge too much. 
John Kiani - Deutsche Bank: Thank you, and then another separate question, John. As your view on IPP focused M&A changed at all over the last several months, I know you have been busy dealing with the issues in Illinois but can you give us some color on that please? 
John Young: I can probably give you color as you know our states are far away from mentioning any one specific that all of you get this color and for those of us who prefer Rembrandt picture that have only color of limited value. But yeah, as I said we are constantly looking at those other integrated and at your play IPP and we have a number of value in our valuation spectrum and also as you would expect they are not all consistent. We want simplicity. We get involved in another transaction. We want to work, we want to continue to be more green. We think our real advantage here in a carbon constraint work is the extent of low carbon energy that we have. We would like to grow in a way that keeps us at the green low carbon end of the spectrum.  We value participation in the competitive marketplace. We are already big enough in at least two other competitive markets. So, we have a number of factors and they don’t lead to one clear and simple answer, just go back to our basic vision statement, we want to be bigger, we want to be more profitable, we want to be more green, we want to be adaptable to the widest providing regulatory changes that can come about and they give you a number of different answers and of course any transaction, depends both on your own priority list and upon the priority list of the other people with whom you might talk.  Those transactions also affect the answer to your first question too. Some people with whom you talk would rather or appeal for any others with whether you were integrated. 
Chaka Patterson: Can we go to the next question please? 
Operator: Your next question is coming from Jonathan Arnold with Merrill Lynch. 
Jonathan Arnold - Merrill Lynch: Hi, good morning everyone. This was just picking on John Young’s comments around capacity and the RPM auctions. I followed you said that you obviously or substantially hedged into 2008 on the Eastern MAAC position. And I think you also said that the '08 impact would be somewhat limited by forward sales and I wanted to just kind of see if you could frame a little more the extent of how much we should be thinking about the open position into 2008 and 2009. Does it relates to the peace outside of Pennsylvania and is that a significant offset to what the potential earnings could be out of RPM and we should think but it's a longer term outside or those hedges can more limited in scope? 
John Young: Those hedges are along the line of the hedging targets that we gave you and if you heard my comment where we were year-by-year. All those were financial hedge positions, you can extrapolate kind of the physical side of that, and then that's further complicated in the near-term by the transfer rate between western PJM and eastern PJM to exactly what price you get there. So, the impact in the near term in the '08 timeframe or they are there, they are less then they would have otherwise we have been not RT sold forward in our normal hedging practices. So, when we give you the open EBITDA stuff we will go through that in some detail as to how you should look at that for '08 and beyond. 
Jonathan Arnold - Merrill Lynch: So, when we look at the 16,000 megawatts of capacity and the 7000 or so commitments under the Illinois auctions we should really be thinking about hedge percentage as it relates to capacity as well do you have number? 
John Young: Yes, we will give you some clarity on that. 
Jonathan Arnold - Merrill Lynch: But that starts one other quick down related issue, the transmit be marginal loss pricing issue that is oversee isn't offset in 2007, does that also continue to be a kind of year-over-year offset into 2008 because of…? 
John Rowe: You are going to see that's going to have a more prominent impact, that's a permanent change to how losses are priced in the OMP, so you will see that going forward as well. Everybody in PJM is going to see that. 
Chaka Patterson: Next question please? 
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. Your next question is coming from Hugh Wynne with Sanford Bernstein. 
Hugh Wynne - Sanford Bernstein: Hi, good morning. I just wanted to ask a question regarding the process you will go through with the Board to size the share buyback. Are there parameters that you are going to be using that you could share with us to make a proposal in terms of, for example, capitalizing on just the free cash available for distribution to shareholders after your dividend payments to fund a borrowing that would be used for a share buyback, or would you go beyond that and try to achieve material change in the capital structure of the companies through the buyback? Is there any financial parameters that you can share us that would guide your advice to the Board about the scale of the buyback? 
John Rowe: I will look at two ways, one the targets that we have already given you around FFO to debt and those things would give you kind of the parameters scaling a share buyback. Obviously that will be impacted by the discussion around the numbers than John gave you in the settlement, a part of the discussion today for this year. Anything that you're talking about beyond that is a normal part of our value return plan. I would almost put in the category kind of a leverage recap. That will be a whole different discussion. We haven’t gone there at all, so I would not be thinking of something beyond those parameters that Michael might have given you around FFO to debt and that’s going to be an annual discussion. Any leverage recap would be a completely different strategic view of how we plan on use the balance sheet. 
Hugh Wynne - Sanford Bernstein: Can you just remind us what those FFO to debt targets are? 
John Rowe: Yeah, the middle of the BBB range which is FFO to debt of about 25%. In business schedule and some of the materials we gave you we've ended up before to kind of give you some targets based on, it’s illustrative but on what's the price expectations we saw in market few months back. 
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Vic Khaitan with Deutsche Asset Management. 
Vic Khaitan - Deutsche Asset Management: Yes. Thank you. John, I heard a comment from Mr. Madigan saying that this was one of the toughest negotiations he had to go through. So you must be feeling very relieved about this thing. So the question then is that well moving forward, you said that you are denied some of the other business objectives which you want to pursue. So, could you remind us what those business objectives you have in mind? 
John Rowe: Well sure. First, there is just no doubt. I am greatly relived. The combination as a speaker of the house and Attorney General that attack on every front over a two year period is very painful. And it is nice to have that behind us or at least we think behind us, and ever since, we've had a handshake while the political process has been fluctuating beyond all of the leads. The Madigan's have kept their word, so I do think that this is over and again President Jones has tried ever so hard in the expenses that, but sure I mean, the kinds of things I had in mind were, we have to address what creates the most value. Whether it's acquiring another integrated generation company that would have been very difficult. After all our New Jersey issue was a handicap by dependency of the Illinois proceedings. So acquiring a pure generation company, to going as far as looking at the splits between generation and the retail companies or trying to determine to bring pieces of generation, to have more value in other hands.  We managed this, is the old time just sitting that goes on rock and roll, this company is built on value per shareholders and there simply isn’t anything that we will not look at. We have care trying to assess both its short-term and its long-term value per shareholders. I tried to address in response to the first question I had, because the different way these factors interplay we want to be bigger, we want to be more green, we want to capitalize on our carbon positions. As you know we are looking at a nuclear plant in Texas, building a nuclear plant in a merchant environment would be the ultimate act of faith in the competitive marketplace.  So the issue is, we have on our planning platforms, I think all of the live questions that all of you have with investors and the issue is which combination of things gives us the best short and long-term value at. We are very proud of the value we've had over the last year. We don’t wish to stop there; we wish to find ways to keep improving it for you. 
Chaka Patterson: Next question please. 
Operator: Thank you, your next question is coming from Greg Gordon with Citigroup. 
John Rowe: Hi Greg. 
Greg Gordon - Citigroup: Hey John, a question for you on opportunity cost. The settlement in itself, it’s a large dollar amount to get back into majority over first two years. Having live to California and watch Maryland and they are going to suit these types of situations, it's hard for us to trust that or for me to trust that two years from now if the market continue to rise that a future legislator won't see that they got a big chunk out of the company the first times, so why don't they come back. So, what was the opportunity cost in your mind of taking this to Federal Court where if you won there would be an immunization from future risk of that magnitude like PCG got in their case and about rate reduction case in California? 
John Rowe: Greg, I am actually glad you asked it. We think on a rate freeze we have the best amendments and preemptions that you can have. You will never get better than three to one opinion on a constitutional taking, okay, I won, won, won I know, and to bet their total company on a constitutional case is a very early thing to do. But second, the settlement wasn't so much about the rate freeze case as this was about the generation taxes and the interference with membership in DJM and all of the Attorney General other efforts to attack the markets. Each one of those had a somewhat different probability of success in your Federal Court, and my general council was liked it if I weren't to clear about my opinion on each case. But each way you write them, each way you change them to create a different set of legal rights. Only a madman with a leap to back a $50 billion company on a whole chain of constitutional claim.  Like I said I tried won, won, I won, won, won. And I've created many people in this country who can say that. But that was in the situation where there was no choice. You are very right of course to have concerns about your ability of this yield. But I as the speaker comments on four years and somehow I expect yield to be around keep it for four years. We've had wonderful integrity from president John and I think the real world we are looking at, is that we are not just basing this on one thing, we have preserve the legal structure, we have kept the right and need expedited the right separate comment if we have too. We have pieces of this deal the PJM membership that go out 15 years. We have other pieces the swap contract it go out six years. We have some pieces that go out four years. We have done every thing we know how by putting bricks, plaster and bin in place to continue to protect the structure.  Personally, when I look back over the past nine years there are lots of things and I have 50 some billion dollars of value that are driven, I think beyond my personal attempt. However, Jack and Chris we organized the nuclear fleet how prices have changed and adapted in the wholesale power market and so forth. But as the person who arranged the Unicom, PECO merger is the person who arranged the sale of the ComEd personal finance as the person who grows the separation of the Generation into a totally separate company, I think the structure that I have established here at Exelon have proven to be remarkably valuable.  And I think, if you look at this deal is first to figure out what percentage of the rate increases over say five years, we arranged to bring home, I think that you will have pretty satisfactory number and when you look at it going out into the future, I think you have to step back and say what in the future look like. See if it's the another 25% increase at one time in Northern Illinois and 50% increase in Southern Illinois there will be new pressures on legislator and new problems to deal with. On the other hand if the systems evolve into a slower or more wretched set of increases I think our structures will prove relatively secure and then step back and say would you really whether defend rate increases in rate based environment, when they have done that it’s not so easy. So, I think, we accomplished what we had to do. Paying $800 million is not a cause for celebration but protecting the market value of 11 nuclear plants in Illinois that is a very big deal indeed. 
Greg Gordon - Citigroup: Thank you, John. 
Chaka Patterson: Next question please. 
Operator: Your next question is coming from Paul Fremont with Jefferies. 
Paul Fremont - Jefferies: Thank you. I am still confused with respect to Illinois as to how new power plants can built in the state, and if I in terms of the amenities and the co-ops, is there any specific state involvement in the construction of new power plants or they are offering or proposing to offer specific contracts on new build or they are not planning any action with respect to new built? 
John Rowe: Well I think it's not been laid entirely clear because every state with competitive market is sort of muddling we wait for the market simply to jump start them or do you try to do it with contracts which as the old integrated resource management add to it. What I believe is slightly in Illinois is that the new power billing agency, we'll propose contracts of some link for new kinds of power and given the politics of the state in the sort of climate sense you can bet that the first one will be vary and anyway fish with cold and not know what to do about it, because of the climate issue and they will be very reluctant to propose contracts to build nuclear. But fortunately the power supply situation in Illinois is still where you need peaking capacity before you need a lot base flows, so I think you'll see some mix of contracts in market or gas fired generation, supplementing some real contracts or win and a lot of kind of debate around the issues of coal and carbon. 
Paul Fremont - Jefferies: Also a quick house keeping question on Commonwealth Edison, are you reflecting the full $416 million perk transmission increase in your rates or because they are subject to refund is there a reserve for some element of that? 
John Rowe: The full amount is in, however, reflecting in the books, we do have a small reserve set aside, because it is subject to review. We are also reviewing reconsideration on a couple of issues so as of now we are going with the rate as they were approved May 1. 
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Steven Fleishman with Catapult Partners. 
Steven Fleishman - Catapult Partners: Hi John, can you hear me. 
John Young: I came to remember you from days in New York. 
Steven Fleishman - Catapult Partners: Yeah, same person with respect to just finalizing this deal could you just go through again what the exact process is? 
John Young: I will ask Fran to do that, whether talking to Frank or gambling the end trials of the sheep is more productive as the details of the process is valid open question. 
Frank Clark: Let me try to remind you and stay hold. The deal will set it to the house oversight committee come to have this afternoon. That’s a nine member committee, it just passed out of that committee toady and we said instead of bill by the way, that the on set meeting LO moved the third meeting, so it will put it out of the House Energy or House Oversight Committee and over to the Senate. It will then go to the house for it's approval. And probably would not occur into Thursday morning. After the thorough vote and in the needs of majority and needs so many vote after that they needed effective graded and went in the extended fashion.  The next step after passing for house will be to go to the senate E&E Committee, the environment committees. And that should also occur on Thursday and the expectation will be voted out in the E&E Committee on Thursday. I know that they contemplate all possibilities that are possible, but three books in one day is a challenge that as a broad sense out [Technical Difficulty] also on Thursday. 
John Rowe: Friday, if everything works exactly that is right the government would the deal a few days after that. The Governor has indicated that the dual transmission for guidance and that is why expectation that could occur next week you'll see. 
Steven Fleishman - Catapult Partners: Thank you. 
Chaka Patterson: Next question please. 
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. 
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates: Good morning guys. 
John Rowe: Hi Paul. 
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates: Just sort of follow up on Greg's question with respect to the RTO and tax threat that was out there. If I would understand you correctly, the real sort of -- I guess which you feel very comfortable with is that, when you spoke or and in your negotiation with Madigan and Jones and Lisa Madigan as well. You have their commitment that they are not going to actually proceed on this because that is sort of I think Greg question, I mean the rebase that you guys are still providing became comparatively small in '09 and '10. And I guess the question just to sort of clarify this. What happens I guess if, what is it that makes you guys feel comfortable other than obviously this rebase language being able to stop the rebase later on that these guys are not going to come back. And try to say hey G maybe this RTO thing doesn’t work. I mean, is the legislation associated with the RTO, can that be changed by the legislature or does this pretty much stop a legislature for 2022 to just change that? 
John Rowe: A new legislature would change it, I don’t think they will. First I am putting the lines on what I consider the speakers word and the senate Presidents word. Those are two very strong people. I will ask Frank to comment on that when I finish. But second this why I put so much emphasis on the financial swap. That contract takes the incentives away to metal. Very large piece of it probably six years, I believe that the new state power agency and the Attorney General will see that now that they have their price from Exelon and it is the market price they will better opt to have market work to get the best price from everybody else. And so I think that is a strong shifting of the interests on what work received is mugging up the market to an interest in making it work. 
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates: What is that John, if this is just the market price right how is anything I mean if I understand you guys correctly it looks like you guys are saying that the peculiar process isn’t likely to change the price that you are receiving. So why is a five year contract at markets so to speak? What is the incentive not to change? I don’t mean to tense here but why is that actually intensified but not to change it in the market? 
John Rowe: It is a price and in the claims that (inaudible) as you can sit here, but this price starts at what was the market price when we made the agreement. And there is certainly room for it to go up a little bit, up and down depending on the exact time of the deal and then it has it escalators in it reports to define terms. So from the point of view of the AG if the market goes up a lot more than expected they have got price stability for the customers but from our point of view they are now focusing on how they can get the other base load and cycling and picking power they need from other people, that's not a matter of going and beating on one big generator that's a matter of how you make the market work, I think its, what you said is all together. Frank, do you want to add in terms of the degree of confidence you have in, what's the people committed to? 
Frank Clark: Well, I have a probably high degree of confidence today that speaker Madigan, our president John and Attorney General who is the Madigan have signed a four year deal and signed it to long-term, and agree to be four year deal. You can't buy a future general assembly, so I don't want to give the impression that nothing sustain, but we have that words, we have the signature of the Attorney General on the settlement agreement and we have an understanding with the large body of legislators not just four leaders but their respective leaderships that has impacted four year deal. So, in some respect while we are acting on the same, I just think of a large number of legislation. In addition, it does impacted two houses to pass legislation so one chamber reacted to other considerations in the future. They would have to get the other channel to agree and that has -- and what's the corporate causes, in other words its difficult watching a lot of that, it is somewhat difficult to change but not inspirable but the degree of confidence today is high. 
John Rowe: No, I would just say the contract was based on market at the time when we made the agreement, it's very much in line with our long range planning, it's not away from that and as trading group was very happy to do this contract just fair amount it's a financial swap its no power, no ancillary services change, hence and I think from Illinois point of view, it give some price certainty for procurement of that load they wanted, they want it that price certainty. If prices go down they will be able to buy the rest of their portfolio much cheaper if price go down, if prices go up, we are happy because they hedge on, so it's a simple is that from my perspective. 
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates: Thanks. 
Chaka Patterson: Next question? 
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Ashar Khan with SAC Capital. 
Ashar Khan - SAC Capital: Good afternoon, if I am hearing in, is it right to expect that the change in the procurement process from your point of view should not have any differences and in prices going forward versus the current process? 
John Young: As far as we concerned any procurement process, we are entitled to market prices for our energy and that capacity and our ancillary services. And any procurement process should follow that, did you hear all that by the way because my mic went off? 
Ashar Khan - SAC Capital: Yes, I did. 
John Young: You got it, well, okay. In other words unless somebody is trying away to force us to sell away from market prices any procurement process has to follow market pricing and that's our intention. 
Ashar Khan - SAC Capital: Okay. And if I can just finish off, John you mentioned the capital allocation decision, will that be just in the third quarter announcement just for this year or is it going to be a broad based decision of what capital allocation return to shareholders going forward for the next two or three years? 
John Rowe: It will be just for this year as we did last year, give you some indication at the end of the year kind of what things out of a whole budget assumptions what capacity might be over a longer period, but that again the policy is that we will make that determination each and every year for that year as far as what return to shareholders be a share repurchase how much that, the same thing is setting the dividends that will be in annual decision. 
Ashar Khan - SAC Capital: Thank you, sir. 
Chaka Patterson: Operator that’s the end for our questions we would like to turn it back over to Mr. Rowe for closing remarks. 
John Rowe: I will be very brief. I do believe subject to the final probations that Frank described, we have this issues behind it. I do believe that this will last at least for a year, because of the way we have staggered pieces of this. I think we have provided a basic structure for peace in Illinois for a longer period than that, and I continue to connect to you just as we look at the options what we can add to this company, what we might separate from this company, we will do it in the same where’s the money added to which we have all done it. Exelon rests on keeping the life time, running our nuclear plants well and adding value where ever we can and that is what we continually do.  My thanks to all of our employees and allies who through their foreign process with it. My thanks also to new our investors and the phase 50 could come out with the decent results which we have done.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Jacque and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Exelon Corporation Fourth Quarter 2006 Earnings Release Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you.  It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Joyce Carson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Madam, you may begin your conference. 
Joyce Carson: Thank you, Jacque. Good morning and welcome to the Exelon's fourth quarter and yearend 2006 earnings review and update conference call. Thank you all for joining us today.  We issued our earnings release this morning. If you haven't received it, the release is available on the Exelon website, at "www.exeloncorp.com," or you can call (inaudible) at 312-394-5222, and she will fax or e-mail the release to you.  This call is being recorded and will be available through February the 6th by dialing 877-519-4471. The international call-in number is 973-341-3080. The confirmation code is 8292439. In addition, the call will be archived on the Exelon website.  Before we begin today's discussions, let me remind you that the earnings release and other materials we discuss in today's call may contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for discussions of factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts and expectations.  In our press release and during this call, we will discuss adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings that exclude the earnings impact of mark-to-market adjustments from non-trading activity; investments in synthetic fuel-producing facilities; certain costs associated with the terminated merger with PSEG; significant impairments of intangible assets, including goodwill; significant changes in decommissioning obligation estimates; severance and severance-related charges; previously incurred severance costs to be recorded by ComEd as approved in the December 28th 2006 amended ICC order; previously incurred losses on extinguishments of long-term debt to be recorded by ComEd as approved in the July 26 ICC order; and other unusual items, including any future changes to GAAP. We believe these adjusted operating earnings are representative of the underlying operational results of the Company. In today's earnings release, we provide a reconciliation between GAAP earnings and adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings.  With me today are John Rowe, Chairman, President and CEO of Exelon; John Young, Executive Vice President, Finance and Markets and Chief Financial Officer of Exelon; Frank Clark, Chairman and CEO of ComEd; and other members of our Exelon and ComEd's senior management team, who will be available to answer your questions.  Today's call will focus on fourth quarter and full year 2006 financial and operational results, our 2007 outlook, and an update on key issues facing the Company. We have scheduled an hour for this call. We will spend about 30 minutes on prepared remarks and use the remaining time for Q&A. In order to effectively manage this call, we would appreciate it if you would limit yourself to one question during the Q&A.  I will now turn the call over to John Young, who will begin with a discussion of Exelon's financial results. John?

John Young: Thank you, Joyce. Good morning and Happy New Year to everyone. I hope you were able to spend some quality time with family and friends over the holidays. We enjoyed seeing many of you in Chicago at our December investor conference and hope you found the meeting and materials informative.  Today, I will discuss Exelon's fourth quarter and full year 2006 financial results and briefly recap our financial outlook for 2007, which was covered in detail at our investor conference. Then, I will turn the call over to Frank Clark, who will provide an update on recent and upcoming activities in Illinois and at ComEd.  John Rowe will conclude our prepared remarks with an operational update and provide his thoughts on two key industry issues, in terms of wholesale markets and normal climate change. We will wrap up the call with Q&A.  Turning now to earnings. As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we had a solid fourth quarter and a strong year. Exelon announced fourth quarter adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings of $487 million, or $0.72 per diluted share, a slight decrease from the fourth quarter of 2005 operating earnings of $495 million, or $0.73 per diluted share.  Our full year 2006 operating earnings were $3.22 per diluted share compared to 2005 operating earnings of $3.10 per diluted share. I'll quickly review our fourth quarter and then return to our full year earnings.  Similar to the first three quarters of 2006, higher wholesale margins at Exelon Generation and higher electric revenues at PECO continued to be major positive year-over-year earnings drivers in the fourth quarter.  These positive drivers offset by unfavorable items, including the effects of unfavorable weather conditions as compared to in the fourth quarter of last year at both ComEd and PECO; higher operating and maintenance expenses, driven by continued inflationary pressures, and two favorable onetime items that occurred at Exelon Generation during the fourth quarter of 2005; and increased depreciation and amortization, including the scheduled higher CTC amortization at PECO, and increased costs associated with recognition of stock compensation expenses across all our operating companies.  We estimated that the unfavorable weather had about $0.04 of negative impact on the fourth quarter earnings for our delivery companies relative to normal weather. Weather normalized earnings for the fourth quarter would have been $0.76 per share, a 6% increase over weather normalized earnings of $0.72 for the fourth quarter of 2005.  On a GAAP basis, Exelon reported consolidated earnings of $592 million, or $0.87 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2006. The main difference between GAAP and non-GAAP operating earnings during the quarter was related to a onetime benefit of $0.14 per diluted share associated with the previously incurred severance costs, which were addressed in ComEd's December 20th 2006 amended order.  Please refer to the tables in the Company's earnings release for additional details regarding our fourth quarter results, including a full reconciliation of our fourth quarter reported GAAP earnings and adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings.  Now, I'll briefly recap our 2006 full year results and 2007 outlook for the consolidated company and by individual operating companies. Exelon's full year 2006 operating earnings were $3.22 per diluted share, a 4% increase over 2005 operating earnings of $3.10 per share, and in the center of our revised guidance of $3.15 to $3.30 per share.  The major drivers of year-over-year growth in operating earnings for the full year were higher generation margins and continued strong operational performance partially offset by higher operating costs. These drivers were essentially the same as what we told you in our original guidance at the beginning of 2006 and have been a continuing theme throughout the year.  For the year, we estimate that unfavorable weather had about $0.07 per share of negative impact on the earnings of our delivery companies relative to normal weather and about $0.18 per share of negative impact compared to 2005. Weather normalized earnings of 2006 are $3.29 per share, a 10% increase over weather normalized earnings of 2005.  For 2006, Exelon Generation contributed $1.88 of operating earnings per diluted share, a 13% increase over 2005 operating earnings of $1.66 per share. Generation's full year earnings were in line with our full year 2006 guidance range of $1.85 to $1.95.  In 2007, we expect Generation's operating earnings to increase considerably, primarily due to expiration of the below market ComEd PPA. 2007 operating earnings guidance for Generation is $3.40 per share to $3.60 per share.  ComEd's contribution to operating earnings of $0.78 per Exelon's share for 2006 were flat when compared to 2005 and in the center of our full year guidance for 2006 of $0.75 to $0.80 per share. We estimate that unfavorable weather had about a penny per share negative impact on the full year 2006 earnings of ComEd's relative to normal weather and about $0.11 per share negative impact compared to 2005.  As a reminder, we expect ComEd's operating earnings in 2007 to decrease significantly from 2006 levels due to the factors we discussed previously. 2007 operating earnings guidance for ComEd is $0.10 to $0.20 per share, which reflects the full impact of the December 20th ICC rate order in the rehearing of ComEd's delivery service case.  The amended order allowed for $74.3 million of increase in the [DST] revenue requirement, reflecting increase in allowed administrative and general expenses and debt return on the 2004 pension contribution.  A portion of the A&G expense is tied to recovery of previously incurred severance costs of $158 million pre-tax, which will now be amortized over the next 7.5 years, reducing the pre-tax benefit of the revenue increase by about $21 million per year.  In December, we provided you with the 2007 operating earnings guidance for ComEd of $65 million to $125 million. The range assumed various outcomes for the DST case rehearing. With the $74 million increase, less the $21 million amortization, the midpoint of the range moves only modestly.  Therefore, while the rehearing did give us additional clarity regarding delivery revenues, we are maintaining our guidance at this time given the continuing issues in Illinois and the ongoing risk that ComEd still faces.  PECO's contribution to operating earnings for 2006 was $0.67 per share, representing a 15% decrease from 2005 operating earnings. PECO's earnings were slightly higher than our 2006 guidance of $0.60 to $0.65 due to change in our estimate for electric unbilled revenues and the successful R&D tax refund plan.  We estimate that unfavorable weather had about $0.06 per share of negative impact on the full year 2006 earnings at PECO relative to normal weather and about $0.07 per share negative impact compared to 2005.  Looking to 2007 and through the balance of the Pennsylvania transition period, we expect continued modest year-over-year decreases in PECO's earnings were slightly higher than our 2006 guidance of $0.60 to 0.65 due to the change in estimate for electric unbilled revenues and the successful R&D tax refund plan. We estimate that unfavorable weather had about $0.06 per share negative impact on the full year 2006 earnings at PECO relative to normal weather, and about a $0.07 per share negative impact compared to 2005.  Looking to 2007 and through balance of the Pennsylvania transition period, we expect continued modest year-over-year decreases in PECO’s operating earnings, driven by the increased amortization of CTC and higher operating expenses including pension and benefits. 2007 operating earnings guidance for PECO is $0.60 to 0.65 per share. As a remainder, our earnings guidance assumes normal weather.  As highlighted during our investor conference, we continue to be focused on creating shareholder value. Our strong 2006 results set the table for continued strong performance in 2007 and beyond. We are reaffirming Exelon’s non-GAAP operating earnings guidance range for 2007 at $4 to $4.30 per share and we are reaffirming our GAAP earnings guidance of $4.10 to $4.40 per share.  The expected uplift in earnings from 2006 to 2007 will provide continued strong cash flows creating an increasingly strong balance sheet. We remain committed to returning available cash to our shareholders through our new value return policy, while maintaining financial flexibility to take advantage of opportunities as they may arise.  In accordance with that value return policy, we set the first quarter of 2007 dividend at $0.44 per share, a 10% increase over the dividend for the fourth quarter of 2006. This dividend is payable on March 10, 2007 to Exelon’s shareholders of record on February 15, 2007. In our earnings release, we have provided much more detail regarding our financial and operating results in addition to details on the effects to our balance sheet applying FASB new accounting standards for pension and other post-employment benefit plans.  With that, I will turn the call over to Frank Clark. 
Frank Clark: Good morning. I am Frank Clark, Chairman and CEO of ComEd. If you please allow me to provide you with a brief update on the status of electricity rates in Illinois, the latest legislative session in Illinois Springfield ended in a stalemate; this is ceptable result for ComEd.  The 94th Illinois General Assembly ended its session on January 9 without taking action on either a three year rate freeze bill or a compromise phase-in plan. The House bill, which would have rolled back frozen electric rates at pre-2007 levels for at least three more years, was not called for a vote of the Senate. And Senate bill, which would have phased in electric rate increases for residential customers with no interest was not called in the House.  This means our new rate approved by the Illinois Commerce Commission remains in effect. The first bills reflecting these new rates have been mailed to customers.  Last month, the ICC issued its final order in re-hearing of ComEd delivery service rate case. ComEd received an additional modest increase. Even with this adjustment, ComEd rates will still remain lower than they were in 1995. Also in December, the ICC approved ComEd voluntary phase-in plan. The plan allows residential customers the choice to cap their electric bill increases at 10% a year through 2009. Customers will pay deferred amount from 2010 to 2012 at a below market interest rate of 3.25% per year. Customers can start enrolling in that plan now.  Despite the fact that the new rates and phase-in plans have taken effect, the fight on this issue is not over. The rate freeze extension bill could be revisited by the House in the future. With the new legislature in place, all bills must begin the process anew and be reintroduced. The General Assembly will be back in Springfield on February 6th.  Illinois State Senator, James Clayborne has recently sought to bring together the utilities and various parties to determine if the compromise position would be appropriate. We applaud these efforts. ComEd has always said that we are open to discussions to help customers transition to the new rates.  We welcome an opportunity to meet with policymakers, consumer groups, and other parties to achieve the lasting solution. Nevertheless, we have entered into binding contracts to supply electricity for more than 3 million customers. We remain committed to the Illinois auction, which gives us the lowest available market price per customer. We will continue to provide regular updates on the status here in Illinois.  And now, I will turn the call over to John Rowe. 
John Rowe: Thank you, Frank. Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. This morning I will add a little perspective to 2006 and offer some thoughts on our strategy going forward especially as it is affected by the national spate from competitive market and global climate change.  As you all know 2006 was very a demanding year at Exelon. We faced serious regulatory challenges in both Missouri and Illinois. Arguably we lost in New Jersey but we kept our commitment to financial discipline as we have promised we would. In Illinois, the ComEd team has been successful in making Illinois Restructuring Act work. I think it’s clear to say that we have discussed the Illinois core solution to good use almost when we could.  The real story for 2006 at Exelon is that we continue to be one of most successful companies in our industry. For the sixth consecutive year, we have improved our operating performance and our operating earnings. As John Young has already reported our year-over-year operating earnings per share increased 4% from 3.10 to 3.22, in spite of relatively unfavorable weather. On weather normalized basis, operating earnings would have been up about 10%.  Over the past six years, operating earnings have increased by almost 9% per year. This success is the product of unrelenting focus on operating performance, disciplined financial management, and sound approaches to regulation, the continuing basics of our business.  In the nuclear area, Chris Crane and his team achieved a new fleet generation record for the fourth consecutive year, producing over 131,000 gigawatt hours in 2006. Nuclear achieved 93.9% capacity factor for the full year, the second highest ever recorded by the fleet compared with 93.5% for 2005. It also set a summer capacity record at 98.1%.  Our average refueling outage duration was 24 days, an improvement over 2005 and significantly better than the 2006 industry average of 39 days. Exelon executed four of the five shortest refueling outages in country in 2006. Totally with all these accomplishments, Nuclear also recorded its best worker safety record in the company’s history.  The Salem and Hope Creek site also set a new combined site capacity factor of 95.7% for 2006 with refueling outage duration averaging 25 days. As many of you know, the site management is being transitioned back to PSEG under the termination provision of the nuclear operating service contract. The three senior leaders of Exelon's on-site team were hired by PSEG effective January 1 and Exelon Generation is transitioning out of management of the site. We are committed to a smooth transition and to continued safe operation.  In our fossil area, Mark Schiavoni and his team have delivered a great year. Our fossil and hydro fleet finished the year with commercial and equivalent availability factor of 93.5% and 95% respectively, the highest commercial availability ever achieved by a fossil team.  Power team, led by Ian MacLean, delivered another distinguished performance in turning our operational prowess into commercial success. Despite somewhat lower gas and power prices and lower load volumes, Power team hedged and optimized our portfolio to again deliver above budget growth and profitability. I am especially grateful to Ian McLean and their team’s efforts this year.  At ComEd, a competitive auction was successfully conducted in Illinois to meet ComEd's continuing load obligation. The end result of the auction and ComEd's delivery service rate case was our overall rate towards customers that's as less than, I think, was approved by regulators in 1995, 12 years ago. Seems fairly clear that competition is working in Illinois in spite of what some would say. And PECO, although challenged by twice as many storms as would be more typical, still had one of its best years in non-storm reliability. We expect PECO to recover from the severe weather and again show improvement in reliability.  As a consequence of our continued financial and operating performance, you have again rewarded us by making us the most highly valued company in the industry. Our stock grew more than 16% in 2006 from $53.14 on December 30 to $61.89 on December 29, 2006. Our yearend market capitalization exceeded $41 billion and is a little over $40 billion as we speak.  As I discussed at length at our Annual Investor Conference, our strategy going forward has two components. First, we must protect the value that we have created, which requires delivering continued superior operating performance and constantly improving it, it requires supporting competitive markets, it requires protecting the market value of our generation and building healthy self-sustaining delivery companies. It is often said that the best defense is a good offense. In the utility business, it's often the other way around. In this case, what works for the (inaudible).  Second, as we look forward, we will be dedicated to growing future value by improving even more our performance, continuing to use our financial discipline, evaluating new growth opportunities, and advancing our environmental strategy. I should also say that the value return policy we announced last fall is also part of this.  The components of our strategy are increasingly affected by two overarching policy debates. One is about this continued viability of wholesale markets and the other is about climate change. In our view, the evidence is simply overwhelming that competition at the wholesale level has delivered huge public benefits.  Even apart from ComEd's recent experience with the auction in Illinois, studies by PJM, CERA, GAO, and [SYNOP] have all confirmed that wholesale competition has; one, improved the operating performance of existing generating units; two, reduced their cost of operations; three, resulted in the construction of significant new generation; and four, pass along significant price reductions to customers.  CERA recently estimated the savings for residential consumers at $34 billion between 1997 and 2004. In spite of this record, competitive model is being challenged. This is because public reacts to price increases under any model. In competitive jurisdictions, there have been price increases over the past several years, in some cases because of reliance on natural gas, and in other cases because of timing.  In a number of states, Illinois included, the increase coincides with the end of restructuring transition periods during which customers receive significant savings of rate reductions and accompanying rate freezes. Massachusetts customers recently saw a 28% increase. In Delaware there was a larger 59% increase. And Maryland recently announced a 47% increase. These all compare to 23% increase in Illinois.  (Inaudible). Now what is truly remarkable is that folks blame competition for the current price increases rather than rising fuel costs. In fact, the states that have traditional cost based regulation have also seen double-digit rate increases. For example, Louisiana saw a 67% increase between 2000 and 2005, Mississippi 53%, Oklahoma 47%, Colorado 43%, and Georgia 37%.  As we all know, people resent it when electricity prices go up. Increasingly we hear a chorus of naysayers, including some in our industry, some regulators, some public power figures, and even those who support to represents industrial customers saying that wholesale competition isn't working. The irony is of course that industrial customers were in the forefront of efforts to inject competition in the industry a few years ago. And those who think rate based means keeping price increases have very short memory.  We at Exelon do not intend to stay on the sidelines in this case. In the coming months we will redouble our advocacy for the competitive model both at federal level and in the states. We will look for then active support from the investment community. The question is quite literally whether we will affirm the obvious benefits of competition or whether we will again revert to planning regime and the inward search for a lower cost or market solution that doesn't work for anyone.  This competitive issue is particularly critical as we confront the second major policy, climate change. Any one who picks up a newspaper or watches TV news tells that climate is an issue whose time is now. The evidence that the atmosphere is warming is compelling, and in the judgment of most scientists, warming is predominantly caused by human activity.  I read one review this morning that suggested that Exelon would use this forum as a vehicle to campaign for carbon legislation. We hardly need to do that. There are others far more effective who will do that. At the regional and state levels, we see the RGGI initiative -- R-G-G-I -- in the Northeast and California's recent adoption of a bill known as AB 32.  At the national level, there has been a flurry of activity in the bipartisan (indiscernible) for the Senate resolution last summer. Speaker Pelosi has just announced a new committee on that. I think no one can predict the details of ultimate legislation, but it seems obvious that climate legislation will receive a great deal of attention this next presidential election.  We at Exelon are not strangers to this place. We have been working on it for a very long time. I was recently reminded that I first testified before Congress about carbon taxes in 1992. In the late '90s, one of the reasons we sold our fossil plants was we believed that carbon legislation would be coming in due course. More recently, I have been active as Co-Chair of the National Commission on Energy Policy, a bipartisan group of academics, environmentalists and some from the industry which has worked some response.  After much discussion, the commission concluded that effectively dealing with climate change requires both a carefully crafted regulatory regime, one that will effectively address carbon without an impossible economic burden, and the development of innovative, low carbon energy alternatives. NCEP recommended a cap-and-trade system with an exclusive safety valve to protect the economy, the tightening of CAFE standards, and more support for energy efficiency cleaner coal and new nuclear plants. There is no single technological answer to climate change.  While increased R&D is required, we believe that a competitive market within a proper regulatory regime will provide more innovative responses. In a very real sense, preserving and protecting competition is essential to successfully addressing climate change. In months ahead, we will be advocating both.  Whatever the fate, however, of climate legislation, it is clear that Exelon is uniquely positioned with our large nuclear fleet to continue our earnings performance in a carbon-constrained world.  So let me just wrap up and turn to your questions by saying we had a tough 2006, but we had a good 2006. I am very proud of what the Exelon team has delivered in the past year and look forward to a better year this year.  We have delivered outstanding operating results and continued outstanding earnings performance and overcome significant regulatory challenges. We shall keep marching along on our course.  Thank you very much. And we'll proceed to Q&A. 
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions)  Your first question is from Greg Gordon of Citigroup. 
John Rowe: Greg, welcome. 
Greg Gordon - Citigroup: Good afternoon, gentlemen. Looking at your numbers, this is sort of a back-to-the-future type question. You know, it's has been a while since you guys talked about the concept of the Exelon Way, which was your efficiency program.  And the reason I ask is because when I look at the earnings for the year, you know, there were $0.14 of increased O&M. Some of that I know was at ComEd where hopefully you ultimately get fair and equable cost recovery. But just in the fourth quarter alone, there was $0.07 of increase going out at Exelon Generation.  You're not the only company who runs merchant nuclear plants that's showing an increase in costs. So I'm wondering is this -- what are the issues that are driving that? Was it just a timing issue or are you actually seeing a fundamental increase in your cost structure? And is there a way to address that? 
John Rowe: I'll start with a short answer, and then refer this to Jack Skolds who can do better than I. But we believe that through the Exelon Way program, we were able to stem cost increases for a number of years, but we didn't reinvent the whole world. And operating these nuclear fleets does require continued expenditure.  We're starting to see this now both in the operating area and the pension area. And while we keep looking, we haven't found new ways to overcome those trends on a going-forward basis. Jack, do you want to --? 
Jack Skolds: The only other thing I will add on the generation and specifically the nuclear side are the costs to conduct our outages is going up substantially. And we have been dealing with some, as the rest of the industry has, some metallurgical issues, which have been expensive to deal with in the fourth quarter.  Other than that, there are I will call them unremarkable kind of onetime events that normally occur during a given year. But in the Generation area, the refueling outage costs are what is driving the increase. 
Greg Gordon - Citigroup: Can you go into just a little bit more detail on what these -- the drivers are there and what these metallurgical issues are as well, please? 
Jack Skolds: The metallurgical issues deal our steam generators on the pressurized water reactors, our reactor coolant system piping and on the boiling water reactors, the vessels. That kind of work is just becoming more expensive.  There is nothing out of the ordinary from the rest of the industry. It's just these types of efforts are becoming more expensive. Other than that, in a refueling outage it is people, it is parts and it is basically the contracting costs that we are managing right now. 
Greg Gordon - Citigroup: Thanks. I will honor the one question rule. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is from John Kiani of Deutsche Bank. 
John Kiani - Deutsche Bank: Good morning. 
John Rowe: Good morning. 
John Kiani - Deutsche Bank: You've already discussed a certain level of stock buyback that's assumed in your '07 guidance. Can you provide an update on your post '07 use or monetization of your expected excess balance sheet capacity? 
John Rowe: The philosophy is very simple. If we have excess cash and we do not have acquisition opportunity that we think we can convince you is a very good place to put your money, we'll give the money back to you. Beyond that, let me defer to John. 
John Young: Yes, we gave you some kind of insight into what might be available for 2007 in December. 
John Kiani - Deutsche Bank: Right. 
John Young: We further gave you if you look back at that presentation kind of an idea of what might be available actually through the entire planning period and our objective there is to probably -- you should plan on a review of that on an annual basis from our perspective.  We're not going to sit here and say we've got a multiyear commitment we're going to make. But we're going to kind of take that a year at a time is how we deal with it. But the one year looked or the five year looked like almost five times what the one year looked like. So it's pretty symmetrical throughout the planning period. 
John Kiani - Deutsche Bank: Great. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is from Paul Fremont of Jefferies. 
Paul Fremont - Jefferies: Thank you. Can you provide us with an update on the AG Supreme Court challenge to the auction? And given CUB's opposition to the auction process, do you accord a lower probability of being able to reach a compromise through Senator Claiborne's efforts? 
John Rowe: I think I should defer that to Frank. Let me say that the CUB is going to oppose the auction process all it wants. The contracts are signed, and they have no magic wand to make them go away. 
Frank Clark: Let me start by addressing the effort led by Senator Claiborne and then ask Darryl, ComEd's General Counsel, to comment on the AG's continued legal action. The president of the Senate, Emil Jones, has made it very clear and stated it publicly in a number of venues that he does not support a rate increase legislation in any form.  And he has instructed Senator Claiborne to get the parties together, the consumer groups, all of the parties that are willing to sit down at the table with the utilities to see if we can find a way to help transition the customer. This is my interpretation to help transition customers to the new rate.  And there are consumer initiatives that we are currently willing to talk about that they help customers better understand how they can manage their -- control their energy bills. We stated earlier and I will repeat it now, ComEd is fully committed both to the auction, and of course, we have already entered into a binding contract for the supply to our 3.7 million customers. Darryl, would you comment on the AG? 
Darryl Bradford: The Attorney General filed an emergency motion for a stay to require ComEd to roll back and freeze its rates both in the Illinois Appellate Court and the Illinois Supreme Court. Those were denied by the Illinois Appellate Court in late December and by the Illinois Supreme Court in early January.  The Attorney General has an appeal of the underlying Illinois Commerce Commission order authorizing the auction still pending in the Illinois Appellate Court Second District. That appeal has been debriefed since early November and will be decided by the court when it so chooses. 
Frank Clark: Thank you, Darryl. 
Paul Fremont - Jefferies: And in terms of a final decision, when would you expect the court to rule? 
Frank Clark: The court -- I don't have an expectation on that. The courts generally rule within for most of their cases three to six months of a case being fully briefed. But it is totally at the discretion of the court as to when it will render its decision on that issue. 
Paul Fremont - Jefferies: Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is from Hugh Wynne of Sanford Bernstein. 
Hugh Wynne - Sanford Bernstein: Hey. I had question about your cost numbers. The adjusted results for the fourth quarter of '06 when compared to adjusted non-GAAP results for the fourth quarter of '05 show a very substantial improvement, a reduction in your purchase power and your fuel costs.  The net reduction is -- in fuel and purchased power expense seems to exceed $300 million. And it's equivalent to about 20% of the fuel in purchased power expense that you incurred in the fourth quarter of 2005. I was wondering if you could comment on that and explain what it's attributable to and whether it's likely to continue? 
Ian McLean: Yes, it's Ian MacLean. Would you like me to take that? 
John Rowe: Yes. Go ahead, Ian. 
Ian McLean: Okay. It's simply the fact that if you remember we had the effects of Katrina back in '05 that sort of flew through till early '06. And literally as spot prices became cheaper and cheaper, you know, it became less expensive for us to buy the power to follow the load to serve the load. So that was -- it is as simple as that.  And yes, you won't see that because we no longer have in '07 the ComEd contract to serve. So we don't have all that load to serve. The load we are serving more or less is served out of our own unit. So we won't have that differential going forward to that extent. 
Hugh Wynne - Sanford Bernstein: So that would explain the $90 million reduction in purchase power expense. Then you have in addition to that a $212 million reduction in fuel off of a base of $770 million in the fourth quarter of '05. Is that just an anomaly of some kind or does represent an ongoing rate? 
Ian McLean: No. That's mainly gas. Gas came down -- you know, came down substantially. But as you know, gas -- typically the gas that we buy is based on a spot spread. So you know, it's based on where we sell the power. So although you saw -- you will see the purchase costs go down, typically the sales costs revenues go down as well commiserate to that. 
Hugh Wynne - Sanford Bernstein: Great. Thank you, Ian. I appreciate it. 
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is from Ashar Khan of SAC Capital. 
Ashar Khan - SAC Capital: Good morning. When should we expect the next ComEd rate case filing? 
Frank Clark: We are looking to file a rate case, a delivery service rate case, in the early part of 2007. I'm looking at -- I don't recall exactly when it is happening. 
Bob McDonald: We said -- this is Bob McDonald. We have said we will file a delivery services rate case before the end of the second quarter. 
Ashar Khan - SAC Capital: Before the end of the second quarter? 
Bob McDonald: Yes. 
Ashar Khan - SAC Capital: Okay. So that would mean that the rates might get affected somewhere around May of next year, right? Because of the 11 month period? 
Frank Clark: 11 months, Ashar, is probably safe. 
Ashar Khan - SAC Capital: Okay. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. 
Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs: Hi, guys Michael Lapides here. When we think about post 2007, can you talk a little bit besides buybacks about what the drivers of earnings growth would be for '08 and '09? 
John Young: Okay. And this will go back to our December 12 data. The drivers are the regulatory recovery plan at Commonwealth Edison, the DST case that Frank and Bob just talked about. There is also a transmission case that will be filed here in the next 60 days I believe at Commonwealth Edison.  So you have the normal rate based growth regulatory recovery that's going on there. Then the other drivers are whatever market prices move from repricing our hedges year-over-year. And you know, we will reprice a significant amount of the portfolio year-over-year. And then the drivers are going to be cost management beyond that.  Those are the kind of 8 and 9 timeframe; the next big driver is going to be the 2011 underwater EPA repricing at PECO. 
Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs: Right. 
John Young: And in between there is all the market fundamentals of market prices, whether capacity prices start reflecting their reduced reserve margins, where fuel prices go, all the environmental issues that John talked about and how quickly carbon may enter the picture. Those are kind of the mid-term and long-term drivers for Exelon as we go forward. 
Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs: Okay. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is from Jonathan Arnold of Merrill Lynch. 
Jonathan Arnold - Merrill Lynch: Good morning, everyone. 
John Rowe: Good morning, Jon. 
Jonathan Arnold - Merrill Lynch: I had a quick question picking up on the last one around the December meeting you gave us a sense of where your overall portfolio stood versus market. You broke out the PECO piece and then your other contracts, is there any -- get any chance of an update as to how those numbers look today versus how they looked then? 
John Young: No, they will look very similar to what we gave you then. I don't think we have plans on updating that until probably sometime in the mid year. 
Jonathan Arnold - Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is from Daniele Seitz of Dahlman Rose. 
Daniele Seitz - Dahlman Rose: Thank you. I just wondering on which do you attribute to the new capacity charges to the potential upside in '07 and '08? Have you quantified that? 
John Rowe: Daniele, I think Ian should answer that. 
Ian McLean: Daniele, are you referring to RPM? Is that? 
Daniele Seitz - Dahlman Rose: Yes. 
Ian McLean: Yes. Well, I think we talked at the investor conference. We have some baked into that. I don't remember the exact numbers. I know it was over the period of the four or five years, I think it was about $200 million. I don't see any big upside that's going to change our plan in '07 and '08.  And you know, I think there is going to be a court challenge to that. So you have to take it for what it's worth today, which is we've put in value for it. We think the value is about right. It's not really big numbers yet. 
Daniele Seitz - Dahlman Rose: Okay. Great. I'll go back in after. Bye. 
John Rowe: Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates. 
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates: Good morning, guys. I wanted to touch base with you on the generating business and just to, sort of, follow up on some of the earlier questions on 2008 versus 2007 in terms of the hedges rolling off. Ian, if you could just give us a feel for what 2008 looks like now versus your hedge causes for 2007 if you were to, sort of, contract here at what the forward curve is for 2008? 
Ian McLean: Yes. I think for 2007, I think we have discussed we're sort of mid to just above mid 90s hedged for 2008 at reasonably nice prices. So we're happy with that. 2008 we are up to about financially about 90% hedged for 2008. They are also at reasonable prices.  And you know, we were sort of encouraged by the fact that despite gas coming off fairly significantly in '07, the '08 market didn't really reflect that full drop in prices for '08. So a lot of it is risk there, right now the differential isn't that huge for '08. 
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates: So if directionally speaking would 2008 be, sort of, equal to 2007 or would it be lower or --? 
Ian McLean: Yes. I mean -- my guess would be right now a guess would be it might be a little lower but it depends where the prices go in that balance of 10%. 
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates: But the 90% that you've hedged and the upper 90s that you hedged in '07 -- 
Ian McLean: Much similarly based, yes. 
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates: Similarly. Okay. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is from Paul Ridzon of KeyBanc. 
Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc: John Rowe, I was just wondering if you have had any updated thoughts on M&A in the sector and your commitment to potentially build a nuclear plant, whether Yucca Mountain is still the big obstacle there and whether there's any work around. 
John Rowe: Well, we keep wire brushing our whole set of M&A options, but as you know, doing anything is a matter of when the time is right for us and when the time is right for a potential partner and those things are both inherently unpredictable. I think the operative wording here are patience and discipline.  We have lots of bright ideas, but which ones are possible and when they are possible is something my lawyers would not let me talk about if I did have an answer. I really want to emphasize the patience and discipline though.  We have plenty of work to do here at home at this moment. And on the nuclear plant, commitment and new nuclear plant don't really belong in the same sentence at the moment. I think the Yucca Mountain project has been in big trouble for some time. The election I think makes it virtually impossible for there to be progress on Yucca Mountain in the near future.  I expect to become Chairman of a Nuclear Energy Institute at its spring annual meeting. And I think it is fair to say that NEI is searching for ways to compromise with now majority leader Reid on some combination of new forms of ways of meeting the adequate assurance, finding and perhaps something like regional surface storage facilities or something like that.  Yucca Mountain is not going to go ahead against the wishes of the majority leader of the United States Senate. And so I think what you'll see now is the entire nuclear industry looking for ways to compromise with Senator Reid on some part of interim storage solutions.  Just speaking for ourselves, I continue to believe that there has to be some solution other than just hopes and dreams before one proceeds on a new nuclear plant. And we've made it very clear in our exploratory processes in Texas that it would have to be either a state or a federal approach to dealing with this before we go forward. 
Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc: John, would you stand by as potential competitors who didn't share your kind of view -- if you just went ahead and built plants? 
John Rowe: I would stand by with great cheer if there are those who are braver than I. This nation needs new nuclear plants. It needs it for climate and a whole lot of other reasons. If other people are braver with their investor's money than I am, I will cheer for them and bask in your confidence at the same time. 
Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc: Thank you very much. 
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is from Nathan Judge of Atlantic Equities. 
Nathan Judge - Atlantic Equities: Hi. On the Illinois issue, when do you think there will be a resolution to this issue and what needs to happen for a full and durable resolution? 
John Rowe: When is an impossible question to answer? I am not at the present time certain there will be one. This stalemate may be the resolution and if so, the Illinois Commerce Commission is adequately and effectively implementing the existing law.  As Frank made also so clear, the various Exelon companies would like to come out with a harmonious and more durable resolution that affects our interests and your rights as investors in our unregulated generation properties, and we have tried to be adaptable, flexible, creative, and we will continue to try to do that.  But, frankly, you've can't have a resolution beyond stalemate without something that makes Senate President Jones happy, the Governor happy, the Speaker of the House, Mr. Madigan happy. And I can't foresee what that would be, but because except for the rate freeze, which we can't bear and your rights won't bear, I do not know what might make Speaker Madigan happy. Frank, want to add to that? 
Frank Clark: I'd only comment that the politics in Illinois are complicated, but I would ask you to remember that all of the regulatory and legal processes that we have been engaged in over the last year have actually worked out in a manner that is very acceptable.  There was a question about the most recent legal challenge by the Attorney General, but as I recall there's been quite a few other challenges including the Illinois Supreme Court none of which are available. The (technical difficulty) exercises responsibility and issued an order first approving the auction and retail the auction. We (technical difficulty) 16 or so suppliers. Those contracts are binding.  I would love to have an opportunity to resolve what I consider some of the social issues around raising rates that have been frozen for a decade, but not in the manner that we jeopardize the financial integrity of ComEd. So Senator Claiborne to the extent that it is been asked by President Jones to get the parties together, we welcome that and we will participate in that. But the contracts we entered into are binding. The auction model I believe works very well and will offer or continue to offer the lowest available prices to consumers in Illinois. 
Joyce Carson: Thank you. 
John Rowe: I'd just like to pick up one other thing just to sort of wrap up because we're running out of time. Joyce says we have time maybe for one more question, but I want to get one more answer in even if there is not that question.  One of you in a prior call was kind enough to say that Exelon is appropriately priced at today's market values for energy and that implies an almost free option on whatever the benefits of carbon regulation maybe for a nuclear fleet. I will leave words like free for other people to use, but I simply want to reemphasize that as you look at these pressures of carbon, I don’t see where you have an investment play better than our nuclear fleet.  And as you think about some of the other things that affect what has historically been a cyclical industry issues like whatever the future of the dividend taxation maybe, again I think you'll look and you'll find your investment in us pretty well-positioned for dealing with those uncertainties.  What I would say is we'll try to continue to do going forward as we have in the past, which is to tell you in as far advance as we can where our problems and issues are and then to deal with them as effectively as we can. But I think if you look at us on a relative basis in this industry, we're positioned even better going forward than we have been over the past few years. Joyce, do you still have time for one more question? 
Joyce Carson: One more question, more. 
John Rowe: Okay. 
Operator: Thank you. Your final question is from Mr. Zach Schreiber of Duquesne Capital. 
Zach Schreiber - Duquesne Capital: Hey, John. It’s Zach Schreiber from Duquesne. Can you hear me? 
John Rowe: I seem to remember you Zach, yes. 
Zach Schreiber - Duquesne Capital: Yes, Sir. I seem to remember a lot of this discussion on carbon and I definitely like it as well. Just a question on the market fundamentals and this is a question for you from your vantage point and John Young and Ian from theirs, just what they're seeing in the markets. Heat rates, sort of the shape of the NI Hub curve relative to gas prices and just some of those power market supply/demand fundamentals, what are you seeing?  And related to that on the capacity price, clearly a lot of that’s dedicated in '07 but that $200 million, what did that relate to? And what is that worth economically and over what period of time? I'm just trying to -- I think investors have all gotten very comfortable understanding sort of the gas price sensitivity in your company and comps, but we're probably a little less educated on some of the heat rate and capacity values in those markets. Thank you. 
John Rowe: There are two things that John and Ian and Jack don't let me deal with. One is buttons and the other is numbers. So I will leave those for my colleagues. But just let me say that we have obviously seen the sort of heady gas peak tail and probably they've tailed a lot more because we have a winter without a winter right now.  But I think as we look forward you can see that Ian has dealt with that problem pretty effectively with his hedging strategy and we are seeing a tightening in capacity need all across this country. New Jersey is basically base load capacity short. The rest of PJM East is slowly getting tight on base load capacity.  And while the Midwest, like Illinois, still has enough, it will need more new peaking capacity within a reasonable amount of time. And what this tells me is that the potential feature for power prices both have to reflect the price of gas under more normal weather conditions and an increasingly tight capacity market. So that’s my lead in. John, Jack, Ian, which one of you wants to pick up and answer his real question? 
John Young: Well, I’ll address it and I think Ian can add some color to this, but generically or generally we see still the phenomenon where total electric prices at the wholesale level are in a energy or fuel kind of driven era where we are not seeing the capacity values whether it comes from heat rate or capacity prices or whatever that are needed to address the reserve margin issues that are coming -- that are either here or in New Jersey or coming as they cascade across the system.  We do from time-to-time and I think we reviewed this with you see the heat rate anomalies where heat rate becomes very low or becomes more appropriately valued in the market and that’s what has occurred as this gas price drop that we saw over the last few months, market prices remain fairly stable in all that through a heat rate expansion.  But we do see that there will be capacity values in the planning horizon and I will just quote some of the numbers we gave you. This year because of our hedge situation, a $1 movement in gas is about $25 million for us. 500 BTUs per kilowatt-hour or our heat rate move is about $35 million for us. Then capacity values if they increase by $10 that’s worth another $10 million to us.  But in 2011, a more kind of open position for us, those numbers are dramatically different, where $1 of gas is almost $400 million. You can go get the exact numbers out of the December 12th presentation. The carbon that John referred to is a significant contributor or even larger than that. And heat rate is quantified as almost $300 or $400 million less for that same 500 BTUs per kilowatt hour.  So none of that in our value right now but those are kind of the broad sensitivities and Ian might give you some of the specifics on where the market is right now. 
Ian McLean: Yes. I think Zach, you are probably well aware, you know, the heat rates in the Midwest tend to be low. It’s nuclear, coal driven energy economy. In the East, which we consider PJM East is they are very high and they are very volatile and you've got low capacity there, excess capacity. You'd expect that.  I think the interesting market for me is ERCOT. ERCOT currently shows a backwardated heat rate and then it climbs as you head out towards 2010 and 2011. That’s a market that I think people have to watch carefully, because I think that heat rate is really just following the energy price -- sorry, the gas price and the backwardated gas curve, and I think that could be a volatile market.  Overall, I think Mr. Rowe is right that heat rates are going to go up. Its unless somebody starts building or we don’t stop using electricity, they are just going to continue to climb. 
Zach Schreiber - Duquesne Capital: On the ERCOT heat rate, you said it’s going to be interesting. Is it with more upside or more downside? 
Ian McLean: I just think it’s going to be interesting on the upside, because it just sort of begs the question why would you have a market with large load growth and no capacity being built currently with a backwardated heat rate? I just find that intriguing. 
Zach Schreiber - Duquesne Capital: Yeah. Interesting, thank you. 
Joyce Carson: Thank you, Zach. 
Zach Schreiber - Duquesne Capital: Thank you, guys. 
John Rowe: Thank you, everybody. And again, let me say that we would have liked a little more December in December. But we are very pleased with last year. And on the carbon front, I was looking at the newspapers late last week, watching the announcements from the US Cap Group, which consists of GE and my friend Jim Rogers at Duke and Lew Hay at FPL and [Peter Darby] at -- I growl to Betsy Moler, who heads our Washington office -- "how come I've been working on this for four years and they get all the credit?" And Betsy looks at me and said, "Well, John, there are show horses and work horses and you are just stuck. You're always going to be a workhorse." So my message is admire the Arabians, invest in the Clydesdales. 
Joyce Carson: Thank you very much. 
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's Exelon Corporation fourth quarter 2006 earnings release conference. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning, my name is Eduardo and I will be you conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Exelon Corporation Third Quarter 2006 Earnings Release Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker’s remarks, there will be a question and answer period. Please limit yourself to one question. If you would like to pose a question during this time please press * then the number 1 on you telephone keypad. If you would like to withdraw your question please press the # key. Thank you. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Joyce Carson, Vice President of Investor Relations and Shareholder Services. Ma’am you may begin your conference.
Joyce Carson, IR: Thank you, Eduardo. Good morning and welcome to the Exelon third quarter earnings review and update conference call. Thank you for joining us today. We issued our earnings release this morning. If you haven't received it, the release is available on the Exelon website at www.exeloncorp.com, or you can call Mary Snider at 312-394-5222 and she will fax or e-mail the release to you. This call is being recorded and will be available through November 10th by dialing 877-519-4471. The international call-in number is 973-341-3080. The confirmation code is 7947312. In addition, the call will be archived on the Exelon website. Before we begin today's discussions, let me remind you that the earnings release and other matters we may discuss in today's call may contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for discussions of factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts, and expectations. In our press release and during this call we will discuss adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings that exclude the impact of mark-to-market adjustments for non-trading activities, investments (Inaudible) as approved in the July 26th IPC rate order and other unusual items including any future changes. We believe these adjusted operating earnings are representative of the underlying operational performance. In today’s earnings release we’ve provided reconciliation between GAAP earnings and adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings. With me today are John Rowe, Chairman, President and CEO of Exelon; John Young, Executive Vice President, Finance and Markets and CFO of Exelon; Frank Clark, Chairman and CEO of ComEd, and other members of our senior management team who will be available to answer your questions. Today's call will focus on third quarter 2006 results, full year expectations by operating company, and updates on key issues facing the Company including the Illinois proposal for a rate freeze extension. We have scheduled an hour for this call. We will spend about 30 minutes on prepared remarks and use the remaining time for questions and answers. In order to effectively manage this call, we would appreciate it if you limit yourself to one question. I will now turn the call over to John Young who will begin with a discussion of Exelon's financial results.
John Young, EVP and CFO: Thank you Joyce, and good morning. Today, I’ll discuss Exelon's third quarter financial results and our full year earnings expectations by operating company. Then I'll turn the call over to John Rowe who will provide an operational update and along with Frank Clark discuss recent Illinois regulatory and political activity. Exelon Corporation announced third quarter adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings of $690 million or $1.02 per diluted share, an increase of 7% from the third quarter of 2005 operating earnings of $645 million or $0.95 per diluted share. On a GAAP basis, Exelon reported a consolidated loss of $44 million or $0.07 per share for the third quarter of 2006. The major difference between third quarter adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings of $1.02 per diluted share and the GAAP loss of $0.07 per share is a charge of $1.15 per diluted share related to the impairment of ComEd’s goodwill, which I will discuss further in a moment. For a full reconciliation of our third quarter reported GAAP loss and adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings, please refer to the tables that accompany the earnings release. The major drivers of Exelon’s year-over-year operating earnings growth in the third quarter were higher wholesale margins at Generation, higher electric revenues at PECO, and favorable income taxes at PECO and Generation. Generation realized increased wholesale margins due to a contractual price increase in the PECO PPA price, higher realized prices on market sales, and increased nuclear and hydro generation. The increase in electric revenue at PECO was associated with PECO’s previously authorized rate increase and the favorable income taxes that were primarily due to Pennsylvania legislation allowing the realization of a previously written off tax asset at Generation along with an investment tax credit refund at PECO. These gains were partially offset by higher operating cost of about $0.06. These were due to numerous storms in the PECO service territory including the worst summer storm in PECO history in mid-July with 450,000 customers losing power. This storm cost about $0.04 for the quarter; in addition, higher nuclear refueling outage costs due to greater number of refueling outage days when compared to last year and inflationary pressures across the board. The quarter also included offsets from higher depreciation and amortization expense including the scheduled increase in CTC amortization at PECO and lower sales volumes at our delivery companies due to less favorable weather in 2006, which represented $0.05 at ComEd and a penny at PECO. To summarize, Exelon realized continued year-over-year growth in operating earnings in the third quarter, consistent with previous quarters this year. Higher margins from the Generation business and higher electric revenues at PECO were partially offset by increased operating costs, higher depreciation and amortization, and less favorable weather. For your reference, the full list of year-over-year earnings drivers for the quarter can be found on page 9 of the tables accompanying the earnings release. With three quarters of solid financial performance and robust operational results behind us, we are reaffirming our 2006 operating earnings guidance of $3.15 to $3.30 per share, which represents the top half of the range of our original 2006 guidance. Our operating earnings guidance is based on the assumption of normal weather for the remainder of the year. The key drivers of Exelon’s expected full year operating earnings growth are improving Generation margins, continued strong operational performance particularly in nuclear, partially offset by less favorable weather and higher operating and maintenance costs. Let me spend a few minutes on the cost side of the business. Several items, some of which are more one-time in nature and some ongoing, have contributed to the 2006 increase in operating and maintenance cost. The items that are unique to 2006 relative to 2005 include: a particularly severe set of storms at PECO this past summer that I’ve already reference, increased bad debt expense at PECO driven by higher customer billings of increased universal service program enrollments, higher nuclear refueling outage costs due to one additional outage in 2006 when compared to 2005, and the recognition of stock-based compensation expense due the adoption of a new accounting standard. Beyond these more unique items, we have experienced and are expecting to continue to experience overall cost pressures in our capital and O&M budgets. For example, we are seeing dramatic increases in the price of raw materials in recent years including copper, aluminum, core steel, and petroleum. As a result some of our commodities such as wire and cable, distribution transformers and poles have recently experienced double digit price increases. Pension and other retirement benefits costs have also risen faster than the rate of inflation. Also, with the transition to market prices for electricity in Illinois, ComEd has incurred additional cost due to continued legal challenges as well as the cost of funding its Customer Outreach program. We expect to see continuing rising cost pressure over the next several years; managing these cost pressures is a major focus of our management team. For 2006, we estimate GAAP earnings will fall in the range of $2.15 to $2.30 per share, assuming normal weather and excluding any impact of the July 26th ICC rate order rehearing process which will occur in the fourth quarter of 2006. This earning is lower than the previously estimated $3 to $3.30 per share primarily due to the impairment of ComEd’s goodwill in the third quarter. As I mentioned in the second quarter earnings call, under GAAP goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that it is “more likely than not” that goodwill might be impaired. Due to the significant negative impact of the Illinois Commerce Commission’s July 26, 2006 rate order to the cash flows and value of ComEd, we were required to complete an impairment test during the third quarter of this year. This test resulted in an impairment charge at both ComEd and Exelon of $776 million, or $1.15 per diluted share. Similarly, rate freeze legislation if enacted would cause a significant additional degradation of ComEd’s cash flows and would likely lead to a further impairment of goodwill at both ComEd and Exelon. Let’s turn now to the individual operating company’s third quarter performance. ComEd’s third quarter operating performance was relatively flat when compared to the third quarter of 2005. During the third quarter, ComEd benefited from a credit to reflect the recovery of previously incurred environmental costs associated with manufactured gas plants and lower purchase power expenses associated with ComEd’s purchase power agreement with Generation. These increases were partially offset by less favorable weather relative to the prior year. At PECO, operating earnings for the third quarter decreased for the same period in 2005 primarily due to higher CTC amortization, higher storm costs, and unfavorable weather relative to the prior year, which were partially offset by increased revenue from the previously authorized rate increase and ICC refund. The rate increase in CTC amortization were fully anticipated and included in our guidance. Generation’s year-over-year third quarter operating earnings drivers are consistent with what we have experienced all year. Operating earnings increased by 23% due to the contractual price increase in the PECO PPA, higher realized prices on market sales for more favorably priced hedges, and increased nuclear and hydro generation. Average realized wholesale margins on all sales at Power Team during the third quarter of 2006 were up 19% over the same period for 2005. This increase in earnings was partially offset by the contractual decrease in prices associated with Generation’s power sales agreement with ComEd and higher operating and maintenance cost, including those related to nuclear refueling outages and higher cost due to the inflation. In our earnings release we have provided much more detail regarding our third quarter results and we will be happy to respond to your questions later in the call. In a continuing effort to provide greater transparency in each of our operating companies, in the press release we have provided full year operating earnings guidance ranges for ComEd, PECO, and Generation on a standalone basis. In 2005, ComEd contributed $0.78 of operating earnings per diluted share for Exelon and we expect the 2006 full year contribution to fall between $0.75 and $0.80 per share. We expect ComEd’s operating earnings in 2007 to decrease significantly from 2006 levels due to several factors including the end of the transition period in Illinois and related transition revenues, the unfavorable ICC distribution rate case order in July 2006, regulatory lag due to the 2004 test year that was used in that rate case, increased operating cost to maintain and improve system reliability, and increased benefit and post-retirement expenses. Obviously, ComEd will be further negatively impacted if rate free legislation is enacted. In 2005, PECO contributed $0.78 of operating earnings per diluted Exelon share and we expect in 2006 the full year contribution to decrease to between $0.60 and $0.65. In 2007 and through the balance of the Pennsylvania transition period, we expect continued modest year-over-year decreases in PECO’s operating earnings driven by the increased amortization of CTC and higher operating expenses including pension and benefits. At Exelon Generation, Generation contributed $1.66 of operating earnings per diluted Exelon share in 2005, and we expect in 2006 the full year contribution to increase to between $1.85 and $1.95 per share. In 2007, we expect Generation operating earnings to increase considerably. The major driver of this projected growth is increased Generation margins due to the expiration of the below market contract with ComEd, favorable market conditions, and a contractual price increase in the PECO PPA. We expect these gains will be partially offset by the roll off of income from the TXU towing arrangement, higher fuel cost, and higher operating expenses including cost related to filing a combined construction and operating license in… We will provide more details on our earnings drivers and expected earnings growth rates by operating company over the next five years along with our high level planning assumptions at the EEI Conference in Las Vegas the week after next. At our annual investor conference in December, we will provide formal 2007 guidance by operating company along with more information on our strategic direction, earning sensitivities, hedging strategy, financing plan, and value return policy. Before I turn the call over John, let me discuss some recent news regarding the operating agreement at Salem and Hope Creek. The neutral operating services contract with PSEG will continue into 2007, but we received notice from PSEG today confirming that the agreement will terminate on January 17th. PSEG’s notice indicates that PSEG wants a two-year termination transition period and reserves the right under the agreement to ask for another year. During this termination transition period Exelon’s assistance to PSEG will wind up. Our interest in this agreement is solely defined as sustainable solution to the operations at…we have had discussions with PSEG along these lines and are continuing those discussions, but to date those discussions have not borne fruit. With that, I will turn the call over to John Rowe who will provide an operational update and discuss our views on recent Illinois events. I look forward to seeing you all at EEI.
John Rowe, Chairman and CEO: Good morning everyone, and thank you John. As all of you know because you see if for yourselves and we’ve told you again and again, Generation is becoming an ever larger part of Exelon’s earnings and Generation in turn is ever more effected by the commodity prices that exist around us. It is for that reason that John has gone into ever increasing detail on how the different components of our business are working so you can make your own best estimates for yourselves. We are of course pleased with our operating results for this quarter and the bad news that we had to bring you wasn’t news today at all; you’ve all heard in excruciating detail when they happen about the ComEd delivery rate case and also the continued threats of rate freeze legislation in Illinois. On an operating basis, our nuclear fleet achieved a capacity factor of 95.8% for the third quarter of 2006 with a summer capacity factor of 98.1%, which is a company best— congratulations Chris Crane— and almost a full percentage point better than its previous summer record of 97.3%. Our fossil and hydro fleet also had a strong quarter with commercial and equivalent availability factors of 92.8% and 88.9% respectively. Power Team continued to add value by optimizing our Generation supply portfolio translating operational performance into commercial value with continued improvements in Generation margins. I think Ian McLean and his group continues to do a superb job at prudently managing the opportunities that lie before them and dealing with risks of things like gas prices. On the delivery side, we experienced record breaking heat and storms this summer and in the early fall. Keeping the lights on always is our first imperative, required an extraordinary effort under such challenging circumstances. Both ComEd and PECO responded well but I have to give special flowers here to the PECO management; the Philadelphia area has had a truly remarkable series of storms and Dennis O’Brien and his team have done a wonderful job in the circumstances. Our commitment remains to continued operating excellence and financial discipline. We know of course that these are never enough. A key component of our success to date has been our ability to handle the regulatory and political challenges that we face and in that regard I’ve asked Frank Clark to join us so you get a first hand update from him on the Illinois situation. Frank.
Frank Clark, ComEd CEO: Thank you, John. As John has indicated, ComEd continues to face serious challenges as we move closer to the completion of the electric industry restructuring transitioning period in Illinois. These include trying to reverse, at least in part, the devastating ICC order in July regarding our delivery costs and revenues as well as new and strong efforts to impose an extension of the nearly decade long rate freeze in Illinois. Let me first address our efforts to persuade the ICC to allow us to recover a larger portion of our delivery cost than the commissioned July 26th order would have permitted. As you know, we have requested a revenue increase of $317 million reflecting our rising costs and significant capital investment in our delivery systems while our rates had been frozen. The commission’s decision allows for an $8 million increase; virtually zero. We are in the midst of a rehearing process and it is possible we will have an order in December of this year. We are encouraged by some of our interactions with interested parties and the ICC staff, but we cannot predict the nature of the eventual outcome. If the result is dissatisfactory, we will appeal. Looking ahead, if ComEd is to continue to maintain and improve the reliability of the system for customers, needs for growing customer requirements and improved customer service, regular rate cases will be required. ComEd plans to file its next distribution rate case in the second quarter of 2007. Let me also note that just recently, on Friday October 20th, the ICC administrative law judge and the proceeding on our rate phase-in proposal issued a proposed order recommending ICC approval of our plan. This moves us to closer to then offer our residential customers the option of paying the rate increase over time rather than having it reflected in their bill all at once. This plan does provide for the creation of deferral balances and their recovery with caring charge rate of 6.5%. Providing this phase-in option to our residential customers is a major part of our care program. Now that’s a program that we launched in the summer and it is designed to help our customers manage their energy bills. Our phase-in plan is supported by the ICC staff but opposed by the Attorney General and co. The ICC still needs to rule on this plan and give their approval by the end of November. Prior to this encouraging development, we accomplished a major milestone in early September with the successful completion of the first of the ICC approved reversed options designed to secure power supply at the lowest available market cost to meet our customer’s needs beginning in January next year when our current power supply contract expires. In this first auction, ComEd’s entire 2007 load and portions of the 2008 and 2009 loads were up for bid. With suppliers limited to serving no more than 35% of that load, the process was opened. Over 20 suppliers participated and there were 16 winning suppliers. We have signed contracts with the winning suppliers. As a result of this auction process, on average rates for our residential customers will increase 22% in January. While this is a significant increase it actually means that our January 2007 rates following a nearly decade long rate freeze will be lower than they were in 1995. To put this in context, in 2007 a competitive auction delivered prices that were less than the cost base price approved by regulators in 1995. Even with this positive auction result and the ALJ support of our rate increase phase-in proposal, we have experienced an escalation of political opposition to any rate increase. This is an election year and any increase in electric rates is the target for some political agendas. As a result, there have been calls by leading policy makers for an extension of the rate freeze via the legislation. On October 9th, a special hearing of the House Oversight Committee was held in Springfield resulting in a split committee vote in favor of rate freeze legislation and the speaker of the house has asked the Governor to call a special legislative session to consider this legislation. Even if a special session does not take place, it is possible that legislation will be considered in the veto session, which takes place in mid and late November following the election or in the spring 2007 session. All of our attention and effort is focused on defeating legislative rate freeze. So, we are close to achieving our goal of completing the transition to new rates based on ComEd’s new cost of purchase and supply and we are hopeful that we can work with the ICC and interested parties for our delivery service revenue and offer a rate increase phase-in program for our residential customers. Nonetheless, we still face a very difficult political challenge. If rate freeze legislation were in fact to become Illinois law, ComEd would quickly be paying more for electric supply and the operation of the transmission and delivery system in the revenues we would be allowed to collect. ComEd will take all of the available legal action to overturn this result. If this proposed legislation becomes effective, it would drive ComEd into insolvency and indeed bankruptcy. And as John has said repeatedly, there could be no bail out of ComEd at the expense of Exelon shareholders nor would we expect it. We’re doing all we can think of to avoid this outcome and while we are always ready to meet with our adversaries to negotiate a settlement on reasonable terms we are also prepared to exercise all of our options to avoid the results of such potentially devastating state policies. John.
John Rowe, Chairman and CEO: Thank you, Frank. Frank Clark and John Hooker and their team have done an absolutely wonderful job with the legislature, with their public relations program and so forth in deferring and deterring the effort to have rate freeze legislation. As you know, they’ve been successful to date and they’ll stay in their pitching. As Frank suggested, the ComEd legal team already has all the necessary papers prepared if this challenge should escalate even further, which we hope it will not. Just to comment on this again from the Exelon perspective, a rate freeze would not benefit customers. We don’t think it will even benefit political figures in the long run. We believe that a rate freeze if actually allowed into effect by the court could only lead to the bankruptcy of both ComEd and some of the Ameren companies. Exelon can withstand a ComEd bankruptcy and if rate freeze legislation were passed and sustained by the courts, in that situation perhaps it even must. We believe it will not come to that pass and we certainly hope it will not come to that pass, and we’re certainly doing everything we can to prevent such a situation from existing, but we prepare and at Exelon we tell you the possibilities as we see them. ComEd has always been a separate legal entity from the rest of Exelon. It accounts for less than 10% of our market value by our internal estimate. We have completed our ring fencing of ComEd to help assure that it remains a separate legal entity. ComEd has an active board with eight directors, seven of them outside directors and three of them selected because they are not even on the Exelon parent board. It has its own credit line. It is prepared to stand on its own if it must. Ironically, while they seem very different, the challenges we faced in New Jersey and continue to face in Illinois reflect the same issue. They reflect the value we have created in Exelon Generation. In both cases our opponents have been mesmerized by the desire to get the value of this unregulated company into the regulated delivery companies. We simply are not going to allow that to happen as long as we have the legal rights to prevent it. Some of our political opponents think that we were just lucky. I even heard another utility CEO falsely characterizing our nuclear plants as something the customers have paid for. That simply isn’t a reflection of the reality. As you all know, both ComEd and PECO in the fully regulated days suffered substantial losses on their nuclear plants. As you all know, both Illinois and Pennsylvania made decisions to bring competition in and both states allowed us to put our generation into separate competitive businesses. By doing that we put both the risks and the opportunities in one place and we will keep fighting to defend that position. So far, we have been successful. It wasn’t just luck that gave our nuclear fleet capacity factors that have been consistently over 90%. It was immense talent from Chris Crane, Jack Scholes, and before them Oliver Kinsley, and Chris’ whole team and immense hard work. It wasn’t just luck that our nuclear plants are in a separate company or that we sold our fossil plants in Illinois. It was hard headed thinking about the way the Illinois restructuring act worked and about the way the market place had to work and a willingness to take risks to put the opportunities of the business where the risks are. It wasn’t just luck that steered us into PJM, the most efficient wholesale market in the nation. That was hard headed thinking by Betsy Moler. It wasn’t just luck that has kept us investing in our P&D business and improving the service for 5 million customers. And it hasn’t been luck that we’ve built one of the best balance sheets in the business. The success for which you have paid in our leading market capitalization is a product of an absolutely relentless focus on the basic. We keep the lights on, we run our nuclear fleet exceptionally well, and we tell people -- our employees, our customers, and certainly you our investors -- about both our problems and our opportunities in the straightest way we know how. As we go forward we will continue to do everything we know how to do to protect and enhance your market value. We consider that a fundamental along with keeping the lights on and face nuclear operations. We not only plan to create value and work to create value, we make the hard decisions and take the gut that goes with creating value. When we need to fight we fight and when we need to change a plan as we did when we pulled out of the PSEG merger we do that. We are driven by value and we will stay that way. We will of course look for ways to ease the political tensions in our states. While I think our political case is strong and our legal case is close to impeccable as a legal case can be, we know that we would benefit from a stable long-term agreement in Illinois and we will continue to seek one by compromises that are consistent with the basic value structure we have created. We will continue to look for ways to defend and enhance the nation’s competitive markets. We shall continue to look for ways to deal with challenges like the Carbon and climate change issues and show leadership combat. We will continue to be hard headed as we approach electricity markets. And we will continue to do as John did in his enhanced explanation of how our individual companies work, show you with the highest level of transparency we can what we are and what we can deliver. That has been a value added recipe for the nearly nine years I’ve been here. I’m confident it’s going to stay a value added recipe. We’ll be happy to take your questions.
Joyce Carson, IR: Operator, we’re prepared for questions now.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, I would like to remind everyone, if you would like to pose a question please press * then the number 1 on your telephone keypad. As a reminder please limit yourself to one question. We’ll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Our first question is coming from Paul Fremont of Jefferies, please go ahead.
Paul Fremont, Jefferies & Co: Thank you very much. With respect to the recent merger breakup, have you reconsidered a structural separation of the regulated businesses form the non-regulated business to potentially put you in a better situation in the future? Also, can you give us a sense on cash re-deployment, what your priorities are right now?
John Rowe, Chairman and CEO: Paul, thanks for the questions, they’re both good questions. Let me touch upon the second part of it first. We’re going to give you a full picture of our cash re-deployment plans at our December 12th investor meeting here in Chicago and we intend to be looking at both the dividend issue, which you’re expecting us to look at, and we’ll also be looking at share repurchases and try to give you a package that we think returns value in the most efficient way, and after I finish responding to your question I’ll let John add more if he wishes to in that respect. On the first question, of course we think of that, we think about it all the time. We are keenly aware that over the past eight years there has been a vantage to shareholders in our current combined structure. We ask ourselves again and again “Will that advantage remain?” We also ask ourselves “Will the states of Illinois and Pennsylvania encourage us to separate or encourage us to stay together,” because the state statute governing restructuring wing would give the state something to say about that. And we’re prepared to address on an ongoing basis whatever option seems to give us the clearest picture of how to add value for shareholders. I don’t believe we know the answer to that yet. My officers all have individual opinions about it, but we believe we have to work through some of these current challenges first and we’re proceeding to do that. I would say that while we remain open on an M&A front to all kinds of possibilities, I think one of the issues you have to ask after our experience in New Jersey is whether it is easier to expand on the pure generation side of the business, and that’s the kind of question we ask. But, Paul, the best thing I can say about the first part of your question is it’s a very intelligent question and we have not answered it yet. We have certainly asked it and it will be the usual Exelon “value comes first” decision when we decide it either way. John, do you want to say anything more about his value return question.
John Young, EVP and CFO: I pretty much just agree with what you said, and just know that what we’re going to probably do mechanically is discuss from a framework perspective at EEI how we plan on addressing the value return and then get specifics with numbers on December 12th here in Chicago; all that is trying to recognize the changing composition of the source of cash and the source of earnings from a predominantly regulated company to a predominantly unregulated company over time.
Paul Fremont, Jefferies & Co: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from John Kiani of Deutsche Bank, please go ahead.
John Kiani, Deutsche Bank: Good morning. John, just to expand a little bit more on the comment you just made, can you give us a little bit more color on your view on M&A post determination of the Public Service Enterprise Group deal, could any potential M&A focus shift to the more pure non-regulated portion of the sector like the IPPs for example in order to avoid the regulatory risk that you discussed?
John Rowe, Chairman and CEO: I think the answer to that is it’s a distinct possibility. I thought I had stated that already. It would take a very special opportunity to get us to take on another integrated in the near future. Risks don’t exist in one sector. The probability of consummation risk is now very much higher in the integrated sectors of the business as witnessed not only by our PEG-E transaction but by the FPL constellation transaction. On the other hand, some of the issues that haunted us in New Jersey like DOJ’s unwillingness to accept FERC’s Appendix A as an adequate market power determination, it would haunt some IPP acquisitions as well. And as you know, when independent Generation is in it’s oh so in, and when it’s out it’s oh so out, and the question that John Young and Mack McFarland and their team will have to look at is what generation is too in to be a good deal anymore and what generation is still a good deal. Again, we want to grow but we only want to grow for value. I hope you will never see the day when John Rowe thinks you put growth ahead of value, because the only kind of growth I care about is growth that adds value for you.
John Kiani, Deutsche Bank: That’s very helpful, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vic Khaitan of Deutsche Asset Management, please go ahead.
Vic Khaitan, Deutsche Asset Management: Thank you. John and Frank, could you talk a little bit about the current political climate or sentiments in Illinois with respect to bankruptcy threat, has there been any change of feeling from either the governor or from the speaker?
John Rowe, Chairman and CEO: Well, I don’t think anybody really wants bankruptcy, but let me let Frank give you a more sophisticated answer to that and then I’ll pick up after he finishes, Vic.
Frank Clark, ComEd CEO: Hi Vic. I think that while the speaker in particular has stated that he does not believe that a ComEd bankruptcy would occur, I believe long term his concern is he would not to bear that responsibility. I also think the governor would not want to see a weakened financial structure in ComEd since we serve 30% of the state’s population. So, I think both of them are rightfully concerned. Bankruptcy of course occurs if freeze legislation passes. As stated earlier, the speaker did in fact send a letter to the governor earlier this month asking for a special session. Almost four weeks have gone by and no special session has been called. I’m sure the speaker will assess whether his numbers in the house want to have such legislation, and if he thinks he has enough votes he will try and move it, if he thinks he has not got enough votes he will not try and move it and we’ll probably face it again in the spring 2007 legislative session. It is my assessment so far the will of the Illinois General Assembly does not favor this legislation.
John Rowe, Chairman and CEO: Vic, the only thing I can add to that, because Frank is much closer to it, is I have to believe this will become a more rational process once the election is over; I mean you have had at least one candidate in this election taking a bad position publicly and then almost calling me up to apologize. I also believe that if the increase goes into effect in January you get a place where instead of us almost begging for people to negotiate a phase-in plan that makes it all more comfortable, I think that once the increase is in place you see some political leaders saying “Well, I wouldn’t cut a deal before because that was cutting a deal for an increase, but now I can cut for a decrease in the increase,” and that’s a much more attractive political dynamic. So, I’m hopeful that this gets to a more right political position for a settlement as we get into the first quarter. I’ve tried to make it painfully clear, and everything I say to you today is consistent with what I say to any political leader less; I mean I will fight for the value that you all put in our Generation business, I’ll fight like a trapped rat for it. On the other hand, I also understand that all the parts of Exelon’s business benefits from our harmonious relationship with our government, and as long as it doesn’t require some major sacrifice of the principle that these are independent companies, Exelon will consider a whole variety of alternatives to make a productive and stable political situation going forward. We started working on this years ago, some of us can even remember when it was a cliff that we were working on, and our preparations look pretty good at the moment, and I think we’ll continue to find ways to work it out.
Vic Khaitan, Deutsche Bank: Thank you very much.
Operator: Once again ladies and gentlemen, we do ask that you please limit yourself to one question. Thank you for your cooperation. Our next question comes from Greg Gordon of Citigroup, please go ahead.
Greg Gordon, Citigroup: Thanks. You did comment on Carbon in your opening comments, can you give us a view on when you think we actually will see a window to the monetization of the value that you have in your fleet because of adjusting with Carbon?
John Rowe, Chairman and CEO: I’ll give you my best insights for what they were, but probably you can pick up any political column to get a better one. I do not think you are going to have Carbon legislation in the next two years unless both houses change, and it’s not because I think President Bush is absolutely in…I don’t believe that. I just think the chances of people weighing the odds the same are still relatively small, but I do think that by ’09 you’re probably going to have Carbon legislation and I think you’re seeing on both sides of the isle more and more members of both houses believing something mandatory is necessary. I believe it will be some sort of cap and trade system. Whether it has a safety valve such as I have advocated, or whether it’s a more pure cap and trade system probably depends on how dramatically the Congress changes, but I think you’ll see something in place and having real cost with it sometime in the 2010-2012 timeframe. If I were a czar we’d start sooner and start lower and ratchet, because I think certainty is worth a lot more in this area than lurching, but no danger of my being a czar.
Greg Gordon, Citigroup: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs, please go ahead.
Michael Lapides, Goldman Sachs: Hey guys, question regarding Pennsylvania, is there any concern…I don’t want to use the word fear…regarding having a similar process in Pennsylvania play out that’s occurring in Illinois when the polar kind expires at the end of the decade, and if so what are the processes you can do to mitigate that in the next couple of years?
John Rowe, Chairman and CEO: Well, of course there is, I’m always frightened and that’s why you pay me is to worry about things like this in advance. You see the same sort of issue having bubbled around some of the western utilities in Pennsylvania whose transition periods ended earlier. However, the commission in Pennsylvania faced what maybe the most miserable situation of all in the Pike County proceeding, and there it was dealing with 70% increase and in the end it settled for 63%. So, I think they stood up to their obligations with absolutely remarkable courage. Now, fortunately in PECO we have a different situation. PECO was of course a relatively high-cost utility when all this happened, but it was also relatively high rate utility and because PECO’s CTCs — and John correct if I mistake this but I think I have it technically correct — in 2010 when it’s power purchase agreement ends, the vanishing of the CTC will compensate for most of the increase we would anticipate in the power market, and therefore we would anticipate a much smaller increase at PECO than other people in Pennsylvania are being forced to bear. So, I think the issue in Illinois is that we’ve had to break the ice, which is always hard on your nose. In Pennsylvania, I think other people are breaking the ice and we’re in a relatively favorable position to continue to construct a practical deal. John Young, did I mistake that in anyway?
John Young, EVP and CFO: No, and as John said Dennis O’Brien is already working on that. The transition charges and payments are very different in their construct than they were in Illinois and when it’s all said and done you’ve got to predict what market prices might be in 2011, but with today’s kind of forecast residential rates might face anywhere from 0 to low single digit, maybe 5% or 6% increases, something like that in the residential class. So, it’s a far different situation and the underlying distribution service company is much healthier financially than where ComEd happens to be right now.
Michael Lapides, Goldman Sachs: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Rizdon of Keybanc, please go ahead.
Paul Rizdon, Keybanc Capital: I was wondering if John Young, could you review kind of what you saw as the ’07 driver at GenCo, I didn’t catch all of them.
John Young, EVP and CFO: We’re going to go into excruciating detail on this than we have, so you’re going to get a lot more clarity on the transition in Illinois. The biggest driver is going to be the transition from an underwater market PPA that GenCo has with ComEd currently and having a different financial arrangement and physical arrangement in ’07. That is the biggest single driver of value that is going to be significant to both GenCo and the company. There are some other smaller ones, the rolling heads process, the risk management processes that Ian and his team have already done, but the biggest single driver is that ComEd PPA transition. There are also some small price changes of some of the bilateral arrangements that we already have, and then it’s the fact that we’re re-pricing a few things. But, we’ll go into that in very detail with the handout and the booklets we’re going to give you in a week and a half, okay?
Paul Rizdon, Keybanc Capital: Okay, fair enough.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates, please go ahead.
Paul Patterson, Glenrock Associates: Hi guys, just a quick question on the quarter year-to-date, weather versus normal. And the income tax benefit that you guys mentioned, is that going to be continuing or how does that work going forward, what kind of tax rate should we be using, can you just sort of elaborate a little bit on that?
John Young, EVP and CFO: I’ll let Matt Hilzinger talk about the income tax credit.
Matthew F. Hilzinger, SVP, Controller, Chief Accounting Officer: With the income tax credits there were a variety of settlements in the quarter and they were more event driven, so I don’t think you ought to consider those as kind of ongoing improvements in our effective tax rate.
Paul Patterson, Glenrock Associates: Okay, so that’s probably not that repeatable?
Matthew F. Hilzinger, SVP, Controller, Chief Accounting Officer: That’s exactly right.
Paul Patterson, Glenrock Associates: And weather versus normal.
Joyce Carson, IR: Can you repeat the question?
Paul Patterson, Glenrock Associates: Weather versus normal, I saw weather year over year, but it looks like…
Matthew F. Hilzinger, SVP, Controller, Chief Accounting Officer: That’s mentioned actually right in our earnings release, can’t put my finger on it right now, but if you go to the release it’s mentioned right in there.
Paul Patterson, Glenrock Associates: Sorry, I missed it, thanks.
Operator: Thank you our next question is coming from Daniele Seitz of Dahlman Rose, please go ahead.
Daniele Seitz, Dahlman Rose: Thank you. Most of my questions have been answered, but I was wondering of the potential addition of the RPM type rates, would that have a positive impact on your system or it doesn’t because most of the power rates are already spoken for?
John Young, EVP and CFO: I don’t know if Ian is on the phone or not, but as RPM enters the market and impacts the market place, it will have a positive impact; as our existing hedges roll off and get re-priced with new hedges that price will effectively lift the market price slightly for us.
Daniele Seitz, Dahlman Rose: And not huge?
John Young, EVP and CFO: Just depending on where the price is, it could be significant?
John Rowe, Chairman and CEO: Daniele, let me try to pick up, and again I don’t know if Ian is on because he is our real expert, but both Mike and John can help with this. I think over time we see the RPM having an increasingly significant effect because it’s a symbol of capacity having more value in the market. We all know that if you go back three or four years ago, in most of PJM there was so much excess capacity that capacity had little value, and I think RPM symbolizes an increasing valuation on capacity and that should benefit us.
Daniele Seitz, Dahlman Rose: You don’t anticipate much of an impact in ’07 though, it will come over time?
John Young, EVP and CFO: No, not in ’07.
Daniele Seitz, Dahlman Rose: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Thank you. I’ll now turn the floor back to management.
John Rowe, Chairman and CEO: I think we have finished and I appreciate everybody’s questions. Joyce has introduced this new real-time feedback mechanism for us. We get to watch what’s happening to our share price while we talk and this apparently hasn’t been our happiest day, but do take a careful look at those fundamentals and the operating results were very solid in this quarter. We’re in fact doing pretty well on our Illinois front and we’re holding the walls very nicely on the value of your Generation’s fleet. We’ve tried to point you very directly to all the risks where we. We won’t flinch from them, we’ll face them, and that’s worked so far, and I believe we’ll continue to make it work for you. Thanks a whole lot.
Joyce Carson, IR: Thank you all for joining us.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today’s Exelon Corporation Third Quarter 2006 Earnings Release Conference Call. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.

Operator:  At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Exelon Corporation second quarter 2006 earnings and merger update conference call. (Operator Instructions) It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Joyce Carson, VP of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin your conference.
 Joyce Carson: Thank you, Nelson. Good morning and welcome to the Exelon second quarter earnings review and update conference call. Thank you all for joining us today. You should have received a copy of our earnings release. If you haven't received it, the release is available on the Exelon website at www.exeloncorp.com. Or you can call Mary Snider at 312-394-5222 and she will fax or e-mail the release to you.  This call is being recorded and will be available through August 14 by dialing 877-519-4471. The international call-in number is 973-341-3080. The confirmation code is 7592439. In addition, the call will be archived on the Exelon website. Before we begin today's discussion, let me remind you that the earnings release and other matters we may discuss in today's call may contain forward-looking financial statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for discussions of the factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts and expectations. In our press release and during this call we will discuss adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings that excludes the earnings impact of several items. For a list of these items, please refer to our earnings release. We believe these adjusted operating earnings are representative of the underlying operational results of the Company. In today's earnings release, we provide a reconciliation between reported GAAP earnings and adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings. With me today are John Rowe, Chairman, President and CEO; John Young, Executive Vice President, Finance and Markets and CFO; and other members of Exelon's senior management team who are available to answer your questions.  Today's call will focus on second quarter 2006 results, full year expectations and updates on key issues facing the Company, including the ICC's rate order on ComEd's distribution, rate case and the status of the merger with Public Service Enterprise Group. We have scheduled an hour for this call. I will now turn the call over to John Young, who will begin with a discussion of Exelon's financial results.
John Young:  Thank you, Joyce. Good morning. I plan to briefly discuss Exelon's second quarter financial results, our expectations for the balance of the year and review the main points contained in the Illinois Commerce Commission's rate order. Then I'll turn the call over to John Rowe who will describe more about our views on this order and provide an operational and merger update. Exelon Corporation announced second quarter adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings of $577 million, or $0.85 per diluted share, an increase of 13% on an EPS basis from the second quarter 2005 operating earnings of $506 million, or $0.75 per diluted share.  On a GAAP basis, Exelon reported net income of $644 million or $0.95 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2006. This reported GAAP number includes the following after-tax items: income of $0.13 per diluted share resulting from decreases in estimated nuclear decommissioning obligations related to the AmerGen nuclear plants; a net charge of $0.08 per diluted share for an impairment related to the write-off of the intangible asset associated with our investments in synthetic fuel producing facilities net of the earnings from the investments; mark-to-market gains of $0.06 per diluted share from non-trading activities; a net charge of $0.01 per diluted share related to certain integration costs assisted with the proposed merger with PSEG and Exelon Generation's prior investment in Sithe Energies which is reflected as discontinued operations. These items are excluded from our operating earnings of $0.85 per diluted share as represented in the tables that accompany the earnings release. I will now review the major drivers of our 13% year-over-year growth in operating earnings per share for the second quarter. For your reference these drivers and additional details can be found on page 9 of the tables accompanying the earnings release. The major positive drivers include: higher realized wholesale margins at generation due to higher realized prices and strong operational performance across our nuclear fleet; increased weather normalized deliveries at ComEd and favorable changes in customer usage and mix; and, increased revenues at PECO associated with previously authorized rate increases.  These positive factors were partially offset by: higher operating costs primarily related to the increased stock-based compensation and general inflation; increased depreciation and amortization expense including the scheduled increase in CTC amortization at PECO; and, lower sales volumes at our delivery companies due to unfavorable weather which represented $0.03 at ComEd and $0.01 at PECO. Turning now to the individual operating companies' performance. Generation's year-over-year second quarter earnings increased by 20% due to the repricing of forward hedges in prior periods at higher prices, combined with higher spot market prices and increased nuclear generation.  Average realized wholesale margins on all sales at Generation during the second quarter of 2006 were up 15% over the same period for 2005. This increase in earnings was partially offset by the contractual decreases in prices associated with Generation's power sales agreement with ComEd and higher operating and maintenance costs, including costs associated with the recognition of stock compensation expenses and the effects of inflation on non-operating costs. The change in the power sales agreement with ComEd had no impact on Exelon's consolidated results. Let's spend a moment on ComEd. The increase in its earnings in the second quarter compared with the second quarter of 2005 was primarily due to the change in the power sales agreement, increased weather normalized deliveries and favorable changes in customer mix and usage. Weather normalized kilowatt hour growth at ComEd was 1.8%.  This demonstrates continued growth in ComEd's service territory. The increase was partially offset by unfavorable weather, increased operating costs primarily due to the recognition of stock compensation expense and other miscellaneous items. According to our models, weather had a negative impact on the earnings at ComEd of $0.03 per Exelon share in the second quarter compared with the prior year and about $0.01 relative to weather. At PECO earnings for the second quarter compared to the same period in 2005 decreased primarily due to higher CTC amortization, unfavorable weather and increased bad debt expense which were partially offset by increased revenue from a previously authorized rate increase. The increase in CTC amortization was fully anticipated and included in our guidance.  According to our models, weather had about $0.01 per share negative impact in the second quarter compared with the prior year and relative to normal weather. In our earnings release we have provided much more detail regarding our second quarter results and will be happy to respond to your questions later in the call. Let's turn for a minute to our full year expectations. As mentioned in the press release, we are reaffirming our initial standalone 2006 operating earnings guidance of $3.00 to $3.30 per share. Our operating earnings guidance is based on the assumption of normal weather for the remainder of the year. The fundamental story remains the same; improving generation margins, continued strong operational performance and core growth in our delivery companies, partially offset by milder weather and higher O&M costs are expected to be the key drivers of year-over-year earnings growth for both the balance of the year and the full year. This is both consistent with what we told you to expect back in January and also consistent with our experience for the first six months of the year. Due to the need to further analyze the impacts of the ICC rate order on ComEd's goodwill, Exelon is not updating its 2006 GAAP guidance of $3.00 to $3.30 per share. As we reported in our 2005 10-K, Exelon and ComEd impaired their $4.7 billion goodwill asset in the fourth quarter of last year by recording a $1.2 billion after-tax charge to earnings.  As we have disclosed before, under GAAP, goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently, if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill might be impaired. We currently perform our annual test in the fourth quarter of each year. However, due to the significant negative impact of the ICC's rate order to cash flows and value of ComEd, we are required to complete an interim impairment test during the third quarter of this year. The size of any potential impairment will not be known until we complete our test in the third quarter but the impairment could be material.  As we did in 2005, we will exclude any potential charge from operating earnings but since we have not completed our test, we cannot provide an update to our GAAP guidance at this time. Before I talk about the ICC rate order, I want to highlight Exelon's changing financial profile. As we have stated many times over the last couple of years, the composition of Exelon's earnings is shifting. Our business is moving from one that derived the majority of its earnings from our delivery companies to one that will see the majority of its earnings in the future come from our Generation company.  In 2005, Generation represented about 50% of our operating earnings while ComEd and PECO each accounted for about 25%. We expect a similar split in 2006 with Generation accounting for about 55% of Exelon's operating earnings and ComEd and PECO contributing around 25% and 20% respectively. With the end of the below market PPA between Generation and ComEd in 2007, we expect to see Generation contributing roughly 70% of Exelon's operating earnings with ComEd and PECO contributing the balance. As Exelon shifts to a more commodity-based business we naturally expect to see increased variability in our earnings.  By way of example we have included as part of our earnings release this morning a graph showing around-the-clock historical forward prices for calendar year 2007. We actually sent out a revised schedule because we had the labeling reversed on this chart, so please refer to the revised chart if you got it. If not, the prices that are represented by the original chart that say NIHUB on top, they are actually, that's the PJM West prices, so just reverse them. In both Northern Illinois and PJM West, prices increased by $10 to $12 from mid-February through mid-April, then decreased by the same amount from mid-April through the beginning of July and have recently started to trend upward again. Given the end of the transition period in Illinois and the related below market PPA between Generation and ComEd, such movements in forward price of wholesale power have a significant impact on the Company's earnings and cash flow projections for 2007 and beyond. Through Power Team, we will focus on getting the most out of the market by managing the risk associated with this type of business while also capturing any upside or optionality. As we have done in the past, we will continue to mitigate volatility through active hedging using various tools and methods. Before I turn the call over to John Rowe, I will summarize the major points of the Illinois Commerce Commission's order in ComEd's first general rate case since 1995. The materials accompanying the earnings release package include a fairly detailed summary that compares ComEd's original request to the ALJ's proposed order filed on June 8 and the ICC's rate order dated July 26th. ComEd originally sought to recover $1.9 billion in delivery rates, reflecting a revenue increase of $317 million. The rate order approves a revenue requirement of $1.6 billion or a delivery rate increase of only $8 million. The reductions to ComEd's original request fall into four major categories:  These reductions, plus $5 million of miscellaneous adjustments from the ICC and $38 million of adjustments made by ComEd over the course of the proceedings to limit the issues in the case, bring the total revenue increase to $8 million. The rate order does allow ComEd to recover previously incurred severance costs, losses on extinguishments of long-term debt, manufactured gas plant costs and costs associated with the procurement case. ComEd expects that it will record regulatory assets and reverse the previously incurred expenses for these items in the third quarter of this year. As mentioned earlier, ComEd may incur impairment charges associated with its goodwill in the third quarter due to the impacts of the rate order. The size of any potential impairment will not be known until ComEd completes its test in the third quarter, but the impairment could be material and could exceed the regulatory assets expected to be recorded in the third quarter based on the ICC order. Importantly, the ICC's order confirms that ComEd will be allowed to recover its energy cost which will be incurred through the upcoming competitive power procurement auction in Illinois to be held in September. With that brief summary, I will turn the call over to John Rowe who will describe more about our views on the ICC rate order and provide an operational and merger update.
John Rowe:  Thank you, John. Good morning everyone. I am of course extremely pleased with our second quarter financial results. As John reported, our operating earnings for the quarter increased 13% compared to last year and year-to-date operating earnings are up almost 5%. The second quarter has put us back on track for the year. As you know, we reported a relatively weak first quarter. As we become more and more dependent on wholesale markets, our earnings are more volatile. This financial performance is driven by our operating performance, both in generation and on the delivery side. Our nuclear fleet achieved a capacity factor of 95.5% for the second quarter of 2006, with a 99.1% capacity factor in June, the highest monthly seasonal level ever achieved for the fleet. There was not a single unplanned automatic scram in the second quarter, although I believe there was one on the first or second day of the third quarter. Our fossil and hydro fleet also had another strong quarter, with commercial availability factors of 93.7% and 95% respectively. Congratulations to Chris Crane, Mark Schiavoni and their excellent teams for giving Ian McLean and the power team the energy to work with. Our delivery companies have also done well, despite an array of record-breaking heat and storms. Two weeks ago, both ComEd and PECO set historic peaks; ComEd at 23,300 megawatts and PECO in excess of 8,600 megawatts; yet both systems performed well. We are getting a service return on the investments we've been making. PECO then experienced one of the five most damaging storms in the Company's history. PECO crews worked around the clock in 16-hour shifts to restore power to affected customers. These extraordinary efforts followed weeks of long hours responding to smaller storms. Both our PECO and our ComEd crews have done very well in this stormy summer and I thank them for their efforts.  While I thank both, it has been particularly difficult around Philadelphia. I need to give a little extra attention there. I also want to thank the crews from the other utilities from across the country that came to assist in PECO. Our operating performance, when coupled with current wholesale prices, gives us renewed confidence in our operating earnings guidance that is, as you know, between $3.00 dollars and $3.30 per share for the year. When the third quarter is in, we will try to sharpen that guidance.  I asked our controller, Matt Hilzinger, if he had any ideas on July and I was told he won't share them until after the call. Not a trusting person, Hilzinger. As many of you know, ComEd filed its first general rate case in nine years in August of 2005 to recover increased expenses and roughly $3 billion in transmission and delivery investments to upgrade the system and to keep up with the growing demand for electricity. As I said earlier that investment has resulted in a steady improvement in ComEd's delivery reliability. Thanks to Jack Skolds, John Costello, a whole of others, from 1998 to 2005 the number of outages declined by 46%, while the length of outages dropped 62%. After an exhaustive hearing two ALJs issued an initial order that would have allowed ComEd a revenue increase of approximately $164.5 million on the $317 million originally requested. While a little short in dollars, we believe that the ALJ's proposal set a principled and sound basis for future decisions.  Last week, however, we were simply shocked -- and there is no other way to put it -- by an ICC order that drastically reduced the initial order to approximately $8 million. Frankly it is difficult to conceive that the commission would all but disallow a delivery rate increase after a nine-year rate freeze and over $3 billion of new investment. We will of course ask the ICC to reconsider its order and appeal. Our real challenge, however, is to convince the commission on rehearing -- and even more importantly, in future cases -- that ComEd must stand on its on bottom, both in order to continue its service improvements and to meet its other public service commitments. ComEd is committed to purchase renewable energy and promote energy efficiency. It is committed to a rate phase-in plan to protect its retail customers against excessively abrupt price increases. ComEd's ability to do these things depends on its continuing financial strength. While last week's decision was a serious blow, we all recognize that the Illinois Commission has shown its commitment to make the system work in its previous decisions, including the power procurement decision in January. This order does provide for recovery with respect to ComEd's investments in its system, and does provide and confirm that ComEd will be allowed to recover the energy costs it incurs through the upcoming competitive auction.  My colleagues at ComEd and I remain committed to working with the ICC to achieve long-term positive results in Illinois. Turning to the merger front, our agreement with the DOJ was a major milestone in our efforts to close the merger with PSEG. It requires that we divest approximately 5,600 megawatts of fossil plant after the merger closes, the largest required in any energy company merger. The DOJ's antitrust expertise and comprehensive nature of their review should provide substantial assurance to the people of New Jersey that the merger will not adversely affect competition. We are of course pleased that the DOJ did not require any further divestiture of our nuclear fleet. The 20,000 megawatts of nuclear generation remains the platform of the combined company. Last week we met with various parties involved in the case in New Jersey and presented a comprehensive offer of settlement in connection with the proposed merger. PSE&G has proposed a package including an electric rate freeze, settling a pending gas rate case for a modest increase and a subsequent rate stay out. They have also offered $600 million to be made available through December 31, 2008 for targeted customer and state benefits as determined by the NJBPU and settling parties. This money can be used for rate reductions, economic development, conservation, environment and efficiency projects, assistance for low income customers or infrastructure development. Finally, PSE&G has also proposed to maintain its existing capital program and to increase its charitable contributions to 20% above 2005 levels. We have already demonstrated the benefits to New Jersey as well as to our shareholders of extending our nuclear know-how. 2005 net generation at Salem and Hope Creek increased by about 4 million megawatt hours when compared to 2004. Net generation this year has increased and additional 1.6 million megawatt hours. Combined with the concessions I have just outlined, there can be little doubt -- in my opinion, no doubt -- that our proposed merger offers a very great value to New Jersey customers. I am painfully aware that this offer is more than we expected to make and more than you expected us to make. Simply put, the analyses we have performed and the work done by our bankers continues to show that this merger can create positive value for our shareholders, both in the short and in the long run. We also believe, based on those analyses, that we can continue to make the merger accretive in the early years although the first one may be a close call. The time has come, however, to resolve the merger through negotiation one way or the other. The Board of Directors of Exelon has taken the position, with my full concurrence, that we must reach a preliminary agreement with the principal government parties in the next week or so if we are to continue this effort. That is why we have made a big offer and said it is as far as we can go.  Once the final terms and conditions of the merger have been determined both the Exelon Board and the PSEG Board will review the complete packages. Speaking for Exelon, our Board will review the final terms, management's valuation analysis, management's accretion and dilution analysis. It will also receive the advice of JP Morgan Chase and Lehman Brothers, who were the bankers on the transaction. And, they will receive an independent review of Lazard in making this determination. Some of our investors suggested that the Board should have advice from a banker not receiving a fee on the deal, and we have done that. This has been a long transaction. It has been a painful negotiation in New Jersey and at the Justice Department. It has been a hard transaction to accomplish. I continue to believe that we will be able to complete the transaction and to make value out of it; but the final decisions made by our Board will be hard-boiled and value-driven as they have been all along. We are happy to take your questions now.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Daniele Seitz - Dahlman Rose.
 Daniele Seitz - Dahlman Rose: You seemed to intimate in your last news release that you may withdraw the 8%, 7% and 6% phase-in proposal. Did I not understand it correctly?
John Rowe:  We are committed to doing a phase-in proposal. We are negotiating with the staff of the commission about what that might look like. We are of course concerned about the ability of ComEd to finance a phase-in proposal, but we're not running away from our commitment. Frank, what would you like to add to that?
 Frank Clark:  This is Frank Clark. I'm the CEO of ComEd. That is exactly our position. Our senior members of the ComEd team have had meetings and will continue to have discussions with the Illinois Commerce Commission staff on going forward with a phase-in program. The numbers may be 8%, 7%, 6% or they may be different. It depends very much on our ability to finance such a phase-in.
 Daniele Seitz - Dahlman Rose:  Okay. Would it come out during the hearings that you may change it?
John Rowe:  Daniel, excuse me, this is what we're trying to say is it may come out in one of several ways. First Frank and his colleagues will be filing a motion for reconsideration and rehearing which will try to relate our request to what it takes to meet the commitments we put on record.  Second, Anne Pramaggiore and her colleagues are trying to negotiate with the commission staff. So this is one of those things where there will be a result when there is a result and we can't tell you when. 
 Daniele Seitz - Dahlman Rose:  I understand. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Hugh Wynne - Sanford Bernstein.
Hugh Wynne - Sanford Bernstein: Good morning. I just wanted to put to you a question regarding page 21 of the release where you provide a calculation of the average margin on your power sales. I noticed that the revenue per megawatt hour on the market and retail sales increased by almost $10 per megawatt hour this year. Yet below that, you provide around-the-clock market prices for PECO and ComEd where the increase is much less, maybe $2 to $5.  I take it that the wholesale sales have benefited from the roll-off of contracts that were causing you to earn somewhat below market revenues. Is that the way I should interpret that?
John Young:  If I understand your questions that is somewhat correct. We've had sales that were repricing outside of our obligations to both ComEd and PECO and then we have the PPA prices that are changing between Generation and ComEd. All of that is contributing to the margin increase at the Generation wholesale level.
Hugh Wynne - Sanford Bernstein:  I noticed that the ComEd revenues per megawatt hour declined by about $2. What was the reason for that?
John Rowe:  It was the nature of the contract which had a different price in it when it was done for '05 and '06, I think, John, wasn't it?
John Young:  It was up. I've got it up, Hugh. Are you reading your schedule right?
Ian McLean:  John, I think what it is I think John was correct. You will find that the transfer price in ComEd went from $38.47 down to $35.80. So when you throw it into the average, that what skews the average.
Hugh Wynne - Sanford Bernstein:  Okay, so the prices that you were selling to ComEd declined -- and I'm still a little bit unclear; maybe you can help me with why the market prices went up so much?
Ian McLean: Yes, I'm not showing the market price up. I don't know what you are referring to. I'm showing actual prices up 2% and market prices year-on-year about flat. So I don't know what you are looking at. You must be looking at something that I don't have in front of me.
Hugh Wynne - Sanford Bernstein:  It is page 21 of the release. Exelon Generation Power Marketing Statistics, under Average Margin, Market and Retail Sales show a very substantial increase in revenues per megawatt hour. That is what I'm trying to understand.
Michael Metzner:  Hugh, if I may, it's Michael Metzner. They did increase. Our average realized revenue on market sales were up in the first six months versus prior year; also the quarter versus prior year. As John mentioned in his prepared remarks, because of repricing forward hedges during prior periods, repricing forward hedges at higher prices and also higher spot prices. So that's just the roll-off of below market sales.
Hugh Wynne - Sanford Bernstein:  Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman - Merrill Lynch.
 Steve Fleishman - Merrill Lynch: Hi, John. A couple of questions. First on the ComEd order, I'm wondering if you've had any commentary from the rating agencies on the potential impact of this? Associated, if ComEd rating were to go below investment grade, what impact does that have for either the auction itself or trying to do a phase-in plan?
John Rowe:  Let me start and have John Young complete my response. We are very concerned and very watchful. We were downgraded by Moody's and it's my understanding that we are looking at a downgrade from Fitch. That will keep us above investment by just a notch. To the extent that we hold there, I expect that the auction will go forward and the participants in the auction will participate.  I think that it could have some increase on the price that they would be willing to bid, principally because there's a greater risk. I think the commission is also aware of this and obviously this is an issue as we make our case in the rehearing process for adequate dollars to continue to fund our investments in the ComEd system, the need to get reasonable rate relief will alleviate some of this pressure.
 Steve Fleishman - Merrill Lynch:  But the Moody's action occurred before this order came out. Has any of them commented to you subsequent to this order?
John Young:  Moody's has not. We have talked to all three of the agencies, Steve, and they said thank you, we will get back to you. Fitch this morning has contacted us about a potential action today as a result of the order and that's the comment that Frank was referring to that they may lower the rating, but it would be the rating I believe equal to where we are with S&P today; which would be one notch above where Moody's has us, which is two notches above investment grade.
John Rowe:  Steve, let me just add one thing. Obviously we are all concerned that ComEd keep its investment grade credit rating. That is one of the issues that Frank and his team will be addressing in their request for rehearing. But let me say that when you get a real disappointment with a regulatory agency, there is a natural temptation to say we will suspend our rate phase-in plans, we will cut our capital program, we won't do any environmental good work. Usually those natural temptations are just the worst thing you can do. What we intend to try to do with the Illinois Commission is to say, we want to keep our commitments, make it possible for ComEd to do so.
 Steve Fleishman - Merrill Lynch:  Okay. I guess on the merger, could you just comment: were the New Jersey parties willing to at least try to negotiate within that timeframe that you've given as a deadline?
John Rowe:  They appear to be, but I'm not authorized to speak for any one of them. But we've had several number now of very sober dialogues and monologues in which we have told people that we have to be wanted here, to be here. We know we can't badger our way in. We know we can't bluff our way in.  On the other hand, we have now been at this proceeding somewhere between 19 and 20 months. It's not the fault of the State of New Jersey that the Justice Department took as long as it did. But there are so many parties involved in the New Jersey discussions that I personally -- and more importantly my Board -- had the sense that this discussion was reaching the point where the fruit starts to rot on the tree. What the Board instructed us to do was to stretch on the money and try to say, look we won't quibble, but we've got to get it done in a relevant timeframe. Now I've got at least two people here cautioning me that I've probably gone as far as I should go already. But we think you, as our investors, are entitled to know the frameworks in which we are dealing. I'm more jolly than I was a week ago when I carried the message to New Jersey. So if you want to measure this on a “Is Rowe jolly?” basis, that will give you about as much indication as I can give you. I mean I've been up and down so many times over these negotiations. I suspect some sort of thermometer -- I hope an oral one -- would give you a lot of different readings over the next week.  But I think the principal parties in New Jersey realize that we are really stretching to make this work and that the natural processes have stretched us on time. So I'm very hopeful that this is going to be a very animated week.
 Steve Fleishman - Merrill Lynch:  Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vic Khaitan – Deutsche Bank.
Vic Khaitan - Deutsche Bank: Good morning to everybody. Just a two-part question, one regarding ComEd. You were preparing to do some more financial refinancing of ComEd so that that rating, if it were to be lower, will not impact the Exelon. So could you remind us where you are on the rate financing of ComEd's financial structure?
John Young: Yes, we are effectively complete with all the actions. The last stage of that would be the non-consolidation opinion and taking that to the rating agencies. That final step is underway as we speak right now.
Vic Khaitan - Deutsche Bank:  But does that mean that you are willing to do that, or do you want to just keep --?
John Young:  No, we are doing it. We are getting the non-consolidation opinion, and then our plans would be as soon as we review that to take that to the three rating agencies.
Vic Khaitan - Deutsche Bank: For John Rowe, you talked about where you stand with the merger and I understand the sensitivity of the discussions. But you are already offering what I consider to be a very generous offer to do this deal. But does this have some implication that the other jurisdiction like Pennsylvania, Illinois, might also come for the second bite in some way for the concession from you?
John Rowe:  Well, obviously, we worry about that sort of thing. I think the Illinois Commission took at least five bites last week. So I think they have taken their piece, as we speak. We've had a very stable situation in Pennsylvania. There is more than one issue going on there. We have a real deal that has been confirmed by the commission. I'm optimistic that we will keep things stable there. We just have to try to keep each company standing on its own, Vic, and we are doing our best. Betsy wants to add something.
Betsy Moler: If you look at what we offered in Pennsylvania in both 2000 plus this latest transaction, and then gross that up for this relative size of PSE&G as compared to PECO, you're really putting them on a par with one another, which is what the ask has been in New Jersey.
Vic Khaitan - Deutsche Bank:  So does New Jersey then get the message that this is really very beneficial to the customers, because they appear to be saying that there is no benefit to customers?
Betsy Moler:  We've certainly been singing that song. I think we will see in the next little while whether the parties are willing to do it at this price.
John Rowe:  Vic, I think the real message we are trying to give you is we tried the usual process of tit-and-tat negotiations, and it wasn't getting this thing done. So we tried to take the principles that New Jersey parties, especially the government parties, were saying. We tried to apply those principles; we tried to meet their demands. We not only think this offer is generous, we think it is at the outer edge of what we can do and defend with all of you. We have made that point and we will be making it all week.
John Young:  Thanks, Vic. Can we go on to the next question now, operator?
Operator:  Yes, thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates:  Good morning. Is divestiture no longer an issue with the BPU in these discussions anymore? I mean we noticed that they put in another filing at PJM for another market monitor analysis, and I was just wondering, is that now off the table?
John Rowe:  Nothing is ever off the table till everything is off the table; that is the nature of negotiations. We believe that PJM will be satisfied with what FERC and justice have required, plus perhaps some operational things in terms of bidding behavior and so forth.  It's very frustrating to us that FERC had a clear set of rules, we complied with them. Justice clearly didn't have a set of rules to consider this, but it wanted more. PJM now seems to be playing with all the Justice Department screens, but coming up with its own set of conclusions. We think they will settle for some operating behavior things along with what we've done. At some point, enough has to be enough.
Operator: Our next question comes from Paul Fremont - Jefferies.
Paul Fremont - Jefferies & Co.:  Hi. I just wanted to clarify when you talked about the $600 million in concessions, were you saying that foregoing the gas rate increase was in addition to that, or is that part of the $600 million package that you are talking about?
John Rowe:  We are proposing settling the gas rate case for part of the amount requested and the difference was, I think, Betsy, not explicitly part of the $600 million. The $600 million is straight cash concession separate from the size of the rate stay outs.
Paul Fremont - Jefferies & Co.:  One other quick question is on Commonwealth Edison. Can you give us a sense as to whether or not you have the ability to offset any of the absence of rate increase with cost cutting measures? Would you be substantially under earning the authorized return that the commission is giving you in the rate case?
John Rowe:  Let me start and then I will turn it over to Frank. Our current guesstimates is that with this kind of rate order, ComEd would be under earnings it's authorized 10.04% by about 7%. Or in other words, ComEd's earnings would be down around 3%. More than that, nearly all of those 3% would be in the FERC regulated transmission components. So yes, ComEd would be drastically under earning and that is part of the case it proposes to make. I will let Frank talk to you about cost-saving efforts and so forth. But bear in mind that hardly anybody has done better than Exelon in the last five years in cutting costs.
 Frank Clark:  Well, I think the straight answer to your question is that we are very aggressively looking at the ways to offset our O&M and capital spend, reflecting what we received in the order. We are also equally aggressively preparing our case for rehearing. The rehearing process we have, I believe 30 days from the date of the order to actually make a petition for rehearing, which we will obviously do. I believe the commission then has an additional 20 days to either grant or deny our request.  So in a relatively short timeframe all of this year, we will know whether we have been able to reverse some of the damage that we see in the order from the ICC. In the meantime obviously, we are very actively looking at ways to reduce our costs. But consistent with what John Rowe said earlier, it does not mean that we are talking about doing things that put in jeopardy the reliability of our service. That would be a foolish thing to do. We are not abandoning commitments we made to phase-ins or to our environmental or any efficiency programs which is a very big thing in the State of Illinois. However, we must show and convince the commission in order to meet those commitments, we have to be adequately financed.
Operator: Our next question comes from Asher Khan - SAC Capital.
Ashar Khan - SAC Capital: Good morning. John, could you to specify a little bit about future cash flow? How you would apply them going forward, next year onwards in terms of stock buyback? When can we get a signal as to the use of that cash flow from the Board and you?
John Rowe:  Well, I'm laughing just a little because if I knew the answer to that you'd probably already have it. I mean, we're trying to balance the desire that some of you have for a share buyback with the desire that others of you have for increased dividends, with the fact that our earnings are volatile and we can reduce the tax impact of the divestitures if we can make some well-placed Generation investments. That is a lot of moving parts to keep track of at once.  John Young just handed me a note saying that he thinks in mid-December we should be able to give you a real plan, although if these offers we've made aren't adequate to secure an agreement on the merger, we may have to give you such plan a bit earlier.
 Joyce Carson:  We have time for one more question.
Operator: Our final question comes from David Frank - Piqua Capital Management.
David Frank - Piqua Capital Management:  Thank you. I was just wondering if you were to take a write-off at ComEd would you anticipate that that would flow through on an equal dollar basis to the consolidated company's balance sheet as well?
John Rowe:  My controller, who would tell me he doesn't have any idea what the write-off will be is nodding his head vociferously that it will be an equal dollar write-off on the Exelon goodwill.  The situation is that when we stop treating delivery as a group and started treating PECO and ComEd as separate items for purposes of the accounting statement, a goodwill write-off at ComEd is essentially one-for-one at Exelon.
David Frank - Piqua Capital Management:  I was going to make a quick note that in the future it would be really helpful if instead of margin per megawatt hour if you could find to provide some information on actual prices realized by region on wholesale and retail, because it kind of it gives us no real accurate base to work off of when you mix everything up and we just look at average margin.
John Rowe:  Well, do take a look at that chart that John Young attached to his comments. I hope that gives you some clarity of signal in terms of what we are seeing in the market. Ian McLean will take your comment to heart. The issue is always how do we try to give you maximum transparency without impairing Ian's ability to do the best thing in the marketplace. Ian is inherently a secretive man.
David Frank - Piqua Capital Management: Thank you.
John Rowe: Thank you, everybody.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's Exelon Corporation second quarter 2006 earnings and merger update conference call. You can now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.

Operator Instructions:
Joyce Carson, Vice President, Investor Relations: Thank you, Ian. Good morning and welcome to the Exelon First Quarter Earnings Review and Update Conference Call. Thank you for joining us this morning. You should have received a copy of our earnings release. If you haven't received it, the release is available on the Exelon website at www.exeloncorp.com or you can call Mary Snyder at 312-394-5222 and she will fax or e-mail the release to you. This call is being recorded and will be available through May 10th by dialing 877-519-4471. The international call-in number is 973-341-3080. The confirmation code is 722-7985. In addition, the call will be archived on our website. Before we begin today's discussion, let me remind you that the earnings release and other matters we may discuss in today's call will contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for discussions of factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts and expectations. In our press release and during this call, we will discuss adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings that exclude mark-to-market adjustments from hedging activities, the expected contribution from our synthetic fuel facilities, significant impairments of intangible assets, certain severance costs, certain merger-related costs, potential and new accounting pronouncements and other items we view as unusual. We believe these adjusted operating earnings are representative of the underlying operational results of the company. In today's earnings release, which is available on our website, we provide a reconciliation between reported GAAP earnings and adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings. With me today are John Rowe, Chairman, President and CEO; John Young, Executive Vice President, Vice President Financial Markets and CFO and other members of Exelon's senior management team who are available to answer your questions. Today's call will focus on first quarter 2006 results and the outlook for the balance of 2006. We scheduled an hour for this call. John Young will begin with a discussion of our financial results.
John Young, Executive Vice President, VP Financial Markets, Chief Financial Officer: Thank you, Joyce. Good morning. Exelon Corporation announced first quarter adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings of $420 million or $0.62 per diluted share compared with earnings of $452 million or $0.67 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2005. On a GAAP basis, Exelon reported net income of $400 million or $0.59 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2006. This reported GAAP number includes several after-tax items; $0.02 per share of mark-to-market losses related to hedging activities, $0.01 per share of certain integration costs related to the proposed merger with PSEG, $0.01 per share of costs associated with the tax settlement related to our previous investment in Sithe Energies and severance costs reported during the quarter and lastly, $0.01 per share of earnings from investments in synthetic fuel producing facilities. These four items are excluded from our operating earnings of $0.62 per share as represented on page 6 of the table that accompany the earnings release. As I mentioned during last quarter's earnings call, we have changed our current and historical segment presentation from the Exelon Energy Delivery to separate reporting for ComEd and PECO. The major driver of the year-over-year decrease in operating earnings per share in the first quarter were lower sales volumes at ComEd and PECO due to unfavorable weather compared with last year's first quarter. Weather cost us about $0.03 of earnings at PECO and $0.01 at ComEd despite healthy core growth at both utilities. Increased operating and maintenance expenses, including costs associated with the recognition of stock compensation expenses related to the adoption of a new accounting standard, higher operating costs and nuclear refueling expenses, higher pension and other post retirement benefits and higher bad debt expense. Increased depreciation amortization expense, including the scheduled increase in CTC amortization at PECO as expected and increased interest expense primarily due to the debt issued in March 2005 to fund Exelon's pension contribution and higher interest rates on outstanding variable rate debt. And finally, increased taxes other than income primarily due to favorable tax settlements in 2005. Partially offsetting these negative drivers were higher wholesale margins at Generation’s and increased electric revenues at PECO associated with previously authorized rate increases. As we discussed and quantified in our press release this morning, Generation's year-over-year first quarter earnings increased due to the repricing of forward hedges at higher prices than in prior periods combined with higher stock market prices and increased nuclear generation. As you can see from the tables in the earnings release, average realized wholesale margins on all sales at Power Team during the first quarter of 2006 were up 15% over the same period in 2005. This increase was partially offset by the contractual decrease in prices associated with Generation's power sales agreement with ComEd and higher operating and maintenance costs, including costs associated with the recognition of stock compensation expenses and nuclear refueling expenses. The change in the power sales agreement with ComEd had no impact on Exelon's consolidated results. I will turn now to our energy delivery business at both ComEd and PECO. ComEd -- the decrease in ComEd earnings in the first quarter compared with the first quarter of 2005 was primarily due to unfavorable weather and an increase in the reserve for potential SECA refunds. Additionally, operations and maintenance expenses primarily due to the recognition of stock compensation expense and other miscellaneous expense items increased from the prior quarter. These increases were offset as anticipated by the change in the power sales agreement I mentioned earlier. Total unadjusted kilowatt hour deliveries decreased about 0.5% in the first quarter compared with the prior year, which is the net effect of higher deliveries from growth offset by unfavorable weather. As many of you know, January weather in ComEd service territory was the warmest in more than 30 years. Heating degree-days in the first quarter were 11% below the prior year and 16% below our estimated normal level. According to our models, weather had about $0.01 per share negative impact on the earnings of ComEd in the first quarter compared to prior year and relative to normal weather. At PECO, earnings decreased primarily due to unfavorable weather and higher CTC amortization, which were partially offset by increased revenue from a previously authorized rating base. An increase in CTC amortization was fully anticipated and included in our guidance. Total unadjusted kilowatt hour deliveries decreased about 2% in the first quarter compared with the prior year, which is the net effect of higher deliveries from growth offset by unfavorable weather. Heating degree-days in the first quarter were 17% below the prior year and 15% below our estimated normal level at PECO. According to our models, weather had about $0.03 per share negative impact in the first quarter compared with the prior year and relative to normal weather. In our earnings release, we have provided much more detail regarding our first quarter results and we will be happy to respond to your questions later in the call. Now, let's spend a minute on the balance of the year expectations. The major drivers of our projected year-over-year growth in operating earnings for the balance of 2006 are essentially the same as what we told you in the January EPS waterfall chart that was included with our fourth quarter earnings release. We expect improving Generation margins, continued strong operational performance and core growth in our delivery businesses to continue to drive earnings growth. As far as our 2006 outlook, we are reaffirming our initial standalone 2006 operating earnings guidance of $3.0 to $3.30 per share. I will remind you that our full-year operating earnings guidance excludes mark-to-market adjustments from hedging activities, the expected earnings contribution from our synthetic fuel facilities, significant impairments of intangible assets, certain severance costs, certain merger-related costs, potential new accounting pronouncements and other items we view as unusual. We estimate GAAP earnings will fall in the range of $3.0 and $3.30 per share as well. This is down a nickel per share from the previous estimate of $3.05 to $3.35 per share due to the expected partial phase-out of tax credits related to synthetic fuel producing facilities. As we noted in the earnings release, continued high oil prices could result in a further reduction in GAAP earnings related to synthetic fuel producing facilities due to an additional phase-out of tax credits and potential significant asset impairment related to the credits. These earnings estimates do not include any impact of any future changes to GAAP. Both our operating earnings and GAAP earnings guidance are based on the assumption of normal weather. We believe that the ongoing strength in our core operation and our low-cost generation position us well to deliver on this guidance. As we mentioned in January, we are in the process of updating our projections for the merged company, but only to the extent we are legally permitted to do so as the Department of Justice is still reviewing our application. However, soon after the merger closes, we plan to host a meeting in New York City to provide our new forecast followed by road shows in several major cities. We would also like to remind you to mark your calendars for our First Annual Exelon Electric and Gas Investor Conference, which we plan to hold here in Chicago on December 12. So, please save the date for this important event. Now, I would like to turn the call over to John Rowe.
John Rowe, Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, John. As John has described and as the numbers show from an earnings perspective, our first quarter can best be described as lackluster. We are of course disappointed in that and what I want to do next is to try to show you what is going on and why it is that we continue to have confidence that we will be able to perform within our guidance range of $3.0 to $3.30 for the entire year. And we base that estimate and projection on some very detailed work that we have done with our entire management in assessing the implications of the first quarter. First, our Nuclear performance led by Chris Crane continues to be very good indeed. The nuclear fleet achieved a capacity factor of 91% in the first quarter compared with 89.9% for the first quarter of 2005. Refueling outages were completed at Clinton, LaSalle 1 and Limerick 1 with an average of 24 days duration. LaSalle 1 set a world record for longest continued run among light water reactors at 739 days online prior to the start of its refueling outage. Limerick 1 completed its sixth consecutive under 20 day refueling outage for the site. I am told that is more than any other site in the United States. I believe and these numbers support the proposition that Chris and his team are running one of the finest nuclear operations in the United States. We have showed tangible improvement in the work that Chris's team is doing for PSEG at the Salem/Hope Creek site. That site is being managed by Exelon Generation under the nuclear operating services agreement. It had a combined generation in the first quarter of more than 7.2 million megawatt hours with a capacity factor of about 100%. In fact, I believe the number was a hair over that, which suggests that the rating probably had to be adjusted at some point. The increase in net generation compared to the first quarter of 2005 is about 1% if you remove the effect of the refueling outage at Hope Creek in the prior year. More importantly to that, I believe the stability of that site is increasing relationships with the employees are very good and I believe those sites are beginning to rebuild some real respect among the regulators. Our fossil fleet commercial availability for the quarter was strong at 92%. Hydro performed well with an availability of 98%. As you know, and as I will come back to, it simply is a fact that our low-cost, well-run Generation fleet is the single major driver of our earnings performance in the next several years. Recent events in world energy markets, indeed the newspaper every morning, have shown that gasoline and natural gas and other fossil fuels have reached record levels. These price behaviors affect the costs of electricity as well. Even in states that have retained traditional cost-based regulation, some utilities are seeking double-digit rate increases. Competitive jurisdictions and jurisdictions, which are heavily dependent on natural gas for local environmental reasons, have been particularly hard-hit and in some cases, these effects are especially large because of timing. In a number of states, including Illinois, which is especially important to us, these overall effects coincide with the end of a restructuring transition period and its accompanying rate freeze. In the long run, neither competition nor regulators can shield consumers or for that matter shareholders from the underlying reality of the world energy market. At Exelon, we are doing our best to capture advantage for our shareholders in these energy markets while trying to provide appropriate protections for our customers. As you all know, as we have long recognized, the underlying nature of the Exelon business is changing. In 2002, a time of low energy prices and various transition restructuring agreements, almost 80% of our earnings came from our regulated distribution utilities. Today, that number stands closer to 50%. By 2007, we expect that our distribution utilities will provide significantly less than 50% of our earnings. Exelon is increasingly engaged in a commodity business, one that is subject to worldwide price cycles and increased price volatility. Through Power Team, our marketing group, we have developed state-of-the-art risk management tools, including carefully structured hedging programs to meet the changing reality of wholesale energy markets. We have strengthened our balance sheet and increased our credit lines to support these programs while attempting to diversify our portfolio both geographically and in terms of generation and fuel type. Our steady earnings growth over the past five years is evidence of our success, not only at cutting costs, but in building our Generation portfolio to meet these conditions and opportunities. And again, as you know, going forward, our earnings are more largely driven by the commodity market than they are by further cost management opportunities, except those involved in the merger. It is very important in this context that our retail affiliates develop tools to manage the risk for the retail customers. How we confront the challenge of dramatic retail price increases will have ramifications for years to come. We are trying to strike balances that protect your investment in these challenging times. We have forcefully and to date successfully resisted those who would require shareholders to continue to subsidize customers at below-market prices, but we have been equally aggressive in looking for ways to mitigate the price volatility that our customers seek. For the longer term, we remain convinced that we must successfully align customer interest with shareholder interest if competition is to succeed and market evaluation is to remain accepted for the output of our power plants. That leads me directly to a discussion of Illinois. By now, you all know that in January after a great deal of effort by Frank Clark, Anne Pramaggiore and her team, the ICC in a 5 to 0 vote approved a statewide auction in which ComEd and Ameren would buy power for their Illinois customers. That decision should ensure that ComEd is financially able to purchase its power at the lowest available market price to assure reliability and affordable service in Illinois. We were very gratified by the Commission's decision, which came at the end of a protracted legal and regulatory process and came despite enormous political pressure. The decision not only helps ComEd to be able to meet its procurement commitments, it also recognizes Exelon Generation as a separate market-based supplier. In this context, ComEd's residential customers will inevitably see a price increase. After a 20% rate reduction and a nine-year rate freeze and given the recent run-up in energy prices generally, it is very likely that rates will increase above today's artificially low prices. Additionally, in August of '05, ComEd filed a distribution rate case to recover the $3 billion it has invested in infrastructure improvements during the current rate freeze. That rate case is also designed to enable ComEd to recover its increased costs for wages, healthcare, insurance, security and other key aspects of the business. We expect a final ICC decision in July. We recognize that the adoption of a competitive procurement process together with the distribution rate increase will put price pressure on retail customers. To ease the transition, ComEd proposed a safety net proposal with the ICC to phase in any procurement and delivery service rate increase. That plan would guarantee that average residential rate increases at the end of 2009 will be no higher than the rates were in 1995. Specifically, the plan limits residential rate increases to no more than 8% in '07, 7% in '08 and 6% in '09. We propose to recover the costs of the deferral with carrying charges over a three-year period beginning in 2010. The proposal was submitted in ComEd's rate case, but by agreement of the parties will be reviewed in a separate proceeding before the ICC. We think that our safety net proposal is a proper way to ensure a financially stable delivery utility to support the working of the competitive marketplace and to soften the effect of rate increases on our customers. In the future, price increases will also be mitigated by the staggered three-year purchase power contract ComEd will execute in connection with its auction in September. Let me say that our progress in meeting the Illinois situation is probably our single largest accomplishment in the first quarter. While risks will remain until others are more comfortable with a market-based environment, I am terribly proud of what our team has done over this period. I would now like to turn to the merger with PSEG. We have continued to make slow but steady progress toward closing the deal. We remain unequivocal in our intention to close the deal and in our view that we can do so in a way that will serve the best interests of our shareholders. In late January, the Pennsylvania Commission gave a unanimous approval to the merger with the Chairman noting it's a big deal at a good deal. In February, the PJM market monitor concluded that the proposed Exelon PSEG market mitigation plan could adequately address market power concentration concerns in the PJM energy markets provided that virtual divestiture is accepted. We have yet to receive approvals from either the Department of Justice or the New Jersey BPU. We of course are terribly frustrated by the extent of review that has been required. We are in ongoing discussions to obtain these approvals and we will continue to work at doing so. In New Jersey, hearings concluded at the end of March. Final brief are due by May 10. We believe the record overwhelmingly demonstrates that the merger will be beneficial to customers, but we do not expect a quick resolution. We are confident that the merits of the deal will ultimately prevail, but we expect that settlement demands will be greater than the $120 million we have proposed. We nonetheless hope and expect to complete all the regulatory reviews and close the merger by the third quarter of this year. We have substantially completed all of our merger integration work. Randy Mehrberg and Ralph Izzo of PSEG have led that effort and are prepared to quickly consolidate our businesses. We remain very excited about the ultimate opportunities that this merger holds. As I have said before, we have a platform and are building a platform that we would not trade with any other utility. The combined companies will be well-positioned to be an industry leader in Generation, Electric and Gas delivery and customer service and will be utterly devoted to making value for our shareholders. I want to comment on one more issue that we experienced in the first quarter and that is the issue of managing water with tritium in it at our nuclear plants. We have had no releases, which have posed a health or safety hazard, but we have failed to manage some of this water in accordance with the highest possible standards. There have been leaks and we simply must clean them up and we will. Chris Crane and his troops are working with our legal department and negotiating the standards for such cleanup as we speak. And we will take whatever steps are necessary to assure that there continue to be no risk to the health or safety of the communities in which we operate. On the whole, we cannot be ecstatic about this quarter, but we remain ecstatic about what we have done with Exelon since we put it together back in the year 2000. We are pleased with our history of earnings growth. We believe, we can deliver earnings within our target range this year and as you know, we are looking to substantial improvements in earnings in 2007. Exelon was recently named one of America's most admired companies by Fortune magazine. We appreciate that recognition. We continue to try to live up to it and literally to be the best electric and gas company in the country. We know that to be that we must deliver the superior performance for you in the future that we have done over the past five years and we believe we can continue to do that. I will be happy to take your questions.

Operator Instructions:
Q - Greg Gordon: Thanks. First, a couple questions for John Young and then one for John Rowe. John, you mentioned timing-related items having impacted the quarter in the release. You didn't specifically address how much of the earnings pressure was just related to shift in timing of expenses in the quarter and the O&M numbers were up quite substantially quarter-over-quarter. Was a lot of that timing or are we seeing pressure on O&M that we should be systematically thinking about rolling through the numbers?
A - John Young: No, remember the earnings guidance we gave you back in January Greg and we stayed firmly committed to that and about $0.03 of that number was timing related and the rest, the $0.04 of weather. Those were the two big impacts.
Q - Greg Gordon: Okay. So $0.03 of general cost pressures were timing related?
A - John Young: That's correct.
Q - Greg Gordon: Then on the O&M, is there any incremental O&M impact versus what you guys thought you would spend over the course of the year due to the Nuclear fleet inspection program that has been implemented after the tritium leaks?
A - John Young: Very, very, very, very small. Yes, there will be some, but right now, and Chris, you might want to comment on this, we may be talking $1 million or $2 million or some number like that.
Q - Greg Gordon: Okay. And for John Rowe --
A - John Rowe: Let me just pick up, or Chris. I don't think we can put a number on the total cleanup costs. The inspection cost, as John said, is not that high, but we have quantified what we could so far in the numbers you have seen, but I don't want you to think the cleanup will only be $1 million or $2 million. You are talking about at least $0.01 a share and maybe several pennies over time.
A - John Young: And Greg you should remember that we did reserve at the end of '05, I think the number was $7 million or $8 million to address some of what John is talking about.
Q - Greg Gordon: Yeah, it was $7 million was in the K.
A - John Young: Yeah. And so I was responding to your question about the inspection and if the inspection shows other things, obviously there will be additional cleanup costs.
Q - Greg Gordon: Okay. Thank you. That's clear. Two sort of strategic questions, one was related to the standalone '07 outlook. You guys have a financial hedging strategy that you have articulated fairly clearly. At this point in time in any given fiscal year, how much of your financial risk on the commodity side of the business would you in the normal course of business have already hedged for the following fiscal year?
A - John Rowe: I would like Ian McLean to answer that please.
A - Ian McLean: Yeah. What we do, as you probably remember is that we set ourselves a target as we go into the fiscal year. So, in other words, at December 31, '05 going into '06, we would like to be about 90% financially hedged. And we do that on a fairly consistent basis over the months leading up to that or over the year leading up to that. We really don't hold back and then suddenly hedge 40%. But we do have some leeway within which we hedge. So, if you look for '07, the difference this year, the kind of slug that is different if you like is the auction. And so, we have made some assumptions around the auction, but we are on track very consistently right now to be nicely hedged at 90% going into '07.
Q - Greg Gordon: Thanks. And the final question for John Rowe is you make a statement in the release, you said in your comments you are firmly committed to the merger. In the release, the language around that says as long as it continues to make economic sense. If anything were to change to make the deal not make economic sense versus the outlook you had when you announced it in '04, what would the key issues be that might cause it to not make economic sense?
A - John Rowe: Well, there are I think only two and they would have to be reviewed in the context of the merger agreement itself. In other words, we pledged and Peggy (phonetic) pledged to do a deal and there are only a couple of exceptions to that in the agreement and it would be better if Randy Mehrberg described them specifically rather than that I do, but at the present time, we believe that the deal can be done and those exceptions will not be triggered. One of those exceptions related to having to sell nuclear capacity. Another one is a typical material change position. The point I am trying to make is that, at the present time, we believe we can get the deal done. We believe we will get it done in a way that will add value to our shareholders. We are unequivocal about that. PSEG is unequivocal about that. But we recognize and they recognized that demands of the state of New Jersey and whatever the DoJ ultimately may require may be different than we initially proposed. Each of us will do what our fiduciary duties require and take a last look at the package when we finally know what all those conditions are. That is what we're trying to say is that we will be honorable, we will be careful, we will be prudent. But I don't want to sound like in any way I am flinching on our belief that this deal remains doable and remains a good deal for shareholders. You'll find no equivocation from me on that at all and I think you'll get none from Jim Ferland either.
Q - Greg Gordon: Okay thank you gentlemen.
Operator: Our next question comes from Leslie Rich with Columbia Management. Please go ahead.
Q - Leslie Rich: Hi, you mentioned in terms of the Synfuel that significant asset impairment might be possible. I wonder if you could walk through what the scenario would be and the magnitude? Is that a physical plant or previously taken tax credits or?
A - Matt Hilzinger: No, it's a non-cash charge. We have on our books in accounting --
A - John Rowe: This is c, our Controller.
A - Matt Hilzinger: We have on our books in accounting terms contractual rights to receive tax benefits, which is an intangible asset. We also have a contractual obligation to pay for part of those rights and the accounting requires us to assess the viability of that intangible asset and based on a full phase-out we'll have to write it off. It's about $125 million or about $0.11. In the future, we will take a look at the non recourse debt that we have that we may potentially not have to pay that and we have a gain upon the extinguishment of that debt. They may certainly occur sometime later on in the future.
A - John Young: And Leslie, just a reminder, all this will be in our non-operating earnings guidance.
A - Matt Hilzinger: And on a cash basis, it is important that understanding accounting is different than cash. On a cash basis, a full phase out besides losing the tax credits going forward, we believe it will have a de minimus impact on our cash position.
Q - Leslie Rich: Okay, thank you.
A – John Rowe: Operator, before we continue, I just want to remind people on the line to limit yourself to one question. We let Greg get away with it because we weren't on top of our game there, but a lot of people queued up, so we would like to limit each questioner to one.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Fremont with Jefferies.
A – John Rowe: Hi Paul.
Q - Paul Fremont: Good morning I am trying to understand, there was a significant increase in PPO sales at ComEd and I guess other providers have sort of experienced a lot of shopping customers sort of returning to polar. This seems to be going almost in the opposite direction. Is that -- are other retail providers in the Chicago area sort of disappearing from the scene? What is causing that significant pickup?
A - Robert McDonald: This is Bob McDonald. I don't think it is a matter of providers disappearing from the scene at all. I think there is just the dynamic cause between the market prices and what is available to some customers and bundled tariffs. We have a situation in Illinois where if the CTCs go to zero for some customers, they no longer have the option of the PPO price. And so they are in a position of needing to make decisions between bundled tariffs and the different supplier. But at the moment, I think it is just that the PPO offering price was attractive compared to market.
A - Anne Pramaggiore: This is Anne Pramaggiore. I would just add on the issue of whether we're seeing retail suppliers leave no, in fact, what we're seeing is more interest in retail suppliers. We have had a couple of certifications for retailers who are interested in serving the residential market. So if anything, we're seeing growth in that area.
Q - Paul Fremont: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Josh Levin with Lord Abbett.
Q - Josh Levin: Good morning.
A: Good morning.
Q - Josh Levin: Regarding a global settlement in Illinois regarding market-based rates, could you update us as to where you are in the settlement process? Are you currently holding settlement talks? What is your expectation for a settlement?
A - John Rowe: Anne, go ahead.
A - Anne Pramaggiore: There is a number of things that are going on the front of resolving the post '06 issues in their entirety. One John referred to, and that is the mitigation and plans that we have been talking about for quite a while and that we recently filed at the commission. We filed in our DST case. The commission staff came back and has asked us to set that up in a separate docket, which we will be doing probably in the next several weeks. And that will provide a forum for parties to come in and comment on what we have and also share their thoughts. Additionally, we continue to have conversations with parties. We have been doing that for some time and we will do that. Obviously, the thinking that has been part of these discussions will become more public as the docket opens at the commission and you get more parties having a debate around that. But the conversations are happening and we would expect the dialog to accelerate as the docket opens at the commission.
Q - Josh Levin: Is your expectation that you are going to reach a settlement with all the parties, or this ends up going through the court system and that is you how you get the final outcome here?
A - Anne Pramaggiore: I think our interest is in resolving this through a settlement. That is what we're looking to do and that is the path we're moving down.
A - John Rowe: Let me just add to that. You don't have a settlement, whether it is Anne's work in Illinois or what Betsy and Ralph is or are doing in New Jersey until you have a settlement. And projecting when people will agree is right up there with grading romance movies. But I want to add a bit of explanation to this as a process that is, why is New Jersey hard? Why is Illinois hard? Well, the answer is really very simple. Wholesale prices are going up and they are going up substantially. That is on the whole very good news for Exelon Generation. It is very good news for PSEG Power. It is very good news for the value of the two companies put together. It is very good news for the wonderful work that Chris and Bill Levis and their team have done at Salem and Hope Creek. But rising prices that need to be passed through to customers put a great deal of pressure on regulators and on regulatory consensus and regulatory deal. The reason we have had a whole lot of issues in Illinois is that prices are going up and it is difficult for regulators and politicians to handle. The reason New Jersey is so difficult is at least partly the fact that prices have gone up substantially in New Jersey. I heard some people say that is all the reason why Exelon would be better standalone. I have heard other people say that is all the reason why PSEG would be better standalone. Our view of the matter is that investors simply need to understand that these competitive structures require nurturing, they require very diligent legal and political protection and they require an understanding that consumers cannot be expected to tolerate too much in the way of rate pressures or one will find oneself trying to protect legal rights in ways that aren't any fun. We were forced to tell you all last August that if the letter from the Governor of Illinois were implemented, it would cause ComEd to go bankrupt. You don't write 8-Ks about things like that lightly. Anne and Bob McDonald, Barry Mitchell, Frank Clark, who spent the last seven months creating a much higher level of confidence that that won't happen. But it took a lot of hard work and it has taken things like the rate mitigation proposal that Anne has made. Likewise, we're seeing these pressures in New Jersey. What is going on in the wholesale power market is very good news for Exelon, for PSEG, for the merger between the two companies. I do caution you not to make your most optimistic forecast and then just assume that it all happens neatly because it requires some work and some concessions to hold all these things together.
Q - Josh Levin: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dan Jenkins with State of Wisconsin.
Q - Dan Jenkins: Good morning.
A - John Rowe: Good morning.
Q - Dan Jenkins: I have questions on the rate case process in Illinois. You mentioned in your statement that hearings in the case concluded earlier this month. I was wondering if you could update us kind of on what your position is as far as the amount of rate increase versus say the staff and the major interveners like CUB and AG.
A - John Rowe: Anne or Bob MacDonald can do that.
A - Anne Pramaggiore: I'll start. Just to give you an update on timing, we finished hearings and filed our initial brief yesterday. There will be another brief in early May and then the Administrative Law Judge will issue his opinion. June 8 is the date as it's set now. There may be some flexibility around that date, but it is roughly in that time frame. The Commission will make an ultimate decision by July 27. We have asked for about $316 million in additional revenue requirement over our previous DST case. The staff has taken a position based on looking at a number of different components that would not give us that increase and I think we see CUB and the Cook County State's Attorney office and their coalition somewhere in the middle giving us about half of the requested increase. The major issues that are under debate are capital structure. That tends to drive a large portion of it. Some of the debate is around allocation, business service company allocation and there is also a debate around ROE and the recovery of our pension assets. Those are really the primary issues. We will see how the ALJ comes out on June 6. I don't think we were surprised, or June 8 excuse me, surprised to get some strong challenges to a rate increase given the environment that we are in right now, but we also believe we took on a very strong case on the merits and we will see what the ALJ says in June, but those are the primary issues that are under debate and the primary drivers around the big dollars in the case.
Q - Dan Jenkins: What was the amount you said of staff proposed increase?
A - Anne Pramaggiore: There is no increase in there.
Q - Dan Jenkins: So there's zero?
A - Anne Pramaggiore: Correct. And then CUB and Cook County are about $150 million increase. That is the 316 that we requested.
Q - Dan Jenkins: And then do you know, is there any timetable for the mitigation, the deferral of the increases? You say that has been put in a separate case or is there a timetable for when that procedure will go forward?
A - Anne Pramaggiore: There is no timetable. The docket itself will likely be opened, we're looking at sometime between now and mid-May and then the Commission will set a schedule or the Administrative Law Judge who oversees the case will set a schedule for testimony and hearings. It will be run like any other docket. We will see testimony filed. There will be public hearings at the Commission and so at this point, it is hard to speculate at what sort of timetable will be laid out. Typically, the parties have the ability to share their opinions with the Administrative Law Judge on what kind of schedule should be set and then a consensus schedule is devised, but that hasn't happened yet.
Q - Dan Jenkins: So you could potentially have an increase, but not know how it would be mitigated or?
A - Anne Pramaggiore: I'm sorry, but we need to move onto the next question please.
Q - Dan Jenkins: Okay.
A - John Rowe: Thank you for your question.
Operator: Our next question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.
Q - Paul Patterson: Good morning guys.
A - John Rowe: Hi Paul.
Q - Paul Patterson: I was wondering if you could just tell us what is going on with DoJ. Why they're taking so long? What their concerns are? If you could just elaborate a little bit more what specifically is holding them up.
A - John Rowe: The answer is no, no and no. We cannot tell you because we are in discussions with them as we speak and there is an understanding that we won't talk about those discussions until we know the result. We continue to believe that we can get to an acceptable answer, but we don't have one worked out yet.
Q - Paul Patterson: Okay. Can I ask?
A - John Rowe: Literally by virtue of the state of Betsy Moler's negotiations with the Justice Department, they have agreed and we can say that we are trying to develop a mutually acceptable approach to address their concerns regarding the competitive effects of the transaction and beyond that, we are not supposed to say anything.
Q - Paul Patterson: Okay. Can you just tell me, you mentioned that you thought New Jersey was going to take, it will be a little bit slow. Can you give us an idea about the time frame that these guys or the discussions that Betsy's having with DoJ might be resolved or any sense?
A - Betsy Moler: Paul, I think we have gone as far as we can go.
A - John Rowe: I can't tell you anymore except that I did tell you I hope that we would have everything done in the third quarter and I can't do better than that. Obviously I'm shooting for earlier than that, but I can't tell you anything more specifically. A negotiation is not like a gestation period. It doesn't have a defined due date.
Q - Paul Patterson: I appreciate it. Thank you.
A - Betsy Moler: Thank you, Paul.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Fleischman with Merrill Lynch.
Q - Steve Fleischman: Hi, can you hear me?
A - John Rowe: Hi Steve.
Q - Steve Fleischman: Hi, with respect to the issue of the comment does the merger make economic sense, is that something that you basically decide on June 20 at the time that the merger agreement expires?
A - John Rowe: Well, we are getting kind of fancy here and I guess I do need Randy to tell you what conditions in the merger agreement are, but we made and PSEG made the basic decision that this was a good deal when we made the deal. And neither of us are entirely free to remake that deal. Now, the existing term expires on June 20, but there is provision for its extension. There are also certain outs related to things like regulatory conditions that might cause a material adverse change and our board will look at them, their board will look at them in good faith when we finally have deals upon which we have permission to close. But I don't want to try to make this -- I am not sending signals here. We believe in what we are doing, but we will also do what it is our duty to do to look at our rights in the agreement and so will PSEG. There is no difference between us on this. Not one whit. So Randy, would you just like to remind people what that all says?
A - Randy Mehrberg: Sure, John. There is a burdensome order provision in the merger agreement, which essentially would be an out or either side if a burdensome order is entered in connection with the merger and in summary, a burdensome order is defined as one of four things. One, something that created a material adverse effect, two, that we would be required to divest nuclear assets, three, that we would be required to divest more than 2,600 megawatts in the virtual auction and four, relating to the extent of the divestiture on the powerful side.
Q - Steve Fleischman: But just to clarify, after June 20, that goes if not that burdensome effect is no longer in place?
A - Randy Mehrberg: If the agreement is not extended, that would no longer be in place. That's correct.
Q - Steve Fleischman: Okay. So it really comes down to the regulatory outcomes that we see in these remaining issues?
A - Randy Mehrberg: Yes.
Q - Steve Fleischman: Okay, thank you.
A – John Rowe: I think we have time for one more question, operator.
Operator: Our next question comes from Daniele Seitz with Dahlman Rose.
Q - Daniele Seitz: Thank you. Just a question that relates to the one just before. Do you need the okay of the DoJ before or at least does the New Jersey Commission makes it condition to their agreeing to anything?
A - John Rowe: I believe the most favorable outcomes would require a settlement with justice before a final settlement with the New Jersey BPU. I can think, Randy can think as fell over as Peggy can think of scenarios in which it might go the other way. But, my best judgment is that New Jersey wants to know that justice has been satisfied before it makes its final deal.
Q - Daniele Seitz: Great. And the other question is, I was wondering can you separate what is especially the O&M, that related only to the first quarter and what is recurring through the year? Is there a way of separating those items? Or there is no way you can do that? I mean the major one obviously.
A - John Young: Other than what we've already said -- if you would call back into Joyce's office, they will take you through that, okay?
Q - Daniele Seitz: All right.
Joyce Carson, Vice President, Investor Relations: Thank you operator. That concludes our call.
A - John Rowe: Thank you everybody.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's Exelon Corporation’s conference call. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Cyndia, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Exelon Corporation Fourth Quarter 2005 Earnings Release Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. If you would like to ask a question during this time, please press “*” and the No. “1” on your telephone keypad.

Sir, the floor is yours.
Michael Metzner, Vice President and Treasurer: Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Exelon's fourth quarter earnings review and update conference call. Thank you for joining us. You should have received a copy of our earnings release. If you haven’t received it, the release is available on the Exelon website at www.exeloncorp.com; or you can call Esmee (phonetic) Gonzalez at 312-394-5740 and she will fax or email the release to you. This call is being recorded and will be available through February 10th by dialing 877-519-4471. The international call-in number is 973-341-3080. The confirmation code is 6888714. In addition, the call will be archived on the Exelon website. Before we begin today's discussion, let me remind you that the earnings release and other matters we may discuss in today's call may contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for discussions of factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts, and expectations. In our press release and during this call we will discuss adjusted non-GAAP operating results that excludes unrealized mark-to-market adjustments from hedging activities and expected earnings contributions from our synthetic fuel facilities, significant impairment of intangible assets, certain severance cost, certain merger-related costs, potential new accounting announcements and other items we view as unusual. We believe these adjusted operating results are representative of the underlying operational results of the company. In today's earnings release which is available on our website, we provide a reconciliation between reported GAAP results and adjusted non-GAAP operating results. With me today are John Rowe, Chairman, President and CEO; John Young, Executive Vice President, Finance and Markets, and CFO; and other members of Exelon's senior management team who are available to answer your questions. Today's call will focus on fourth quarter and full year 2005 results, and the outlook for 2006. We have scheduled an hour and 15 minutes for this call. John Young will begin with a discussion of our financial results.
John Young, Executive Vice President Finance and Markets: Good morning. Exelon Corporation announced fourth quarter adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings of $488 million or $0.72 per diluted share, an increase of 16% on an EPS basis from the fourth quarter of 2004 operating earnings of $416 million or $0.62 per diluted share. Our full year 2005 operating earnings were $3.09 per diluted share, up 11% over 2004 operating earnings of $2.78 per diluted share. Our return to our full year results in 2006 outlook after our review of our fourth quarter results. On a GAAP basis, Exelon reported a net loss of $844 million or $1.26 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2005 driven by an impairment charge related to ComEd’s goodwill. This reported GAAP number includes several after-tax items, $1.81 per share of charges due to the goodwill impairments, which I will discuss more in a moment. $0.13 per share of unrealized mark-to-market losses related to hedging activities; $0.06 per share loss for the cumulative effect of adopting the new accounting standard, FIN 47 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations. $0.02 per share of earnings from our investments in synthetic fuel producing facilities, and $0.01 per share of certain integration cost related to the proposed merger with PSEG. These five items are excluded from our operating earnings of $0.72 per share. Now let me go into more detail about the goodwill impairment. Exelon and ComEd had approximately $4.7 billion of goodwill in the quarter at December 31st 2004, which was originally recognized and recorded in connection with the PECO Unicom merger. Exelon and ComEd are required to perform an assessment for impairment of the goodwill asset at least annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the goodwill might be impaired. Exelon and ComEd test goodwill annually as of November 1, and during that quarter, determine that goodwill was impaired by $1 billion. This is an after-tax non-cash charge. The possibility of a significant impairment in the fourth quarter was disclosed in our prior SEC filings. While assessment for impairment of goodwill is dependent on many interrelated and uncertain variables, the key driver of ComEd’s goodwill impairment charge in the fourth quarter was the impending end of the transition period end it all on more, now less than one year away. With the cessation of all transition revenues after 2006, the present value of ComEd's future cash flows no longer support carrying value of its goodwill. Additionally, the changes in both the regulatory and clinical environment in Illinois during 2005, and the fair value of ComEd's purchase power agreement increased the magnitude of the impairment charge. You will notice in the press release that we have changed our current and historical segment of the presentation from Exelon Energy Delivery to a separate reporting for ComEd and PECO. We did this for a number of reasons including, to provide investors with greater insight into our business, to reflect changes and how we evaluate the business, the recent changes in the regulatory environment in Illinois, and our new governance model at ComEd. These changes also effect how we test for goodwill impairment. As a result, we no longer include PECO's cash flows when testing Exelon’s goodwill for impairment as we have disclosed in the past, because we now only consider ComEd’s cash flows a goodwill impairment at ComEd flows dollar-for-dollar to Exelon. Turning now to Exelon’s fourth quarter results, the major drivers of our 16% year-over-year growth in operating earnings per share were, higher realized margins or higher realized wholesale prices at Generation, higher sales volume at ComEd and PECO primarily due to favorable weather for the last year’s fourth quarter, increased pension expense reflecting our discretionary funding, contribution of $2 billion early in 2005. Partially offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation and amortization expense including the PECO-CEC amortization. As discussed and quantified in our press release this morning, Generation's year-over-year fourth quarter earnings increased due to the re-pricing of our hedges at higher prices in prior periods combined with higher stock market prices and increased nuclear generation. Another item that drove margins at Generation in the fourth quarters of 2005 was the scheduled increase in Generation's energy transfer price to ComEd. This had no impact on Exelon’s consolidated results. I will turn now for our Energy Delivery business, at both ComEd and PECO. ComEd's gross margin or revenue net of purchased power and fuel increased in the fourth quarter compared with the fourth quarter of 2004, primarily due to the more favorable weather in core growth and delivery volumes. In December alone, heating degree-days at ComEd were 11% above normal, and represented the coldest December in 5 years. Total unadjusted kilowatt-hour deliveries increased 4% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year. Heating degree-days in the fourth quarter were 11% above the prior year, and close to our estimated normal level. According to our models, weather had about $0.02 per share positive impact on earnings at ComEd in the fourth quarter compared with the prior year, and about $0.01 per share positive impact relative to normal weather. As I mentioned previously, the transfer price change with Generation had a negative impact on ComEd in the fourth quarter. At PECO, the gross margin or revenue net of purchased power and fuel increased in the fourth quarter compared with the fourth quarter of 2004, primarily due to favorable weather. Total unadjusted kilowatt-hour deliveries increased 3% in the fourth quarter compared with the prior year mainly due to cold weather. Heating degree-days in the fourth quarter were 3% above the prior year, and 2% below our estimated normal level at PECO. According to our models, weather had about $0.01 per share positive impact on the earnings of PECO in the fourth quarter when compared with the prior year, and neutral impact relative to normal weather. Let’s turn to a brief summary of our full-year results. As I mentioned earlier, full year 2005 operating earnings were $3.09 per share, up 11% over 2004 operating earnings of $2.78 per share. Major drivers of the year-over-year earnings growth included higher realized wholesale margins on market sales of Generation, increased nuclear generation, increased retail deliveries at ComEd and PECO mostly due to favorable weather along with 1% to 1.5% core growth and lower pension expense. These positives were partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization, and increased cost of generation to serve higher load at ComEd and PECO at fixed below market prices. We estimate that favorable weather in 2005 had about $0.12 per share positive impact on earnings at ComEd and PECO relative to normal weather. In our earnings release, we have provided much more detail regarding our fourth quarter and full year results, and we would be happy to respond your questions later in the call. We are very pleased with our 2005 results, and believe this it sets the table for continued strong performance in 2006. As far as our 2006 outlook, we have completed our standalone budget and long-range plan. We are reaffirming our initial standalone 2006 operating earnings guidance of $3 to $3.30 per share. I remind you, that our full operating earnings guidance excludes unrealized mark-to-market adjustments from hedging activities, the expected earnings contributions from our synthetic fuel facilities, significant impairments of intangible assets, certain severance cost, certain merger related cost and potential new accounting announcements. We have included an updated operating EPS waterfall chart for 2006 along with our earnings release in today's Form 8-K filing and on our Investor Relations website. The chart has been updated from what was provided to you in August, but the fundamental story remains the same from our earnings expectation. The some other parts indicated on the waterfall adds up to the mid range of our guidance, reflecting ongoing strength in our core operations and our low cost generation position. This middle of the range represents about 6% growth over last year's weather normalized earnings. We believe that Exelon is well position for 2006 to deliver on this guidance. Looking at the merged company, Exelon Electric and Gas, we are in the process of updating our projections, but only to the extent we are legally permitted to do so as the Department of Justice is still reviewing our application. However, soon after the merger closes, we plan to host a meeting in New York City to provide our new forecast, followed by roadshows in several major cities. We would also like you to mark the calendars for our first annual Exelon Electric and Gas Investor Conference, which we plan to hold here in Chicago on December 12th, so please save the date for this important event. Lastly, I want to touch on our dividend. Yesterday, our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.40, incorporation for the closing of the merger, a pro rata dividend was declared and will accrue as specified up until the closing of the merger. On January 17, Public Service Enterprise Group announced an increase in its quarterly dividend to $0.57 from $0.56. As required under the merger agreement, the Exelon dividend will be increased after the merger closes. Based on PSEG’s new annual rate of $2.28 per share and considering the exchange ratio, we estimate that Exelon would pay a dividend of slightly more than $1.86 per share or about 16% increase. The PSEG shareholders is neutral, since they will be getting a dividend on 1.225 Exelon shares for every PSEG share. This increased dividend level is still comfortably within Exelon targeted payout range of 50% to 60%. Now I will turn the call over to John Rowe.
John Rowe, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, John. Good morning everybody. As the press release states, we are all pleased with our strong 2005 operating performance. Our operating earnings per share increased as John said by 16% for the fourth quarter, and by more than 11% for the full year. I just want to quickly review some of the performance highlights. First in the nuclear area. Chris Crane and his nuclear fleet achieved a capacity factor of 93.5% for the full year with a production cost of $13.03 for megawatt hour, which is top core trial in the nation. This is another year of Exelon performance, and for those of you who may have questioned a year and half ago whether we had the team to selling behind all of our Chris and his groups have shown that they can do it very well indeed. Refueling outage duration every 24 days, an improvement of one day over 2004. Our fossil generation station Unit 1 broke the world record for longest continuous run among all light water reactors last week, breaking the previous record set in September 2005 by Peach Bottom 3, another nuclear operating unit. Our TMI unit broke its one world record for continuous operation of a pressurized water reactor. Chris and his team of nuclear operators have made noteworthy improvements under the Nuclear Operating Services Agreement at Salem and Hope Creek. The combined site achieved net generation of more than 26 million megawatt hours, the highest it has ever achieved. In our fossil area, Mark Schiavoni and his team have done a great job this year. They run our high growing fossil plants and they achieved a commercial availability, remember these units don’t run all the time of 95.7% across the fleet for the year. Their value increased substantially under more favorable market conditions. Our power marketing group, Power Team led by Ian McLean effectively managed our portfolio of assets to capitalize on market prices while delivering on its commitment to our various wholesale customers. Ian and his team continued to demonstrate operational and commercial excellence in terms of managing our huge portfolio. In Energy Delivery led by Jacks Skolds, Denis O’Brien, Frank Clark, our delivery service customers experienced fewer outages than prior year despite distress placed on the delivery system by high summer heat and correspondingly high loads. For our delivery business as a whole both the frequency and the ratio outages decreased from the prior year. In ComEd’s territory cooling degree-days were 90% higher than 2004, 40% above normal. We had ComEd's as customers experience 35% fewer outages and on average the outages they did experience were 13% partially in durations. In the PECO territory cooling degree-days were 21% higher than 2004 and 25% above normal. Outages experienced by PECO customers were on average 7% shorter in duration, unfortunately they occurred at a slightly higher frequency. We are continuing to make improvements in this area. While we are very proud of our 2005 progress, we continue to face in a place full of challenges. We must continue to work with all Illinois stakeholders to ensure reliable and affordable service in Illinois. We must provide New Jersey Regulators with the assurances they need to approve the merger with PSEG. We must continue to make both government and our customers happy in Pennsylvania, and all in all we must keep working to improve the performance of the system to live up to our commitment to keep the lifetime. Now, I want to turn to the real news that which you are most interested in, which is the recent ruling in Illinois. As you may recall ComEd made two filings in 2005 with be Illinois Commerce Commission. In February, ComEd filed its procurement proposal with the ICC. A reversed auction competitive bidding process by which ComEd could procure energy for its customers beginning in January 2007 with cost recovery from those customers. In August, ComEd filed a distribution rate case to recover among other things the $3 billon ComEd has invested in infrastructure improvements. Yesterday, the ICC ruled on the procurement filing. After six months of workshop on procurement in 2004, involving all stakeholders, and after an 11-month review of the New Jersey style auctions proposed by both ComEd and Ameron declining clock auction proposal, the ICC issued a 5 to 0 vote yesterday approving statewide auctions to buy power for Illinois customers. This is a key milestone in Illinois transformation of the electricity industry. The ICC reached its malicious order last night; it contains a number of conditions. Given the timing, we know most of the broad terms of the decision, but none have not yet been able to review all of the details. On the whole we are very gratified by yesterday's ICC decision. We believe and they have made clear that they believe both in the decision and in the comments they made in public at making the decision, that competitive procurement and a declining clock auction are the best way to assure that reliable and competitively price power are available to all Illinois consumer. The auction chosen maximizes competition between qualified and competing suppliers using successive rounds of bidding designed to drive the price of electricity now. An independent ICC approved auction manger will administer the auction with oversight by the ICC staff. The provisions prevent any one supplier from winning more than 35% of the ComEd load in the auction, and the contract offered our stay with three-year contracts. We also understand that the order will include a process to promote renewable energy and energy efficiency. We support those principles and expect to work actively with the commission's staff and with other parties to develop these proposals. An additional commission calls for apposed auction and prudency review process, which we believe could have a detrimental effect on supplier's conference in the auction and lead to higher prices. Of course, we do not agree with everything in the commission orders, but it does deliver a workable framework for us, for Ameron, for all competitive wholesale suppliers and ultimately for our consumers to have reliable energy at a price that is disciplined by competition. In today's environment of rising energy prices, even with the competitive auction as the commission pointed out, electricity rates will increase in 2007. ComEd remains committed to working with Illinois stakeholders to develop a plan that will ease the impacts of transitioning the market prices for its residential customers. The ICC staff, ICC administrative law judges in both the ComEd and Ameron proceedings, and a large number of interested parties supported the competitive procurement proposals. However, the authorization of others created a great deal of uncertainties for ComEd. The concerns that we raised at last call about ComEd uncertain financial future are reduced by the ICC's decision on January 24. In our view, these continuing regulatory challenges ComEd now faces are similar than those to those of any other utility, and in that sense things should be getting back to normal for ComEd. In other words, all utilities are dependent upon therein principal regulation to provide decent service and fair returns. ComEd is no different, and we see the decision yesterday is an affirmation that the Illinois Commission remains a principal party. Turning to the ComEd distribution rate case, we expect a final ICC decision this summer. Since 2001, ComEd has spent $3 billion to maintain upgrade and expand its delivery system. These investments have enabled ComEd to meet the needs of a growing customer base, while providing higher levels of reliability as I discussed earlier. Like all other utilities and most other enterprises ComEd's cost for wages, healthcare insurance, security and other aspects of its business have risen. ComEd's investment and increased cost are not reflected in its current rates however due to the rate fee, which has existed since the end of 1997. We need to recover these costs to continue to provide good service to our customers. On December 23rd, a number of parties included in the ICC staff filed challenges to our proposed capital structure, return on equity, revenue requirement and overall rate of return. ComEd has entailed the end of the month to respond to these challenges. After a hearing scheduled in March, two ALJs will make an initial decision as to what adjust and reasonable rates should be, we expect a final ICC decision in late July. Turning briefly to the merger with PSEG we have made substantial progress. As you know in June we received court approval. In September, we announced that PECO reached the settlement in Pennsylvania subject to Final Commission approval with many of the major parties in the proceeding. The ALJ in Pennsylvania recommended approval of the merger in December, we expect the PUC to vote on the case this Friday. In New Jersey, the merger review hearings began earlier this month and have been extended and are now expected to end at the end of February. Settlement discussions are expected to resume after the hearings conclude. While a settlement could result in the case sooner, the scheduled date for an initial ALJ decision and the final order from the BPU are expected to be extended, no firm dates have been set yet. Our other remaining regulatory approvals include the U.S. Department of Justice. We expect that we will be able to complete all of the regulatory reviews and hope to close the merger late in the second quarter of this year. By the middle of February we will have completed, Randy Mehrberg, has led this effort, substantially all of our merger integration planning work. And we will be ready to close the deal as selected regulatory approvals. We are eager to finish the regulatory process with both ALJ in New Jersey, we remain excited by the opportunities this merger hold. We've had a substantial support from all of you, our investors, and we believe this combination gives us a real chance to create the industry leader in generation, electric and gas delivery, customer service and of course shareholder value. Finally, I want to underscore the importance of keeping the right time and continuously improving our operations, even as we confront issues in Illinois and New Jersey. When we announced the merger last year, I assured you that we had the depth and talent to do both. Our 2005 results confirm that say. Even as we have doubt with an exhausted regulatory process for the merger and the very taxing regulatory and political challenges of Illinois, we have maintained our edge in nuclear and power performance, improved our fast generation performance and improved the performance of our delivery companies. Our safety record particularly at PECO was setting the industry standard. We are very, very proud of what we have accomplished in 2005, and so far in the month of January and we are now prepared to take your questions.

Operator Instructions:
Q - Kit Konolige: Good morning. Congratulations on the ongoing process and another big step for mankind. John, I wanted to follow up with you a little bit on the question of, as you repeated in the earnings release, the companies kind of standing offer to have a cap in deferral system that would be associated with the auction. As I read it, and I've read, I am sure less than you, the ICC didn’t specifically address what would happen to deferrals, or if there would be deferrals, and probably I guess legally can't even approach that. Can you discuss with us your current view of how that will have to turn out, you know, I will just end by mentioning that my recollection is that your stance has been and I assume continues to be that the company would insist on some kind of securitization or other secure procedure for recovering deferrals that, and would view an auction pricing as effectively old Exelon Generation, even if it wasn’t fully pass through to customers in the current year?
A - John Rowe: Well, let's take those in pieces, because there are a lot of parts to that question. The short answer is yes for people who like short answers. The first step is that, you know, why didn’t the commission get more into this issue? We see the procurement case is simply affirming the proposition that ComEd does not have power, that it has to get power and the right place to get it is the competitive market and an auction is the most cheap way for customers to have ComEd get back power. That becomes a cost of ComEd to recover like other cost. And the next principle I want to establish is the ICC decision of firms by its result what the ALJ said explicitly, and that is that Exelon Generation is a market competitor like other market competitors, and Exelon Generation will expect ComEd to pay just like Midwest Generation will expect it to pay, and so well other suppliers in Illinois. Exelon Generation will expect to be paid currently in haul. Now ComEd promised, during all of these proceedings over the last 6 months, that it would adopt to cap and deferral system to feather the impact of the rate increases that are caused not by the auction but by the rising price power across the nation and in the region for our residential customers. And just the fact because ComEd won big yesterday doesn’t mean ComEd will be wavered from that firm. ComEd is willing to sit down and negotiate fair ways of doing that with any interested party at anytime. But ComEd will continue to maintain the principle that its entitled to earn on any deferrals, and as if when you look at ComEd’s balance sheet you can see that this it is going to differ a substantial amount of money, it needs to be able to earn on those deferrals. So ComEd’s position remains very clear, it will keep its promises to its customers, and the overall Exelon position remains that we want to work this out in a way that makes the largest number of stakeholders happy, but Exelon Generation is an independent competitor just like all other generating companies, and has the same rights that its competitors does.
Q - Kit Konolige: Hi, can I just, continuation of the same question, not a new question.
A - John Rowe: Here, the colleagues will allow you one more question.
Q - Kit Konolige: Alright.
A - John Rowe: Your, not because of your -
Q - Kit Konolige: Yeah, I think in discussions that I think many of us have had with you and with other folks in the firm, I think there is a general expectation that a deferral mechanism would from Exelon's viewpoint would have to be backed up by a securitization procedure that would probably, certain require the legislature to approve it. In other words that, I think I’ve heard you say in the past that simply having the ICC affirm that there are deferrals and they will be recovered sometime in the future would not be satisfactory to management?
A - John Rowe: I think that depends on the length of the deferral and the recovery period. Some sort of securitization procedure would be the cheapest for customers, but as you said it does probably require legislature. I think it’s our position that we can do a short-term deferral mechanism like 3 years or something like that without legislation, and in that kind of a context we would probably accept a clear ICC decision. We do not believe that legislation is essential to make all of this work, we believe that commission has full authority to do what it has done, and we think its in both customers and shareholders interest that we continue to present proposals that can be done within the existing law.
Q - Kit Konolige: Alright, good, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.
A - John Rowe: Good morning Paul.
Q - Paul Patterson: Hi how are you. Can you hear me?
A - John Rowe: I’m very good, this morning of course.
Q - Paul Patterson: Just I want to touch on the merger process, and the DOJ, it seems like that you are taking a little longer than we expected, and they usually filed, could you just elaborate a little bit what’s going on there, and also the market power issues which FERC seem to refine with, but I guess some people in New Jersey are, if you could just elaborate a little bit on what’s going on there and with the DOJ?
A - John Rowe: I will give you the shorthand, and then ask - to chip in.
A - John Rowe: In essence DOJ has taken a great deal of time to look at this, and to engage consultants to look at it with them because they consider this both one of the largest utility mergers they’ve seen, and also one in which there is more proximity between emerging companies and more dependants on the regional transmission authority. Beyond that we simply do not know what they maybe likely to ask, at the same time in New Jersey the hearings are now focused on testimony from the PJM market monitor Dr. Boulering, about whether the general packages of divestitures that we’ve proposed with the virtual divestiture on the nuclear output are adequate and what alternatives may also be adequate. I think this is, in my judgment less an issue about whether, but simply whether what we put in is enough to assure people with PJM will be a fully efficient market in all of the effective regions. Let’s see what you want to add to that.
A - Randy Mehrberg: So we have asked Dr. Boulering to do additional analysis of our proposed divestiture alternative with respect to the fossil plans, we are expecting Tim to have that additional analysis available to parties and the proceedings hopefully today, and then we will have additional hearings and briefs and so forth during the month of February with respect to that analysis, so we can successfully conclude a satisfactory package that the ALJ will see fit to endorse in its decision. We are optimistic that we will be able to convince the parties in New Jersey that we are not in a position to exert any sort of market power, and we think that Dr. Boulering is an excellent person to confirm that judgment.
Q - Paul Patterson: Okay. When is PUJ, when we're going to get a sense as to when PUJ will actually make their finding?
A - John Rowe: I don’t have a date for that right now.
Q - Paul Patterson: Okay, but they are also looking at the same source often, and you’re pretty confident about what’s going on there as well?
A - John Rowe: Yes.
Q - Paul Patterson: Okay, thanks a lot guys.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Greg Gordon of CitiGroup. Please go ahead your line is live.
Q - Greg Gordon: Thank you.
A - John Rowe: Good morning.
Q - Greg Gordon: At this point, can you give us any window into the timeline for when you might sit down with interested parties, start to negotiate the next step of the process, which are these, the structure of this potential deferral?
A - John Rowe: Structure of what potential?
Q - Greg Gordon: The potential deferral associated with the outcome of the auction, and is there are at this point?
A - John Rowe: We’d have had negotiations at various times over the last 3, 4 months. We assume in the wake of the ICC decision, other people will get more interested in negotiating with us on the basis of the law and the economics in the ICC decision. If they are, we’ll go meet anyone anywhere anytime, if they continue to take the provision that the law doesn’t mean what it said, negotiation won’t go very far.
Q - Greg Gordon: But is the venue a specific ICC docket or would this be negotiated outside of that?
A - John Rowe: I think ICC docket is the delivery rate case, because I think that’s were most likely the implementation of all of this would be established. My brings from Missouri and Bradford are nodding so I must have stumbled into that, right.
Q - Greg Gordon: Great. And are any further actions that remained to be taken by ComEd to increase the visibility of it’s independence use of its main fencing from the parent or have all of their actions you’ve taken to-date sort of, are those the sum total of the activities that you plan on execution?
A - John Rowe: Fairy, do you want to take that the other, the very initial comment.
A - Michael Metzner: The one specific key element is the separate credit facility that we are in the process of finalizing arrangements on and that should be completed in the next couple of weeks.
Q - Greg Gordon: Thank you very much guys.
Q - Greg Gordon: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Ashar Khan of SAC Capital. Please go ahead your line is live.
Q - Ashar Khan: Good morning and congratulations.
A - John Rowe: Thank you very much.
Q - Ashar Khan: Can I just going on to the earnings, I am just trying to do a proforma, if I go to the release and John I don’t know if you can help me on this, on Page 19?
A - John Rowe: I will pass on to Mr. Young, when you get pass the first five pages that require the CFO.
Q - Ashar Khan: Alright, Page 19 ComEd, do you get what hour sales for like you know 83 terawatt hours. And if I am right for the year, and then the average price was about 3750, and am I correct if you were kind of like selling in the open market right now you would be getting something in the 50 right now going into '06. So if one was to do a proforma as if an auction or we were selling the ComEd loads to market, we can just take the difference between the, an implied 50 price, somewhere in the 50s and 3750 and multiply it by the 83 terawatt hours. Would that be a correct calculation?
A - John Young: From whose perspective?
Q - Ashar Khan: From the Generation company's perspective in terms of its improvement and profitability once you get into market?
A - John Young: You know I think you need to look, the calculation is fair up until the point the volume of ComEd isn’t all going to be served by the Generation company.
Q - Ashar Khan: Okay, but right now that’s, that is the ComEd volume, isn’t it? Or what they are being served, right? Whether it's served by Generation or it's served to other customers, but that is a volume right now of ComEd’s own volume that’s dedicated to ComEd right now in 2005, is that correct?
A - John Young: That’s right.
Q - Ashar Khan: So, I can take that volume which supplied at 3750 right for the year average, correct?
A - John Young: Right.
Q - Ashar Khan: And current price is, you are saying is around in the 50s, correct, in the market. Is that a fair number?
A - John Young: That’s close.
Q - Ashar Khan: Okay.
A - John Rowe: Oh wait a minute, this is John Rowe, just between John and my, you first got to pick up the point John Young made about how much of that load, Exelon Generation can supply, it's limited to 35%. So, the rest of what ex-Gen sales would be into the wholesale market. And you can decide for yourself whether that makes a difference. You also will have to take into account to some extent, the difference between the price for base load power and the price for the full load following product, and I just want to make certain that John and Mike are picking that up in their answer to you.
Q - Ashar Khan: What would be the price for the full load product right now, can I just get a…
A - John Young: Sure, there is probably a dozen self side analysts on the phone can walk you through that, but most of them have also done it correct, and we’d be happy to walk with you too. In general, you are right, the page you’re looking at 19, that’s what Generation currently sells to ComEd, you have to make a judgment as to what a price would clear out of an auction, whether that’s somewhere in the mid to up or 50s, you kind of have to make that decision based on your forecasted prices. You would apply that difference to the amount that generation currently sells to ComEd, that’s the potential pickup from the Generation side of the equation.
Q - Ashar Khan: Okay. And John, if I can just end up, right now is it fair, second quarter merger close is still pretty key possibility, correct as thing stand?
A - John Rowe: We agree with that.
Q - Ashar Khan: Okay, thank you very very much.
A - John Rowe: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. As a reminder, we do ask the analysts to limit themselves to one question. Our next question is coming from Josh Elvin of Board Abbitt (phonetic). Please go ahead you line is live.
Q - Josh Elvin: Good morning.
A - John Rowe: Good morning.
Q - Josh Elvin: Good morning, you know over the past several months you have taken steps to arrangement ComEd, assuming you reach a cap and defer settlement in Illinois along the lines you have proposed, will you then take steps to undue the ring fencing of ComEd?
A - John Rowe: May be a little of it, not all of it, as you look at the way PSEG & PSENG are organized, they also have some of those ring fence characterizations in place, I think we would continue to keep active boards in the retail subsidiaries. I think we would continue to try to have financial structures that can’t stand on their own because all of these affiliate relationships get revisited from time to time, we want to make certain that we have retail companies that can’t clearly comply with the requirements of the various state.
Q - Josh Elvin: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Steve Fleishman of Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead, your line is live.
A - John Rowe: Good morning, Steve.
Q - Steve Fleishman: Hi John, two questions. First, I saw a recent story that Oyster Creek maybe on the block, and I guess, I wanted to confirm if that’s the case, and whether if that were the case that would be the kind of thing that could resolve the PSE&G & New Jersey issues pretty much on its own?
A - John Rowe: I can’t confirm or deny any comments about a specific plan Steve. And just let me say that, we believe there are lots of different ways to address the concerns that are being raised in New Jersey, we intend to be very flexible about doing it. Just remember, operating nuclear plants is big part of our business. But, we just can’t address any specific plant until we have a regulatory situation worked out, and until we can deal squarely with employees at whatever every plant that may be effected, right now it is the lot bigger concern on the fossil plants where we sent 4000 megawatts will go when it is on a nuclear plant.
Q - Steve Fleishman: Okay.
A - John Rowe: I know that’s not an answer, but its all I knew.
Q - Steve Fleishman: Okay, and then totally separate, on the goodwill write-off, for you standalone or I guess even thinking as a merged company, obviously that impacts your book, ratios, debt-to-capital, equity capital, but has no impact on your cash flow. So I guess if we're thinking going forward in terms of how you are thinking about your balance sheet and use of cash and the like, does this change very much in your minds or not?
A - John Rowe: We don’t think so. The way the Illinois statue works, that goodwill is part of our equity for doing the earnings cap calculation through 2006, but we we're not allowed to establish rates, thereafter based on earning on the goodwill, and therefore I don’t see this having any new cash flow impact at all. John Young or Bob McDonald, ComEd's CFO might want to add to that comment, but, I think the real answer to your question is a deal was made way back in '97, that deal said that Generation would go to market, the ICC affirmed that yesterday, but the corollary of that is that ComEd has no way to earn on that goodwill. So I think these are just two sides of the same deal and it would be a fair deal.
Q - Steve Fleishman: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Paul Ridzon of Key McDonald. Please go ahead, your line is live.
A - John Rowe: Hi, Paul.
Q - Paul Ridzon: Do you think you could possibly settle the distribution case or do you anticipate that thing fully litigated, and then just as a follow-up, wondering separating whether from demand destruction, did you see any evidence of demand destruction?
A - Ian McLean: I’ll do my best and then I am going to ask John or Jack to chip in. But on the first case, I think a settlement is at least possible and perhaps even probable with some parties, because Illinois law is very clear that partial settlements still have to be fully reviewed by the Commission, and I can’t imagine that we would have a settlement with every objecting party, I think, you know the Commission will still have to make a full ruling in Illinois, but as I indicated earlier, we promised we proposed a phase in proceeding, we will propose it. If somebody will come talk to us, we would be delighted to group that in a settlement, because we think it would make life better for our customers, and can basically take care of our shareholders very well at the same time. But that requires, somebody else to dance and the teenage boy is tired of asking one of the girls who was going to have to signal little willingness now too. And as to the demand destruction, my colleagues are all growling at me. I remember how awkward teenage boys are and I have really God know which.
Q - Paul Ridzon: So we will go on a demand infrastructure.
A - John Rowe: No, that we haven’t seen demand destruction, the growth in the PECO part of the business is right at about 1%, whether normalized and the growth in the ComEd business is a little better than that 1.5%.
Q - Paul Ridzon: And just a real quick question, have you put any oil hedges on to protect synthetic fuel cash flows or earnings?
A - John Rowe: Yes.
Q - Paul Ridzon: Can you give us some sense of?
A - Matthew F. Hilzinger: Yeah, the synthetic fuel, we created about $0.10 of earnings in '04, $0.10 of earnings in '05, we believe that there will be some potential phase out there, decline there maybe $0.05 to $0.06 this year. We have done some things to protect some of the cash flow connected with the synthetic fuels, but that’s kind of where we are.
A - John Rowe: That was Matt Hilzinger, Exelon’s Controller.
Q - Paul Ridzon: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Daniele Seitz of Dahlman Rose. Please go ahead.
Q - Daniele Seitz: Hello, hi. I just was wondering if you are looking for more complete method of implementation through the distribution case, and you intent to leave whatever the ICC decision is, as is and we’ll implement additional message to make it more specific?
A - John Rowe: I am sure the answer to that is yes, but I know the question is more illuminating than the answer. Basically we intend to fully comply with the ICC decision and just in order to protect our record we may seek reconsideration or appeal from some of it, but the real answer is, you know, they give the order we issue in March. And certainly that's true renewables and energy efficiency, which is something we were working on before that things happened last August anyway. And do you have anything you would like to add to answer Daniele’s question.
A - John Young: Hi, Daniele.
Q - Daniele Seitz: Hi.
A – Company Speaker: The only thing I would add, we are still taking a look at the order, 250 pages obviously there is, you know, we want to make sure we fully understand that as John indicated and gives us an and adopt the option, it gives us the direction uncertainty that's what we are looking for. Most of the amendments that were adopted yesterday looks like they are consumer protection addition, the addition of workshops around retail market, the addition of workshop and we are making for ground energy efficiency and demands like management, the addition of Illinois market monitoring unit. And I think we are supportive of all those. We continued to be concerned about the prudence review of today, it’s a structured prudence review but our position on that but then that is unnecessary and for great costs. So, we will be taking a hard look at that. As John indicated that we will file a petition from rehearing to protect the records on appeal.
Q - Daniele Seitz: Okay, thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from David Schanzer of Janney Montgomery. Please go ahead.
Q - David Schanzer: Yes, good morning.
A - John Rowe: Good morning, Dave.
Q - David Schanzer: My question has to do with the nuclear outages. I know that you had about 20% fewer outage days in the quarter compared with the last year, but the associated expenses were normally higher. I was wondering if there are any big items in there, something that could be reoccurring going forward?
A - John Rowe: That’s the post phase 19 plus, and so we’ll ask you to refer that to Chris Crane. Chris?
A - Christopher Crane: The outage expenses for '05 and we’ll see it in '06 not materially huge, but they've increased due to industry-driven inspections on piping, reactor vessels as a result of the Davis Bessy (phonetic) event two years back. So, we anticipate spending a few million dollars more on each one of those sites to cover that. There is slight escalation in some of our labor contracts that’s primarily proactive inspections of passive components in the reactor.
Q - David Schanzer: Great, exactly what I was looking for, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Hugh Wynne of Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead your line is live.
A - John Rowe: Good morning, Hugh.
Q - Hugh Wynne: Good morning. I just wanted to start by echoing Kit's comment that I think the quarter's results were greatly reported in the onward march of human progress, primarily my hope is that I might get the answer, answers to two questions as well. My first question is the $88 million annualized mark-to-market loss, if you remind me why that excluded from GAAP earnings if it derives from a non-trading activity but its being taken as a head to your income statement that it sounds to me like it must result from being effectiveness of a hedge?
A - Michael Metzner: Now, John Young is going to pick up on this, because he can give you a much better than I can Hugh. But, that was a quarter event, if you look at it over the year, I think the number was either plus or minus one penny. So, in terms of the consequence of the year this is not the 11 or 12, that item it looks like here, but John you want to pick up?
A – John Young: We have excluded this starting, I think in the first or second quarter of 2005, and it is included in GAAP earnings that’s excluded from our operating earnings representation. These are unrealized and they are related to hedging our gas, oil and some little power, a little bit of coal, but they reversed as these transactions settle going forward. Looking at year-after-year-after-year and it's not my design but at the end of the year it's plus or minus a penny.
Q - Hugh Wynne: Great, that's fine, thank you. And then I guess the last question was regarding the likely next steps in the Circuit Court case, the suit - the Attorney General and the Citizens Utility Board, is there any indication that those parties are going to appeal this decision to a higher court or this is the end of their suit against you?
A - John Rowe: I think they will now kind of do what the District Court said, and appeal the ICC decision itself. They may - maybe they like every form imaginable, but their route is much more straightforward appealing the ICC decisions then it is appealing the Circuit Court’s denial of their request for previous decision injunction.
Q - Hugh Wynne: Okay. But the effect is then that there are still some residual legal uncertainty although the initial decisions of all kind of ways?
A - John Rowe: Always some legal uncertainty that - when you find me a certain lawyer, I assume you will be in a museum.
Q - Hugh Wynne: Alright, thank you much, I appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Vic Khaitan of the Deutsche Asset Management. Please go ahead.
Q -Vic Khaitan: Yes thank you, and congratulations on yesterday's ICC ruling. Did it surprise you to get five in all, and the real question then is that how would the distribution case the CND case will come up? How would these commissioner vote because there seem to be his staff is recommending fairly low rate pays there?
A - John Rowe: Well, I don’t think there is any particular useful way to comment on whether we were surprised, we obviously hoped for this result. We think that all of the commissioners showed great courage in sticking to a record that has been developed over eleven months and not responding to outside pressures. We particularly think the new Chairman who was being in an awkward position showed infinite courage in that regard. And one should never be surprised when humans live up to their obligation but one should always be deeply grateful. As to the delivery rate case the staff recommended what we think is a kind of Greg Coney in result, one of my people suggested that this might be the staff’s idea of a rate increase litigation proposal. I suspect that someone will negotiate with the staff. I suspect that the amount of the delivery rate increase that we requested that we get will to some extent be affected by our success or lack thereof in finding somebody to negotiate with on the rate pays in. The staff itself has taken a highly principle better positions over the past few years, sometimes like on goodwill where it’s a cause up some pain and suffering, sometimes like on procurement where we’ve been delighted to have them as an ally. I think in initial filings on rate cases staff tries to set it up itself to have maximum negotiating leverage, but one should note that the staff is doing just what one of the commissioners said it does, which is try to make certain that the commission in itself act for consumers. So, we take their position very seriously, and we would hope they would want to be an active party in the settlement negotiation. Ian, you want to add to that.
A - Ian McLean: No not at all, I think you’ve covered the only thing I would also say. I consider to be very early in the case they have filed first round testimony, that’s how we’ve see today, there is several more round of testimony we are hearing schedule for the end of March, ALJ opinion sometime in May and June. So, there is time on that and I think we hope to work with staff and meet their concerns, some of their concerns are related to what they precede to be a lack of foundation, we need to provide them with more evidence I think we can go through some on that, some of them as John indicates our positions that they feel strongly on principle, but we are working with them and we’ll continue to do that and I think it’s certainly indicates.
Q -Vic Khaitan: And John just a quick follow-up to yesterday’s ruling, couple of newspapers said that both the Governor and Attorney General are still going to fight this ruling. So, again I am not giving up I guess?
A - John Rowe: Well, you read the same newspaper as I did. I don’t expect them to give up, but I do hope that they recognize that they recognized that they now lost before the commission; they’ve lost in FERC, they have lost in every objective forum that exists. And that they’ll try to say, okay let's find a way to negotiation, and make certain we protect the interest we care most about but, I would like to think that they will now do this within the framework of the laws that exist. This is yesterday’s result is a huge victory for both their implementation of the statuette, the implementation of the market and for ComEd’s financial position as they tries to do good job for customers, but I’ve been quoting Winston Churchill’s comment about El Alamein in all of my life, “It’s not the end of the beginning of the end, it’s is the end of the beginning”. I think the commission has now made clear what the law and policy is, and we will be actively trying to work things out. But, one should always remember another Churchill comment, which is, “Before the El Alamein the British never won, after it they never lost”. I’m at least hope.
Q -Vic Khaitan: Thank you again, and see you later.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Zack Schreiber of Duquesne Capital. Please go ahead your line is live.
Q - Zack Schreiber: Hi, it’s Zack Schreiber from Duquesne. Can you hear me?
A - John Rowe: Yes Zack, welcome.
Q - Zack Schreiber: Thanks. Just a follow-up on the prudency review, and I recognize you have had a chance to go through the order or I must say Ian sheet going through it pretty closely.
A - John Rowe: Ian has four horses. We care for but other than that she works on that.
Q - Zack Schreiber: She just, just on the prudency review. Am I correct that the prudency review provisions in the final order or an improvement relative to the prudency review provisions in the ALJ Iraq in terms of making it less open-ended with the annual reconciliation and the more exclusive provisions around the presumptions of prudency in terms of who has to bear the burden approved to in terms of the future reconciliation proceedings. This is an improvement over the ALJ, which you had an issue with or is this sort of an inline with the ALJ or is that worse than ALJ?
A - John Rowe: I know that you are correct, but I want Ian to end the answer because he and she are further in the reading more than I am.
Q - Zack Schreiber: Okay.
A – Ian McLean: Thanks, probably further then all of that, hi Zack.
Q - Zack Schreiber: Hi Ian.
A – Ian McLean: You had that right, what the commission amendment is an improvement over the ALJ opinion, what we heard from the bench yesterday was the commission are riding Commissioner Diaz owned the concerns about prudency review, they were not only our concerns but suppliers were very, very vocal on that issue, and so they did strengthen that, they adopted some recommendations by staff who chose the position that you know you really didn’t need the prudency review either, but if you are going to do it you have had to show it up a little, structure it a little bit more and as you indicate, the presumption is stronger going into the prudency proceedings that the burden is on the other side to show that there is something better out there that could have been purchases or could have been done. And also that the issue of prudency will be looked at in the annual forward-looking proceedings that we will be having to determine whether you need it in the future. I mean that was staff’s recommendation in oral arguments, we are going to try it, you know lest at least revisit it because we don’t think you need it and so that was part of what they incorporated as well.
Q - Zack Schreiber: Got it, and just a follow-up. In terms of the DOJ, I mean not them filing utility mergers for ten years, I’ve never seen one take this long, I have never seen the weighing period not expire, I mean clearly you folks seem very confident, we got to the third process without going to hearings and it now seems like a state of New Jersey with a PJM guy and the DOJ are trying to go through instead of recreate what they seem FERC should have done on in terms of the process, who has the legal authority to opine in the wholesale market, where does the jurisdictions start and stop relative to deferred relative to DOJ. Does New Jersey even have under its public interest standard authority to review the wholesale market?
A - John Rowe: I want to Dulcie to answer all of that, I think you know my views on the general answer but let Dulcie start from back to front.
A – Company Speaker: The Hart-Scott-Rodino waiting period has run, DOJ takes the positions as they have general authority under here, and I trust laws should determine quite in access to review this, and we are in conversation with DOJ, and we hope that review will be concluded soon. The New Jersey…
Q - Zack Schreiber: And before going to New Jersey, Dulcie, I’m sorry but the weighting period of DOJ has expired?
A - Dulcie: Correct.
Q - Zack Schreiber: And does that mean that wanted to expire for two weeks they have to sort of put up or set up, isn’t this the way it works?
A - Dulcie: Not really, I would be delighted to talk to you about the process.
Q - Zack Schreiber: Okay.
A - Dulcie: The process. The New Jersey statuette requires the board of public utilities to look at the effect on competition of any merger.
Q - Zack Schreiber: Got it.
A - Dulcie: I mean they contempt that because their retail basic generation service auction is impacted by wholesale market. They have the legal rights to look at wholesale market, we can argue with them as to the law and attempted to do so but I'd really rather workout something that is satisfactory and give them the ultimate comfort that we are not in the position to act in concert with others inappropriately raise market prices, and exert market power. We believe that the Boulering analysis which will come to an acceptable, hope and believe that the Boulering analysis will come to an acceptable result. And that that we will do something that is consistent with the commitment we have already made at FERC and things will go on.
Q - Zack Schreiber: Are we anywhere near the point where the mitigation measures that we are going to be asked to take to meet these two additional regulatory approvals start to undermine some of the economic and strategic rationale of the merger, while we know we are near that point?
A - John Rowe: No, we‘re not there. Please look very carefully the mitigation requirement, this is good time to selling power plants and they’re quite consistent with our deal case.
Q - Zack Schreiber: Good time to own them too?
A - Dulcie: We want to do both.
Q - Zack Schreiber: Thanks so much.
John Rowe, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you. I think we are almost out of time and Mike if it makes sense I’d just like to make a couple wrap-up comments.
Michael Metzner, Vice President and Treasurer: Yeah.
John Rowe, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: First, thank you all for being here. Second, we are obviously very, very pleased by both the operating results for the year, and with the Commissions’ decision yesterday which is a major affirmation with the Illinois law means what it says. I would reiterate what I said earlier the goodwill write-off is a realistic effort to look at ComEd's future cash flows in accordance with the accounting requirement. And it is also to some extent the other side of the ‘97 deal. Exelon generation is an unregulated generation company. ComEd is a much smaller company in terms of its balance sheet, its earnings power than it used to be. We think all of these things go properly together. As we look back at our operating earnings over the 5 years since the merger we are obviously also pleased that we have been able to deliver 10% as we look at the future and as you look at the future we don’t expect to see as much consistency. All of us think ‘07 looks like a much better year than ’06; we don’t expect to see that kind of growth continuing in the subsequent years. There is a much larger commodity element in this company now than there was before. We ‘re doing our best to bring you some of the best of both an unregulated Generation business and honest regulated delivery businesses. We will continue to do that, we will continue to work very hard to make agreements in both Illinois and New Jersey that make public constituencies contented that the best interest of their constituencies are being served by the Exelon companies, and we will spare no effect to do that, and meanwhile we are delighted with the results we have been able to give all of you. Thank you very much.
Michael Metzner, Vice President and Treasurer: Thank you operator, that concludes the call.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's Exelon conference call. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.
